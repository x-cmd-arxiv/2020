Hoelder asymptotics as $x$ approaches $H$, and the limit ODE $d X(t)=a(X(t))\,
d t$ does not have a unique solution.
  We show that if the drift pushes the solution away of $H$, then the limit
process with certain probabilities selects some extreme solutions to the limit
ODE. If the drift attracts the solution to $H$, then the limit process
satisfies an ODE with some averaged coefficients. To prove the last result we
formulate an averaging principle, which is quite general and new.

creation of a quality scale, suggesting that the bottom 10% of quality projects
spend at least 6 times more effort on fixing bugs than the top 10%. Analysis of
project attributes shows that lower CCP (higher quality) is associated with
smaller files, lower coupling, use of languages like JavaScript and C# as
opposed to PHP and C++, fewer developers, lower developer churn, better
onboarding, and better productivity. Among other things these results support
the ""Quality is Free"" claim, and suggest that achieving higher quality need not

Then the effective Hamiltonian is further solved by VQE, which we call deep
VQE. Deep VQE allows us to apply quantum-classical hybrid algorithms on

good accuracy ~ a few %. The proposed scheme enables us to handle the problems
of >1000 qubits by concatenating VQEs with a few tens of qubits. While it is
unclear how accurate ground state energy can be obtained for such a large

provides a good approximation (discrepancy within a few percent) and has a room

that {anti}-cross-validation (choosing among a set of candidate algorithms

cross-validation, unless one makes an assumption -- which has never been
formalized -- about how the distribution over induction problems, on the one

disentanglement of underlying factors of variation in naturalistic videos.
Previous work suggests that representations can be disentangled if all but a
few factors in the environment stay constant at any point in time. As a result,
algorithms proposed for this problem have only been tested on carefully
constructed datasets with this exact property, leaving it unclear whether they
will transfer to natural scenes. Here we provide evidence that objects in
segmented natural movies undergo transitions that are typically small in
magnitude with occasional large jumps, which is characteristic of a temporally
sparse distribution. We leverage this finding and present SlowVAE, a model for
unsupervised representation learning that uses a sparse prior on temporally
adjacent observations to disentangle generative factors without any assumptions
on the number of changing factors. We provide a proof of identifiability and
show that the model reliably learns disentangled representations on several
established benchmark datasets, often surpassing the current state-of-the-art.
We additionally demonstrate transferability towards video datasets with natural
dynamics, Natural Sprites and KITTI Masks, which we contribute as benchmarks
for guiding disentanglement research towards more natural data domains.

circuit elements can exhibit microwave mode spectra with left-handed
dispersion, resulting in a high density of modes in the same frequency range
where superconducting qubits are typically operated, as well as a bandgap at
lower frequencies that extends down to dc. Using this novel regime for
multi-mode circuit quantum electrodynamics, we have performed a series of
measurements of such a superconducting metamaterial resonator coupled to a
flux-tunable transmon qubit. Through microwave measurements of the
metamaterial, we have observed the coupling of the qubit to each of the modes
that it passes through. Using a separate readout resonator, we have probed the
qubit dispersively and characterized the qubit energy relaxation as a function
of frequency, which is strongly affected by the Purcell effect in the presence
of the dense mode spectrum. Additionally, we have investigated the ac Stark
shift of the qubit as the photon number in the various metamaterial modes is
varied. The ability to tailor the dense mode spectrum through the choice of
circuit parameters and manipulate the photonic state of the metamaterial
through interactions with qubits makes this a promising platform for analog
quantum simulation and quantum memories.

a point in parameter space that is not identical to the classical voter model.
A vast range of different quantities are used to determine the universality

The characterization can be given by the classical $\mathcal{O}$-operators
precisely when the solutions satisfy an invariant condition. When the invariant
condition is compatible with a Frobenius algebra, such solutions have close
relationships with Rota-Baxter operators on the Frobenius algebra. In general,
solutions of the nhacYBe can be produced from Rota-Baxter operators, and then
from $\mathcal{O}$-operators when the solutions are taken in semi-direct
product algebras. In the other direction, Rota-Baxter operators can be obtained
from solutions of the nhacYBe in unitizations of algebras. Finally a
classifications of solutions of the nhacYBe satisfying the mentioned invariant

obtained. All these solutions are shown to come from Rota-Baxter operators.

and include additional luminosity data of 'ancient' nova shells. We compare the
long-term behaviour with respect to nova speed class and light curve type. We
find that, in general, the luminosity as a function of time can be described as
consisting of an initial shallow logarithmic decline or constant behaviour,
followed by a logarithmic main decline phase, with a possible return to a
shallow decline or constancy at very late stages. The luminosity evolution in
the first two phases is likely to be dominated by the expansion of the shell
and the corresponding changes in volume and density, while for the older nova
shells, the interaction with the interstellar medium comes into play. The slope
of the main decline is very similar for almost all groups for a given emission
line, but it is significantly steeper for [OIII], compared to H$\alpha$, which
we attribute to the more efficient cooling provided by the forbidden lines. The
recurrent novae are among the notable exceptions, along with the plateau light
curve type novae and the nova V838 Her. We speculate that this is due to the
presence of denser material, possibly in the form of remnants from previous
nova eruptions, or of planetary nebulae, As a by-product of our study, we
revised the identification of all novae included in our investigation with

evolution of the entropy of any system undergoing Markovian dynamics. Here I
show that this form of the second law is strengthened for multi-dimensional,
complex systems, coupled to multiple thermodynamic reservoirs, if we have a set
of \textit{a priori} constraints restricting how the dynamics of each
coordinate can depend on the other coordinates. As an example, this
strengthened second law (SSL) applies to complex systems composed of multiple
physically separated, co-evolving subsystems, each identified as a coordinate
of the overall system. In this example, the constraints concern how the
dynamics of some subsystems are allowed to depend on the states of the other
subsystems. Importantly the SSL applies to such complex systems even if some of
its subsystems can change state simultaneously, which is prohibited in a
multipartite process. The SSL also strengthens previously derived bounds on how
much work can be extracted from a system using feedback control, if the system
is multi-dimensional. Importantly, the SSL does not require local detailed
balance. So it potentially applies to complex systems ranging from interacting
economic agents to co-evolving biological species.

rather shown that the conservation equation of current reduces to a massless

a conservation equation. Considering velocity potential and Clebesch

interactions of surface winds with gauge-shield geometry. The Multi-Angle
Snowflake Camera (MASC), which photographs hydrometeors in free-fall from three
different angles while simultaneously measuring their fall speed, has been used
in the field at multiple mid-latitude and polar locations both with and without
wind shielding. Here we show results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
simulations of the airflow and corresponding particle trajectories around the
unshielded MASC and compare these results to Arctic field observations with and
without a Belfort double Alter shield. Simulations in the absence of a wind
shield show a separation of flow at the upstream side of the instrument, with
an upward velocity component just above the aperture, which decreases the mean
particle fall speed by 55%(74%) for a wind speed of 5 m/s(10 m/s).
MASC-measured fall speeds compare well with Ka-band Atmospheric Radiation
Measurement (ARM) Zenith Radar (KAZR) mean Doppler velocities only when winds
are light (<5 m/s) and the MASC is shielded. MASC-measured fall speeds that do
not match KAZR measured velocities tend to fall below a threshold value that
increases approximately linearly with wind speed but is generally <0.5 m/s. For
those events with wind speeds <1.5 m/s, hydrometeors fall with an orientation
angle mode of 12 degrees from the horizontal plane, and large, low-density
aggregates are as much as five times more likely to be observed. We conclude
that accurate MASC observations of the microphysical, orientation, and fall
speed characteristics of snow particles require shielding by a double wind
fence and restriction of analysis to events where winds are light (<5 m/s).
Hydrometeors do not generally fall in still air, so adjustments to these
properties' distributions within natural turbulence remain to be determined.

incorporate the problem setting of non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM) into
deep learning to learn 3D structure reconstruction. The most important
difficulty of NRSfM is to estimate both the rotation and deformation at the
same time, and previous works handle this by regressing both of them. In this
paper, we resolve this difficulty by proposing a loss function wherein the
suitable rotation is automatically determined. Trained with the cost function
consisting of the reprojection error and the low-rank term of aligned shapes,
the network learns the 3D structures of such objects as human skeletons and
faces during the training, whereas the testing is done in a single-frame basis.
The proposed method can handle inputs with missing entries and experimental
results validate that the proposed framework shows superior reconstruction
performance to the state-of-the-art method on the Human 3.6M, 300-VW, and

inevitable noise, which, to make the task even harder, are often spatially
unevenly distributed. A natural solution is to borrow the idea from
multi-exposure, which captures multiple shots to obtain well-exposed images
under challenging conditions. High-quality implementation/approximation of
multi-exposure from a single image is however nontrivial. Fortunately, as shown
in this paper, neither is such high-quality necessary since our task is face
detection rather than image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a novel
Recurrent Exposure Generation (REG) module and couple it seamlessly with a
Multi-Exposure Detection (MED) module, and thus significantly improve face
detection performance by effectively inhibiting non-uniform illumination and
noise issues. REG produces progressively and efficiently intermediate images
corresponding to various exposure settings, and such pseudo-exposures are then
fused by MED to detect faces across different lighting conditions. The proposed
method, named REGDet, is the first `detection-with-enhancement' framework for
low-light face detection. It not only encourages rich interaction and feature
fusion across different illumination levels, but also enables effective
end-to-end learning of the REG component to be better tailored for face
detection. Moreover, as clearly shown in our experiments, REG can be flexibly
coupled with different face detectors without extra low/normal-light image
pairs for training. We tested REGDet on the DARK FACE low-light face benchmark
with thorough ablation study, where REGDet outperforms previous
state-of-the-arts by a significant margin, with only negligible extra
parameters.

to control the persistence of the random walk. We compute analytically the
survival probability of a walk of $n$ steps, showing that it is independent of
the jump distribution for any finite $n$. This universality is a consequence of
the Sparre-Andersen theorem for random walks with uncorrelated and symmetric

which the random walk reaches its maximum and the record statistics of the
walk, which show the same universality. In particular, we show that the

  coalescence in electrolyte solutions",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inhibition of bubble coalescence in electrolyte solutions enables the
formation of oceanic whitecaps and affects the heat and mass transfer in many
bubble related engineering processes. For different electrolytes, the ability
to inhibit bubble coalescence correlates to the ion specificity at the air
water interface at an abnormal cation-anion pair relationship, rather than the
typically expected cation or anion series that was widely reported in
atmospheric, bio- and chemical processes. Here we show that the inhomogeneous
interfacial flow, at a different electrolyte concentration from the solution
because of the surface specificity of both cation and anion, contributes to the
bubble coalescence inhibition behavior in electrolyte solutions. The
interfacial flow, achieved with the mobile air-water interface, contributes to
the continuous change of electrolyte concentration within the liquid film
formed between two colliding bubbles, thereby resulting in a concentration
gradient of electrolytes between the thin film and the bulk solution. The
electrolyte concentration gradient, hence surface tension gradient, becomes
significant to resist film thinning when the film thickness reaches tens of
nanometers. The retarded film thinning between two bubbles and delayed bubble
coalescence were experimentally captured by high-speed interferometry and
quantitatively explained by the proposed electrolyte transportation model. This
finding clearly highlights the coupled effect of interfacial flow and ion
specificity, and shows important implications for improved understanding of
ocean waves, for future development of colloidal science in high concentration
electrolyte solutions that is critical for biology, and benefits many applied
fields like water splitting and mineral extraction.

data have a power-law index ($\xi(\Delta r) \propto \Delta r^{\gamma}$) of
$\gamma\approx-2$ at most spatial scales, which is in line with theoretical
predictions. After removing bound structures, the data have a power-law index
of $\gamma\approx-1$ for $<100$ pc and $\gamma \lesssim -1.5$ for $>100$ pc. We
interpret these results with the aid of a novel star-by-star simulation of the
Galaxy in which stars are born in clusters orbiting in a realistic potential
that includes spiral arms, a bar, and GMCs. We find that the simulation largely
agrees with the observations (within a factor of 2-3) at all spatial and
kinematic scales. In detail, the correlation function in the simulation is
shallower than the data at $< 20$ pc scales, and steeper than the data at $>
30$ pc scales. We also find a persistent clustering signal in the kinematic
correlation function for the data at large $\Delta v$ ($>5$ km s$^{-1}$) not
present in the simulations. We speculate that this mismatch between
observations and simulations may be due to two processes not included in the
simulation: hierarchical star formation and transient spiral arms. We also use
the simulations to predict the clustering signal as a function of pair-wise
metallicity and age separations. Ages and metallicities measured with a
precision of $50\%$ and $0.05$ dex are required in order to enhance the
clustering signal.

critical for our understanding of structure formation and the galaxy-halo
connection. Most commonly, subhalos are defined to reside inside a spherical
overdensity boundary such as the virial radius. The resulting host-subhalo
relations depend sensitively on the somewhat arbitrary overdensity threshold,
but the impact of this dependence is rarely quantified. The recently proposed
splashback radius tends to be larger and to include more subhalos than even the
largest spherical overdensity boundaries. We systematically investigate the
dependence of the subhalo fraction on the radius definition and show that it
can vary by factors of unity between different spherical overdensity
definitions. Using splashback radii can yet double the abundance of subhalos
compared to the virial definition. We also quantify the abundance of flyby (or
backsplash) halos, hosts that used to be subhalos in the past. We show that the
majority of these objects are mislabeled satellites that are naturally
classified as subhalos when we use the splashback radius. We show that the
subhalo fraction can be understood as a universal function of only peak height
and the slope of the linear power spectrum. We provide a simple fitting
function that captures our simulation results to 20% accuracy across a wide
range of halo masses, redshifts, and cosmologies. Finally, we demonstrate that
splashback radii significantly change our understanding of satellite and flyby

relations between gradient steepness and galaxy properties. We find that TNG50

significant diversity among these negative gradients. We determine that the
gradient steepness of all galaxies increases approximately monotonically with
redshift at a roughly constant rate. This rate does not vary significantly with
galaxy mass. We observe a weak negative correlation between gradient steepness
and galaxy stellar mass at redshifts $z\leq2$. However, when we normalize
gradients by a characteristic radius defined by the galactic star formation
distribution, we find that these normalized gradients remain invariant with
both stellar mass and redshift. We place our results in the context of previous
simulations and show that TNG50 high-redshift gradients are steeper than those
of models featuring burstier feedback, which may further highlight
high-redshift gradients as important discriminators of galaxy formation models.
We also find that redshift $z=0$ and $z=0.5$ TNG50 gradients are consistent
with the gradients observed in galaxies at these redshifts, although the
preference for flat gradients observed in redshift $z\gtrsim1$ galaxies is not
present in TNG50. If future JWST and ELT observations validate these flat
gradients, it may indicate a need for simulation models to implement more
powerful radial gas mixing within the ISM, possibly via turbulence and/or

Each of these quantities vary significantly with stellar mass and stellar age,
but we are able to reduce all of our simulations to a single relationship that
depends only on stellar structure, characterized by a single parameter
$\rho_c/\bar\rho$, and impact parameter $\beta$. We also find that, in general,
more centrally concentrated stars have steeper $dM/dt$ rise slopes and
shallower decay slopes. For the same $\Delta M$, the $dM/dt$ shape varies
significantly with stellar mass, promising the potential determination of
stellar properties from the TDE light curve alone. The $dM/dt$ shape depends
strongly on stellar structure and to a certain extent stellar mass, meaning

young associations in the solar neighbourhood and several members are known to
host circumstellar discs, planets, and comets. Measuring its age with precision
is basic to study several astrophysical processes such as planet formation and
disc evolution which are strongly age dependent.
  Aims: We aim to determine a precise and accurate dynamical traceback age for
the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group.
  Methods: Our sample combines the extremely precise Gaia DR2 astrometry with
ground-based radial velocities measured in an homogeneous manner. We use an
updated version of our algorithm to determine dynamical ages. The new approach
takes into account a robust estimate of the spatial and kinematic covariance
matrices of the association to improve the sample selection process and to
perform the traceback analysis.
  Results: We estimate a dynamical age of $18.5_{-2.4}^{+2.0}$ Myr for the
$\beta$ Pictoris moving group. We investigated the spatial substructure of the
association at birth time and we propose the existence of a core of stars more
concentrated. We also provide precise radial velocity measurements for 81
members of $\beta$ Pic, including ten stars with the first determination of
their radial velocities.
  Conclusions: Our dynamical traceback age is three times more precise than
previous traceback age estimates and, more important, for the first time,
reconciles the traceback age with the most recent estimates of other dynamical,
lithium depletion boundary, and isochronal ages. This has been possible thanks
to the excellent astrometric and spectroscopic precisions, the homogeneity of
our sample, and the detailed analysis of binaries and membership.

Of particular interest are cases with asymptotic giant branch (AGB) primary

transients. In three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh

early-AGB star with companions of different masses. Although the stellar
envelope of the AGB star is less tightly bound than that of a red giant, we
find that the release of orbital energy of the core binary is insufficient to
eject more than about twenty percent of the envelope mass. Ionization energy
released in the expanding envelope, however, can lead to complete envelope
ejection. Because recombination proceeds largely at high optical depths in our
simulations, it is likely that this effect indeed plays a significant role in
the considered systems. The efficiency of mass loss and the final orbital
separation of the core binary system depend on the mass ratio between the
companion and the primary star. Our results suggest a linear relation between
the ratio of final to initial orbital separation and this parameter.

star-forming galaxies, quiescent and starburst galaxies at different cosmic
epochs.
  We take advantage of the X-ray data from the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy survey and
of the extensive multiwavelength ancillary observations in the COSMOS field
presented in the COSMOS2015 catalog. We perform an X-ray stacking analysis and
combine it with detected sources, in a broad redshift interval ($0.1<z<3.5$).
The X-ray luminosity is used to predict the BHAR, while a similar stacking
analysis on far-infrared Herschel maps is used to measure the corresponding
SFR.
  We focus on the evolution of the average SFR-stellar mass (M*) relation and
compare it with the BHAR-M* relation. We find that the ratio between BHAR and
SFR does not evolve with redshift, although it depends on stellar mass. For the
star-forming populations, this dependence on M* has a logarithmic slope of
$\sim0.6$, for the starburst sample of $\sim0.4$, both at odds with quiescent
sources where it remains constant ($\log(\rm {BHAR}/{\rm SFR})\sim -3.4$). By
studying the specific BHAR and specific SFR we find signs of downsizing for
both M* and black hole mass (M$_{\rm BH}$): quiescents grew their super-massive
black hole at very early times, while star-forming and starburst galaxies had
an accretion that endured until more recent times.
  Our results support the idea that the same physical processes feed and
sustain both star formation and black hole accretion. Our integrated estimates
of the M*-M$_{\rm BH}$ relation at all redshifts are consistent with
independent determinations of the local M*-M$_{\rm BH}$ relation, thus adding
key evidence to a weak evolution in the BHAR/SFR, and its low normalization

Al, and Sc for a subsample of S2 objects. We report coherent abundance patterns
over a large metallicity spread (~1 dex) confirming that the S2 stream was
produced by a disrupted dwarf galaxy. The combination of S2's $\alpha$-elements
displays a mildly decreasing trend with increasing metallicity which can be
tentatively interpreted as a ``knee'' at [Fe/H]<-2. At the low metallicity end,
the n-capture elements in S2 may be dominated by r-process production however
several stars are Ba-enhanced, but unusually poor in Sr. Moreover, some of the
low-[Fe/H] stars appear to be carbon-enhanced. We interpret the observed
abundance patterns with the help of chemical evolution models that demonstrate
the need for modest star-formation efficiency and low wind efficiency
confirming that the progenitor of S2 was a primitive dwarf galaxy.

important for the formation of the first stars. To examine the dynamo behavior
during the gravitational collapse of primordial gas, we extend the theory of
nonlinear turbulent dynamo to include the effect of gravitational compression.
The relative importance between dynamo and compression varies during
contraction, with the transition from dynamo- to compression-dominated
amplification of magnetic fields with the increase of density. In the nonlinear
stage of magnetic field amplification with the scale-by-scale energy
equipartition between turbulence and magnetic fields, reconnection diffusion of
magnetic fields in ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence becomes
important. It causes the violation of flux-freezing condition and accounts for
(a) the small growth rate of nonlinear dynamo, (b) the weak dependence of
magnetic energy on density during contraction, (c) the saturated magnetic
energy, and (d) the large correlation length of magnetic fields. The resulting
magnetic field structure and the scaling of magnetic field strength with
density are radically different from the expectations of flux-freezing.

observations of many 3mm-band molecular lines across a large map of the W49
massive star-forming region ($\sim$100$\times$100pc at 11kpc), which were taken
as part of the ""LEGO"" IRAM-30m large project. We find that the spatial extent
or brightness of the molecular line transitions are not well correlated with
their critical densities, highlighting abundance and optical depth must be
considered when estimating line emission characteristics. We explore how the
total emission and emission efficiency (i.e. line brightness per H$_{2}$ column
density) of the line emission vary as a function of molecular hydrogen column
density and dust temperature. We find that there is not a single region of this
parameter space responsible for the brightest and most efficiently emitting gas
for all species. For example, we find that the HCN transition shows high
emission efficiency at high column density ($10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$) and moderate
temperatures (35K), whilst e.g. N$_2$H$^+$ emits most efficiently towards lower
temperatures ($10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$; <20K). We determine $X_{\mathrm{CO} (1-0)}
\sim 0.3 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}(Kkms^{-1})^{-1}}$, and
$\alpha_{\mathrm{HCN} (1-0)} \sim 30\mathrm{M_\odot(Kkms^{-1}pc^2)^{-1}}$,
which both differ significantly from the commonly adopted values. In all, these

consistent with a rock/iron mixture that is ice-poor and ``Earth-like''; the

(""FIR-$z$"") have been used over the past decade to derive redshift constraints
for highly obscured galaxies that lack photometry at other wavelengths like the
optical/near-infrared. Most literature FIR-z fits are performed through
$\chi^2$minimization to a single galaxy's far-infrared template spectral energy
distribution (SED). The use of a single galaxy template, or modest set of
templates, can lead to an artificially low uncertainty estimate on FIR-$z$'s
because real galaxies display a wide range in intrinsic dust SEDs. I use the
observed distribution of galaxy SEDs (for well-constrained samples across
$0<z<5$) to motivate a new far-infrared through millimeter photometric redshift
technique called MMpz. The MMpz algorithm asserts that galaxies are most likely
drawn from the empirically observed relationship between rest-frame peak
wavelength, $\lambda_{\rm peak}$, and total IR luminosity, L$_{\rm IR}$; the
derived photometric redshift accounts for the measurement uncertainties and
intrinsic variation in SEDs at the inferred L$_{\rm IR}$, as well as heating
from the CMB at $z>5$. The MMpz algorithm has a precision of $\sigma_{\Delta
z/(1+z)}\approx0.3-0.4$, similar to single-template fits, while providing a
more accurate estimate of the FIR-$z$ uncertainty with reduced chi-squared of

spectra by classical techniques, which ignore or mask the telluric lines. We
present a methodology and pipeline to derive precision RVs from near-infrared

wide wavelength coverage (Y, J, and H bands, simultaneously), taken by the
InfraRed Doppler (IRD) spectrograph on the Subaru 8.2-m telescope. Our pipeline
extracts the instantaneous instrumental profile of the spectrograph for each
spectral segment, based on a reference spectrum of the laser-frequency comb
that is injected into the spectrograph simultaneously with the stellar light.
These profiles are used to derive the intrinsic stellar template spectrum,
which is free from instrumental broadening and telluric features, as well as
model and fit individual observed spectra in the RV analysis. Implementing a
series of numerical simulations using theoretical spectra that mimic IRD data,
we test the pipeline and show that IRD can achieve $<2$ m s$^{-1}$ precision
for slowly rotating mid-to-late M dwarfs with a signal-to-noise ratio $> 100$
per pixel at 1000 nm. Dependences of RV precision on various stellar parameters
(e.g., $T_{\rm eff}$, $v\sin i$, [Fe/H]) and the impact of telluric-line
blendings on the RV accuracy are discussed through the mock spectra analyses.
We also apply the RV-analysis pipeline to the observed spectra of GJ 699 and
TRAPPIST-1, demonstrating that the spectrograph and the pipeline are capable of
an RV accuracy of $<3$ m s$^{-1}$ at least on a time scale of a few months.

analysis of Palatini gravity constitutes a noteworthy set of results on its
own. In particular, its computational simplicity is visible, as compared to
previous Hamiltonian studies. We argue for the potential value of both the
method and the given examples in the context of generalized Proca and their
coupling to gravity. The possibilities of the method are not exhausted by this
concrete proposal.

and the stellar mass function at $z=0$, we attempt to understand the most
stellar deficient galaxy groups. We argue such groups are a kind of fossil
group (FGs) -- in comparison to the normal groups of galaxies, they assemble
both halo and stellar mass earlier. We find there is a central galaxy and
satellite conformity between these FGs and normal groups: centrals and
satellites in the former form earlier and more stellar deficient than their
counterparts of the latter. We term this effect ""Assembly Conformity"" of dark
matter halos. This effect accounts for about 70 percent of the difference in
stellar content between FGs and normal groups. When split by the peak redshift
for the star formation rate of a group, the mass functions of satellite halos
on either side of the peak redshift are found to be indistinguishable between
FGs and normal groups, indicating a self-similarity of halo assembly with
respect to the peak. The ""baryonic environmental"" effect due to ram-pressure
and gas heating accounts for about 30 percent of the difference in stellar
content. While the total stellar mass of FGs is lower than that of normal
groups, we predict that the mass of the brightest central galaxy of FGs is, on
average, higher than that of normal groups. We also predict that in the central
galaxies of FGs, there is a negative stellar age gradient from the center
outward, where the opposite is expected for those in normal groups.

  Hyperparameters in Machine Learning","10 pages, 6 figures.\",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperparameter tuning is an active area of research in machine learning,
where the aim is to identify the optimal hyperparameters that provide the best
performance on the validation set. Hyperparameter tuning is often achieved
using naive techniques, such as random search and grid search. However, most of
these methods seldom lead to an optimal set of hyperparameters and often get
very expensive. In this paper, we propose a bilevel solution method for solving
the hyperparameter optimization problem that does not suffer from the drawbacks
of the earlier studies. The proposed method is general and can be easily
applied to any class of machine learning algorithms. The idea is based on the
approximation of the lower level optimal value function mapping, which is an
important mapping in bilevel optimization and helps in reducing the bilevel
problem to a single level constrained optimization task. The single-level
constrained optimization problem is solved using the augmented Lagrangian
method. We discuss the theory behind the proposed algorithm and perform
extensive computational study on two datasets that confirm the efficiency of
the proposed method. We perform a comparative study against grid search, random
search and Bayesian optimization techniques that shows that the proposed
algorithm is multiple times faster on problems with one or two hyperparameters.
The computational gain is expected to be significantly higher as the number of
hyperparameters increase. Corresponding to a given hyperparameter most of the
techniques in the literature often assume a unique optimal parameter set that
minimizes loss on the training set. Such an assumption is often violated by
deep learning architectures and the proposed method does not require any such
assumption.

the light curves of prototypes. The largest group is the DQ Her group with
V1280 Sco as the main prototype and the key to grouping. Novae of this group
have three or four variants of a dust condensation. Novae of the small GQ Mus

Cyg, and V1493 Aql are prototypes for 4 groups with close tilts of the initial
brightness decline phase of the light curves. The group with RR Pic as
prototype, including the HR Del subgroup, has a prolonged state of maximal
brightness with the presence of several brightness variations before the final
decline phase. The relationship of groups of novae, or form of the light curve,
with processes in the circumstellar and circum-binary system environment is
shortly discussed. The material ejected during an outburst forms expanding
shells of a generally ellipsoidal shape. In the Lac, Pup, and Cyg groups, the
shells do not show a pronounced regular structure, except for their ellipsoidal
shape. Shells of novae with a dust condensation (the DQ Her group) have an
ellipsoidal shape with an equatorial belt. The unique shell of CK Vul, Nova Vul

in a Universe with a net dark charge for matter. The cosmological dynamics can
be described by a Lema\^itre model and understood thanks to a screening
mechanism driven by the electromagnetic non-linearities that suppress the dark
force on small scales. Only at low redshift, when the screening scale enters
the Hubble horizon, do cosmological structures commence to feel the dark
repulsion. This repulsive force enhances the local value of the Hubble
constant, thus providing a promising scenario for solving the Hubble tension.
Remarkably, the dark electromagnetic interaction can have a crucial impact on
peculiar velocities, i.e. introducing a bias in their reconstruction methods,

infer the quantity of fuel that has been burned during a certain period. To do
so, the v-Angra Collaboration has developed an antineutrino detector and a
complete acquisition system to readout and store the signals generated by its
sensors. The entire detection system has been installed inside a container
laboratory placed beside the dome of the nuclear reactor, in a restricted zone
of the Angra II site. The system is supposed to work standalone for a few years
in order to collect enough data so that the experiment can be validated. The
detector's readout electronics and its environmental conditions are crucial
parts of the experiment and they should work autonomously and be controlled and
monitored remotely. Additionally, threshold configuration is a central issue of
the experiment since antineutrino particles produce low energy signals in the
detector, being necessary to carefully adjust it for all the detector channels
in order to make the system capable of detecting signals as low as those
generated by single photons. To this end, an embedded system was developed and
integrated to the detection apparatus installed in the container at the Angra
II site and is now operational and accessible to the v-Angra Collaboration.
This article aims at describing the proposed embedded system and presenting the

belongs to a new universality class. In this work, we further investigate this

This is achieved by introducing a non-local shear stress into the hydrodynamic
description, which leads to superdiffusion of the velocity field, and can be
viewed as a result of the active particles performing Levy walks. The universal
properties in the critical region are derived by performing a perturbative
renormalization group analysis of the corresponding response functional within
the one-loop approximation. We show that the effect of non-local shear stress
decreases the upper critical dimension of the model, and can lead to the
irrelevance of the active fluid self-advection with the resulting model
belonging to an unusual 'long-range Model A' universality class not reported

non-linearities become irrelevant and the mean-field description is valid in

homogeneous. Space however contains overdense regions in which matter is
concentrating, leaving underdense regions of almost void. The evolution of the
scale factor of the universe has been established from measurements on SNIa.
Since such events occur in regions were matter is present, we may expect that
most of the SNIa are located in overdense regions. This means that the
evolution of the scale factor has been established in a biased manner, by
considering only information coming from overdense regions, excluding the one
from the underdense regions. We develop a simple model to analyze the effect of
this bias, and show that it leads to the appearance of a new tensor in the
Einstein equation of general relativity, which can account for the apparent
acceleration of the expansion of the universe. We further show that this tensor
tends to be proportional to the FLRW metric tensor, and that the constant of
proportionality quantitatively corresponds to the measured cosmological
constant with a remarkable accuracy. We finally explain why these properties
remain valid for other techniques used in determining the dynamics of the
universe, such as the baryon acoustic oscillations.

classes of GLMs. In this paper we develop and apply a new global
goodness-of-fit test, similar to the well-known and commonly used
Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test, that can be used with a wide variety of GLMs. The
test statistic is a variant of the HL test statistic, but we rigorously derive
an asymptotically correct sampling distribution of the test statistic using
methods of Stute and Zhu (2002). Our new test is relatively straightforward to
implement and interpret. We demonstrate the test on a real data set, and
compare the performance of our new test with other global GOF tests for GLMs,
finding that our test provides competitive or comparable power in various
simulation settings. Our test also avoids the use of kernel-based estimators,
used in various GOF tests for regression, thereby avoiding the issues of
bandwidth selection and the curse of dimensionality. Since the asymptotic
sampling distribution is known, a bootstrap procedure for the calculation of a

fundamentally limited by the strong optical attenuation when light is delivered

reported internal-illumination photoacoustic imaging using a customized
radial-emission optical fiber diffuser, which, however, has complex
fabrication, high cost, and non-uniform light emission. To overcome these
shortcomings, we have developed a new type of low-cost fiber diffusers based on
a graded-scattering method in which the optical scattering of the fiber
diffuser is gradually increased as the light travels. The graded scattering can
compensate for the optical attenuation and provide relatively uniform light
emission along the diffuser. We performed Monte Carlo numerical simulations to
optimize several key design parameters, including the number of scattering
segments, scattering anisotropy factor, divergence angle of the optical fiber,
and reflective index of the surrounding medium. These optimized parameters
collectively result in uniform light emission along the fiber diffuser and can
be flexibly adjusted to accommodate different applications. We fabricated and
characterized the prototype fiber diffuser made of agarose gel and intralipid.
Equipped with the new fiber diffuser, we performed thorough proof-of-concept
studies on ex vivo tissue phantoms and an in vivo swine model to demonstrate
the deep-imaging capability (~10 cm achieved ex vivo) of photoacoustic
tomography. We believe that the internal light delivery via the optimized fiber
diffuser is an effective strategy to image deep targets (e.g., kidney) in large
animals or humans.

of automated detection of rumors in social media in this paper by designing a
modular explainable architecture that uses both latent and handcrafted features
and can be expanded to as many new classes of features as desired. This
approach will allow the end user to not only determine whether the piece of
information on the social media is real of a rumor, but also give explanations
on why the algorithm arrived at its conclusion. Using attention mechanisms, we
are able to interpret the relative importance of each of these features as well
as the relative importance of the feature classes themselves. The advantage of
this approach is that the architecture is expandable to more handcrafted
features as they become available and also to conduct extensive testing to
determine the relative influences of these features in the final decision.
Extensive experimentation on popular datasets and benchmarking against eleven
contemporary algorithms, show that our approach performs significantly better
in terms of F-score and accuracy while also being interpretable.

candidate towards reducing this labeling effort. Current one-shot

Most of the current self-supervised methods are analyzed with single imaging

results. Considering that the diagnostics of various vitreoretinal diseases can
greatly benefit from another imaging modality, e.g., FFA, this paper presents a
novel self-supervised feature learning method by effectively exploiting
multi-modal data for retinal disease diagnosis. To achieve this, we first
synthesize the corresponding FFA modality and then formulate a patient
feature-based softmax embedding objective. Our objective learns both
modality-invariant features and patient-similarity features. Through this
mechanism, the neural network captures the semantically shared information
across different modalities and the apparent visual similarity between
patients. We evaluate our method on two public benchmark datasets for retinal
disease diagnosis. The experimental results demonstrate that our method clearly
outperforms other self-supervised feature learning methods and is comparable to

a low-mass planet (M_p<=10M_Earth) due to the combined effect of dust-gas
interaction and the gravitational attraction of the planet. Recently, it has
been shown that although the total solid mass is negligible compared to that of
gas in protoplanetary discs, a positive torque can be emerged by a certain size
solid species. The torque magnitude can overcome that of gas which may result
in outward planetary migration. In this study, we show that the accretion of
solid species by the planet strengthens the magnitude of solid torque being
either positive or negative. We run two-dimensional, high-resolution (1.5Kx3K)
global hydrodynamic simulations of an embedded low-mass planet in a
protoplanetary disc. The solid material is handled as a pressureless fluid.
Strong accretion of well-coupled solid species by a M_p<0.3M_Earth protoplanet
results in the formation of such a strongly asymmetric solid pattern close to
the planet that the positive solid torque can overcome that of gas by two
times. However, the accretion of solids in the pebble regime results in
increased magnitude negative torque felt by protoplanets and strengthened
positive torque for Earth-mass planets. For M_p>=3M_Earth planets the magnitude
of the solid torque is positive, however, independent of the accretion strength
investigated. We conclude that the migration of solid accreting planets can be
substantially departed from the canonical type-I prediction.

correction, is an important task for controlling quantum systems in order to
produce reliable quantum devices. When the evolution is governed by a
completely positive map, there exist reversibility conditions, known as the
quantum error correcting code conditions, which are necessary and sufficient
conditions for the reversibility of a quantum operation on a subspace, the code
space. However, if we suppose that the evolution is not described by a
completely positive map, necessary and sufficient conditions are not known.
Here we consider evolutions that do not necessarily correspond to a completely
positive map. We prove that the completely positive map error correcting code
conditions can lead to a code space that is not in the domain of the map,
meaning that the output of the map is not positive. A corollary to our theorem
provides a class of relevant examples. Finally, we provide a set of sufficient
conditions that will enable the use of quantum error correcting code conditions

magnetic field strength and orientation within the ionized medium of the Milky
Way. Observations indicate a RM in the spiral arms that exceeds the commonly
assumed range. This raises the question of under what conditions spiral arms
create such strong RM. Aims: We investigate the effect of spiral arms on
Galactic RMs through shock compression of the interstellar medium (ISM). It has
recently been suggested that the Sagittarius spiral arm creates a strong peak
in RM where the line of sight (LOS) is tangent to the arm, and that enhanced RM
follows along an intersecting LOS. We seek to understand the physical
conditions that give rise to this effect and the role of viewing geometry.
Methods: We apply a MHD simulation of the multi-phase ISM in a Milky Way type
spiral galaxy disk in combination with radiative transfer to evaluate different
tracers of spiral arm structures. For observers embedded in the disk, dust
intensity, synchrotron emission and the kinematics of molecular gas
observations are derived to identify spiral arm tangents. RMs are calculated
through the disk and evaluated for different observer positions. The observer's
perspective is related to the parameters of the local bubble surrounding the
observer. Results: We reproduce a scattering of tangent points for different
tracers of about $6^\circ$ per spiral arm similar to the Milky Way. As for the
RM, the model shows that compression of the ISM and associated amplification of
the magnetic field in spiral arms enhances RM by a few hundred rad $m^{-2}$ on
top of the mean contribution of the disk. The arm-inter-arm contrast in RM
along the LOS is approximately 10 in the inner Galaxy, fading to ~2 in the
outer Galaxy. We identify a shark-fin like pattern in the RM Milky Way
observations as well as the synthetic data that is characteristic for spiral
arms.

mechanical properties are essential in understanding the behaviour of soft and
biological materials in a wide range of applications. Needle based measurement
techniques such as Cavitation Rheology and Volume Controlled Cavity Expansion
(VCCE), allow for minimally invasive local mechanical testing, but have been
limited to measuring the elastic material properties. Here, we propose several
enhancements to the VCCE technique to adapt it for characterization of
viscoelastic response at low to medium stretch rates ($10^{-2}$ - $1$
s${}^{-1}$). The proposed technique performs several cycles of
expansion-relaxation at controlled stretch rates in a cavity expansion setting
and then employs a large deformation viscoelastic model to capture the measured
material response. Application of the technique to soft PDMS rubber reveals
significant rate dependent material response with high precision and
repeatability, while isolating equilibrated states that are used to directly
infer the quasistatic elastic modulus. The technique is further established by
demonstrating its ability to capture changes in the rate dependent material
response of a tuneable PDMS system. The measured viscoelastic properties are
used to explain earlier reports of rate insensitive material response by needle
based methods: it is demonstrated that the conventional use of constant
volumetric rate cavity expansion can induce high stretch rates that lead to
viscoelastic stiffening and an illusion of rate insensitive material response.
We thus conclude with a cautionary note on possible overestimation of the
quasistatic elastic modulus in previous studies and suggest that the stretch
rate controlled expansion protocol, proposed in this work, is essential for
accurate estimation of both quasistatic and dynamic material parameters.

learning of decision-making policies by leveraging past experience. However, in
the offline RL setting -- where a fixed collection of interactions are provided
and no further interactions are allowed -- it has been shown that standard
off-policy RL methods can significantly underperform. Recently proposed methods
often aim to address this shortcoming by constraining learned policies to
remain close to the given dataset of interactions. In this work, we closely
investigate an important simplification of BCQ -- a prior approach for offline
RL -- which removes a heuristic design choice and naturally restricts extracted
policies to remain exactly within the support of a given behavior policy.
Importantly, in contrast to their original theoretical considerations, we
derive this simplified algorithm through the introduction of a novel backup
operator, Expected-Max Q-Learning (EMaQ), which is more closely related to the
resulting practical algorithm. Specifically, in addition to the distribution
support, EMaQ explicitly considers the number of samples and the proposal
distribution, allowing us to derive new sub-optimality bounds which can serve
as a novel measure of complexity for offline RL problems. In the offline RL
setting -- the main focus of this work -- EMaQ matches and outperforms prior
state-of-the-art in the D4RL benchmarks. In the online RL setting, we
demonstrate that EMaQ is competitive with Soft Actor Critic. The key
contributions of our empirical findings are demonstrating the importance of
careful generative model design for estimating behavior policies, and an
intuitive notion of complexity for offline RL problems. With its simple
interpretation and fewer moving parts, such as no explicit function
approximator representing the policy, EMaQ serves as a strong yet easy to
implement baseline for future work.

\times N$ thin rectangle in Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model, assuming
that cooperative binding cannot be enforced (temperature-1 self-assembly) and
that tiles are allowed to be placed at most one step into the third dimension
(just-barely 3D). While the directed tile complexities of a square and a
scaled-up version of any algorithmically specified shape at temperature 1 in
just-barely 3D are both asymptotically the same as they are (respectively) at
temperature 2 in 2D, the bounds on the directed tile complexity of a thin
rectangle at temperature 2 in 2D are not known to hold at temperature 1 in
just-barely 3D. Motivated by this discrepancy, we establish new lower and upper
bounds on the directed tile complexity of a thin rectangle at temperature 1 in
just-barely 3D. We develop a new, more powerful type of Window Movie Lemma that
lets us upper bound the number of ""sufficiently similar"" ways to assign glues
to a set of fixed locations. Consequently, our lower bound,
$\Omega\left(N^{\frac{1}{k}}\right)$, is an asymptotic improvement over the
previous best lower bound and is more aesthetically pleasing since it
eliminates the $k$ that used to divide $N^{\frac{1}{k}}$. The proof of our
upper bound is based on a just-barely 3D, temperature-1 counter, organized
according to ""digit regions"", which affords it roughly fifty percent more
digits for the same target rectangle compared to the previous best counter.
This increase in digit density results in an upper bound of

capability. In this paper, we consider an IoT network where the cloud/edge
platform performs the DL based semantic communication (DeepSC) model training
and updating while IoT devices perform data collection and transmission based
on the trained model. To make it affordable for IoT devices, we propose a lite
distributed semantic communication system based on DL, named L-DeepSC, for text
transmission with low complexity, where the data transmission from the IoT
devices to the cloud/edge works at the semantic level to improve transmission
efficiency. Particularly, by pruning the model redundancy and lowering the
weight resolution, the L-DeepSC becomes affordable for IoT devices and the
bandwidth required for model weight transmission between IoT devices and the
cloud/edge is reduced significantly. Through analyzing the effects of fading
channels in forward-propagation and back-propagation during the training of
L-DeepSC, we develop a channel state information (CSI) aided training
processing to decrease the effects of fading channels on transmission.
Meanwhile, we tailor the semantic constellation to make it implementable on
capacity-limited IoT devices. Simulation demonstrates that the proposed
L-DeepSC achieves competitive performance compared with traditional methods,
especially in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) region. In particular, while it can

  Mitigation","Accepted at VTC-Fall 2020",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interest of the automotive industry has progressively focused on subjects
related to driver assistance systems as well as autonomous cars. Cars combine a
variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings robustly. Among them, radar
sensors are indispensable because of their independence of lighting conditions
and the possibility to directly measure velocity. However, radar interference
is an issue that becomes prevalent with the increasing amount of radar systems
in automotive scenarios. In this paper, we address this issue for frequency
modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars with fully convolutional neural
networks (FCNs), a state-of-the-art deep learning technique. We propose two
FCNs that take spectrograms of the beat signals as input, and provide the
corresponding clean range profiles as output. We propose two architectures for
interference mitigation which outperform the classical zeroing technique.
Moreover, considering the lack of databases for this task, we release as open
source a large scale data set that closely replicates real world automotive
scenarios for single-interference cases, allowing others to objectively compare
their future work in this domain. The data set is available for download at:

health policy making. Predictions of mortality and hospitalization help
governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we
consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at
the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a
forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point
forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision
making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where
probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and
we aggregate the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. With only
limited information available regarding the historical accuracy of the
forecasting teams, we consider aggregation (i.e. combining) methods that do not
rely on a record of past accuracy. In this empirical paper, we evaluate the
accuracy of aggregation methods that have been previously proposed for interval
forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use
of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods, which enable robust
estimation and allow the aggregate forecast to reduce the impact of a tendency
for the forecasting teams to be under- or overconfident. We use data that has
been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. While the simple
average performed well for the high mortality series, we obtained greater
accuracy using the median and certain trimming methods for the low and medium
mortality series. It will be interesting to see if this remains the case as the
pandemic evolves.

communication (OWC) that is considered a promising solution for high-speed
indoor connectivity. Unlike in conventional radio frequency wireless systems,
the OWC channel is not isotropic, meaning that the device orientation affects
the channel gain significantly. However, due to the lack of proper channel
models for LiFi systems, many studies have assumed that the receiver is
vertically upward and randomly located within the coverage area, which is not a
realistic assumption from a practical point of view. In this paper, novel
realistic and measurement-based channel models for indoor LiFi systems are
proposed. Precisely, the statistics of the channel gain are derived for the
case of randomly oriented stationary and mobile LiFi receivers. For stationary
users, two channel models are proposed, namely, the modified truncated Laplace
(MTL) model and the modified Beta (MB) model. For LiFi users, two channel
models are proposed, namely, the sum of modified truncated Gaussian (SMTG)
model and the sum of modified Beta (SMB) model. Based on the derived models,
the impact of random orientation and spatial distribution of LiFi users is
investigated, where we show that the aforementioned factors can strongly affect
the channel gain and system performance.

These lines also trace the disk/envelope structure around the protostar. The
H2CO (K_a=2 and 3), CH3OH, and SO emissions are concentrated toward the
protostar, while the DCN emission is more extended around the protostar. We
have performed the principal component analysis (PCA) for these distributions
on the two different scales, the outflow and the disk/envelope structure. For
the latter case, the molecular-line distributions are classified into two
groups, according to the contribution of the second principal component, one
having a compact distribution around the protostar and the other showing a
rather extended distribution over the envelope. Moreover, the second principal
component value tends to increase as an increasing quantum number of H2CO
(K_a=0,1,2, and 3), reflecting the excitation condition: the distribution is
more compact for higher excitation lines. These results indicate that PCA is
effective to extract the characteristic feature of the molecular line
distributions around the protostar in an unbiased way. In addition, we identify
four blobs in the outflow structure in the H2CO lines, some of which can also
be seen in the CH3OH, CS, CCH, and SO emissions. The gas temperature derived
from the H2CO lines ranges from 43 to 63 K, which suggests shocks due to the
local impact of the outflow on clumps of the ambient gas.

performance of the generalized Kennedy receiver having optimally displaced

Then we analyze the properties of the optimum threshold and the optimum

obtain them. We prove that the ODTD degenerates to the Kennedy receiver with
threshold detection when the signal power is large, and we also clarify the
connection between the generalized Kennedy receiver with threshold detection
and the one-port homodyne detection. Numerical results show that the proposed
heuristic greedy search algorithm can obtain a lower and smoother error

identify disease subtypes that could not be observed otherwise by using

concerns primarily the identification of subpopulations that have similar
patterns in gene features. However, as the features corresponding to irrelevant
confounders (e.g. gender or age) may dominate the clustering process, the
resulting clusters may or may not capture clinically meaningful disease
subtypes. This gives rise to a fundamental problem: can we find a subtyping
procedure guided by a pre-specified disease outcome? Existing methods, such as
supervised clustering, apply a two-stage approach and depend on an arbitrary
number of selected features associated with outcome. In this paper, we propose
a unified latent generative model to perform outcome-guided disease subtyping
constructed from omics data, which improves the resulting subtypes concerning
the disease of interest. Feature selection is embedded in a regularization
regression. A modified EM algorithm is applied for numerical computation and
parameter estimation. The proposed method performs feature selection, latent
subtype characterization and outcome prediction simultaneously. To account for
possible outliers or violation of mixture Gaussian assumption, we incorporate
robust estimation using adaptive Huber or median-truncated loss function.
Extensive simulations and an application to complex lung diseases with
transcriptomic and clinical data demonstrate the ability of the proposed method
to identify clinically relevant disease subtypes and signature genes suitable
to explore toward precision medicine.

narrow band photometry from PAUS, a survey with 40 narrow bands spaced at
$100\r{A}$ intervals covering the range from $4500\r{A}$ to $8500\r{A}$, and 26
broad, intermediate, and narrow bands covering the UV, visible and near
infrared spectrum from the COSMOS2015 catalogue. We introduce a new method that
models the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as a linear combination of
continuum and emission line templates and computes its Bayes evidence,
integrating over the linear combinations. The correlation between the UV
luminosity and the OII line is measured using the 66 available bands with the
zCOSMOS spectroscopic sample, and used as a prior which constrains the relative
flux between continuum and emission line templates. The flux ratios between the
OII line and $\mathrm{H}_{\alpha}$, $\mathrm{H}_{\beta}$ and $\mathrm{OIII}$
are similarly measured and used to generate the emission line templates.
Comparing to public spectroscopic surveys via the quantity
$\Delta_z\equiv(z_{\mathrm{photo}}-z_{\mathrm{spec}})/(1+z_{\mathrm{spec}})$,
we find the photometric redshifts to be more precise than previous estimates,
with $\sigma_{68}(\Delta_z) \approx (0.003, 0.009)$ for galaxies at magnitude
$i_{\mathrm{AB}}\sim18$ and $i_{\mathrm{AB}}\sim23$, respectively, which is
$3\times$ and $1.66\times$ tighter than COSMOS2015. Additionally, we find the
redshifts to be very accurate on average, yielding a median of the $\Delta_z$
distribution compatible with $|\mathrm{median}(\Delta_z)|\leq0.001$ at all
redshifts and magnitudes considered. Both the added PAUS data and new
methodology contribute significantly to the improved results.

microscope, electron microprobe, cathodoluminescence, and electron backscatter
diffraction techniques. Phase associations, microtextures, and microstructures
of phosphates are extremely variable within and between the differently-shocked
lithologies investigated in the Chelyabinsk meteorite. We observe continuously
strained as well as recrystallized, strain-free phosphate populations.
Recrystallized grains (with strain-free subdomains) are present only in the
more intensely shocked dark lithology, indicating that phosphate growth in
Chelyabinsk predates the development of primary shock-metamorphic textures.
This disruption event is also recorded by complete melting of portions of the
meteorite to produce the shock-melt lithology, which contains a population of
phosphorus-rich olivine grains. We interpret the textures and phase
associations of Chelyabinsk to have resulted from initial phosphate growth via
metasomatic olivine replacement, followed by major deformation during an early
shock-melting impact and a subsequent minor shock event. This minor event
appears to have generated a sub-population of phosphates that display patchy CL
textures, in both the light and dark lithology. Finally, we propose a new
classification scheme to describe various types of

shock metamorphic events and define the associated physicochemical processes.

based on basis set expansions. The calculations are carried out in a
valence-only framework using recently derived correlation consistent effective
core potentials. Our primary goal is to understand the fixed-node diffusion QMC
errors in both the ground and excited states with single-reference trial wave
functions. Using a combination of methods, we demonstrate the very high
accuracy of the QMC atomization energies being within $\approx$ 0.07 eV or
better when compared with essentially exact results. By employing proper
choices for trial wave functions, we have found that the fixed-node QMC biases
for total energies are remarkably uniform ranging between $1-3.5$ % with
absolute values at most $\approx$ 0.2 eV across the systems and several types
of excitations such as singlets and triplets as well as low-lying and
Rydberg-like states. Our results further corroborate that Si systems, and
presumably also related main group IV and V elements of the periodic table (Ge,
Sn, etc), exhibit some of the lowest fixed-node biases found in valence-only
electronic structure QMC calculations.

synthesis, the one of suspended oil drops depends on the adsorption equilibrium
of the surrounding molecules. The presence of salt raises the polarity of the
water phase, favoring the salting out of the surfactant from the aqueous
solution and increasing its surface excess. Yet, the electrolyte also screens
the resulting surface charge of the drops [Debye-H\""uckel, 1923]. As a result,
the electrostatic surface potential increases with the ionic strength until the
saturation of the interface and then decreases. This behavior produces a
maximum previously observed in hexadecane-in-water nanoemulsions
[Urbina-Villalba, 2013; 2015]. Here, the variation of the surface potential of
two dodecane-in-water (d/w) nanoemulsions is evaluated as a function of the
sodium chloride concentration. As expected, maximum values are obtained for
concentrations of 0.5 and 7.5 mM sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS). However, the
surface excess of dodecane drops shows an intermediate behavior between the
adsorption equilibrium predicted by macroscopic adsorption isotherms, and the
one previously found on hexadecane drops. The stability of the prepared
emulsions was followed monitoring the change in the average radius of the
dispersions during five minutes, six times the lapse of time employed in a
typical evaluation of the aggregation rate. In the case of 7.5 mM SDS, the
smallest change in size coincides with the maximum surface potential found (40
mM NaCl). This is not observed for 0.5 mM SDS. Three regimes of destabilization
are found to exist depending on the ionic strength of the aqueous phase. They
correspond to the prevalence of: 1) solubilization/ripening, 2) aggregation,
and 3) crystal precipitation.

transport constraints to take into account real-world imperfections. The
transport cost between two points is given by the pairwise similarity between
deep features extracted by a neural network trained under full supervision

the best existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets while requiring
much less parameters and without using multiscale analysis. Our second finding

Landau-de Gennes energy depends on four elastic constants; $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$,
$L_4$. For the general case of $L_4\neq 0$, Ball-Majumdar \cite {BM} found an
example that the Landau-de Gennes energy functional from physics literature
\cite{MN} does not satisfy a coercivity condition, which causes a problem in
mathematics to establish existence of energy minimizers. In order to solve this
problem, we observe that the original third order term on $L_4$, proposed by
Schiele and Trimper \cite{ST} in physics, is a linear combination of a fourth
order term and a second order term. Therefore, we can propose a new Landau-de
Gennes energy, which is equal to the original for uniaxial nematic $Q$-tensors.
The new Landau-de Gennes energy with general elastic constants satisfies the
coercivity condition for all $Q$-tensors, which establishes a new link between
mathematical and physical theory. Similarly to the work of Majumdar-Zarnescu

may not have access to those data. Rather, based on the fact that it is easy to
store the learned re-identifications models, which mitigates any data privacy
concern, we develop an efficient model adaptation approach using hypothesis
transfer learning that aims to transfer the knowledge using only source models
and limited labeled data, but without using any source camera data from the
existing network. Our approach minimizes the effect of negative transfer by
finding an optimal weighted combination of multiple source models for
transferring the knowledge. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmark

energies of intermetallic alloys. We used two semilocal approximations, the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and
the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA. In addition,
we utilized two nonlocal DFT functionals, the hybrid HSE06, and the
state-of-the-art random phase approximation (RPA). The nonlocal functionals
such as HSE06 and RPA yield accurate formation energies of binary alloys with
completely-filled d-band metals, where semilocal functionals underperform. The
accuracy at the nonlocal functionals is greatly reduced when a partially-filled
d-band metal is present in an alloy, while PBE-GGA outperforms in these cases.
We show that the accurate prediction of formation energies by any DFT method
depends on its ability to predict the accurate electronic properties, e.g.,
valence d-band contribution to the density of states (DOS). The SCAN meta-GGA
often corrects the PBE-DOS, however, it does not provide accurate formation
energies compared to PBE. This is assumed to be due to the lack of proper error
cancellation that should be expected due to the similar bulk nature of both
alloys and their constituents, which may improve with the modification of
meta-GGA ingredients. RPA yields too negative formation energies of alloys with
partially-filled d-band metals. RPA results can be corrected by restoring the
exchange-correlation kernel, thereby improving the short-range
electron-electron correlation in metallic densities.

frequency or contrast, potentially interfering with the validity of findings.
Here, we present a battery of tests used to weigh the relative merits of two
displays for presenting achromatic, mean-modulated flicker. These tests
revealed marked differences between a new high-performance liquid-crystal
display (LCD; EIZO ColorEdge CG247X) and a new consumer-grade LCD (Dell
U2415b), despite displays' vendor-supplied specifications being almost
identical. We measured displayed luminance using a spot meter and a linearized
photodiode. We derived several measures, including spatial uniformity, the
effect of viewing angle, response times, Fourier amplitude spectra, and
cycle-averaged luminance. We presented paired luminance pulses to quantify the
displays' nonlinear dynamics. The CG247X showed relatively good spatial
uniformity (e.g., at moderate luminance, standard deviation 2.8% versus
U2415b's 5.3%). Fourier transformation of nominally static test patches
revealed spectra free of artifacts, with the exception of a frame response. The
CG247X's rise and fall times depended on both the luminance from which, and to
which, it responded, as is to be generally expected from LCDs. Despite this
nonlinear behaviour, we were able to define a contrast and frequency range
wherein the CG247X appeared largely artifact-free; the relationship between
nominal luminance and displayed luminance was accurately modelled using a
causal, linear time-invariant system. This range included contrasts up to 80%,
and flicker frequencies up to 30 Hz.

platform to study strongly correlated states in two dimensions, thanks to the
strong electron interaction in the moir\'e minibands. In most systems, the
correlated states appear when the moir\'e lattice is filled by integer number
of electrons per moir\'e unit cell. Recently, correlated states at fractional
fillings of 1/3 and 2/3 holes per moir\'e unit cell has been reported in the
WS2/WSe2 heterobilayer, hinting the long range nature of the electron
interaction. In this work, employing a scanning microwave impedance microscopy
technique that is sensitive to local electrical properties, we observe a series
of correlated insulating states at fractional fillings of the moir\'e minibands
on both electron- and hole-doped sides in angle-aligned WS2/WSe2
hetero-bilayers, with certain states persisting at temperatures up to 120 K.
Monte Carlo simulations reveal that these insulating states correspond to
ordering of electrons in the moir\'e lattice with a periodicity much larger
than the moir\'e unit cell, indicating a surprisingly strong and long-range

introduced over the years. However, these approaches depend on explicit
realisations, for instance as a differential operators, of the underlying Lie
algebra. This is also the case for the construction of their related symmetry
algebra which take usually the form of a finitely generated quadratic algebra.
These algebras often display structure constants which depend on the central
elements and in particular on the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we develop a new
approach reexamining the case of the generic superintegrable systems on the
2-sphere for which a symmetry algebra is known to be the Racah algebra $R(3)$.
Such a model is related to the 59 $2D$ superintegrable systems on conformally
flat spaces and their 12 equivalence classes. We demonstrate that using further
polynomials of degree 2,3 and 4 in the enveloping algebra of $su(3)$ one can
generate an algebra based only on abstract commutation relations of $su(3)$ Lie
algebra without explicit constraints on the representations or realisations.
This construction relies on the maximal Abelian subalgebra, also called MASA,
which are the Cartan generators and their commutant. We obtain a new
6-dimensional cubic algebra where the structure constant are integer numbers
which reduce from a quartic algebra for which the structure constant depend on
the Cartan generator and the Casimir invariant. We also present other form of
the symmetry algebra using the quadratic and cubic Casimir invariants of
$su(3)$. It reduces as the known quadratic Racah algebra $R(3)$ only when using
an explicit realization. This algebraic structure describe the symmetry of the
generic superintegrable systems on the 2 sphere. We also present a contraction
to another 6-dimensional cubic algebra which would corresponding to the
symmetry algebra of a Smorodinsky-Winternitz model.

  approach",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge graph embedding, which aims to learn the low-dimensional
representations of entities and relationships, has attracted considerable
research efforts recently. However, most knowledge graph embedding methods
focus on the structural relationships in fixed triples while ignoring the
temporal information. Currently, existing time-aware graph embedding methods
only focus on the factual plausibility, while ignoring the temporal smoothness
which models the interactions between a fact and its contexts, and thus can
capture fine-granularity temporal relationships. This leads to the limited
performance of embedding related applications. To solve this problem, this
paper presents a Robustly Time-aware Graph Embedding (RTGE) method by
incorporating temporal smoothness. Two major innovations of our paper are
presented here. At first, RTGE integrates a measure of temporal smoothness in
the learning process of the time-aware graph embedding. Via the proposed
additional smoothing factor, RTGE can preserve both structural information and
evolutionary patterns of a given graph. Secondly, RTGE provides a general
task-oriented negative sampling strategy associated with temporally-aware
information, which further improves the adaptive ability of the proposed
algorithm and plays an essential role in obtaining superior performance in
various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark tasks show
that RTGE can increase performance in entity/relationship/temporal scoping
prediction tasks.

matrices is closely related to the degrees of nonstationarity of autoregressive
models for time series and longitudinal data. Heuristically, one expects for a
nearly stationary covariance matrix the entries in each subdiagonal of the
Cholesky factor of its inverse to be nearly the same in the sense that sum of
absolute values of successive terms is small. Statistically such smoothness is
achieved by regularizing each subdiagonal using fused-type lasso penalties. We
rely on the standard Cholesky factor as the new parameters within a regularized
normal likelihood setup which guarantees: (1) joint convexity of the likelihood
function, (2) strict convexity of the likelihood function restricted to each
subdiagonal even when $n<p$, and (3) positive-definiteness of the estimated
covariance matrix. A block coordinate descent algorithm, where each block is a
subdiagonal, is proposed and its convergence is established under mild
conditions. Lack of decoupling of the penalized likelihood function into a sum
of functions involving individual subdiagonals gives rise to some computational
challenges and advantages relative to two recent algorithms for sparse
estimation of the Cholesky factor which decouple row-wise. Simulation results
and real data analysis show the scope and good performance of the proposed
methodology.

thermal states with a bond dimension growing polynomially with the system size.
In the regime of sufficiently low temperatures, which is particularly important
for practical applications, the existing techniques do not yield optimal
bounds. Here, we propose a new thermal area law that holds for generic
many-body systems on lattices. We improve the temperature dependence from the
original $\mathcal{O}(\beta)$ to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\beta^{2/3})$, thereby
suggesting diffusive propagation of entanglement by imaginary time evolution.
This qualitatively differs from the real-time evolution which usually induces
linear growth of entanglement. We also prove analogous bounds for the R\'enyi
entanglement of purification and the entanglement of formation. Our analysis is
based on a polynomial approximation to the exponential function which provides
a relationship between the imaginary-time evolution and random walks. Moreover,
for one-dimensional (1D) systems with $n$ spins, we prove that the Gibbs state
is well-approximated by a matrix product operator with a sublinear bond
dimension of $e^{\sqrt{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\beta \log(n))}}$. This proof allows
us to rigorously establish, for the first time, a quasi-linear time classical
algorithm for constructing an MPS representation of 1D quantum Gibbs states at
arbitrary temperatures of $\beta = o(\log(n))$. Our new technical ingredient is
a block decomposition of the Gibbs state, that bears resemblance to the
decomposition of real-time evolution given by Haah et al., FOCS'18.

equations approximately describing the oscillator dynamics. By analyzing an
analytically tractable oscillator model with a cubic nonlinearity, we show that
the asymptotic phase of the oscillator state in an infinite-dimensional state
space can be approximately evaluated and non-trivial bistability of the
oscillation amplitude caused by moderately strong periodic perturbations can be
predicted on the basis of the derived phase-amplitude equations. We further
analyze a model of gene-regulatory oscillator and illustrate that the reduced

spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the large scale, these empirical solutions,
often associated with extended and complete lockdowns, attempt to minimize the
costs associated with mortality, economic losses and social factors, while
being subject to constraints such as finite hospital capacity. Here we pose the
question of how to mitigate pandemic costs subject to constraints by adopting
the language of optimal control theory. This allows us to determine top-down
policies for the nature and dynamics of social contact rates given an
age-structured model for the dynamics of the disease. Depending on the relative
weights allocated to life and socioeconomic losses, we see that the optimal
strategies range from long-term social-distancing only for the most vulnerable,
to partial lockdown to ensure not over-running hospitals, to alternating-shifts
with significant reduction in life and/or socioeconomic losses. Crucially,
commonly used strategies that involve long periods of broad lockdown are almost
never optimal, as they are highly unstable to reopening and entail high
socioeconomic costs. Using parameter estimates from data available for Germany
and the USA, we quantify these policies and use sensitivity analysis in the
relevant model parameters and initial conditions to determine the range of
robustness of our policies. Finally we also discuss how bottom-up behavioral
changes can also change the dynamics of the pandemic and show how this in
tandem with top-down control policies can mitigate pandemic costs even more
effectively.

of a globally ice-covered snowball climate for paleo Earth and for tidally
locked planets around low-mass stars. Here, we investigate whether sea-ice
drift can influence the stellar flux threshold for a snowball climate onset on
rapidly rotating aqua-planets around a Sun-like star. Using a fully coupled
atmosphere--land--ocean--sea-ice model with turning on or off sea-ice drift, a
circular orbit with no eccentricity (e=0) and an eccentric orbit (e=0.2) are
examined. When sea-ice drift is turned off, the stellar flux threshold for the
snowball onset is 1250--1275 and 1173--1199 W m^-2 for e=0 and 0.2,
respectively. The difference is mainly due to the poleward retreat of sea ice
and snow edges when the planet is close to the perihelion in the eccentric
orbit. When sea-ice drift is turned on, the respective stellar flux threshold
is 1335--1350 and 1250--1276 W m^-2. These mean that sea-ice drift increases
the snowball onset threshold by ~80 W m^-2 for both e=0 and 0.2, promoting the
formation of a snowball climate state. We further show that oceanic dynamics
have a small effect, <26 W m^-2, on the snowball onset threshold. This is
because oceanic heat transport becomes weaker and weaker as the sea ice edge is
approaching the equator. These results imply that sea-ice dynamics are
important for the climate of planets close to the outer edge of the habitable

the energy management of these systems in three complementary scenarios. The
first and second scenarios are respectively suitable for a market with a

low-dimensional vector embedding for each node that is typically fixed for all
tasks involving the node. Many of the existing methods focus on obtaining a
static vector representation for a node in a way that is agnostic to the
downstream application where it is being used. In practice, however, downstream
tasks such as link prediction require specific contextual information that can
be extracted from the subgraphs related to the nodes provided as input to the
task. To tackle this challenge, we develop SLiCE, a framework bridging static
representation learning methods using global information from the entire graph
with localized attention driven mechanisms to learn contextual node
representations. We first pre-train our model in a self-supervised manner by
introducing higher-order semantic associations and masking nodes, and then
fine-tune our model for a specific link prediction task. Instead of training
node representations by aggregating information from all semantic neighbors
connected via metapaths, we automatically learn the composition of different
metapaths that characterize the context for a specific task without the need
for any pre-defined metapaths. SLiCE significantly outperforms both static and
contextual embedding learning methods on several publicly available benchmark
network datasets. We also interpret the semantic association matrix and provide
its utility and relevance in making successful link predictions between
heterogeneous nodes in the network.

multi-core architectures with multilevel cache hierarchies have been widely
accepted in modern processors. However, the complexity of the architectures
makes modeling of shared caches extremely complex. In this paper, we propose a
data-sharing aware analytical model for estimating the miss rates of the
downstream shared cache under multi-core scenarios. Moreover, the proposed
model can also be integrated with upstream cache analytical models with the
consideration of multi-core private cache coherent effects. This integration
avoids time consuming full simulations of the cache architecture that required
by conventional approaches. We validate our analytical model against gem5
simulation results under 13 applications from PARSEC 2.1 benchmark suites.
Compared to the results from gem5 simulations under 8 hardware configurations
including dual-core and quad-core architectures, the average absolute error of
the predicted shared L2 cache miss rates is less than 2% for all
configurations. After integrated with the refined upstream model with coherence
misses, the overall average absolute error in 4 hardware configurations is
degraded to 8.03% due to the error accumulations. The proposed coherence model
can achieve similar accuracies of state of the art approach with only one tenth
time overhead. As an application case of the integrated model, we also evaluate
the miss rates of 57 different multi-core and multi-level cache configurations.

even jumping of an individual droplet by changing the intrinsic balance of
three-phase interfacial tensions, which has been widely used for droplet
manipulating in microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip devices in over decades. In the
present paper, we present an analytical prediction of jumping velocity for
droplets electrowetting on textured hydrophobic surfaces with different wetting
states. In particular, we consider a liquid droplet wetting on a textured
hydrophobic substrate with a voltage applied between the droplet and the
substrate. Once the voltage is turned off, the energy stored in the droplet
during the electrowetting releases and could even result in the detachment of
the droplet. The effects of the initial and electro-wetting states, i.e.
Cassie-Baxter state and Wenzel state, on the jumping velocity of droplets are
systematically discussed. Based on energy conservation, the energy conversion
between the surface energy, internal viscous dissipation and the kinetic energy
of droplets in different wetting states are analysed. The close-form formulas
to predict the jumping velocity for different droplet wetting states are
systematically derived. Finally, the unified form for predicting the
electrowetting-induced jumping velocity of droplets on both flat and textured
substrates with different wetting states is obtained, which can describe the
jumping motion with various wetting conditions. This work provide theoretical
insights on accurate control of the electrowetting-induced jumping motion of

The hierarchical graph pooling layers are then involved to downsample graph

commutative operator -- is a common computation in many numerical computations,
including scientific computations, machine learning, computer vision, and
financial analytics.
  Contemporary polyhedral-based compilation techniques make it possible to
optimize reductions, such as prefix sums, in which each component of the
reduction's output potentially shares computation with another component in the
reduction. Therefore an optimizing compiler can identify the computation shared
between multiple components and generate code that computes the shared
computation only once.
  These techniques, however, do not support reductions that -- when phrased in
the language of the polyhedral model -- span multiple dependent statements. In
such cases, existing approaches can generate incorrect code that violates the
data dependences of the original, unoptimized program.
  In this work, we identify and formalize the optimization of dependent
reductions as an integer bilinear program. We present a heuristic optimization
algorithm that uses an affine sequential schedule of the program to determine
how to simplfy reductions yet still preserve the program's dependences.
  We demonstrate that the algorithm provides optimal complexity for a set of
benchmark programs from the literature on probabilistic inference algorithms,
whose performance critically relies on simplifying these reductions. The
complexities for 10 of the 11 programs improve siginifcantly by factors at
least of the sizes of the input data, which are in the range of $10^4$ to

explore the thermodynamical properties of SADs in the 2011 October 22 limb
flare using the observations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly and an improved Differential Emission Measure (DEM) technique.
Different heating events around SADs are identified and the propagation speeds
of plasma heating are calculated. The first heating event starts with the
increase of the emission measure at temperatures higher than 5 MK, about 2.8
minutes before the arrival of the first studied SAD. Its propagation speed is
about 140 km/s, a little faster than the speed of the SAD. However, the other
two events have fast propagation speeds more than 700 km/s. We suspect that the
first heating event can be explained by adiabatic compression, but the others
may have different causes. Besides, we observed that SADs can push away their
surrounding spikes. The formation of SADs is further explained on the basis of
patchy and bursty magnetic reconnection that reconnection outflows may push
away surrounding plasma and leave dark lanes behind them. The reliability of
the DEM results, heating and cooling mechanisms, and other SAD explanations are
discussed.

direct use of LAPACK functions can be error-prone for non-expert users and

bidirectional, which facilitates exploiting channel reciprocity for pilot based
channel estimation of both uplink and downlink. However, there exists a gross
asymmetry in channel estimation complexity for the uplink and downlink,
particularly for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) TDD systems. Usually,
Base Stations (BS) with more antennas need to estimate fewer parameters from
each antenna, whereas the estimation requirement is disproportionately higher
at the User Equipment (UE). Unlike the UE, the BS has powerful hardware,
computational resources and energy to accurately estimate and track channel
profiles. To overcome this asymmetry, we propose a solution for MIMO-TDD
downlink communication, wherein the post-coder part of the channel matrix is
quantized at the BS, and is communicated to the UE via a low-rate channel.
Using asymptotically tight lower bounds on the downlink achievable rates, we
quantify the performance of the proposed scheme. Simulations reveal that a
moderate number of quantization bits are sufficient to achieve rates close to
the the link capacity. We further show that, when the BS has many more antennas
at than the UE, the channel can be compensated by appropriate transmit domain
precoding without post-coder knowledge at the UE.

  Authentication Schemes","Accepted into ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security. 32 Pages",,,,"cs.CR cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observation Resilient Authentication Schemes (ORAS) are a class of shared
secret challenge-response identification schemes where a user mentally computes
the response via a cognitive function to authenticate herself such that
eavesdroppers cannot readily extract the secret. Security evaluation of ORAS
generally involves quantifying information leaked via observed
challenge-response pairs. However, little work has evaluated information leaked
via human behavior while interacting with these schemes. A common way to
achieve observation resilience is by including a modulus operation in the
cognitive function. This minimizes the information leaked about the secret due
to the many-to-one map from the set of possible secrets to a given response. In
this work, we show that user behavior can be used as a side-channel to obtain
the secret in such ORAS. Specifically, the user's eye-movement patterns and
associated timing information can deduce whether a modulus operation was
performed (a fundamental design element), to leak information about the secret.
We further show that the secret can still be retrieved if the deduction is
erroneous, a more likely case in practice. We treat the vulnerability
analytically, and propose a generic attack algorithm that iteratively obtains
the secret despite the ""faulty"" modulus information. We demonstrate the attack
on five ORAS, and show that the secret can be retrieved with considerably less
challenge-response pairs than non-side-channel attacks (e.g.,
algebraic/statistical attacks). In particular, our attack is applicable on
Mod10, a one-time-pad based scheme, for which no non-side-channel attack
exists. We field test our attack with a small-scale eye-tracking user study.

that the evolution approximates a Heisenberg model in the middle of its course,
and the model is in a delocalized phase. We show numerically that we can speed
up the standard algorithm for finding the ground state of the random-field
Ising model using this idea. We also demonstrate that the speedup is due to gap
amplification, even though the underlying model is not frustration-free. The
crossover to speedup occurs at roughly the value of the interaction which is
known to be the critical one for the delocalization transition. We also
calculate the participation ratio and entanglement entropy as a function of
time: their time dependencies indicate that the system is exploring more states
and that they are more entangled than when there is no catalyst. Together, all
these pieces of evidence demonstrate that the speedup is related to
delocalization. Even though only relatively small systems can be investigated,
the evidence suggests that the scaling of the method with system size is
favorable. Our method is illustrated by experimental results from a small
online IBM quantum computer, showing how to verify the method in future as such
machines improve. The cost of the catalytic method compared to the standard
algorithm is only a constant factor.

associations in the Milky Way, and provide the observational evidences in
support of them. In fact, the second release of Gaia astrometric data (April
2018) is revolutionising the field, because it allows us to unravel the 3D
structure and kinematics of stellar associations with unprecedented details by
providing precise distances and a solid membership assessment. As an
illustration, I summarise some recent studies on three OB associations: Cygnus
OB2, Vela OB2, and Scorpius OB1, focussing in more detail to Sco OB1. A
multi-wavelength study, in tandem with astrometric and kinematic data from Gaia
DR2, seems to lend support, at least in this case, to a scenario in which star
formation is not monolithic. As a matter of fact, besides one conspicuous star
cluster, NGC 6231, and the very sparse star cluster Trumpler 24, there are
several smaller groups of young OB and pre-main sequence stars across the
association, indicating that star formation is highly structured and with no
preferred scale. A new revolution is expected with the incoming much awaited
third release of Gaia data.

subtle ingress and egress features in photometric transit light curves, we
investigate the effect of oblateness on the spectroscopic Rossiter-McLaughlin
(RM) signals. We found that a giant planet, with planet-to-star radius ratio of
0.15 and Saturn-like oblateness of 0.098, can cause spectroscopic signatures
with amplitudes up to 1.1 ms$^{-1}$ which is detectable by high-precision

and for planets with spin-orbit misalignment thereby making them more prominent
than the photometric signals at some transit orientations. We compared the
detectability of oblateness in photometry and spectroscopy and found that
photometric light curves are more sensitive to detecting oblateness than the
spectroscopic RM signals mostly because they can be sampled with higher cadence
to better probe the oblateness ingress and egress anomaly. However, joint
analyses of the light curve and RM signal of a transiting planet provides more
accurate and precise estimate of the planet's oblateness. Therefore, ESPRESSO
alongside ongoing and upcoming photometric instruments such as TESS, CHEOPS,

employed to identify greenhouses. Two models are proposed which uniquely
incorporate dilated convolutions and skip connections, and the results are
compared to that of the baseline U-Net model. The dataset used consists of
pan-sharpened orthorectified Azersky images (red, green, blue,and near infrared
channels) with 1.5-meter resolution and annotation masks, collected from 15
regions in Azerbaijan where the greenhouses are densely congested. The images
cover the cumulative area of 1008 $km^2$ and annotation masks contain 47559
polygons in total. The $F_1, Kappa, AUC$, and $IOU$ scores are used for
performance evaluation. It is observed that the use of the deconvolutional
layers alone throughout the expansive path does not yield satisfactory results;
therefore, they are either replaced or coupled with bilinear interpolation. All
models benefit from the hard example mining (HEM) strategy. It is also reported
that the best accuracy of $93.29\%$ ($F_1\,score$) is recorded when the
weighted binary cross-entropy loss is coupled with the dice loss. Experimental
results showed that both of the proposed models outperformed the baseline U-Net

In this work, we examine the role of water molecules in enhancing the stability

formation of K$_2^+$ dimers, thereby modifying the stoichiometric charge of the
system. These findings have potentially significant technological implications
for the consideration of cryptomelane as a Li$^+$/Na$^+$ battery electrode. Our
work establishes the functional role of water in altering the energetics and
structural properties of cryptomelane, an observation that has frequently been

develop a new technique for direct numerical simulations of stratified
turbulence. Since the spatial scale of oceanic internal gravity waves is
typically much larger than that of turbulence, fully incorporating both in a
model would require a high computational cost, and is therefore out of our
scope. Alternatively, we cut out a small domain periodically distorted by an
unresolved large-scale internal wave and locally simulate the energy cascade to
the smallest scales. In this model, even though the Froude number of the outer
wave, $Fr$, is small such that density overturn or shear instability does not
occur, a striped pattern of disturbance is exponentially amplified through a
parametric subharmonic instability. When the disturbance amplitude grows
sufficiently large, secondary instabilities arise and produce much
smaller-scale fluctuations. Passing through these two stages, wave energy is
transferred into turbulence energy and will be eventually dissipated. Different
from the conventional scenarios of vertical shear-induced instabilities, a
large part of turbulent potential energy is supplied from the outer wave and
directly used for mixing. The mixing coefficient $\Gamma=\epsilon_P/\epsilon$,
where $\epsilon$ is the dissipation rate of kinetic energy and $\epsilon_P$ is
that of available potential energy, is always greater than 0.5 and tends to
increase with $Fr$. Although our results are mostly consistent with the
recently proposed scaling relationship between $\Gamma$ and the turbulent
Froude number, $Fr_t$, the values of $\Gamma$ obtained here are larger by a
factor of about two than previously reported.

perspective of efficient spintronics owing to Rashba effect. This effect occurs
as a consequence of strong spin-orbit coupling under noncentrosymmetric
environment, which can be dynamic and/or static. However, there exist intense
debates on the origin of broken inversion symmetry since the halide perovskites
typically crystallize into a centrosymmetric structure. In order to clarify the
issue, we examine both dynamic and static effects in the all-inorganic CsPbBr3
and organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals by
employing temperature- and polarization-dependent photoluminescence excitation
spectroscopy. The perovskite single crystals manifest the dynamic effect by
photon recycling in the indirect Rashba gap, causing dual peaks in the
photoluminescence. But the effect vanishes in CsPbBr3 at low temperatures (< 50
K), accompanied by a striking color change of the crystal, arising presumably
from lower degrees of freedom for inversion symmetry breaking associated with
the thermal motion of the spherical Cs cation, compared with the polar MA
cation in MAPbBr3. We also show that static Rashba effect occurs only in
MAPbBr3 below 90 K due to surface reconstruction via MA-cation ordering, which
likely extends across a few layers from the crystal surface to the interior. We
further demonstrate that this static Rashba effect can be completely suppressed
upon surface treatment with poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) coating. We believe
that our results provide a rationale for the Rashba effects in halide
perovskites.

localize itself in the global map given by the drone. It contains dense mapping
with Elevation Map and software ""Metashape"", map matching with a proposed

localization with particle filter. The approach enables map matching for
cooperative SLAM with the feasibility of multiple scene sensors, varies from
stereo cameras to lidars, and is insensitive to the synchronization of the two
systems. We demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and the speed of the approach
under experiments of the Aero-Ground Dataset.

of Floyd-Hoare logics) are a powerful approach for program reasoning. Recently,
there has been a trend of increasing the expressive power of such logics by
augmenting their rules with additional information to reason about program
side-effects. For example, general program logics have been augmented with cost
analyses, logics for probabilistic computations have been augmented with
estimate measures, and logics for differential privacy with
indistinguishability bounds. In this work, we unify these various approaches
via the paradigm of grading, adapted from the world of functional calculi and
semantics. We propose Graded Hoare Logic (GHL), a parameterisable framework for
augmenting program logics with a preordered monoidal analysis. We develop a
semantic framework for modelling GHL such that grading, logical assertions
(pre- and post-conditions) and the underlying effectful semantics of an
imperative language can be integrated together. Central to our framework is the
notion of a graded category which we extend here, introducing graded Freyd
categories which provide a semantics that can interpret many examples of
augmented program logics from the literature. We leverage coherent fibrations
to model the base assertion language, and thus the overall setting is also
fibrational.

scalability, an energy minimization problem is formed with different behaviors

thickness. While the multipolar edge modes and breathing modes of flat
nanostructures have previously been interpreted using intuitive, analytical
models based on surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes of a thin-film stack, it
has been found that the true dispersion relation of the multipolar edge modes
deviates significantly from the SPP dispersion relation. Here, we developed a
modified intuitive model that uses effective wavelength theory to accurately
model this dispersion relation with significantly less computational overhead
compared to full-wave electromagnetic simulations. However, for the case of
thick nanodisks, this effective wavelength theory breaks down, and such
intuitive models are no longer viable. We found that this is because some modes
of the thick nanodisks carry a polar (i.e. out of the substrate plane, or along
the electron beam direction) dependence and cannot be simply categorized as
radial breathing modes or angular (azimuthal) multipolar edge modes. This polar
dependence leads to radiative losses, motivating the use of simultaneous EELS
and cathodoluminescence measurements when experimentally investigating the
complex mode behavior of thick nanostructures.

relative loss for uniform point pairs to enhance spatial constraint in the

discontinuous regions, which helps preserve the sharpness of estimation
results. Finally, based on analysis of failure cases for prior methods, we
collect a new Hard Case (HC) Depth dataset of challenging scenes, such as
special lighting conditions, dynamic objects, and tilted camera angles. The new

distinguishability is distilled. Motivated by the more general problem of
quantum state discrimination, we consider boxes of a fixed finite number of

objects. In this relation a tuple of positive operators is greater than another
if there is a completely positive trace nonincreasing map under which the image
of the first tuple satisfies certain semidefinite constraints relative to the

testing a composite null hypothesis against a simple alternative hypothesis, as
well as certain error probabilities in state discrimination. We present a
sufficient condition for the existence of catalytic transformations between
boxes, and a characterization of an associated asymptotic preorder, both
expressed in terms of sandwiched R\'enyi divergences. This characterization of

two regimes of internal planetary rotation, that is, when the planet rotates
rigidly and when the rotation of its deep interior is time dependent as a
consequence of a vacillating or intermittent convection in its outer shell. The
model is applied to a sample of very hot Jupiters predicting maximum
transit-time deviations from a constant-period ephemeris of approximately 50
seconds in the case of rigid rotation. The transit time variations of WASP-12,

the disk is heated in the mid-plane by viscous heating due to accretion. We
attribute the near-IR emission lines to scattering by molecules in the upper

instrumentation. Multiple properties of particle beams can be precisely
measured by various optical techniques, which include: direct sampling of
optical radiation emitted from a charged particle beam; monitoring interactions
with an optical probe such as a laserwire; and by electro-optic conversion of
the beam signal with high-bandwidth fibre readout. Such methods are typically
minimally-invasive and non-destructive, thus permitting diagnostics during
accelerator operation without perturbation of the particle beam or risk of
damage to the instrument. These proceedings summarise three CAS lectures that
introduce the basic principles of optics relevant for instrumentation design,
outline the key laser technologies and setups, and review the state-of-the-art

features will vanish and new features will emerge when learning with streams.
Conventional methods usually assume that a label will be revealed after

hold whereas no label will be given at most time steps. A good solution is to
leverage the technique of manifold regularization to utilize the previous
similar data to assist the refinement of the online model. Nevertheless, this
approach needs to store all previous data which is impossible in learning with
streams that arrive sequentially in large volume. Thus we need a buffer to
store part of them. Considering that different devices may have different

storage budget limit. In this paper, we propose a new setting: Storage-Fit
Feature-Evolvable streaming Learning (SF$^2$EL) which incorporates the issue of
rarely-provided labels into feature evolution. Our framework is able to fit its
behavior to different storage budgets when learning with feature evolvable

remains highly controversial. We take advantage of a recently developed SFR
estimator based on the [O II] $\lambda3727$ and [O III] $\lambda5007$ emission
lines to investigate the SFRs of the host galaxies of more than 5,800 type 1
and 7,600 type 2 AGNs with $z < 0.35$. After matching in luminosity and
redshift, we find that type 1 and type 2 AGNs have a similar distribution of
internal reddening, which is significant and corresponds to $\sim
10^9\,M_\odot$ of cold molecular gas. In spite of their comparable gas content,
type 2 AGNs, independent of stellar mass, Eddington ratio, redshift or
molecular gas mass, exhibit intrinsically stronger star formation activity than
type 1 AGNs, in apparent disagreement with the conventional AGN unified model.
We observe a tight, linear relation between AGN luminosity (accretion rate) and
SFR, one that becomes more significant toward smaller physical scales,
suggesting that the link between the AGN and star formation occurs in the
central kpc-scale region. This, along with a correlation between SFR and
Eddington ratio in the regime of super-Eddington accretion, can be interpreted
as evidence that star formation is impacted by positive feedback from the AGN.

properties of a representative sample of 40 z<0.3 Palomar-Green quasars, the

quasars. We find that the AGN luminosity correlates with both the CO luminosity
and black hole mass, suggesting that AGN activity is loosely coupled to the
cold gas reservoir of the host. The observed strong correlation between host
galaxy total infrared luminosity and AGN luminosity arises from their common
dependence on the molecular gas. We argue that the total infrared luminosity,
at least for low-redshift quasars, can be used to derive reliable star
formation rates for the host galaxy. The host galaxies of low-redshift quasars
have molecular gas content similar to that of star-forming galaxies of
comparable stellar mass. Moreover, they share similar gas kinematics, as
evidenced by their CO Tully-Fisher relation and the absence of detectable
molecular outflows down to sensitive limits. There is no sign that AGN feedback
quenches star formation for the quasars in our sample. On the contrary, the
abundant gas supply forms stars prodigiously, at a rate that places most of

evolution of interstellar molecules, and for extracting physical information
from spectroscopic observations of interstellar clouds. The modeling usually
involves handling of a chemical reaction network and solution of a set of
coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which is traditionally done
using code written in compiled languages such as Fortran or C/C++. While being
computationally efficient, there is room for improvement in the ease of use and
interactivity for such an approach. In this work we present a new public code
named Chempl, which emphasizes interactivity in a modern Python environment,
while remaining computationally efficient. Common reaction mechanisms and a
three-phase formulation of gas-grain chemistry are implemented by default. It
is straightforward to run 0D models with Chempl, and only a small amount of
additional code is needed to construct 1D or higher dimensional chemical
models. We demonstrate its usage with a few astrochemically relevant examples.

  Review","ACM / IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering
  and Measurement (ESEM '20), October 8--9, 2020, Bari, Italy",,"10.1145/3382494.3410679",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Medical device development projects must follow proper directives
and regulations to be able to market and sell the end-product in their
respective territories. The regulations describe requirements that seem to be
opposite to efficient software development and short time-to-market. As agile
approaches, like DevOps, are becoming more and more popular in software
industry, a discrepancy between these modern methods and traditional regulated
development has been reported. Although examples of successful adoption in this
context exist, the research is sparse. Aims: The objective of this study is
twofold: to review the current state of DevOps adoption in regulated medical
device environment; and to propose a checklist based on that review for
introducing DevOps in that context. Method: A multivocal literature review is
performed and evidence is synthesized from sources published between 2015 to
March of 2020 to capture the opinions of experts and community in this field.
Results: Our findings reveal that adoption of DevOps in a regulated medical
device environment such as ISO 13485 has its challenges, but potential benefits
may outweigh those in areas such as regulatory, compliance, security,
organizational and technical. Conclusion: DevOps for regulated medical device
environments is a highly appealing approach as compared to traditional methods
and could be particularly suited for regulated medical development. However, an
organization must properly anchor a transition to DevOps in top-level
management and be supportive in the initial phase utilizing professional
coaching and space for iterative learning; as such an initiative is a complex
organizational and technical task.

it to a SIR model with time-dependent coefficients. We then confront the model
with COVID-19 in Denmark, Germany, Italy and France and show that the approach
works rather well in reproducing the data. We also show that a better
understanding of the time dependence of the recovery rate would require

and data formats may be used in rather short terms to gain experiences. We
present a model-driven approach to analyse the quality of research data. It
allows abstracting from the underlying database technology. Based on the
observation that many quality problems show anti-patterns, a data engineer
formulates analysis patterns that are generic concerning the database format
and technology. A domain expert chooses a pattern that has been adapted to a
specific database technology and concretises it for a domain-specific database
format. The resulting concrete patterns are used by data analysts to locate
quality problems in their databases. As proof of concept, we implemented tool
support that realises this approach for XML databases. We evaluated our
approach concerning expressiveness and performance in the domain of cultural

stars, which are believed to be progenitors of double black-hole merger events.
This work aims to quantitatively characterise the steady-state circulation
currents in components of a tidally locked binary system and to explore the
effects of such currents on numerical models. Previous results describing the
circulation in a single rotating star and a binary star are used to deduce a
new prescription for the internal circulation in tidally locked binaries. We
explore the effect of this prescription numerically for binary systems with
primary masses between 25 and 100 solar masses. When comparing circulation
velocities in the radial direction for the single rotating star and binary
star, it is found that the average circulation velocity in the binary star may
be described as an enhancement to the circulation velocity in a single rotating
star. This velocity enhancement is a simple function depending on the masses of
the binary components and amounts to a factor of approximately two when the
components have equal masses. It is found that the ehancement causes the
formation of double helium stars through efficient mixing to occur for systems
with higher initial orbital periods, lower primary masses and lower mass
ratios, compared to the standard circulation scenario. Taking into account
appropriate distributions for primary mass, initial period and mass ratio,
models with enhanced mixing predict 2.4 times more double helium stars being
produced in the parameter space than models without. We conclude that the
effects of companion-induced circulation have strong implications for the
formation of close binary black holes. Not only do the predicted detection
rates increase but double black-hole systems with mass ratios as low as 0.8 may
be formed when companion-induced circulation is taken into account.

since the early 1970s, but one aspect that is noticeably missing from this
literature is the use of Gaussian points (i.e., the zeros of Legendre

approximation errors. Authors in the past have used equally spaced or
nonlinearly distributed collocation points (noticing that the latter can
increase approximation accuracy) but, strangely, have continued to avoid
Gaussian collocation points. Using the methodology and computer routines
provided by Carl de Boor's book A Practical Guide to Splines as a `numerical
laboratory', the present dissertation examines how the use of Gaussian points
can interact with other features such as box size, mesh size and the order of
polynomial approximants to affect the accuracy of approximations to
Schr\""odinger's bound state wave functions for the electron in the hydrogen
atom. We explore whether or not, and under what circumstances, B-spline
collocation at Gaussian points can produce more accurate approximations to
Schr\""odinger's wave functions than equally spaced and nonlinearly distributed
collocation points. We also apply B-spline collocation at Gaussian points to a
Schr\""odinger equation with cubic nonlinearity which has been used extensively
in the past to study nonlinear phenomena. Our computer experiments show that
collocation at Gaussian points can be a highly successful approach for the
hydrogen atom, consistently superior to equally spaced collocation points and
often superior to nonlinearly distributed collocation points. However, we do
encounter some situations, typically when the mesh is quite coarse relative to
the box size for the hydrogen atom, and also in the cubic Schr\""odinger
equation case, in which nonlinearly distributed collocation points perform
better than Gaussian collocation points.

growth with the development of robotics and imaging systems. Innovations in
vision, haptics and accurate movements of robot arms have enabled surgeons to
perform precise minimally invasive surgeries. Real-time semantic segmentation
of the robotic instruments and tissues is a crucial step in robot-assisted
surgery. Accurate and efficient segmentation of the surgical scene not only
aids in the identification and tracking of instruments but also provided
contextual information about the different tissues and instruments being
operated with. For this purpose, we have developed a light-weight cascaded
convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment the surgical instruments from
high-resolution videos obtained from a commercial robotic system. We propose a
multi-resolution feature fusion module (MFF) to fuse the feature maps of
different dimensions and channels from the auxiliary and main branch. We also
introduce a novel way of combining auxiliary loss and adversarial loss to
regularize the segmentation model. Auxiliary loss helps the model to learn
low-resolution features, and adversarial loss improves the segmentation
prediction by learning higher order structural information. The model also
consists of a light-weight spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) unit to aggregate rich
contextual information in the intermediate stage. We show that our model
surpasses existing algorithms for pixel-wise segmentation of surgical
instruments in both prediction accuracy and segmentation time of
high-resolution videos.

measurements is regarded as quantum steering, which can be detected by various
steering criteria. Recently, Mondal et al. [Phys. Rev. A 98, 052330 (2018)]
derived the complementarity relations of coherence steering criteria, and
revealed that the quantum steering of system can be observed through the
average coherence of subsystem. Here, we experimentally verify the
complementarity relations between quantum steering criteria by employing
two-photon Bell-like states and three Pauli operators. The results demonstrate
that if prepared quantum states can violate two setting coherence steering
criteria and turn out to be steerable states, then it cannot violate the
complementary settings criteria. Three measurement settings inequality, which
establish a complementarity relation between these two coherence steering
criteria, always holds in experiment. Besides, we experimentally certify that
the strengths of coherence steering criteria dependent on the choice of
coherence measure. In comparison with two setting coherence steering criteria
based on l1 norm of coherence and relative entropy of coherence, our
experimental results show that the steering criterion based on skew information
of coherence is more stronger in detecting the steerability of quantum states.
Thus, our experimental demonstrations can deepen the understanding of the
relation between the quantum steering and quantum coherence.

proved useful in recent years in describing the different phases of
out-of-equilibrium systems. Here, we investigate the performance of a
compression-based entropy, namely the Computable Information Density (CID),
within the Vicsek model of collective motion. Our entropy is defined through a
crude coarse-graining of the particle positions, in which the key role of
velocities in the model only enters indirectly through the velocity-density
coupling. We discover that such entropy is a valid tool in distinguishing the
various noise regimes, including the crossover between an aligned and
misaligned phase of the velocities, despite the fact that velocities are not
used by this entropy. Furthermore, we unveil the subtle role of the time
coordinate, unexplored in previous studies on the CID: a new encoding recipe,
where space and time locality are both preserved on the same ground, is
demonstrated to reduce the CID. Such an improvement is particularly significant
when working with partial and/or corrupted data, as it is often the case in
real biological experiments.

black hole mass. In this paper, we present the 5 GHz Very Large Array (VLA)
observational results of a sample of 25 extremely high Eddington accreting

one-kiloparsec scale. We estimated the lowest star formation rate surface
density required for producing the observed radio emission, and found it is
higher than the largest value previously detected in circumnuclear starburst
galaxies, implying that the radio emission is from the AGN activity. Along with
a comparison sample, we find an overall inverse radio loudness and Eddington
ratio correlation ranging from sub- to super-Eddington ratios. The
high-Eddington and mildly super-Eddington AGNs (-0.5<log lambda_Edd<0.6) have a
radio to X-ray luminosity ratio L_R/L_X~10^-5 to 10^-4 and a steep radio

Our highly super-Eddington sources (log lambda_Edd>~0.6) have a flatter radio

the biological shielding. However, hidden neutrons can weakly interact with
usual matter, making possible for their detection in the context of low-noise
measurements. In the present work, the novelty rests on a better background
discrimination and the use of a mass of a material - here lead - able to
enhance regeneration of hidden neutrons into visible ones to improve detection.
The input of this new setup is studied using both modelizations and
experiments, thanks to tests currently performed with the experiment at the BR2

  evolutionary game theory analysis of trust in repeated games",,,,,"cs.GT cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The actions of intelligent agents, such as chatbots, recommender systems, and
virtual assistants are typically not fully transparent to the user.
Consequently, using such an agent involves the user exposing themselves to the
risk that the agent may act in a way opposed to the user's goals. It is often
argued that people use trust as a cognitive shortcut to reduce the complexity
of such interactions. Here we formalise this by using the methods of
evolutionary game theory to study the viability of trust-based strategies in
repeated games. These are reciprocal strategies that cooperate as long as the
other player is observed to be cooperating. Unlike classic reciprocal
strategies, once mutual cooperation has been observed for a threshold number of
rounds they stop checking their co-player's behaviour every round, and instead
only check with some probability. By doing so, they reduce the opportunity cost
of verifying whether the action of their co-player was actually cooperative. We
demonstrate that these trust-based strategies can outcompete strategies that
are always conditional, such as Tit-for-Tat, when the opportunity cost is
non-negligible. We argue that this cost is likely to be greater when the
interaction is between people and intelligent agents, because of the reduced
transparency of the agent. Consequently, we expect people to use trust-based
strategies more frequently in interactions with intelligent agents. Our results
provide new, important insights into the design of mechanisms for facilitating
interactions between humans and intelligent agents, where trust is an essential
factor.

anisotropic ferromagnetic exchange interactions. Each spin is also anisotropic
with an uniaxial anisotropy. The site spin on these SMMCs take values $1$,

we carry out a kMC simulation starting with an initial state in which all SMMCs
are completely spin polarized and assembled on a one-dimensional lattice so as
to experience ferromagnetic spin-dipolar interaction with each other. From
these simulations we obtain the relaxation time $\tau_r$ as a function of

different exchange anisotropy, on-site anisotropy and strength of dipolar
interactions. The magnetization relaxation times show non-Arrhenius behaviour
for weak on-site interactions. The energy barrier to magnetization relaxation
increases with increase in on-site anisotropy, exchange anisotropy and strength
of spin dipolar interactions; more strongly on the last parameter. In all cases
the barrier saturates at large on-site anisotropy. The barrier also increases

Our method combines purification and local basis optimization (LBO) as an

the optimal local basis by diagonalizing the local reduced density matrix. By
transforming the state into this basis, one can truncate the local Hilbert
space with a negligible loss of accuracy for a wide range of parameters. In
this work, we focus on the crossover regime between large and small polarons of
the Holstein model. Here, no analytical solution exists and we show that the
thermal expectation values at low temperatures are independent of the phonon
Hilbert space truncation provided the basis is chosen large enough. We then
demonstrate that we can extract the electron spectral function and establish
consistency with results from a finite-temperature Lanczos method. We
additionally calculate the electron emission spectrum and the phonon spectral
function and show that all the computations are significantly simplified by the
local basis optimization. We observe that the electron emission spectrum shifts
spectral weight to both lower frequencies and larger momenta as the temperature
is increased. The phonon spectral function experiences a large broadening and
the polaron peak at large momenta gets significantly flattened and merges
almost completely into the free-phonon peak.

However, large labeled data sets are generally needed for the training and

labeling is expensive, for instance when specific expert knowledge is required.
Active Learning (AL) is one approach to mitigate the problem of limited labeled
data. Through selecting the most informative and representative data instances
for labeling, AL can contribute to more efficient learning of the model. Recent
AL methods for CNNs propose different solutions for the selection of instances
to be labeled. However, they do not perform consistently well and are often
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel AL algorithm that
efficiently learns from unlabeled data by capturing high prediction
uncertainty. By replacing the softmax standard output of a CNN with the

that contribute efficiently to improving model performance during training. We
demonstrate in several experiments with publicly available data that our method
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art AL approaches. It can be easily

does not emerge by itself. Instead, we need both design techniques to create
intelligent systems, as well as approaches to validate their correct behavior.
An example of intelligent systems that could benefit smart cities are
self-driving vehicles. Self-driving vehicles are continuously becoming both
commercially available and common on roads. Accidents involving self-driving
vehicles, however, have raised concerns about their reliability. Due to these
concerns, the safety of self-driving vehicles should be thoroughly tested
before they can be released into traffic. To ensure that self-driving vehicles
encounter all possible scenarios, several millions of hours of testing must be
carried out; therefore, testing self-driving vehicles in the real world is
impractical. There is also the issue that testing self-driving vehicles
directly in the traffic poses a potential safety hazard to human drivers. To
tackle this challenge, validation frameworks for testing self-driving vehicles
in simulated scenarios are being developed by academia and industry. In this
chapter, we briefly introduce self-driving vehicles and give an overview of
validation frameworks for testing them in a simulated environment. We conclude
by discussing what an ideal validation framework at the state of the art should
be and what could benefit validation frameworks for self-driving vehicles in
the future.

modules are simple yet effective and can be flexibly added to any existing
segmentation network without excessively increasing time and space complexity.
We evaluate the proposed method on the 2017 MICCAI Automated Cardiac Diagnosis

show that the absorbed energy grows with increasing the nanoparticle density

collective heating effects depend on the size and density of nanoparticles,
which can further be used to modulate the photothermal process.

susceptibility) of layered ferroelectric-dielectric junction, biased by the
time-dependent harmonic voltage with single frequency $\omega$. Working point
is stabilized, by the charge boundary condition between the layers, in the
region with negative electric capacitance. The static susceptibility $\chi_0$
is negative and relative dielectric constant $\epsilon_r$ smaller than one,
clearly indicating the opposite direction of electric field and polarization in
the ferroelectric layer due to the negative electric capacitance. At finite
frequencies this sign is preserved in real part of susceptibility which gains
the frequency dependence. Also, frequency dependent imaginary part arises due
to the phase shift between electric field and polarization. The type of that
frequency dependence in linear regime is so-called relaxation (Debye) response,
i.e. $\chi'(\omega)=\chi_0/(1+(\tau \omega)^2)$ and $\chi""(\omega)=\chi_0\tau
\omega/(1+(\tau \omega)^2)$, where $\tau$ is polarization switching time
characteristic to ferroelectric material. In particular, we modeled the
junction of ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and dielectric Al$_2$O$_3$, taking the
experimental values of material parameters, and addressed the role of
nonlinearity with respect to result of the linear response theory.

between DNN algorithms, memory hierarchy, and dataflow. However, owing to the
large degrees of freedom in the design space, finding an optimal solution
through the implementation of individual design points becomes infeasible.
Recently, several estimation frameworks for fast design space exploration (DSE)
have emerged, yet they either suffer from long runtimes or a limited
exploration space. This work introduces ZigZag, a memory-centric rapid DNN
accelerator DSE framework which extends the DSE with uneven mapping
opportunities, in which operands at shared memory levels are no longer bound to
use the same memory levels for each loop index. For this, ZigZag uses a
memory-centric nested-for-loop format as a uniform representation to integrate
algorithm, accelerator, and algorithm-to-accelerator mapping, and consists of
three key components: 1) a latency-enhanced analytical Hardware Cost Estimator,
2) a Temporal Mapping Generator that supports even/uneven scheduling on any
type of memory hierarchy, and 3) an Architecture Generator that explores the
whole memory hierarchy design space. Benchmarking experiments against existing
frameworks, together with three case studies at different design abstraction
levels show the strength of ZigZag. Up to 33% more energy-efficient solutions
are found by introducing ZigZag's uneven scheduling opportunities.

lines, which are ubiquitous in magnetized plasmas. As the core structure of
various eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere, flux ropes hold the key to
understanding the physical mechanisms of solar eruptions, which impact the
heliosphere and planetary atmospheres. Strongest disturbances in the Earth's
space environments are often associated with large-scale flux ropes from the
Sun colliding with the Earth's magnetosphere, leading to adverse, sometimes
catastrophic, space-weather effects. However, it remains elusive as to how a
flux rope forms and evolves toward eruption, and how it is structured and
embedded in the ambient field. The present paper addresses these important
questions by reviewing current understandings of coronal flux ropes from an
observer's perspective, with emphasis on their structures and nascent evolution
toward solar eruptions, as achieved by combining observations of both remote
sensing and in-situ detection with modeling and simulation. It highlights an
initiation mechanism for coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in which plasmoids in
current sheets coalesce into a `seed' flux rope whose subsequent evolution into
a CME is consistent with the standard model, thereby bridging the gap between
microscale and macroscale dynamics.

a new class of convolutional blocks that can serve as an alternative to the 3D
convolutional layer and its variants in 3D CNNs. An STFT block consists of
non-trainable convolution layers that capture spatially and/or temporally local
Fourier information using a STFT kernel at multiple low frequency points,
followed by a set of trainable linear weights for learning channel
correlations. The STFT blocks significantly reduce the space-time complexity in
3D CNNs. In general, they use 3.5 to 4.5 times less parameters and 1.5 to 1.8
times less computational costs when compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, their feature learning capabilities are significantly better than
the conventional 3D convolutional layer and its variants. Our extensive
evaluation on seven action recognition datasets, including Something-something

outburst of MAXI J1727-203 using NICER observations. The outburst lasted
approximately four months. Spectral modelling in the 0.3-10 keV band shows the
presence of both a soft thermal and a hard Comptonised component. The analysis
of these components shows that MAXI J1727-203 evolved through the soft,
intermediate and hard spectral states during the outburst. We find that the
soft (disc) component was detected throughout almost the entire outburst, with
temperatures ranging from ~0.4 keV, at the moment of maximum luminosity, to
~0.1 keV near the end of the outburst. The power spectrum in the hard and
intermediate states shows broadband noise up to 20 Hz, with no evidence of
quasi-periodic oscillations. We also study the rms spectra of the broadband
noise at 0.3-10 keV of this source. We find that the fractional rms increases
with energy in most of the outburst except during the hard state, where the
fractional rms remains approximately constant with energy. We also find that,
below 3 keV, the fractional rms follows the same trend generally observed at
energies >3 keV, a behaviour known from previous studies of black holes and
neutron stars. The spectral and timing evolution of MAXI J1727-203, as
parametrised by the hardness-intensity, hardness-rms, and rms-intensity
diagrams, suggest that the system hosts a black hole, although we could not
rule out a neutron star.

for nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems. We investigate the well-posedness of
the regularization. Compared to the case where $\alpha>\beta\geq0$, the results
for the case $\alpha=\beta\geq0$ are weaker due to the lack of coercivity and
Radon-Riesz property of the regularization term. Under certain condition on the
nonlinearity of $F$, we prove that every minimizer of $ \alpha\|

case $\alpha>\beta\geq0$, if the exact solution is sparse, we derive
convergence rate $O(\delta^{\frac{1}{2}})$ and $O(\delta)$ of the regularized
solution under two commonly adopted conditions on the nonlinearity of $F$,
respectively. In particular, it is shown that the iterative soft thresholding
algorithm can be utilized to solve the $ \alpha\| \cdot\|_{\ell_1}-\beta\|

present a temperature-dependent, implicit solvent, sequence-specific
coarse-grained (CG) simulation model that reproduces the transition
temperatures as a function of sequence length and guest residue identity of

generate feature sequences from the vertical segments to preserve the
bottom-to-top feature relationships in the epithelium image data; 2) an
attention-based fusion network image-level classifier predicting the final CIN

cases. Yet, researchers had little to no historical information about the
pandemic at their disposal in order to inform their forecasting methods. Our
work studies the predictive performance of models at various stages of the
pandemic to better understand their fundamental uncertainty and the impact of
data availability on such forecasts. We use historical data of COVID-19
infections from 253 regions from the period of 22nd January 2020 until 22nd
June 2020 to predict, through a rolling window backtesting framework, the
cumulative number of infected cases for the next 7 and 28 days. We implement
three simple models to track the root mean squared logarithmic error in this
6-month span, a baseline model that always predicts the last known value of the
cumulative confirmed cases, a power growth model and an epidemiological model
called SEIRD. Prediction errors are substantially higher in early stages of the
pandemic, resulting from limited data. Throughout the course of the pandemic,
errors regress slowly, but steadily. The more confirmed cases a country
exhibits at any point in time, the lower the error in forecasting future
confirmed cases. We emphasize the significance of having a rigorous backtesting
framework to accurately assess the predictive power of such models at any point
in time during the outbreak which in turn can be used to assign the right level
of certainty to these forecasts and facilitate better planning.

differences affecting the comparison of simulations with observations. To this
aim, we analyzed a set of 24 realistically simulated MoRIA (Models of Realistic

constructed ""observed"" color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the simulated dwarf
galaxies in the typically used V- and I-bands. Then we used the CMD-fitting
method to recover their star-formation histories (SFHs) from their observed
CMDs. These solved SFHs were then directly compared to the true SFHs from the
simulation star-particle data, mainly in terms of the star-formation rate(SFR)
and the age-metallicity relation (AMR). We applied a dust extinction
prescription to the simulation data to produce observed CMDs affected by dust
in star-formation regions. Since future facilities, such as the JWST and E-ELT
will focus on the near IR rather than the optical, we also constructed and
analyzed CMDs using the I- and H-bands. We find a very good agreement between
the recovered and the true SFHs of all the simulated dwarf galaxies in our
sample, from the synthetic CMD analysis of their V-I versus I as well as the
I-H versus H CMDs. Dust leads to an underestimation of the SFR during the last
few hundred million years. Overall, our analysis indicates that quantities like
SFR and AMR derived from the photometric observations of galaxies are directly
comparable to their simulated counterparts.

that provide recipes to construct Nystrom approximations with variable
accuracies and computing times. This paper proposes a scalable Nystrom-based

cosmological analysis of large galaxy surveys. Anisotropic two-point clustering
measurements from the same simulation show some scatter for different lines of
sight (LOS), but are on average equal, due to cosmic variance. This results in
scatter in the measured cosmological parameters. We use the OuterRim N-body
simulation halo catalogue to investigate this, considering the 3 simulation
axes as LOS. The quadrupole of the 2-point statistics is particularly sensitive
to changes in the LOS, with sub-percent level differences in the velocity
distributions resulting in ~1.5$\sigma$ shifts on large scales. Averaging over
multiple LOS can reduce the impact of cosmic variance. We derive an expression
for the Gaussian cross-covariance between the power spectrum multipole
measurements, for any two LOS, including shot noise, and the corresponding
reduction in variance in the average measurement. Quadrupole measurements are
anti-correlated, and for three orthogonal LOS, the variance on the average
measurement is reduced by more than 1/3. We perform a Fisher analysis to
predict the corresponding gain in precision on the cosmological parameter
measurements, which we compare against a set of 300 extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) emission line galaxy (ELG) EZmocks. The gain in
$f\sigma_8$, which measures the growth of structure, is also better than 1/3.
Averaging over multiple LOS in future mock challenges will allow the RSD models
to be constrained with the same systematic error, with less than 3 times the

for the finite-size boundary effects and at the same time allows the extraction

optimized performance. However, the use of inverse design for plasmonic
structures has been challenging due to local field concentrations that can lead
to errors in gradient calculation when the continuum adjoint method is used. On
the other hand, with the discrete adjoint method one can achieve the exact
gradient. Historically the discrete version is exclusively used with a Finite
Element model, and applying the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method in
inverse design of plasmonic structures is rarely attempted. Due to the
popularity of using FDTD in simulating plasmonic structures, we integrate the
discrete adjoint method with FDTD and present a framework to carry out inverse
design of plasmonic structures using density-based topology optimization. We
demonstrate the exactness of the gradient calculation for a plasmonic block
structure with varying permittivity. Another challenge that is unique with
plasmonic structures is that non-physical amplification caused by poorly chosen
material interpolation can destroy a stable convergence of the optimization. To
avoid this, we adopt a non-linear material interpolation scheme in the FDTD
solver. In addition, filtering-and-projection regularization is incorporated to
ensure manufacturability of the designed structures. As an example of this
framework, successful reconstruction of electric fields of a plasmonic bowtie
aperture is presented.

different kinds of detectors with good spatial resolution and high rate

Typically GEM is made up of a thin polyimide foil having a thickness of 50
micrometers with 5 micrometers copper cladding on top and bottom sides. The
presence of polyimide changes the gain of the detector under the influence of
external radiation and the phenomenon is referred to as the charging up effect.
The charging up effect is investigated with a double mask triple GEM detector

geometric fibers are Tate. Using Voevodsky's motives with rational
coefficients, the formula is valid for an arbitrary regular base $S$, without
assuming the existence of a base field or even of a prime integer $\ell$
invertible on $S$. This result, and some of Bondarko' ideas, lead us to a
generalized formulation of Corti-Hanamura's conjecture. Secondly we establish
the existence of the motivic decomposition when $f:X \rightarrow S$ is a
projective quadric bundle over a characteristic $0$ base, which is either
sufficiently general or whose discriminant locus is a normal crossing divisor.
This provides a motivic lift of the Bernstein-Beilinson-Deligne decomposition

on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) machine learning methodology. The
potential is based on a training set of configurations collected from density
functional theory (DFT) simulations and is capable of treating bulk and
multilayer hBN as well as nanotubes of arbitrary chirality. The developed force
field faithfully reproduces the potential energy surface predicted by DFT while
improving the efficiency by several orders of magnitude. We test our potential
by comparing formation energies, geometrical properties, phonon dispersion
spectra and mechanical properties with respect to benchmark DFT calculations
and experiments. In addition, we use our model and a recently developed
graphene-GAP to analyse and compare thermally and mechanically induced rippling
in large scale two-dimensional (2D) hBN and graphene. Both materials show
almost identical scaling behaviour with an exponent of $\eta \approx 0.85$ for
the height fluctuations agreeing well with the theory of flexible membranes.
Based on its lower resistance to bending, however, hBN experiences slightly
larger out-of-plane deviations both at zero and finite applied external strain.
Upon compression a phase transition from incoherent ripple motion to
soliton-ripples is observed for both materials. Our potential is freely

been extensively studied during the past decade. Meanwhile, such techniques can
be extremely time-consuming due to manipulation of the program code to
fabricate a large number of patches and also repeated executions of tests on
patches to identify potential fixes. PraPR, a recent G&V APR technique, reduces
these costs by modifying program code directly at the level of compiled
bytecode, and further performing on-the-fly patching by allowing multiple
patches to be tested within the same JVM session. However, PraPR is limited due
to its pattern-based, bytecode-level nature and it is basically
unsound/imprecise as it assumes that patch executions do not change global JVM
state and affect later patch executions on the same JVM session. Inspired by
the PraPR work, we propose a unified patch validation framework, named UniAPR,
which aims to speed up the patch validation for both bytecode and source-code
APR via on-the-fly patching; furthermore, UniAPR addresses the imprecise patch
validation issue by resetting the JVM global state via runtime bytecode
transformation. We have implemented UniAPR as a fully automated Maven Plugin.
We have also performed the first study of on-the-fly patch validation for
state-of-the-art source-code-level APR. Our experiments show the first
empirical evidence that vanilla on-the-fly patch validation can be
imprecise/unsound; in contrast, our UniAPR framework can speed up
state-of-the-art APR by over an order of magnitude without incurring any
imprecision in patch validation, enabling all existing APR techniques to
explore a larger search space to fix more bugs in the near future. Furthermore,
UniAPR directly enables hybrid source and bytecode APR to fix substantially
more bugs than all state-of-the-art APR techniques (under the same time limit)
in the near future.

the temporal response is governed by thermal conductive dynamics. By properly
engineering the optical pulse, we prospect switching times of nanoseconds with
an energy consumption of a few nanojoules. Our results unveil a new temporal

its vulnerability against presentation attacks poses a significant security
threat. Though presentation attack detection (PAD) methods try to address this

propose a new framework for PAD using a one-class classifier, where the
representation used is learned with a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural
Network (MCCNN). A novel loss function is introduced, which forces the network
to learn a compact embedding for bonafide class while being far from the
representation of attacks. A one-class Gaussian Mixture Model is used on top of
these embeddings for the PAD task. The proposed framework introduces a novel
approach to learn a robust PAD system from bonafide and available (known)
attack classes. This is particularly important as collecting bonafide data and
simpler attacks are much easier than collecting a wide variety of expensive
attacks. The proposed system is evaluated on the publicly available WMCA
multi-channel face PAD database, which contains a wide variety of 2D and 3D
attacks. Further, we have performed experiments with MLFP and SiW-M datasets
using RGB channels only. Superior performance in unseen attack protocols shows
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Software, data, and protocols to

phases with a series of geometric shapes are studied using the compressible
liquid-drop (CLD) model, where nuclear matter separates into a dense liquid
phase of nucleons and a dilute gas phase of nucleons and $\alpha$ particles.
The equilibrium conditions for two coexisting phases are derived by
minimization of the total free energy including the surface and Coulomb
contributions, which are clearly different from the Gibbs conditions for phase
equilibrium due to the finite-size effects. Compared to the results considering
only spherical nuclei, the inclusion of pasta phases can delay the transition
to uniform matter and enlarge the region of nonuniform matter in the phase
diagram. The thermodynamic quantities obtained in the present calculation with
the CLD model are consistent with those in the realistic equation of state
table for astrophysical simulations using the Thomas--Fermi approximation. It
is found that the density ranges of various pasta shapes depend on both the
temperature $T$ and the proton fraction $Y_p$. Furthermore, the nuclear
symmetry energy and its density dependence may play crucial roles in
determining the properties of pasta phases. Our results suggest that the pasta
phase diagram is most sensitively dependent on the symmetry energy slope $L$
especially in the low-$Y_p$ and high-$T$ region.

proposed method is thoroughly evaluated over several challenging datasets

  Non-Orthogonal Massive Access","Submitted for publication",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In massive connectivity scenarios with short packets, of interest is the
regime where users share wireless resources in a non-orthogonal fashion. Small
payloads combined with sporadic user activation call for approaches that
jointly address the users access to the shared resources and the design of the
channel code. In this paper, we propose a transmission scheme that combines
sparse signatures with finite-length forward error correction (FEC) coding for
non-orthogonal massive access. Our signature design is based on Euler squares,
which are special instances of quasi-cyclic partial geometries that yield
sparse graphs with favorable decoding properties. Following a graph-theoretic
approach, we explicate the benefits of the coding scheme for the receiver
processing that involves joint user detection and decoding. The proposed
construction is flexible and can be explicitly characterized for a large number
of combinations of system parameters, suitable for both grant-based and
grant-free massive access. Finally, unlike common existing schemes, our scheme
can be applied to unsourced random access (U-RA). We numerically characterize
the trade-off between system parameters such as number of users, load and
channel coding rate. The performance evaluation against the state of the art
illustrates the potential of the scheme to provide an energy-efficient solution
for U-RA.

performance over similar models acting on either color images or on a
combination of different modalities (visible, NIR, thermal and depth), as well
as on a SVM-based classifier acting on SWIR image differences. Experiments have
been carried on a new public and freely available database, containing a wide

become nearly insensitive to the $d_\perp=d-d_\parallel$ uninformative

\sqrt{p}$, where $p$ is the size of the training set. We quantify the benefit
of such a compression on the test error $\epsilon$. For large initialization of
the weights (the lazy training regime), no compression occurs and for regular
boundaries separating labels we find that $\epsilon \sim p^{-\beta}$, with
$\beta_\text{Lazy} = d / (3d-2)$. Compression improves the learning curves so
that $\beta_\text{Feature} = (2d-1)/(3d-2)$ if $d_\parallel = 1$ and
$\beta_\text{Feature} = (d + d_\perp/2)/(3d-2)$ if $d_\parallel > 1$. We test
these predictions for a stripe model where boundaries are parallel interfaces

we show that compression shapes the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) evolution in

this method for determining SMBH masses using polarization in broad emission

We find that polarization states of H${\alpha}$ and H${\beta}$ lines are almost

polarization angle ${\varphi}$ exhibits an additional ""plateau"" with a constant
${\varphi}$, which deviates than the profiles expected for pure Keplerian
motion. SMBH mass estimates using Mg II line are higher by up to 35% than those

existence of a compact source with a mass of about $4\times 10^6 M_\odot$,
traditionally assumed to be a massive black hole (BH). Important for any model
is the explanation of the multiyear, accurate astrometric data of S2 and the
challenging G2: its post-pericenter velocity decelerates faster than expected
from a Keplerian orbit around the putative BH. This has been reconciled in the
literature by acting on G2 a drag force by an accretion flow. Alternatively, we
show that the S2 and G2 motion is explained by the ""core-halo"" fermionic dark
matter (DM) profile of the fully-relativistic Ruffini-Arg\""uelles-Rueda (RAR)
model. It has been already shown that for 48-345 keV fermions, it accurately
fits the rotation curves of the Milky-Way halo. We here show that, for a
fermion mass of 56 keV, it explains the time-dependent data of the position
(orbit) and light-of-sight radial velocity (redshift function $z$) of S2 and
G2, the latter without a drag force. We find the RAR model fits better the
data: the mean of reduced chi-squares of the orbit and $z$ data are, for S2,
$\langle\bar{\chi}^2\rangle_{\rm S2, RAR}\approx 3.1$ and
$\langle\bar{\chi}^2\rangle_{\rm S2, BH}\approx 3.3$ while, for G2,
$\langle\bar{\chi}^2\rangle_{\rm G2, RAR}\approx 20$ and
$\langle\bar{\chi}^2\rangle_{\rm G2, BH}\approx 41$. For S2 the fits of the $z$
data are comparable, $\bar{\chi}^2_{z,\rm RAR}\approx 1.28$ and
$\bar{\chi}^2_{z,\rm BH}\approx 1.04$, for G2 only the RAR model fits,
$\bar{\chi}^2_{z,\rm RAR}\approx 1.0$ and $\bar{\chi}^2_{z,\rm BH}\approx 26$.
In addition, the critical mass for the gravitational collapse of a degenerate
56 keV-fermion DM core into a BH is $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$, which may be the
initial seed for the formation of the observed central supermassive BH in
active galaxies, such as M87.

incentivized with voluntary transaction fees and fixed block rewards which will
halve gradually to zero. In the setting where optional and arbitrary
transaction fee becomes the remaining incentive, Carlsten et al.\ [CCS~2016]
find that an undercutting attack can become the equilibrium strategy for
miners. In undercutting, the attacker deliberately forks an existing chain by
leaving wealthy transactions unclaimed to attract petty complaint miners to its
fork. We observe that two simplifying assumptions in [CCS~2016] of fees
arriving at fixed rates and miners collecting {\em all} accumulated fees
regardless of block size limit are often infeasible in practice and find that
they are inaccurately inflating the profitability of undercutting. Studying
Bitcoin and Monero blockchain data, we find that the fees deliberately left out
by an undercutter may not be attractive to other miners (hence to the attacker
itself): the deliberately left out transactions may not fit into a new block
without ""squeezing out"" some other to-be transactions, and thus claimable fees
in the next round cannot be raised arbitrarily.
  This work views undercutting and shifting among chains rationally as mining
strategies of rational miners. We model profitability of undercutting strategy
with block size limit present, which bounds the claimable fees in a round and
gives rise to a pending (cushion) transaction set. In the proposed model, we
first identify the conditions necessary to make undercutting profitable. We
then present an easy-to-deploy defense against undercutting by selectively
assembling transactions into the new block to invalidate the identified
conditions. Under a typical setting with undercutters present, applying this
avoidance technique is a Nash Equilibrium. Finally, we complement the above
analytical results with experiments.

This phenomenon is now expected to be employed in a variety of devices for
applications ranging from quantum communication to dark matter detection. To be
successful, most of these applications require a vast control of the coupling
strength, resulting in intensive efforts to understanding coupling by a variety
of different approaches. Here, the electromagnetic properties of both resonator
and magnetic samples are investigated to provide a comprehensive understanding
of the coupling between these two systems. Because the coupling is a
consequence of the excitation vector fields, which directly interact with
magnetisation dynamics, a highly-accurate electromagnetic perturbation theory
is employed which allows for predicting the resonant hybrid mode frequencies
for any field configuration within the cavity resonator, without any fitting
parameters. The coupling is shown to be strongly dependent not only on the
excitation vector fields and sample's magnetic properties but also on the
sample's shape. These findings are illustrated by applying the theoretical
framework to two distinct experiments: a magnetic sphere placed in a

optical transitions between magnetic sublevels of hyperfine levels, excited
with $\sigma^+$, $\pi$ and $\sigma^-$ polarized light, for the $D_1$ and $D_2$
lines of $^{87}$Rb and $^{85}$Rb atoms. Depending on the type of transition and
the quantum numbers of involved levels, the Hamiltonian matrices are of
$1\times 1$, $2\times 2$, $3\times 3$ or $4\times 4$ dimension. As an example,
analytical expressions are presented for the case of $2\times 2$ dimension
matrices for $D_1$ line of both isotopes. Eigenvalues and eigenkets are given,
and the expression for the transition intensity as a function of $B$ has been
determined. It is found that some $\pi$ transitions of $^{87}$Rb and $^{85}$Rb
get completely canceled for certain, extremely precise, values of $B$. No
cancellation occurs for $\sigma^+$ or $\sigma^-$ transitions of $D_1$ line. For
matrices with size over $2\times 2$, analytical formulas are heavy, and we have
performed numerical calculations. All the $B$ values cancelling $\sigma^+$,
$\pi$ and $\sigma^-$ transitions of $D_1$ and $D_2$ lines of $^{87}$Rb and
$^{85}$Rb are calculated, with an accuracy limited by the precision of the
involved physical quantities. We believe our modeling can serve as a tool for
determination of standardized values of magnetic field. The experimental
implementation feasibility and its possible outcome are addressed. We believe
the experimental realization will allow to increase precision of the physical
quantities involved, in particular the upper state atomic levels energy.

Because the prograde spin rate around the principal axis of inertia is not
bounded from above, it can accidentally reach the threshold value corresponding
to rotational break-up. Previous investigations of this process were limited to
integrations of $\sim 10^3$ orbits because of the stiff equation of motion. We
present here a fast 1D simulation method to compute the evolution of this spin
rate over $\sim 10^9$ orbits. We apply the method to the most eccentric solar
system asteroid known, 2006 HY51 (with $e = 0.9684$), and find that for any
reasonably expected shape parameters, it can never be accelerated to break-up
speed. However, primordial solar system asteroids on more eccentric orbits may
have already broken up from this type of rotational fission. The method also
represents a promising opportunity to investigate the long-term evolution of
extremely eccentric triaxial exo-asteroids ($e > 0.99$), which are thought to

These medical modalities give information about different diseases.
Complementary information is offered by CT and MRI. CT provides the best

compares five variations of the wavelet transform implemented separately in

the set of different types of disturbances, including parameter perturbation,
measurement noise, and immeasurably external variables, by an extended state
method. Kalman-Bucy filter is then applied to accurately estimate the state
information of the extended DG model. In addition, based on the accurate
estimation, a fast terminal sliding mode (FTSM) surface with terminal
attractors is designed to maintain the system stability and accelerate the
convergence of consensus tracking, which significantly improves the performance
of secondary voltage control under both normal and plug-and-play operation.
Finally, case studies are conducted in both MATLAB/Simulink and an experimental

Given a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ with edge weights in $\{1, 2, \dots, M\}$, we

given vertices $u,v\in V$ and a failed vertex or edge $f\in (V\cup E)$, output
the length of the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ that does not go through $f$.
Our main result is a simple DSO with $\tilde{O}(n^{2.7233}M)$ preprocessing
time and $O(1)$ query time. Moreover, if the input graph is undirected, the
preprocessing time can be improved to $\tilde{O}(n^{2.6865}M)$. The
preprocessing algorithm is randomized with correct probability $\ge 1-1/n^C$,
for a constant $C$ that can be made arbitrarily large. Previously, there is a
DSO with $\tilde{O}(n^{2.8729}M)$ preprocessing time and
$\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ query time [Chechik and Cohen, STOC'20].
  At the core of our DSO is the following observation from [Bernstein and

$Q$, then we can construct a DSO with preprocessing time $P+\tilde{O}(n^2)\cdot

Passing Interface (MPI) plus Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) programming account
for its popularity. Nevertheless, strong programming efforts are required to
gain performance benefits from the MPI+OpenMP code. An emerging hybrid method
that combines MPI and the MPI shared memory model (MPI+MPI) is promising.
However, writing an efficient hybrid MPI+MPI program -- especially when the
collective communication operations are involved -- is not to be taken for
granted.
  In this paper, we propose a new design method to implement hybrid MPI+MPI
context-based collective communication operations. Our method avoids on-node
memory replications (on-node communication overheads) that are required by
semantics in pure MPI. We also offer wrapper primitives hiding all the design
details from users, which comes with practices on how to structure hybrid
MPI+MPI code with these primitives. The micro-benchmarks show that our
collectives are comparable or superior to those in pure MPI context. We have
further validated the effectiveness of the hybrid MPI+MPI model (which uses our
wrapper primitives) in three computational kernels, by comparison to the pure
MPI and hybrid MPI+OpenMP models.

low-quality antenna, significantly limiting communication range and link
quality. In particular, these antennas are typically linearly polarized and
therefore susceptible to polarization mismatch, which can easily cause 10-15
dBm of link loss on communication to and from such devices. In this work, we
highlight this under-appreciated issue and propose the augmentation of IoT
deployment environments with programmable, RF-sensitive surfaces made of
metamaterials. Our smart meta-surface mitigates polarization mismatch by
rotating the polarization of signals that pass through or reflect off the
surface. We integrate our metasurface into an IoT network as LAMA, a Low-power
Lattice of Actuated Metasurface Antennas, designed for the pervasively used 2.4
GHz ISM band. We optimize LAMA's metasurface design for both low transmission
loss and low cost, to facilitate deployment at scale. We then build an
end-to-end system that actuates the metasurface structure to optimize for link
performance in real time. Our experimental prototype-based evaluation
demonstrates gains in link power of up to 15 dBm, and wireless capacity
improvements of 100 and 180 Kbit/s/Hz in through-surface and surface-reflective
scenarios, respectively, attributable to the polarization rotation properties
of LAMA'S metasurface.

large, for waves that reach large amplitudes as they travel away from the star,

conversion efficiency is reduced due to dephasing on subsequent passages and
considerable Alfv\'{e}n power on the closed field lines remains. Thus while
some leakage into the fast mode happens, we need detailed understanding of the

that over two-thirds of articles matching a simple keyword search were
irrelevant. We examine coverage of each taxa in different regions, and find
that elephants, rhinos, tigers, and lions receive the most coverage, with daily

saiga for which it was neutral. Coverage was broadly distributed, with articles

multi-resource allocation problem with heterogeneous demands and Leontief
utilities. Unlike existing settings, we allow each agent to specify
requirements to only accept allocations from a subset of the total supply for
each resource. These requirements can take form in location constraints (e.g. A
hospital can only accept volunteers who live nearby due to commute
limitations). This can also model a type of substitution effect where some
agents need 1 unit of resource A \emph{or} B, both belonging to the same

We propose a new mechanism called Dominant Resource Fairness with Meta Types

strategy-proofness, and a notion of sharing incentive for our setting. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to study this problem formulation,

arise in real life situations. Finally, we show numerically that our method
scales better to large problems than alternative approaches.

Based on such a motivation, in the training process, we measure the consistency
between forward and backward trajectories to learn a robust tracker from

correlation filter network, and propose a multi-frame validation scheme and a
cost-sensitive loss to facilitate unsupervised learning. Without bells and

classic fully supervised trackers while achieving a real-time speed.
Furthermore, our unsupervised framework exhibits a potential in leveraging more

where we have aggregated the outputs from two different encoders and their
different scales to obtain the final prediction probability. We train and test
the proposed CVR-Net on three different datasets, where the images have

  Neural Networks","Master's thesis at EPFL",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, we disentangle the generalized Gauss-Newton and approximate
inference for Bayesian deep learning. The generalized Gauss-Newton method is an
optimization method that is used in several popular Bayesian deep learning
algorithms. Algorithms that combine the Gauss-Newton method with the Laplace
and Gaussian variational approximation have recently led to state-of-the-art
results in Bayesian deep learning. While the Laplace and Gaussian variational
approximation have been studied extensively, their interplay with the
Gauss-Newton method remains unclear. Recent criticism of priors and posterior
approximations in Bayesian deep learning further urges the need for a deeper
understanding of practical algorithms. The individual analysis of the
Gauss-Newton method and Laplace and Gaussian variational approximations for
neural networks provides both theoretical insight and new practical algorithms.
We find that the Gauss-Newton method simplifies the underlying probabilistic
model significantly. In particular, the combination of the Gauss-Newton method
with approximate inference can be cast as inference in a linear or Gaussian
process model. The Laplace and Gaussian variational approximation can
subsequently provide a posterior approximation to these simplified models. This
new disentangled understanding of recent Bayesian deep learning algorithms also
leads to new methods: first, the connection to Gaussian processes enables new
function-space inference algorithms. Second, we present a marginal likelihood
approximation of the underlying probabilistic model to tune neural network
hyperparameters. Finally, the identified underlying models lead to different
methods to compute predictive distributions. In fact, we find that these
prediction methods for Bayesian neural networks often work better than the
default choice and solve a common issue with the Laplace approximation.

of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for brain tumor segmentation with a low
computation requirement. The system consists of a CNN for the main processing
for the segmentation, a pre-CNN block for data reduction and post-CNN
refinement block. The unique CNN consists of 7 convolution layers involving
only 108 kernels and 20308 trainable parameters. It is custom-designed,
following the proposed paradigm of ASCNN (application specific CNN), to perform
mono-modality and cross-modality feature extraction, tumor localization and
pixel classification. Each layer fits the task assigned to it, by means of (i)
appropriate normalization applied to its input data, (ii) correct convolution
modes for the assigned task, and (iii) suitable nonlinear transformation to
optimize the convolution results. In this specific design context, the number
of kernels in each of the 7 layers is made to be just-sufficient for its task,
instead of exponentially growing over the layers, to increase information
density and to reduce randomness in the processing. The proposed activation
function Full-ReLU helps to halve the number of kernels in convolution layers
of high-pass filtering without degrading processing quality. A large number of
experiments with BRATS2018 dataset have been conducted to measure the
processing quality and reproducibility of the proposed system. The results
demonstrate that the system reproduces reliably almost the same output to the
same input after retraining. The mean dice scores for enhancing tumor, whole
tumor and tumor core are 77.2%, 89.2% and 76.3%, respectively. The simple
structure and reliable high processing quality of the proposed system will
facilitate its implementation and medical applications.

quantitative changes in subcellular structure, i.e., size and thickness,
remains elusive. We present an integrated chip-based optical nanoscopy set-up
that provides a lateral optical resolution of 61 nm combined with a highly
sensitive quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) system with a spatial phase
sensitivity of $\pm$20 mrad. We use the system to obtain the 3D morphology of
liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) combined with super-resolved spatial
information. LSECs have a unique morphology with nanopores that are present in
the plasma membrane, called fenestration. The fenestrations are grouped in
clusters called sieve plates, which are around 100 nm thick. Thus, imaging and
quantification of fenestration and sieve plate thickness requires resolution
and sensitivity of sub-100 nm along both lateral and axial directions. In the
chip-based nanoscope, the optical waveguides are used both for hosting and
illuminating the sample. A strong evanescent field is generated on top of the
waveguide surface for single molecule fluorescence excitation. The fluorescence
signal is captured by an upright microscope, which is converted into a
Linnik-type interferometer to sequentially acquire both super-resolved images
and quantitative phase information of the sample. The multi-modal microscope
provided an estimate of the fenestration diameter of 124$\pm$41 nm and revealed
the average estimated thickness of the sieve plates in the range of
91.2$\pm$43.5 nm for two different cells. The combination of these techniques
offers visualization of both the lateral size (using nanoscopy) and the
thickness map of sieve plates, i.e. discrete clusters fenestrations in QPM
mode.

  Connection for Abstract Dialectical Frameworks and May-Must Argumentation
  (First Report)",,,,,"cs.LO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Labelling-based formal argumentation relies on labelling functions that
typically assign one of 3 labels to indicate either acceptance, rejection, or
else undecided-to-be-either, to each argument. While a classical
labelling-based approach applies globally uniform conditions as to how an
argument is to be labelled, they can be determined more locally per argument.
Abstract dialectical frameworks (ADF) is a well-known argumentation formalism
that belongs to this category, offering a greater labelling flexibility. As the
size of an argumentation increases in the numbers of arguments and
argument-to-argument relations, however, it becomes increasingly more costly to
check whether a labelling function satisfies those local conditions or even
whether the conditions are as per the intention of those who had specified
them. Some compromise is thus required for reasoning about a larger
argumentation. In this context, there is a more recently proposed formalism of
may-must argumentation (MMA) that enforces still local but more abstract
labelling conditions. We identify how they link to each other in this work. We
prove that there is a Galois connection between them, in which ADF is a
concretisation of MMA and MMA is an abstraction of ADF. We explore the
consequence of abstract interpretation at play in formal argumentation,
demonstrating a sound reasoning about the judgement of
acceptability/rejectability in ADF from within MMA. As far as we are aware,
there is seldom any work that incorporates abstract interpretation into formal
argumentation in the literature, and, in the stated context, this work is the
first to demonstrate its use and relevance.

Virus (HCV), and it has been recognized as the main reason for liver diseases.
HCV incidence is growing as an important issue in the epidemiology of
infectious diseases. In the present study, a mathematical model is employed for
simulating the dynamics of HCV outbreak in a population. The total population
is divided into five compartments, including unaware and aware susceptible,
acutely and chronically infected, and treated classes. Then, a Lyapunov-based
nonlinear adaptive method is proposed for the first time to control the HCV
epidemic considering modelling uncertainties. A positive definite Lyapunov
candidate function is suggested, and adaptation and control laws are attained
based on that. The main goal of the proposed control strategy is to decrease
the population of unaware susceptible and chronically infected compartments by
pursuing appropriate treatment scenarios. As a consequence of this decrease in
the mentioned compartments, the population of aware susceptible individuals
increases and the population of acutely infected and treated humans decreases.
The Lyapunov stability theorem and Barbalat's lemma are employed in order to
prove the tracking convergence to desired population reduction scenarios. Based
on the acquired numerical results, the proposed nonlinear adaptive controller
can achieve the above-mentioned objective by adjusting the inputs (rates of
informing the susceptible people and treatment of chronically infected ones)
and estimating uncertain parameter values based on the designed control and
adaptation laws, respectively. Moreover, the proposed strategy is designed to
be robust in the presence of different levels of parametric uncertainties.

fusion field. Fusion is basically extraction of best of inputs and conveying it

image information is comprehended together to form one image to express its
information. The aim of image fusion is to integrate complementary and
redundant information. In this paper, a multimodal image fusion algorithm based
on the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) and adaptive particle swarm
optimization (APSO) is proposed. Fusion is achieved through the formation of a
fused pyramid using the DTCWT coefficients from the decomposed pyramids of the
source images. The coefficients are fused by the weighted average method based
on pixels, and the weights are estimated by the APSO to gain optimal fused
images. The fused image is obtained through conventional inverse dual-tree
complex wavelet transform reconstruction process. Experiment results show that
the proposed method based on adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm is
remarkably better than the method based on particle swarm optimization. The
resulting fused images are compared visually and through benchmarks such as

for on-demand incremental learning over locally sensed data. The presented
multi-core HW/SW architecture achieves a peak performance of 2.21 and 1.70
MAC/cycle, respectively, when running forward and backward steps of the
gradient descent. We report the trade-off between memory footprint, latency,
and accuracy for learning a new class with Latent Replay CL when targeting an
image classification task on the CORe50 dataset. For a CL setting that retrains
all the layers, taking 5h to learn a new class and achieving up to 77.3% of
precision, a more efficient solution retrains only part of the network,
reaching an accuracy of 72.5% with a memory requirement of 300 MB and a
computation latency of 1.5 hours. On the other side, retraining only the last
layer results in the fastest (867 ms) and less memory hungry (20 MB) solution

between humans and nature. The analysis of social media data with graph theory
is a promising approach to provide global information on users' perceptions for
different marine ecosystems. Fourteen areas were selected to illustrate the use
of graph theory on social media data. The selected areas, known to protect key
recreational, educational and heritage attributes of marine ecosystems, were
investigated to identify variability in users' preferences. Instagram data
(i.e., hashtags associated to photos) was extracted for each area allowing an
in-depth assessment of the CES most appreciated by the users. Hashtags were
analysed using network centrality measures to identify clusters of words,
aspects not normally captured by traditional photo content analysis. The
emergent properties of networks of hashtags were explored to characterise
visitors' preferences (e.g., cultural heritage or nature appreciation),
activities (e.g., diving or hiking), preferred habitats and species (e.g.
forest, beach, penguins), and feelings (e.g., happiness or place identity).
Network analysis on Instagram hashtags allowed delineating the users' discourse
around a natural area, which provides crucial information for effective
management of popular natural spaces for people.

  (2020)",,,,"cs.CE cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hot-rolling is a metal forming process that produces a workpiece with a
desired target cross-section from an input workpiece through a sequence of
plastic deformations; each deformation is generated by a stand composed of
opposing rolls with a specific geometry. In current practice, the rolling
sequence (i.e., the sequence of stands and the geometry of their rolls) needed
to achieve a given final cross-section is designed by experts based on previous
experience, and iteratively refined in a costly trial-and-error process. Finite
Element Method simulations are increasingly adopted to make this process more
efficient and to test potential rolling sequences, achieving good accuracy at
the cost of long simulation times, limiting the practical use of the approach.
We propose a supervised learning approach to predict the deformation of a given
workpiece by a set of rolls with a given geometry; the model is trained on a
large dataset of procedurally-generated FEM simulations, which we publish as
supplementary material. The resulting predictor is four orders of magnitude
faster than simulations, and yields an average Jaccard Similarity Index of
0.972 (against ground truth from simulations) and 0.925 (against real-world
measured deformations); we additionally report preliminary results on using the
predictor for automatic planning of rolling sequences.

How to properly design these user interface modules is vital to achieving user
satisfaction for a mobile app. However, there are few methods to determine
design variables for user interface modules except for relying on the judgment
of designers. Usually, a laborious post-processing step is necessary to verify
the key change of each design variable. Therefore, there is a only very limited
amount of design solutions that can be tested. It is timeconsuming and almost
impossible to figure out the best design solutions as there are many modules.
To this end, we introduce FEELER, a framework to fast and intelligently explore
design solutions of user interface modules with a collective machine learning
approach. FEELER can help designers quantitatively measure the preference score
of different design solutions, aiming to facilitate the designers to
conveniently and quickly adjust user interface module. We conducted extensive
experimental evaluations on two real-life datasets to demonstrate its
applicability in real-life cases of user interface module design in the Baidu
App, which is one of the most popular mobile apps in China.

steady MTL research has always been present, there is a growing interest driven
by the impressive successes published in the related fields of transfer
learning and pre-training, such as BERT, and the release of new challenge
problems, such as GLUE and the NLP Decathlon (decaNLP). These efforts place
more focus on how weights are shared across networks, evaluate the re-usability
of network components and identify use cases where MTL can significantly
outperform single-task solutions. This paper strives to provide a comprehensive
survey of the numerous recent MTL contributions to the field of natural
language processing and provide a forum to focus efforts on the hardest
unsolved problems in the next decade. While novel models that improve
performance on NLP benchmarks are continually produced, lasting MTL challenges
remain unsolved which could hold the key to better language understanding,
knowledge discovery and natural language interfaces.

  fission","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A regular pattern, revealing the leading role of the light-fragment nuclear
charge, is found to emerge from a consistent analysis of the experimental
information collected recently on low-energy asymmetric fission of
neutron-deficient nuclei around lead. The observation is corroborated by a
theoretical investigation within a microscopic framework, suggesting the
importance of proton configurations driven by quadrupole-octupole correlations.
This is in contrast to the earlier theoretical interpretations in terms of
dominant neutron shells. The survey of a wider area of the nuclear chart by a
semi-empirical approach points to the lack of understanding of the competition
between the different underlying macroscopic and microscopic forces in a
quantitative manner. Combined with previously identified stabilizing forces,
the present finding shows a striking connection between the ""old"" (actinide)
and ""new"" (pre-actinide) islands of asymmetric fission which could steer the
strive for an unified theory of fission.

COVID-19. Given n samples collected from patients, how should we select and
test mixtures of samples to maximize information and minimize the number of
tests? Group testing is a well-studied problem with several appealing
solutions, but recent biological studies impose practical constraints for
COVID-19 that are incompatible with traditional methods. Furthermore, existing
methods use unnecessarily restrictive solutions, which were devised for
settings with more memory and compute constraints than the problem at hand.
This results in poor utility. In the new setting, we obtain strong solutions
for small values of n using evolutionary strategies. We then develop a new
method combining Bloom filters with belief propagation to scale to larger
values of n (more than 100) with good empirical results. We also present a more
accurate decoding algorithm that is tailored for specific COVID-19 settings.
This work demonstrates the practical gap between dedicated algorithms and
well-known generic solutions. Our efforts results in a new and practical
multiplex method yielding strong empirical performance without mixing more than
a chosen number of patients into the same probe. Finally, we briefly discuss
adaptive methods, casting them into the framework of adaptive sub-modularity.

the dynamics of human competition, and has been proven useful in soccer,
basketball, and other professional sports. In this paper we present a model for
dodgeball, a popular sport in US schools, and analyze it using an ordinary
differential equation (ODE) compartmental model and stochastic agent-based game
simulations. The ODE model reveals a rich landscape with different game
dynamics occurring depending on the strategies used by the teams, which can in
some cases be mapped to scenarios in competitive species models. Stochastic
agent-based game simulations confirm and complement the predictions of the
deterministic ODE models. In some scenarios, game victory can be interpreted as
a noise-driven escape from the basin of attraction of a stable fixed point,
resulting in extremely long games when the number of players is large. Using
the ODE and agent-based models, we construct a strategy to increase the
probability of winning.

photonic process which, in combination with standard frequency filters,
facilitates isolation. Isolation up to 13 dB is measured with a 3 dB bandwidth
of 2 GHz and insertion loss of 18 dB. As one potential application is
cross-talk suppression in bi-directional communication links, we also show
transmission of a 4 Gbps data signal through the isolator while retaining a

shown to generate electricity at night with no active input of heat needed,
instead using the ambient air itself as the heat source. Here, we optimize both
the geometry and operating conditions of radiative cooling driven
thermoelectric (RC-TE) generators. We determine the optimal operating
conditions, including maximum power point and maximum efficiency point, by
developing a combined thermal and electrical model. Our results show that the
optimal operating condition results in larger power output than was previously
expected. Moreover, we show that maximum power density occurs when the area
ratio between cooler and P or N element reaches an optimal value. Finally, we
perform a parametric study that takes account of environmental and structural
parameters to improve the performance of the RC-TE device, including enhancing
heat transfer between the hot surface and ambient air, suppressing the cooling
loss of the radiative cooler, and optimizing the geometry of individual
thermocouples. Our work identifies how to maximize the output of RC-TE devices
