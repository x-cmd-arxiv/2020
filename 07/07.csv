discovery that has been shown to successfully recover governing dynamical
systems from data (Brunton et al., PNAS, '16; Rudy et al., Sci. Adv. '17).
Recently, several groups have independently discovered that the weak
formulation provides orders of magnitude better robustness to noise. Here we
extend our Weak SINDy (WSINDy) framework introduced in (arXiv:2005.04339) to
the setting of partial differential equations (PDEs). The elimination of
pointwise derivative approximations via the weak form enables effective
machine-precision recovery of model coefficients from noise-free data (i.e.
below the tolerance of the simulation scheme) as well as robust identification
of PDEs in the large noise regime (with signal-to-noise ratio approaching one
in many well-known cases). This is accomplished by discretizing a convolutional
weak form of the PDE and exploiting separability of test functions for
efficient model identification using the Fast Fourier Transform. The resulting
WSINDy algorithm for PDEs has a worst-case computational complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(N^{D+1}\log(N))$ for datasets with $N$ points in each of $D+1$
dimensions (i.e. $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ operations per datapoint). Furthermore,
our Fourier-based implementation reveals a connection between robustness to
noise and the spectra of test functions, which we utilize in an \textit{a
priori} selection algorithm for test functions. Finally, we introduce a
learning algorithm for the threshold in sequential-thresholding least-squares
(STLS) that enables model identification from large libraries, and we utilize
scale-invariance at the continuum level to identify PDEs from poorly-scaled
datasets. We demonstrate WSINDy's robustness, speed and accuracy on several
challenging PDEs.

different kinds of noise: the fast noise (which makes neurons more prone to
failure), the slow noise (stemming from interference among stored memories),
and synaptic noise (due to possible flaws during the learning or the storing

neurons can interact in $p$-plets, in the absence of fast noise, and we
investigate the interplay of slow and synaptic noise. In particular, leveraging
on the duality between associative neural networks and restricted Boltzmann
machines, we analyze the effect of corrupted information, imperfect learning
and storing errors. For $p=2$ (corresponding to the Hopfield model) any source
of synaptic noise breaks-down retrieval if the number of memories $K$ scales as
the network size. For $p>2$, in the relatively low-load regime $K \sim N$,
synaptic noise is tolerated up to a certain bound, depending on the density of

measure spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayer
structures. In the course of a measurement, other resonant processes such as
spin pumping (SP) and heating can cause spin current or heat flows between the
layers, inducing additional resonant voltage signals via the inverse spin Hall
effect (ISHE) and Nernst effects (NE). In the standard ST-FMR geometry, these
extra artifacts exhibit a dependence on the angle of an in-plane magnetic field
that is identical to the rectification signal from the SOTs. We show
experimentally that the rectification and artifact voltages can be quantified
separately by measuring the ST-FMR signal transverse to the applied current
(i.e., in a Hall geometry) in addition to the usual longitudinal geometry. We
find that in Pt (6 nm)/CoFeB samples the contribution from the artifacts is
small compared to the SOT rectification signal for CoFeB layers thinner than 6
nm, but can be significant for thicker magnetic layers. We observe a sign
change in the artifact voltage as a function of CoFeB thickness that we suggest
may be due to a competition between a resonant heating effect and the SP/ISHE
contribution.

of machine learning to estimate different nuisance functions and hence allow
for fewer restrictions on the underlying structure of the data. To limit a
potential overfitting bias that may result when using machine learning methods,
cross-fitting estimators have been proposed. This includes the splitting of the
data in different folds to reduce bias and averaging over folds to restore
efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, it is not yet clear how exactly the
data should be split and averaged. We employ a Monte Carlo study with different
data generation processes and consider twelve different estimators that vary in
sample-splitting, cross-fitting and averaging procedures. We investigate the
performance of each estimator independently on four different meta-learners:
the doubly-robust-learner, R-learner, T-learner and X-learner. We find that the
performance of all meta-learners heavily depends on the procedure of splitting
and averaging. The best performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE) among
the sample split estimators can be achieved when applying cross-fitting plus
taking the median over multiple different sample-splitting iterations. Some
meta-learners exhibit a high variance when the lasso is included in the ML
methods. Excluding the lasso decreases the variance and leads to robust and at
least competitive results.

garnered attention because of their ability to prevent cross contamination and

suffer from low conductivity, reducing deionization performance. Utilization of
higher mass loadings to combat this leads to poor rheological properties.
Herein, Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene was introduced as 1 mg/mL slurry electrodes in
an FE-CDI system for the removal and recovery of ammonia from simulated
agricultural wastewater. The electrode performance was evaluated by operating
the FE-CDI system with a feed solution of 500 mg/L NH$_4$Cl running in batch
mode at a constant voltage of 1.20 V and -1.20 V in charging and discharging
modes, respectively. Despite the low loading, Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ flowing
electrodes showed markedly improved performance, achieving 60% ion removal
efficiency in a saturation time of 115 minutes with an adsorption capacity of
460 mg/g. To understand the high adsorption performance of the electrodes,
physiochemical and structural analysis was done via a variety of
characterization techniques such as SEM, TEM, XRD, DLS, and Raman Spectroscopy.
Cyclic Voltammetry and Galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles were obtained to
evaluate the electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The system proved to
be an energy-saving technology by exhibiting a charge efficiency of 58-70%
while operating at an energy consumption of 0.45 kWh/kg. A 92% regeneration

late times, $z \lesssim 2$, where the dark energy component begins to dominate
the cosmic energy density. Many theoretical models involving dynamical dark
energy exhibit a 'freezing' equation of state however, where $w \to -1$ at late
times, with a transition to a 'tracking' behaviour at earlier times (with $w
\gg -1$ at sufficiently high redshift). In this paper, we study whether
large-scale structure surveys in the post-reionisation matter-dominated regime,
$2 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$, are sensitive to this behaviour, on the basis that
the dark energy component should remain detectable (despite being strongly
subdominant) in this redshift range given sufficiently precise observations.
Using phenomenological models inspired by parameter space studies of Horndeski
(generalised scalar-tensor) theories, we show how existing CMB and large-scale
structure measurements constrain the dark energy equation of state in the
matter-dominated era, and examine how forthcoming galaxy surveys and 21cm
intensity mapping instruments can improve constraints in this regime. We also
find that the combination of existing CMB and LSS constraints with DESI will
already come close to offering the best possible constraints on $H_0$ using
BAO/galaxy power spectrum measurements, and that either a spectroscopic
follow-up of the LSST galaxy sample (e.g. along the lines of MegaMapper or
SpecTel) or a Stage 2/PUMA-like intensity mapping survey, both at $z \gtrsim

naturally emerging within a compressed frictional granular medium. Using laser
interferometry, we show that the deformation inside this granular gouge occurs
as a succession of localized micro-slips distributed along the fault. The
associated distributions of released seismic moments, the memory effects in
strain fluctuations, as well as the time correlations between successive
events, follow exactly the empirical laws of natural earthquakes. Using a
methodology initially developed in seismology and social science, we reveal,
for the first time at the laboratory scale, the underlying causal structure.
This demonstrates that the spatio-temporal correlations of the slip dynamics
effectively emerge from more fundamental triggering kernels. This formal
analogy between natural faults and our experimentally controllable granular
shear band opens the way towards a better understanding of earthquake physics.
In particular, comparing experiments performed under different imposed
deformation rates, we show that strain, not time, is the right parameter
controlling the memory effects in the dynamics of our fault analog. This raises
the fundamental question of the relative roles of strain-dependent structural
rearrangements within the fault gouge vs that of truly time-dependent,
thermally activated processes, in the emergence of spatio-temporal correlations
of natural seismicity.

statistical physics, dynamical systems and differential equations on
networks/graphs have permeated into a broad number of mathematical areas as
well as into many applications. One central problem in the field is to find
suitable approximations of the dynamics as the number of nodes/vertices tends
to infinity, i.e., in the large graph limit. A cornerstone in this context are
Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations (VFPEs) describing a particle density on a
mean-field level. For all-to-all coupled systems, it is quite classical to
prove the rigorous approximation by VFPEs for many classes of particle systems.
For dense graphs converging to graphon limits, one also knows that mean-field
approximation holds for certain classes of models, e.g., for the Kuramoto model
on graphs. Yet, the space of intermediate density and sparse graphs is clearly
extremely relevant. Here we prove that the Kuramoto model can be be
approximated in the mean-field limit by far more general graph limits than
graphons. In particular, our contributions are as follows. (I) We show, how to
introduce operator theory more abstractly into VFPEs by considering graphops.
Graphops have recently been proposed as a unifying approach to graph limit
theory, and here we show that they can be used for differential equations on
graphs. (II) For the Kuramoto model on graphs we rigorously prove that there is
a VFPE equation approximating it in the mean-field sense. (III) This mean-field
VFPE involves a graphop, and we prove the existence, uniqueness, and continuous
graphop-dependence of weak solutions. (IV) On a technical level, our results
rely on designing a new suitable metric of graphop convergence and on employing
Fourier analysis on compact abelian groups to approximate graphops using
summability kernels.

Here we discuss the quantifying of quantum coherence for the Dicke model of

$l_1$-norm of coherence is given by the square root of the normalized average
intensity of radiation emitted by the superradiant system. This validates
quantum coherence as a useful figure of merit towards the understanding of
superradiance phenomenon in the mean-field approach. In particular, this result
suggests probing the single-atom coherence through the radiation intensity in
superradiant systems, which might be useful in experimental realizations where
is unfeasible to address atoms individually. Furthermore, given the nonlinear
unitary dynamics of the time-dependent single-atom state that effectively
describes the system of $N$ atoms, we analyze the quantum speed limit time and
its interplay with the $l_1$-norm of coherence. We verify the quantum coherence
speeds up the evolution of the superradiant system, i.e., the more coherence
stored on the single-atom state, the faster the evolution. These findings
unveil the role played by quantum coherence in superradiant systems, which in
turn could be of interest for communities of both condensed matter physics and
quantum optics.

quantum teleportation from a dynamical viewpoint, which makes explicit at each

involved in it. In order to construct this dynamical perspective, it has been
necessary to define some auxiliary elements, namely virtual nodes and edges, as
well as an additional notation for nodes describing potential states (against
nodes accounting for actual states). With these elements, not only the flow of
the process can be followed step by step, but they allow us to establish a
direct correspondence between this graph-based approach and the usual state
vector description. To show the suitability and versatility of this graph-based
approach, several particular teleportation examples are examined, which include
bipartite, tripartite and tetrapartite maximally entangled states as quantum

technologies for merging virtual objects and physical scenes to provide an
immersive mixed reality (MR) environment to its user. A fundamental limitation
of HMDs is, that the user itself cannot be augmented conveniently as, in casual
posture, only the distal upper extremities are within the field of view of the
HMD. Consequently, most MR applications that are centered around the user, such
as virtual dressing rooms or learning of body movements, cannot be realized
with HMDs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept and prototype system that
combines OST HMDs and physical mirrors to enable self-augmentation and provide
an immersive MR environment centered around the user. Our system, to the best
of our knowledge the first of its kind, estimates the user's pose in the
virtual image generated by the mirror using an RGBD camera attached to the HMD
and anchors virtual objects to the reflection rather than the user directly. We
evaluate our system quantitatively with respect to calibration accuracy and
infrared signal degradation effects due to the mirror, and show its potential
in applications where large mirrors are already an integral part of the
facility. Particularly, we demonstrate its use for virtual fitting rooms,
gaming applications, anatomy learning, and personal fitness. In contrast to
competing devices such as LCD-equipped smart mirrors, the proposed system
consists of only an HMD with RGBD camera and, thus, does not require a prepared
environment making it very flexible and generic. In future work, we will aim to
investigate how the system can be optimally used for physical rehabilitation
and personal training as a promising application.

  to submit to a peer-reviewed journal",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dispersion measure (DM) is one of the key attributes of radio pulsars and
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). There is a mistaken view that the DM is an accurate
measure of the column density of electrons between the observer and the source.
To start with, the DM, unlike a true column density, is not a Lorentz
invariant. Next, the DM also includes contribution from ions and is sensitive
to the temperature of the plasma in the intervening clouds. Separately, the
primary observable is the dispersion slope, $\mathcal{D}\equiv
\Delta{(t)}/\Delta{(\nu^{-2}})$, where $t(\nu)$ is the arrival time at
frequency, $\nu$. A scaling factor composed of physical and astronomical
constants is needed to convert $\mathcal{D}$ to DM. In the early days of pulsar
astronomy the relevant constants were defined to parts per million (ppm). As a
result, a convention arose in which this conversion factor was fixed. Over
time, several such conventions came about -- recipe for confusion. Meanwhile,
over the past several years, the SI system has been restructured and the parsec
is now exactly defined. As a result, the present accuracy of the conversion
factor is below a part per billion -- many orders of magnitude better than the
best measurement errors of $\mathcal{D}$. We are now in an awkward situation
wherein the primary ""observable"", the DM, has incorrect scaling factor(s). To
address these two concerns I propose that astronomers report the primary
measurement, $\mathcal{D}$ (with a suggested normalization of $10^{15}\,$Hz),
and not the DM. Interested users can convert $\mathcal{D}$ to DM without the
need to know secret handshakes of the pulsar timing communities.

reduced production. We exploit the unique characteristics of the Gaia-ESO

constrain the evolution of Li at high metallicity. We trace the the upper
envelope of Li abundance versus metallicity evolution using 18 clusters and
considering members that should not have suffered any Li depletion. At variance
with previous claims, we do not find any evidence of a Li decrease at high
metallicity. The most metal-rich clusters in the sample ([Fe/H] about 0.3)
actually show the highest Li abundances, with A(Li) > 3.4. Our results clearly
show that previous findings, which were based on field stars, were affected by
selection effects. The metal-rich population in the solar neighbourhood is
composed of relatively old and cool stars that have already undergone some Li
depletion; hence, their measured Li does not represent the initial interstellar
medium abundance, but a lower limit to it.

metrics have been proposed for measuring algorithmic bias or unfairness. Two
popular fairness measures are calibration and equality of false positive rate.
Each measure seems intuitively important, but notably, it is usually impossible
to satisfy both measures. For this reason, a large literature in machine
learning speaks of a fairness tradeoff between these two measures. This framing
assumes that both measures are, in fact, capturing something important. To
date, philosophers have not examined this crucial assumption, and examined to
what extent each measure actually tracks a normatively important property. This
makes this inevitable statistical conflict, between calibration and false
positive rate equality, an important topic for ethics. In this paper, I give an
ethical framework for thinking about these measures and argue that, contrary to
initial appearances, false positive rate equality does not track anything about
fairness, and thus sets an incoherent standard for evaluating the fairness of
algorithms.

Our first main theorem is an optimal hitting time result. Consider the random

produced by this process has minimum degree $2k$, it contains $k$ edge-disjoint
Hamilton cycles, for any fixed $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Secondly, we obtain a

requires at least a desired number of live neighbors to become alive. For
underpopulation (resp., overpopulation), a live vertex requires at least (resp.

independently. Rotation-based precoding is new precoding and power allocation
that beats existing solutions in PHY security and multicasting and is reliable
in different antenna settings. Next, a DNN-based precoder is designed to unify
the solution for all objectives. The proposed DNN concurrently learns the

address this challenge, we develop a data-driven methodology based on matrix

remove noisy outliers from the data by Principal Component Pursuit, then employ
a temporally smooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization to automatically discover

combination (activation) reconstructs the dominant echogram structures. This
low-rank representation provides biological information that is more tractable

systematic analysis with other ocean variables. Unlike existing methods that
rely on fixed, handcrafted rules, our unsupervised machine learning approach is
well-suited for extracting information from data collected from unfamiliar or

the warehouse. To reduce such undesired oscillations, this paper treats the
to-be-delivered object as an unknown external disturbance and presents an
image-based disturbance observer (DOB) to estimate and reject such disturbance.
Different from the existing DOB technique that can only compensate for the
disturbance after the oscillations happen, the proposed image-based one
incorporates image-based disturbance prediction into the control loop to
further improve the performance of the DOB. The proposed image-based DOB
consists of two parts. The first one is deep-learning-based disturbance
prediction. By taking an image of the to-be-delivered object, a sequential
disturbance signal is predicted in advance using a connected pre-trained
convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.
The second part is a conventional DOB in the feedback loop with a feedforward
correction, which utilizes the deep learning prediction to generate a learning
signal. Numerical studies are performed to validate the proposed image-based
DOB regarding oscillation reduction for delivery drones during the grasping and
releasing periods of the objects.

Through interferometric experiments we extract the substrate stress profile at

However, theoretical results to quantify this improvement do not exist yet. In
this paper we explain and quantify this improvement in linear asymptotic
convergence speed for the special case of a stationary version of AA applied to
ADMM. We do so by considering the spectral properties of the Jacobians of ADMM
and the stationary version of AA evaluated at the fixed point, where the
coefficients of the stationary AA method are computed such that its asymptotic
linear convergence factor is optimal. The optimal linear convergence factors of
this stationary AA-ADMM method are computed analytically or by optimization,
based on previous work on optimal stationary AA acceleration. Using this
spectral picture and those analytical results, our approach provides new
insight into how and by how much the stationary AA method can improve the
asymptotic linear convergence factor of ADMM. Numerical results also indicate
that the optimal linear convergence factor of the stationary AA methods gives a
useful estimate for the asymptotic linear convergence speed of the
non-stationary AA method that is used in practice.

glitches (17 of them have sizes $\Delta\nu/\nu\geq10^{-6}$) and exhibit very
similar characteristics. This similarity, combined with the regularity with
which large glitches occur, has turned Vela into an archetype of this type of
glitching behaviour. The properties of its smallest glitches, on the other

significant change of spin frequency $\nu$ and/or the spin-down rate

respective sizes $\Delta\nu/\nu$ of $(5.55\pm0.03)\times10^{-9}$ and
$(38\pm4)\times10^{-9}$. In addition to these two glitch events, our study
reveals numerous events of all possible signatures (i.e. combinations of
$\Delta\nu$ and $\Delta\dot{\nu}$ signs), all of them small with
$|\Delta\nu|/\nu<10^{-9}$, which contribute to the Vela timing noise. The Vela
pulsar presents an under-abundance of small glitches compared to many other
glitching pulsars, which appears genuine and not a result of observational
biases. In addition to typical glitches, the smooth spin-down of the pulsar is
also affected by an almost continuous activity that can be partially
characterised by small step-like changes in $\nu$, $\dot{\nu,}$ or both.
Simulations indicate that a continuous wandering of the rotational phase,

data deletion algorithms that are able to handle an arbitrarily long sequence
of adversarial updates while promising both per-deletion run-time and
steady-state error that do not grow with the length of the update sequence. We
also introduce several new conceptual distinctions: for example, we can ask
that after a deletion, the entire state maintained by the optimization
algorithm is statistically indistinguishable from the state that would have
resulted had we retrained, or we can ask for the weaker condition that only the
observable output is statistically indistinguishable from the observable output
that would have resulted from retraining. We are able to give more efficient
deletion algorithms under this weaker deletion criterion.

unsuitable for low-power and edge applications. This paper attempts to address
this conflict by proposing the IMU preintegrated features as a replacement for
the raw IMU data in deep inertial odometry. Exploiting the manifold structure
of the IMU motion model, these features provide a temporally compressed motion

However, this assumption is violated in almost all practical applications:
machine learning systems are regularly tested under distribution shift, due to
changing temporal correlations, atypical end users, or other factors. In this
work, we consider the problem setting of domain generalization, where the
training data are structured into domains and there may be multiple test time
shifts, corresponding to new domains or domain distributions. Most prior
methods aim to learn a single robust model or invariant feature space that
performs well on all domains. In contrast, we aim to learn models that adapt at
test time to domain shift using unlabeled test points. Our primary contribution
is to introduce the framework of adaptive risk minimization (ARM), in which
models are directly optimized for effective adaptation to shift by learning to
adapt on the training domains. Compared to prior methods for robustness,
invariance, and adaptation, ARM methods provide performance gains of 1-4% test
accuracy on a number of image classification problems exhibiting domain shift.

beginning of large-scale structure formation in the universe. The impulsive
ionization fronts (I-fronts) heat and ionize the gas within the reionization
bubbles in the intergalactic medium (IGM). The temperature during this process
is a key yet uncertain ingredient in current models. Typically, reionization
simulations assume that all baryonic species are in instantaneous thermal
equilibrium with each other during the passage of an I-front. Here we present a
new model of the temperature evolution for the ionization front by studying
non-equilibrium effects. In particular, we include the energy transfer between
major baryon species ($e^{-}$, \HI, \HII, \HeI, and \HeII) and investigate
their impacts on the post-ionization front temperature $T_{\mathrm{re}}$. For a
better step-size control when solving the stiff equations, we implement an
implicit method and construct an energy transfer rate matrix. We find that the
assumption of equilibration is valid for a low-speed ionization front
($\lessapprox\ 10^9~\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s}$), but deviations from equilibrium
occur for faster fronts. The post-front temperature $T_{\mathrm{re}}$ is lower
by up to 19.7\% (at $3\times 10^9$ cm/s) or 30.8\% (at $10^{10}$ cm/s) relative
to the equilibrium case.

kinematics. The approach is validated on hydrodynamically simulated lenses. We
apply the method to the TDCOSMO sample of 7 lenses (6 from H0LiCOW) and measure
$H_0=74.5^{+5.6}_{-6.1}$ km s$^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. In order to further
constrain the deflector mass profiles, we then add imaging and spectroscopy for
33 strong gravitational lenses from the SLACS sample. For 9 of the SLAC lenses
we use resolved kinematics to constrain the stellar anisotropy. From the joint
analysis of the TDCOSMO+SLACS sample, we measure $H_0=67.4^{+4.1}_{-3.2}$ km

from the same parent population. The blind H0LiCOW, TDCOSMO-only and

analysis prefers marginally shallower mass profiles than H0LiCOW or
TDCOSMO-only. While our new analysis does not statistically invalidate the mass
profile assumptions by H0LiCOW, and thus their $H_0$ measurement relying on
those, it demonstrates the importance of understanding the mass density profile
of elliptical galaxies. The uncertainties on $H_0$ derived in this paper can be
reduced by physical or observational priors on the form of the mass profile, or

with the only exception of 3C 326.1 and 3C 454.1 and from radio lobes in 6 out

X-ray fluxes and luminosities for all nuclei and lobes in the soft (0.5 - 1
keV), medium (1 - 2 keV) and hard (2 - 7 keV) X-ray bands. Since the discovered
X-ray extended emission is spatially coincident with the radio structure in all
cases, its origin could be due to Inverse Compton scattering of the Cosmic

of active nematics. Two-dimensional active nematics flow spontaneously and
exhibit spatiotemporal chaotic flows with proliferation of topological defects
in the nematic texture. It has been proposed that the dynamics of active
nematics can be understood in terms of the dynamics of interacting defects,
propelled by active stress. Previous work has derived effective equations of
motion for individual defects as quasi-particles moving in the mean field
generated by other defects, but an effective theory governing multi-defect
dynamics has remained out of reach. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of
2D active nematics in the limit of strong order and overdamped compressible
flow. The activity-induced defect dynamics is formulated as a perturbation of
the manifold of quasi-static nematic textures explicitly parameterized by
defect positions. This makes it possible to derive a set of coupled ordinary
differential equations governing defect (and therefore texture) dynamics.
Interestingly, because of the non-orthogonality of textures associated with
individual defects, their motion is coupled through a position dependent
``collective mobility"" matrix. In addition to the familiar active
self-propulsion of the $+1/2$ defect, we obtain new collective effects of
activity that can be interpreted in terms of non-central and non-reciprocal
interactions between defects.

the opacity (kappa_nu) of the intervening Lya forest and distinct AGN escape
fractions f_esc(HI) and f_esc(HeII) at 1~ryd and 4~ryd, respectively. We also
examine H I and He II photoelectric heating from the reprocessed background,
whose spectral index (alpha_b > alpha_s) depends on alpha_s, the H I column
density slope beta, and the ratio R = f_esc(HI) / f_esc(HeII). We compare the

Internal AGN absorption with f_esc(HeII) = 0.6-0.8 but f_esc(HI) = 1 would
increase the index by Delta-alpha_b = 0.3-1.0, corresponding to eta = 60-200

To do this we make use of the explicit Wightman functions for a massless scalar

different capacities for creating correlations between the detectors, with the
Vaidya vacuum interpolating between the Unruh vacuum near the horizon and the
Boulware vacuum far from the horizon. Third, we show that the black hole
horizon inhibits \textit{any} correlations, not just entanglement. Finally, we
show that the efficiency of the harvesting protocol depend strongly on the

of the bright Milky Way (MW) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and their
orbital pericenter distances poses a potential signature of self-interacting
dark matter (SIDM). In this work we investigate this possibility by analysing
the range of SIDM scattering cross section per unit mass, $\sigma/m_{\chi}$,
able to explain such anti-correlation. We simulate the orbital evolution of
dSphs subhaloes around the MW assuming an analytical form for the gravitational
potential, adopting the proper motions from the Gaia mission and including a
consistent characterization of gravitational tidal stripping. The evolution of
the subhaloes density profile is modelled using the gravothermal fluid
formalism, where DM particle collisions induce thermal conduction that depends
on $\sigma/m_{\chi}$. We find that models of dSphs, such as Carina and Fornax,
reproduce the observed central DM densities with fixed $\sigma/m_{\chi}$
ranging between $30$ and $50$ cm$^{2}$g$^{-1}$, whereas other dSphs prefer
larger values ranging between $70$ and $100$ cm$^{2}$g$^{-1}$. These cross
sections correlate with the average collision velocity of DM particles within
each subhalo's core, so that systems modelled with large cross sections have
lower collision velocities. We fit the cross section-velocity correlation with
a SIDM particle model, where a DM particle of mass $m_{\chi}=0.648\pm 0.154$
GeV interacts under the exchange of a light mediator of mass $m_{\phi}=0.636\pm
0.055$ MeV, with the self-interactions being described by a Yukawa potential.
The outcome is a cross section-velocity relation that explains the diverse DM
profiles of MW dSph satellites and is consistent with observational constraints

Much of the phenomenology of MBL emerges from the existence of $\ell$-bits, a
set of conserved quantities that are quasilocal and binary (i.e., possess only
$\pm 1$ eigenvalues). While MBL and $\ell$-bits are known to exist in
one-dimensional systems, their existence in dimensions greater than one is a
key open question. To tackle this question, we develop an algorithm that can
find approximate binary $\ell$-bits in arbitrary dimensions by adaptively
generating a basis of operators in which to represent the $\ell$-bit. We use
the algorithm to study four models: the one-, two-, and three-dimensional
disordered Heisenberg models and the two-dimensional disordered hard-core
Bose-Hubbard model. For all four of the models studied, our algorithm finds
high-quality $\ell$-bits at large disorder strength and rapid qualitative
changes in the distributions of $\ell$-bits in particular ranges of disorder
strengths, suggesting the existence of MBL transitions. These transitions in
the one-dimensional Heisenberg model and two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model
coincide well with past estimates of the critical disorder strengths in these
models which further validates the evidence of MBL phenomenology in the other
two and three-dimensional models we examine. In addition to finding MBL
behavior in higher dimensions, our algorithm can be used to probe MBL in
various geometries and dimensionality.

galaxies at the same redshift, we find that the PC UVLF shows a significant
excess towards the bright-end. This excess can not be explained by the
contribution of only active galactic nuclei, and we also find that this is more
significant in higher dense regions. Assuming that all protocluster members are
located on the star formation main sequence, the PC UVLF can be converted into
a stellar mass function. Consequently, our protocluster members are inferred to
have a 2.8 times more massive characteristic stellar mass than that of the
field Lyman break galaxies at the same redshift. This study, for the first
time, clearly shows that the enhancement in star formation or stellar mass in
overdense regions can generally be seen as early as at $z\sim4$. We also
estimate the star formation rate density (SFRD) in protocluster regions as
$\simeq 6-20\%$ of the cosmic SFRD, based on the measured PC UVLF after
correcting for the selection incompleteness in our protocluster sample. This
high value suggests that protoclusters make a non-negligible contribution to
the cosmic SFRD at $z\sim4$, as previously suggested by simulations. Our
results suggest that protoclusters are essential components for the galaxy
evolution at $z\sim4$.

reveals a relationship between AGN luminosity and the size of the broad-line
region, and that use of this relationship, combined with the Doppler width of
the broad emission line, enables an estimate of the mass of the black hole at
the center of the active nucleus based on a single spectrum. An unresolved key
issue is the choice of parameter used to characterize the line width, either
FWHM or line dispersion (the square root of the second moment of the line
profile). We argue here that use of FWHM introduces a bias, stretching the mass
scale such that high masses are overestimated and low masses are
underestimated. Here we investigate estimation of black hole masses in AGNs
based on individual or ""single epoch"" observations, with a particular emphasis
in comparing mass estimates based on line dispersion and FWHM. We confirm the
recent findings that, in addition to luminosity and line width, a third
parameter is required to obtain accurate masses and that parameter seems to be
Eddington ratio. We present simplified empirical formulae for estimating black
hole masses from the Hbeta 4861 A and C IV 1549 A emission lines. While the AGN
continuum luminosity at 5100 A is usually used to predict the Hbeta
reverberation lag, we show that the luminosity of the Hbeta broad component can
be used instead without any loss of precision, thus eliminating the difficulty
of accurately accounting for the host-galaxy contribution to the observed

as well as a system of bound subhaloes. It is the prevailing practice to
include all halo mass, including mass in subhaloes, in studies of halo density
profiles. However, often in observational studies satellites are treated as
having their own distinct dark matter density profiles in addition to the
profile of the host. This difference makes comparisons between theoretical and
observed results difficult. In this work we investigate density profiles of the
smooth components of host haloes by excluding mass contained within subhaloes.
We find that the density profiles of the smooth halo component (without
subhaloes) differs substantially from the conventional halo density profile.
Smooth profiles decline more rapidly at large radii and are not well
characterised by the standard NFW profile. We also find that concentrations
derived from smooth density profiles exhibit less scatter at fixed mass and a
weaker mass dependence than standard concentrations. Both smooth and standard
halo profiles can be described by a generalised Einasto profile, an Einasto
profile with a modified central slope, with smaller residuals than either an
NFW or Einasto profile. These results hold for both Milky Way-mass and
cluster-mass haloes. This new characterisation of smooth halo profiles can be
useful for many analyses, such as lensing and dark matter annihilation, in
which the smooth and clumpy components of a halo should be accounted for
separately.

waves has renewed our interest on environments that can be the cradle of these
mergers. In this work we study merger rates of binary black holes in globular
clusters that are among the most dense stellar environments and a natural place
for the creation of black hole binaries. To model these systems with all their
variations we rely on the observational properties of the known Milky Way
globular clusters. We consider direct capture events between black holes, as
well as soft interactions of black hole binaries with stars as third bodies
that accelerate the evolution of these binaries. We find that binary black
holes from direct captures merge at an averaged rate of $0.3-5 \times 10^{-11}$
yr$^{-1}$ per cluster. Third body soft interactions are a much more prominent
channel giving an averaged rate of $2-4 \times 10^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$ per cluster.
Those rates in globular clusters can lead to a cumulative merger rate of about
100 mergers per year up to redshift of 1, i.e. a significant fraction of the
detectable in the near future binary black hole coalescence events. Further
observations of cluster properties both in terms of their masses, profile
properties, velocity dispersion of stars and their cosmological distribution,
will allow us to better constrain the contribution of these environments to the

tilts are coupled through local update rules, and are known to lead to
different ordered and disordered steady state phases depending on the
microscopic rates. We introduce a generalized balance mechanism in
non-equilibrium systems, namely $bunchwise~balance$, in which incoming and
outgoing transition currents are balanced between groups of configurations.
This allows us to exactly determine the steady state in a subspace of the phase
diagram of this model. We introduce the concept of $irreducible~sequences$ of
interfaces and bends in this model. These sequences are non-local, and we show
that they provide a coarsening length scale in the ordered phases at late
times. Finally, we propose a $local$ correlation function ($\mathcal{S}$) that
has a direct relation to the number of irreducible sequences, and is able to
distinguish between several phases of this system through its coarsening
properties. Starting from a totally disordered initial configuration,
$\mathcal{S}$ displays an initial linear rise and a broad maximum. As the
system evolves towards the ordered steady states, $\mathcal{S}$ further
exhibits power law decays at late times that encode coarsening properties of
the approach to the ordered phases. Focusing on early time dynamics, we posit
coupled mean-field evolution equations governing the particles and tilts, which
at short times are well approximated by a set of linearized equations, which we
solve analytically. Beyond a timescale set by a lattice cutoff and preceding
the onset of coarsening, our linearized theory predicts the existence of an

multi-level Monte Carlo as a solid and efficient method for a precise lattice

known example of a bright millisecond duration radio burst (FRB 200428) similar
to the cosmological population of fast radio bursts (FRBs), bolstering the
association of FRBs to active magnetars. The detection of a coincident bright
X-ray burst has revealed the first observed multi-wavelength counterpart of a
FRB. However, the search for similar emission at optical wavelengths has been
hampered by the high inferred extinction on the line of sight. Here, we present
results from the first search for second-timescale emission from the source at
near-infrared wavelengths using the Palomar Gattini-IR observing system in
J-band, made possible by a recently implemented detector read-out mode that
allowed for short exposure times of 0.84 s with 99.9% observing efficiency.
With a total observing time of 12 hours (47728 images) on source, we place
median $3\,\sigma$ limits on the second-timescale emission of $< 20$ mJy (13.1
AB mag). We present non-detection limits from epochs of four simultaneous X-ray
bursts detected by the Insight-{\it HXMT} and {\it NuSTAR} telescopes during
our observing campaign. The limits translate to an extinction corrected fluence
limit of $< 125$ Jy ms for an estimated extinction of $A_J = 2.0$ mag. These
limits provide the most stringent constraints to date on the fluence of flares
at frequencies of $\sim 10^{14}$ Hz, and constrain the ratio of the
near-infrared (NIR) fluence to that of coincident X-ray bursts to $R_{\rm NIR}
< 2.5 \times 10^{-2}$. Our observations were sensitive enough to easily detect
a near-infrared counterpart of FRB 200428 if the NIR emission falls on the same
power law as that observed across its radio to X-ray spectrum. The
non-detection of NIR emission around the coincident X-ray bursts constrains the
fluence index of the brightest burst to be steeper than $0.35$.

disassembly sequence planner identifies both the positions and orientations of

obtains an optimal disassembly sequence that follows disassembly rules and

For quantum fields in curved space, entanglement entropy of the quantum field
theory degrees of freedom is well-defined for a fixed background geometry. In
this paper, we propose a generalization of the quantum field theory
entanglement entropy by including dynamical gravity. The generalized quantity
named effective entropy, and its Renyi entropy generalizations, are defined by
analytic continuation of a gravitational path integral on replica geometry with
a co-dimension-$2$ brane at the boundary of region we are studying. We discuss
different approaches to define the region in a gauge invariant way, and show
that the effective entropy satisfies the quantum extremal surface formula. When
the quantum fields carry a significant amount of entanglement, the quantum
extremal surface can have a topology transition, after which an entanglement
island region appears. Our result generalizes the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi
formula of holographic entropy (with quantum corrections) to general geometries
without asymptotic AdS boundary, and provides a more solid framework for
addressing problems such as the Page curve of evaporating black holes in
asymptotic flat spacetime. We apply the formula to two example systems, a
closed two-dimensional universe and a four-dimensional maximally extended
Schwarzchild black hole. We discuss the analog of the effective entropy in
random tensor network models, which provides more concrete understanding of
quantum information properties in general dynamical geometries. By introducing
ancilla systems, we show how quantum information in the entanglement island can
be reconstructed in a state-dependent and observer-dependent map. We study the
closed universe (without spatial boundary) case and discuss how it is related
to open universe.

recent in situ detection on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and

that it is common on most (if not all) comets. Impact experiments conducted at
the Experimental Impact Laboratory at NASA's Johnson Space Center have shown
that samples of GLA and GLA mixed with montmorillonite clays can survive impact
delivery in the pressure range of 4.5 GPa to 25 GPa. Extrapolated to amounts of
GLA observed on individual comets and assuming a monotonic impact rate in the
first billion years of solar system history, these experimental results show
that up to 10^23 kg of cometary GLA could have survived impact delivery, with
substantial amounts of threose, erythrose, glycolic acid, and ethylene glycol
also produced or delivered. Importantly, independent of the profile of the
impact flux in the early solar system, comet delivery of GLA would have
provided (and may continue to provide) a reservoir of starting material for the
formose reaction (to form ribose) and the Strecker reaction (to form amino
acids). Thus, comets may have been important delivery vehicles for starting

LOFAR data at 150 MHz and X-ray Chandra data.
  NGC 4217 shows a large-scale X-shaped magnetic field structure, covering a
major part of the galaxy with a mean total magnetic field strength in the disk
of 9 micro Gauss (via equipartition). Using rotation measure synthesis
(RM-synthesis) at C-band, we found that the direction of the disk magnetic
field is pointing inward. A helical outflow structure is furthermore present in
the northwestern part of the galaxy, which is extended nearly 7 kpc into the
halo. More polarized emission is observed on the approaching side of the
galaxy. With a simplified galaxy disk model, we are able to explain that
finding and predict that roughly 75% of edge-on spiral galaxies will show
higher polarized intensity on the approaching side. Many loop and shell
structures are found throughout the galaxy in total intensity at C-band. A
superbubble-like structure is prominent in total and polarized intensity, as
well as in Halpha and optical dust filaments, being a possible result of
concentrated star formation in the disk. The flux density contribution of the
disk in comparison to the halo decreases toward lower frequencies. Total
intensity profiles at the three radio frequencies were fit with two-component
exponential functions. The frequency dependence of the resulting scale heights
between C-band and L-band suggests advection to be the main CR transport
process. The 1D CR transport modeling (SPINNAKER) shows that advection appears

to multiply impute cross-sectional wealth data in the 2013 PSID, and compare

by helping preserve correlation structures, such as the associations between
PSID wealth components and the relationships between the household net worth

suggest that the use of unverified open datasets can be problematic, although
the discoveries presented in this work may not be significant enough to

Language Processing (NLP). We also formulate different pre-processing steps for
addresses using a combination of edit distance and phonetic algorithms. Then we
approach the task of creating vector representations for addresses using
Word2Vec with TF-IDF, Bi-LSTM and BERT based approaches. We compare these
approaches with respect to sub-region classification task for North and South
Indian cities. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
generalized RoBERTa model, pre-trained over a large address corpus for language
modelling task. Our proposed RoBERTa model achieves a classification accuracy
of around 90% with minimal text preprocessing for sub-region classification
task outperforming all other approaches. Once pre-trained, the RoBERTa model
can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks in supply chain like pincode
suggestion and geo-coding. The model generalizes well for such tasks even with
limited labelled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its

paper proposes a cybersecurity assessment approach designed to assess the

intermittent generation of RES, vulnerabilities introduced by
microprocessor-based electronic information and operational technology (IT/OT)
devices, and contingency analysis results. The proposed approach utilizes deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) and an adapted Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) score tailored to assess vulnerabilities in EPS in order to identify the
optimal attack transition policy based on N-2 contingency results, i.e., the
simultaneous failure of two system elements. The effectiveness of the work is
validated via numerical and real-time simulation experiments performed on
literature-based power grid test cases. The results demonstrate how the
proposed method based on deep Q-network (DQN) performs closely to a
graph-search approach in terms of the number of transitions needed to find the
optimal attack policy, without the need for full observation of the system. In
addition, the experiments present the method's scalability by showcasing the
number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack transition policy in a
large system such as the Polish 2383 bus test system. The results exhibit how
the proposed approach requires one order of magnitude fewer transitions when
compared to a random transition policy.

turns to a presentation of its theoretical and practical limits with regard to

(i.e., sensitivity and accuracy despite high levels of missingness). Next using
a simulated time series in which two signals close in frequency are embedded in
significant amounts of random noise, the predictive power of this approach is
compared to the traditional ARIMA approach, with support also garnered for its
being robust even in the face of significant levels of missing data. The

smooth bundles over Hilbert schemes of ideal sheaves of curves and points in
$X$.
  When $X$ is Calabi-Yau this gives a simple wall crossing formula expressing
curve counts (and so ultimately Gromov-Witten invariants) in terms of counts of
D4-D2-D0 branes. These latter invariants are predicted to have modular
properties which we discuss from the point of view of S-duality and
Noether-Lefschetz theory.

space-bounded client reading the edge stream of a massive graph may delegate
some of its work to a cloud service. We seek algorithms that allow the client
to verify a purported proof sent by the cloud service that the work done in the
cloud is correct. A line of work starting with Chakrabarti et al. (ICALP 2009)
has provided such algorithms, which we call schemes, for several statistical
and graph-theoretic problems, many of which exhibit a tradeoff between the
length of the proof and the space used by the streaming verifier.
  This work designs new schemes for a number of basic graph
problems---including triangle counting, maximum matching, topological sorting,
and single-source shortest paths---where past work had either failed to obtain
smooth tradeoffs between these two key complexity measures or only obtained
suboptimal tradeoffs. Our key innovation is having the verifier compute certain
nonlinear sketches of the input stream, leading to either new or improved
tradeoffs. In many cases, our schemes in fact provide optimal tradeoffs up to
logarithmic factors.
  Specifically, for most graph problems that we study, it is known that the
product of the verifier's space cost $v$ and the proof length $h$ must be at
least $\Omega(n^2)$ for $n$-vertex graphs. However, matching upper bounds are
only known for a handful of settings of $h$ and $v$ on the curve $h \cdot
v=\tilde{\Theta}(n^2)$. For example, for counting triangles and maximum
matching, schemes with costs lying on this curve are only known for
$(h=\tilde{O}(n^2), v=\tilde{O}(1))$, $(h=\tilde{O}(n), v=\tilde{O}(n))$, and
the trivial $(h=\tilde{O}(1), v=\tilde{O}(n^2))$. A major message of this work
is that by exploiting nonlinear sketches, a significant ``portion'' of costs on
the tradeoff curve $h \cdot v = n^2$ can be achieved.

Additionally, it is matrix-free in the sense that it is not necessary to invert

analyze several approaches for implementing the parallel algorithms by
optimizing predominant loop structures and maximizing data reuse. Using a

derive the simplified equations for gravity as well as the longitudinal and

reconciles the fifth force propagated by the longitudinal mode of the cubic

all scales probed by the simulation, the transverse mode has a negligible
impact on structure formation in a realistic cosmological setup. It is well
known that in this model the strength of the fifth force is controlled by a
free model parameter, which we denote as beta_3. By running a suite of
cosmological simulations for different values of beta_3, we show that this
parameter also determines the effectiveness of the Vainshtein screening. The
model behaves identically to the cubic scalar Galileon for beta_3 going to
zero, in which the fifth force is strong in unscreened regions but is
efficiently screened in high-density regions. In the opposite limit, beta_3
going to infinity, the model approaches its `quintessence' counterpart, which

learning from ordinal data, that is, when measurements are taken from ordinal
scales. This is a topic that has not received much attention in machine
learning so far. The core of the learning problem itself consists of
identifying the capacity underlying the Sugeno integral. To tackle this

also includes a suitable technique for transforming the original feature values

the full range between zero rotation and the mass-shedding limit. We prove that
a single inertial mode couples to a Newtonian tidal field; overlap integrals
with all other modes vanish. We prove also that four inertial modes couple to a

artificially with bicubic downsampling. However, in real-world SR, there is a
large variety of realistic image degradations and analytically modeling these
realistic degradations can prove quite difficult. In this work, we propose to
handle real-world SR by splitting this ill-posed problem into two comparatively
more well-posed steps. First, we train a network to transform real LR images to
the space of bicubically downsampled images in a supervised manner, by using
both real LR/HR pairs and synthetic pairs. Second, we take a generic SR network
trained on bicubically downsampled images to super-resolve the transformed LR
image. The first step of the pipeline addresses the problem by registering the
large variety of degraded images to a common, well understood space of images.
The second step then leverages the already impressive performance of SR on
bicubically downsampled images, sidestepping the issues of end-to-end training
on datasets with many different image degradations. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing it to recent methods in
real-world SR and show that our proposed approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art works in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results,

hand methods such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics that build a bias
potential based on few order parameters or collective variables. On the other
hand, tempering methods such as replica exchange that combine different
thermodynamic ensembles in one single expanded ensemble. We instead adopt a
unifying perspective, focusing on the target probability distribution sampled
by the different methods. This allows us to introduce a new class of
collective-variables-based bias potentials that can be used to sample any of
the expanded ensembles normally sampled via replica exchange. We also provide a
practical implementation, by properly adapting the iterative scheme of the
recently developed on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling method [Invernizzi
and Parrinello, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11.7 (2020)], which was originally
introduced for metadynamics-like sampling. The resulting method is very general
and can be used to achieve different types of enhanced sampling. It is also
reliable and simple to use, since it presents only few and robust external
parameters and has a straightforward reweighting scheme. Furthermore, it can be
used with any number of parallel replicas. We show the versatility of our
approach with applications to multicanonical and multithermal-multibaric
simulations, thermodynamic integration, umbrella sampling, and combinations
thereof.

Activities of Daily Living (ADL). ADL have two specific properties (i) subtle
spatio-temporal patterns and (ii) similar visual patterns varying with time.
Therefore, ADL may look very similar and often necessitate to look at their
fine-grained details to distinguish them. Because the recent spatio-temporal 3D
ConvNets are too rigid to capture the subtle visual patterns across an action,
we propose a novel Video-Pose Network: VPN. The 2 key components of this VPN
are a spatial embedding and an attention network. The spatial embedding
projects the 3D poses and RGB cues in a common semantic space. This enables the
action recognition framework to learn better spatio-temporal features
exploiting both modalities. In order to discriminate similar actions, the
attention network provides two functionalities - (i) an end-to-end learnable
pose backbone exploiting the topology of human body, and (ii) a coupler to
provide joint spatio-temporal attention weights across a video. Experiments
show that VPN outperforms the state-of-the-art results for action
classification on a large scale human activity dataset: NTU-RGB+D 120, its
subset NTU-RGB+D 60, a real-world challenging human activity dataset: Toyota

express the density of the fluid as a linear function of the pressure, and we
use the lubrication approximation to further simplify the fluid dynamics
problem. On the other hand, the structural mechanics is governed by a modified
Donnell shell theory accounting for Kelvin--Voigt-type linearly viscoelastic
mechanical response. The fluid and structural mechanics problems are coupled
through the tube's radial deformation and the hydrodynamic pressure. For small
compressibility numbers and weak coupling, the equations are solved
analytically via a perturbation expansion. Three illustrative problems are
analyzed. First, we obtain exact (but implicit) solutions for the pressure for
steady flow conditions. Second, we solve the transient problem of impulsive
pressurization of the tube's inlet. Third, we analyze the transient response to
an oscillatory inlet pressure. We show that an oscillatory inlet pressure leads
to acoustic streaming in the tube, attributed to the nonlinear pressure
gradient induced by the interplay of FSI and compressibility. Furthermore, we
demonstrate an enhancement in the volumetric flow rate due to FSI coupling. The
hydrodynamic pressure oscillations are shown to exhibit a low-pass frequency

for rotation signatures in these TOIs, using Fast Fourier Transform,
Lomb-Scargle, and wavelet techniques, accompanied by a rigorous visual
inspection. This effort revealed 163 targets with rotation signatures, 131 of
which present unambiguous rotation periods ranging from 0.321 and 13.219 days,
whereas 32 of them present dubious rotation periodicities. One hundred and nine
of these stars show flux fluctuations whose root-cause is not clearly
identified. For 714 TOIs, the light curves show a noisy behavior, corresponding
to typically low-amplitude signals. Our analysis has also revealed 10 TOI stars
with pulsation periodicities ranging from 0.049 to 2.995 days and four
eclipsing binaries. With upcoming TESS data releases, our periodicity analysis
will be expanded to almost all TOI stars, thereby contributing in defining
criteria for follow-up strategy itself, and the study of star-planet
interactions, surface dynamic of host stars and habitability conditions in
planets, among other aspects. In this context, a living catalog is maintained

couplings between multi-component flow in porous media with thermodynamic phase
behavior. The coupled nonlinear system is commonly solved by the fully-implicit
scheme. Various compositional formulations have been proposed. However, severe
convergence issues of Newton solvers can arise under the conventional
formulations. Crossing phase boundaries produces kinks in discretized
equations, and subsequently causing oscillations or even divergence of Newton
iterations. The objective of this work is to develop a smooth formulation that
removes all the property switches and discontinuities associated with phase
changes. We show that it can be very difficult and costly to smooth the
conservation equations directly. Therefore, we first reformulate the coupled
system, so that the discontinuities are transferred to the phase equilibrium
model. In this way a single and concise non-smooth equation is achieved and
then a smoothing approximation can be made. The new formulation with a
smoothing parameter provides smooth transitions of variables across all the
phase regimes. In addition, we employ a continuation method where the solution
progressively evolves toward the target system. We evaluate the efficiency of
the new smooth formulation and the continuation method using several complex
problems. Compared to the standard natural formulation, the developed
formulation and method exhibit superior nonlinear convergence behaviors. The
continuation method leads to smooth and stable iterative performance, with a
negligible impact on solution accuracy. Moreover, it works robustly for a wide
range of flow conditions without parameter tuning.

weak-point or strong-correlated disorder dominates based on characterizing the
distribution of the interaction forces between objects mapped in large
fields-of-view. We illustrate our proposal with the case-study system of vortex
structures nucleated in type-II superconductors with different pinning
landscapes. Interaction force distributions are computed from individual vortex
positions imaged in thousands-vortices fields-of-view in a
two-orders-of-magnitude-wide vortex-density range. Vortex structures nucleated
in point-disordered media present Gaussian distributions of the interaction
force components. In contrast, if the media have dilute and
randomly-distributed correlated disorder, these distributions present
non-Gaussian algebraically-decaying tails for large force magnitudes. We
propose that detecting this deviation from the Gaussian behavior is a
fingerprint of strong disorder, in our case originated from a dilute
distribution of correlated pinning centers.

transverse and longitudinal optical (TO and LO) modes at the Brillouin zone
center. At low temperature, both modes are strongly damped but sit at a finite
energy ($\sim4$ meV in both samples), shifting to higher energy at room
temperature. These modes are soft due to a proximate structural instability
driven by the sensitivity of Pb-Te and Sn-Te $p$-orbital hybridization to
off-center displacements of the metal atoms. The impact of the soft optical
modes on the low-energy acoustic modes is inferred from the low thermal

the action of a radial electric field is considered. The jet is assumed to be
inviscid and perfectly conducting, and a field is set up by placing the jet
concentrically inside a perfectly cylindrical tube whose wall is maintained at
a constant potential. A nontrivial interaction arises between the hydrodynamics
and the electric field in the annulus, resulting in the formation of
electrocapillary waves. The main objective of the present study is to describe
nonlinear aspects of such axisymmetric waves in the weakly nonlinear regime
which is valid for long waves relative to the undisturbed jet radius. This is
found to be possible if two conditions hold: the outer electrode radius is not
too small, and the applied electric field is sufficiently strong. Under these
conditions long waves are shown to be dispersive and a weakly nonlinear theory
can be developed to describe the evolution of the disturbances. The canonical
system that arises is the Kortweg de-Vries equation with coefficients that vary
as the electric field and the electrode radius are varied. Interestingly, the
coefficient of the highest order third derivative term does not change sign and
remains strictly positive, whereas the coefficient $\alpha$ of the nonlinear
term can change sign for certain values of the parameters. This finding implies
that solitary electrocapillary waves are possible; there are waves of elevation
for $\alpha>0$ and of depression for $\alpha<0$. Regions in parameter space are
identified where such waves are found.

introduce the use of a cost-sensitive multi-class adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)
algorithm, which we call SAMME.C2, to handle such imbalances. To calibrate
SAMME.C2 algorithm, we use empirical data collected from a telematics program
in Canada and we find improved assessment of driving behavior with telematics

outperform other models that can handle class imbalances: SAMME, SAMME with

We use only reported deaths in the two weeks after the first death to determine
infection parameters, in order to make predictions of hidden variables such as
the time dependence of the number of infections. Early deaths are sporadic and
discrete so the use of network models of epidemic spread is imperative, with
the network itself a crucial random variable. Location-specific population age
distributions and population densities must be taken into account when
attempting to fit these events with parametrized models. These characteristics
render naive Bayesian model comparison impractical as the networks have to be
large enough to avoid finite-size effects. We reformulated this problem as the
statistical physics of independent location-specific `balls' attached to every
model in a six-dimensional lattice of 56448 parametrized models by elastic
springs, with model-specific `spring constants' determined by the stochasticity
of network epidemic simulations for that model. The distribution of balls then
determines all Bayes posterior expectations. Important characteristics of the
contagion are determinable: the fraction of infected patients that die
($0.017\pm 0.009$), the expected period an infected person is contagious ($22
\pm 6$ days) and the expected time between the first infection and the first
death ($25 \pm 8$ days) in the US. The rate of exponential increase in the
number of infected individuals is $0.18\pm 0.03$ per day, corresponding to 65
million infected individuals in one hundred days from a single initial
infection, which fell to 166000 with even imperfect social distancing
effectuated two weeks after the first recorded death. The fraction of compliant
socially-distancing individuals matters less than their fraction of social

water-rich and have a large scale-height, though attempts to characterize it
have yielded ambiguous results. Here we present a sensitive search for water
and TiO in its atmosphere at high spectral resolution using the Gemini North
telescope and the GRACES spectrograph. We combine observations with previous
observations from Subaru and CFHT, improving the constraints on the presence of
water vapor. We adopt parametric models with an updated planet radius based on
recent measurements, and use a cross-correlation technique to maximize
sensitivity. Our results are consistent with atmospheres that are cloudy or
contain minimal amounts of water and TiO. Using these parametric models, we
rule out a water-rich atmosphere (VMR >= 0.1%) with a mean molecular weight of
<= 15 g/mol at a 3 sigma confidence level, improving on the previous limit by a
significant margin. For TiO, we rule out a mean molecular weight of <= 5 g/mol
with a 3 sigma confidence level for a VMR greater than 10^-8; for a VMR of
greater than 10^-7, the limit rises to a mean molecular weight of <= 10 g/mol.
We can rule out low mean-molecular-weight chemical equilibrium models both
including and excluding TiO/VO at very high confidence levels (> 10 sigma).
Overall, our results are consistent with an atmosphere with a high mean
molecular weight and/or clouds, or no atmosphere.

functions. In many applications, the objective function can be evaluated at
multiple fidelities to enable a trade-off between the cost and accuracy. To
reduce the optimization cost, many multi-fidelity BO methods have been
proposed. Despite their success, these methods either ignore or over-simplify
the strong, complex correlations across the fidelities, and hence can be
inefficient in estimating the objective function. To address this issue, we
propose Deep Neural Network Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization (DNN-MFBO)

fidelities to improve the objective function estimation and hence the
optimization performance. We use sequential, fidelity-wise Gauss-Hermite

the advantages of our method in both synthetic benchmark datasets and
real-world applications in engineering design.

energy/spectral dimension associated with PCDs potentially brings great
benefits such as for material decomposition, beam hardening and metal artifact
reduction, as well as low-dose CT imaging. However, X-ray PCDs are currently
limited by several technical issues, particularly charge splitting (including
charge sharing and K-shell fluorescence re-absorption or escaping) and pulse
pile-up effects which distort the energy spectrum and compromise the data
quality. Correction of raw PCD measurements with hardware improvement and
analytic modeling is rather expensive and complicated. Hence, here we proposed
a deep neural network based PCD data correction approach which directly maps
imperfect data to the ideal data in the supervised learning mode. In this work,
we first establish a complete simulation model incorporating the charge

network for PCD data correction. Next, the trained network is used to correct
separately generated PCD data. The test results demonstrate that the trained

in the long-wavelength approximation which retains the essential physics of the
system and allows for interfacial deformations to be as large as the annular
gap hence accounting for possible touchdown at the inner or outer electrode.
The effects of the electric parameters are evaluated initially by performing a
linear stability analysis which shows excellent agreement with the linear
theory of the full axisymmetric problem in the appropriate long wavelength
regime. The nonlinear interfacial dynamics are investigated by carrying out
direct numerical simulations of the derived long wave models, both in the
absence and presence of electric fields. For non-electrified thin layer flows
(i.e. one of the layers thin relative to the other) the long-time dynamics
agree with the lubrication approximation results found in literature. When the
liquid layers have comparable thickness our results demonstrate the existence
of both finite time and infinite time singularities (asymptotic touching
solutions) in the system. It is shown that a two-side touching solution is
possible for both the non-electrified and perfect dielectric cases, while only
one-side touching is found in the case of leaky dielectric liquids, where the

failures might reflect a preference for learning efficiency over multitasking

that over a large space of parameters the agent sacrifices long-run optimality

nuclear matter at extreme densities, inaccessible by laboratory experiments.
The late inspiral is influenced by the presence of tides, which depend on the
neutron star equation of state. Neutron star mergers are expected to often
produce rapidly-rotating remnant neutron stars that emit gravitational waves.
These will provide clues to the extremely hot post-merger environment. This
signature of nuclear matter in gravitational waves contains most information in
the 2-4 kHz frequency band, which is outside of the most sensitive band of

optimized to study nuclear physics with merging neutron stars. The concept uses
high circulating laser power, quantum squeezing and a detector topology
specifically designed to achieve the high-frequency sensitivity necessary to
probe nuclear matter using gravitational waves. Above one kHz, the proposed
strain sensitivity is comparable to full third-generation detectors at a
fraction of the cost. Such sensitivity changes expected event rates for
detection of post-merger remnants from approximately one per few decades with
two A+ detectors to a few per year, and potentially allows for the first
gravitational-wave observations of supernovae, isolated neutron stars, and
other exotica.

Existing methods to remove EMG artifacts include independent component analysis
(ICA), and other high-order statistical methods. However, these methods can not
effectively remove most of EMG artifacts. Here, we proposed a modified ICA
model for EMG artifacts removal in the EEG, which is called EMG Removal by
Adding Sources of EMG (ERASE). In this new approach, additional channels of
real EMG from neck and head muscles (reference artifacts) were added as inputs
to ICA in order to ""force"" the most power from EMG artifacts into a few
independent components (ICs). The ICs containing EMG artifacts (the ""artifact
ICs"") were identified and rejected using an automated procedure. Simulation
results showed ERASE removed EMG artifacts from EEG significantly more
effectively than conventional ICA. Subsequently, EEG was collected from 8
healthy participants while they moved their hands to test the realistic
efficacy of this approach. Results showed that ERASE successfully removed EMG
artifacts (on average, about 75% of EMG artifacts were removed when using real
EMGs as reference artifacts) while preserving the expected EEG features related
to movement. We also tested the ERASE procedure using simulated EMGs as
reference artifacts (about 63% of EMG artifacts removed). Compared to
conventional ICA, ERASE removed on average 26% more EMG artifacts from EEG.
These results indicate that using additional real or simulated EMG sources can
increase the effectiveness of ICA in removing EMG artifacts from EEG. Combined
with automated artifact IC rejection, ERASE also minimizes potential user bias.

problems: (i) finding the probably approximately correct (PAC) best-$k$ items

sample complexity upper bound matches the lower bound up to a constant factor.
For the exact best-$k$ items selection, we first prove a worst-instance lower

algorithms: one works for $k=1$ and is sample complexity optimal up to a loglog
factor, and the other works for all values of $k$ and is sample complexity

(ICA) approach for removal of EMG artifacts from EEG, and referred to as EMG
Reduction by Adding Sources of EMG (ERASE). Here, we tested ERASE on EEG
recorded from six TBI patients with hemicraniectomies while they performed a
thumb flexion task. ERASE removed a mean of 52 +/- 12% (mean +/- S.E.M)
(maximum 73%) of EMG artifacts. In contrast, conventional ICA removed a mean of
27 +/- 19\% (mean +/- S.E.M) of EMG artifacts from EEG. In particular,
high-gamma synchronization was significantly improved in the contralateral hand
motor cortex area within the hemicraniectomy site after ERASE was applied. We
computed fractal dimension (FD) of EEG high-gamma on each channel. We found
relative FD of high-gamma over hemicraniectomy after applying ERASE were
strongly correlated to the amplitude of finger flexion force. Results showed
that significant correlation coefficients across the electrodes related to
thumb flexion averaged 0.76, while the coefficients across the homologous
electrodes in non-hemicraniectomy areas were nearly 0. Across all subjects, an
average of 83% of electrodes significantly correlated with force was located in
the hemicraniectomy areas after applying ERASE. After conventional ICA, only
19% of electrodes with significant correlations were located in the
hemicraniectomy. These results indicated that the new approach isolated
electrophysiological features during finger motor activation while selectively

wall shape and the thread interfacial dynamics. The linearized system is
studied by the Floquet theory due to the presence of non-constant coefficients
in the equation and the spectrum is computed numerically via the
Fourier-Floquet-Hill method. The resulting features agree qualitatively with
those obtained based on a lubrication model in the thin annulus limit, where
the short-wave disturbances that would be stabilizing owing to the capillarity
in the absence of wall corrugation, can excite some unstable long waves. Those
results from the linear theory are also confirmed numerically by the direct
numerical simulation on the evolution equations. Meanwhile, a transition on the
dominant modes from the one for a tube without corrugation to the one with wall
shape included is found. Finally the drop formation is shown in the nonlinear
regime when the pinch off of the core thread is obtained. The annular film
drainage regime is also approached slowly along with pinching when the tube
wall is close to the thread interface. In addition, our results demonstrate the

spin-orbit-coupled system, moving of the potential will induce a
velocity-dependent effective detuning. This induced detuning breaks the spin
symmetry and makes the ground-state transporting channel be spin-$\uparrow$
($\downarrow$) favored while makes the excited-state transporting channel be
spin-$\downarrow$ ($\uparrow$) favored for a positive-direction
(negative-direction) transporting. When the $\delta$-potential well moves at a
small velocity, both the ground-state and the excited-state channels contribute
to the transportation, and thus both the spin components can be efficiently
transported. However, when the moving velocity of the $\delta$-potential well
exceeds a critical value, the induced detuning is large enough to eliminate the
excited bound state, and makes the ground bound state the only transporting

constraints are included to ensure their resilience and ability to operate in
islanded mode. However, unscheduled islanding events may trigger cascading
disconnections of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) inside the MG due to the
transient response, leading to a partial or full loss of load. In this paper, a
min-max-min, hybrid, stochastic-robust investment planning model is proposed to
obtain a resilient MG considering both High-Impact-Low-Frequency (HILF) and
Low-Impact-High-Frequency (LIHF) uncertainties. The HILF uncertainty pertains
to the unscheduled islanding of the MG after a disastrous event, and the LIHF
uncertainty relates to correlated loads and DER generation, characterized by a
set of scenarios. The MG resilience under both types of uncertainty is ensured
by incorporating static and transient islanding constraints into the proposed
investment model. The inclusion of transient response constraints leads to a
min-max-min problem with a non-linear dynamic frequency response model that
cannot be solved directly by available optimization tools. Thus, in this paper,
a three-stage solution approach is proposed to find the optimal investment
plan. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on the CIGRE 18-node

distinctive peaks and valleys that do not exist in the standard correlation
functions. Their locations are robust against the redshifts and the background
geometry, however it is unlikely that they can be used as ``standard rulers''
to probe the cosmic expansion history. Nonetheless we find that these features
may be used to probe parameters related with the structure formation history,
such as the values of $\sigma_8$ and the galaxy bias. Finally, after conducting
a comprehensive analysis using the full shapes of the $W(s)$s and $W_{\Delta

improve the cosmological parameter constraints. Compared with using only the
standard correlation function, the combinations of MCFs with $\alpha=0,\ 0.5,\
1$ and $\alpha=0,\ -1,\ -0.5,\ 0.5,\ 1$ can improve the constraints on

neural networks have recently shown promising results on some classic NP-hard
problems. These are single-level optimization problems with only one player.
Multilevel combinatorial optimization problems are their generalization,
encompassing situations with multiple players taking decisions sequentially. By
framing them in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting, we devise a
value-based method to learn to solve multilevel budgeted combinatorial problems
involving two players in a zero-sum game over a graph. Our framework is based
on a simple curriculum: if an agent knows how to estimate the value of
instances with budgets up to $B$, then solving instances with budget $B+1$ can
be done in polynomial time regardless of the direction of the optimization by
checking the value of every possible afterstate. Thus, in a bottom-up approach,
we generate datasets of heuristically solved instances with increasingly larger
budgets to train our agent. We report results close to optimality on graphs up
to $100$ nodes and a $185 \times$ speedup on average compared to the quickest
exact solver known for the Multilevel Critical Node problem, a max-min-max
trilevel problem that has been shown to be at least $\Sigma_2^p$-hard.

an upstream supply of information. The combined work of theory and experiment
has elucidated how these systems break symmetry during developmental
transitions. Given such transitions are multiple and their temporal ordering is
crucial, an equally important question is how these developmental transitions
are coordinated in time. Using a minimal mass-conserved substrate-depletion
model for symmetry breaking as our case study, we elucidate mechanisms by which
cells and tissues can couple reaction-diffusion driven symmetry breaking to the
timing of developmental transitions, arguing that the dependence of patterning
mode on system size may be a generic principle by which developing organisms
measure time. By analyzing different regimes of our model, simulated on growing

UDA methods need both source and target data to train models which perform
image translation (harmonization) or learn domain-invariant features. However,
training a model for each target domain is time consuming and computationally
expensive, even infeasible when target domain data are scarce or source data
are unavailable due to data privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel self
domain adapted network (SDA-Net) that can rapidly adapt itself to a single test
subject at the testing stage, without using extra data or training a UDA model.
The SDA-Net consists of three parts: adaptors, task model, and auto-encoders.
The latter two are pre-trained offline on labeled source images. The task model
performs tasks like synthesis, segmentation, or classification, which may
suffer from the domain shift problem. At the testing stage, the adaptors are
trained to transform the input test image and features to reduce the domain
shift as measured by the auto-encoders, and thus perform domain adaptation. We
validated our method on retinal layer segmentation from different OCT scanners
and T1 to T2 synthesis with T1 from different MRI scanners and with different
imaging parameters. Results show that our SDA-Net, with a single test subject
and a short amount of time for self adaptation at the testing stage, can

antennas are active in each channel use. The probing waveforms are orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) type. The OFDM carriers are divided into
two groups, one that is used by the active antennas in a shared fashion, and
another one, where each subcarrier is assigned to an active antenna in an
exclusive fashion (private subcarriers). Target estimation is carried out based
on the received and transmitted symbols. The system communicates information
via the transmitted OFDM data symbols and the pattern of active antennas in a

systems based on a Human-In-The-Loop Machine Learning (HITL-ML) paradigm, in
which one or many human annotators and an automatic classifier (trained at
least partially by the human annotators) label an incoming stream of instances.
This is typical of many near-real-time social media analytics and web
applications, including annotating social media posts during emergencies by
digital volunteer groups. From a practical perspective, low-quality human
annotations result in wrong labels for retraining automated classifiers and
indirectly contribute to the creation of inaccurate classifiers.
  Considering human annotation as a psychological process allows us to address
these limitations. We show that human annotation quality is dependent on the
ordering of instances shown to annotators and can be improved by local changes
in the instance sequence/order provided to the annotators, yielding a more
accurate annotation of the stream. We adapt a theoretically-motivated human
error framework of mistakes and slips for the human annotation task to study
the effect of ordering instances (i.e., an ""annotation schedule""). Further, we
propose an error-avoidance approach to the active learning paradigm for stream
processing applications robust to these likely human errors (in the form of
slips) when deciding a human annotation schedule. We support the human error
framework using crowdsourcing experiments and evaluate the proposed algorithm
against standard baselines for active learning via extensive experimentation on

various domains. Sparse Matrix-Matrix multiplication (SpMM) is a fundamental
operator in GNNs, which performs a multiplication between a sparse matrix and a
dense matrix. Accelerating SpMM on parallel hardware like GPUs can face the
following challenges: From the GNN application perspective, the compatibility
needs to be considered. General GNN algorithms require SpMM-like operations
(e.g., pooling) between matrices, which are not supported in current
high-performance GPU libraries (e.g., Nvidia cuSPARSE). Moreover, the
sophisticated preprocessing in previous implementations will lead to heavy data
format conversion overheads in GNN frameworks. From the GPU hardware
perspective, optimizations in SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector) designs on GPUs do
not apply well to SpMM. SpMM exposes the column-wise parallelism in the dense
output matrix, but straightforward generalization from SpMV leads to
inefficient, uncoalesced access to sparse matrix in global memory. The sparse
row data can be reused among GPU threads, which is neither possible in SpMM
designs inherited from SpMV.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose GE-SpMM. GE-SpMM performs SpMM-like
operation on sparse matrices represented in the most common Compressed Sparse
Row (CSR) format, so it can be embedded in GNN frameworks with no preprocessing
overheads and support general GNN algorithms. We introduce the Coalesced Row
Caching method to process columns in parallel and ensure coalesced access to
sparse matrix data. We also present the Coarse-grained Warp Merging to reduce
redundant data loading among GPU warps. Experiments on a real-world graph
dataset show that GE-SpMM achieves up to 1.41X speedup over Nvidia cuSPARSE and
up to 1.81X over GraphBLAST. We also embed GE-SpMM in GNN frameworks and get up
to 3.67X speedup over popular GNN models like GCN and GraphSAGE.

control the spread of the epidemic. These countermeasures seek to restrict
human mobility because COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that is spread

the urgency to effectively evaluate the outcome of human restriction policies

(e.g., regional lockdown, telecommuting, screening). Users can conveniently
designate the spatial and temporal ranges for different mobility restriction

paradigm that has been applied in many real-world applications. In contrast to
the simple logical vector in single-label learning (SLL) and multi-label
learning (MLL), LDL assigns labels with a description degree to each instance.
In practice, two challenges exist in LDL, namely, how to address the
dimensional gap problem during the learning process of LDL and how to exactly
recover label distributions from existing logical labels, i.e., Label
Enhancement (LE). For most existing LDL and LE algorithms, the fact that the
dimension of the input matrix is much higher than that of the output one is
alway ignored and it typically leads to the dimensional reduction owing to the
unidirectional projection. The valuable information hidden in the feature space
is lost during the mapping process. To this end, this study considers
bidirectional projections function which can be applied in LE and LDL problems
simultaneously. More specifically, this novel loss function not only considers
the mapping errors generated from the projection of the input space into the
output one but also accounts for the reconstruction errors generated from the
projection of the output space back to the input one. This loss function aims
to potentially reconstruct the input data from the output data. Therefore, it
is expected to obtain more accurate results. Finally, experiments on several
real-world datasets are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method for both LE and LDL.

some works introduce the meta-optimization idea into the recommendation

all users and then learning the local parameters for each user separately.
However, most meta-learning based recommendation approaches adopt
model-agnostic meta-learning for parameter initialization, where the global

paper, we design two memory matrices that can store task-specific memories and
feature-specific memories. Specifically, the feature-specific memories are used
to guide the model with personalized parameter initialization, while the
task-specific memories are used to guide the model fast predicting the user
preference. And we adopt a meta-optimization approach for optimizing the

that, as a special Riemannian manifold, $({\mathbb R}^{m+p},e^{-|x|^2/m}\ol g)$

mean curvature flow we considered here turns out to be equivalent to a special
variation of the ``{\em conformal mean curvature flow}\,'' which we have

that any immersed compact submanifold in the standard Gaussian space, with the
square norm of the position vector being not equal to $m$, will blow up at a
finite time under the mean curvature flow, in the sense that either the
position or the curvature blows up to infinity; Moreover, by this main theorem,
the interval $[0,T)$ of time in which the flowing submanifolds keep regular has
some certain optimal upper bound, and it can reach the bound if and only if the
initial submanifold either shrinks to the origin or expands uniformly to
infinity under the flow. Besides the main theorem, we also obtain some other
interesting conclusions which not only play their key roles in proving the main
theorem but also characterize in part the geometric behavior of the flow, being

details with ground-based telescopes. The H II regions in M51 were observed
using the 2.16 m telescope of the National Astronomical Observatories of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and the 6.5 m Multiple Mirror Telescope with
spatial resolution of less than $\sim100$ pc. We obtain a total of 113 spectra
across the galaxy and combine the literature data of Croxall et al. to derive a
series of physical properties, including the gas-phase extinction, stellar
population age, star formation rate (SFR) surface density, and oxygen
abundance. The spatial distributions and radial profiles of these properties
are investigated in order to study the characteristics of M51 and the clues to
the formation and evolution of this galaxy. M51 presents a mild radial
extinction gradient. The lower gas-phase extinction in the north spiral arms
compared to the south arms are possibly caused by the past encounters with the
companion galaxy of NGC 5195. A number of H II regions have the stellar age
between 50 and 500 Myr, consistent with the recent interaction history by
simulations in the literatures. The SFR surface density presents a mild radial
gradient, which is ubiquitous in spiral galaxies. There is a negative
metallicity gradient of $-0.08$ dex $R_{e}^{-1}$ in the disk region, which is
also commonly found in many spiral galaxies. It is supported by the
""inside-out"" scenario of galaxy formation. We find a positive abundance
gradient of 0.26 dex $R_{e}^{-1}$ in the inner region. There are possible
reasons causing the positive gradient, including the freezing of the chemical
enrichment due to the star-forming quenching in the bulge and the gas infall
and dilution due to the pseudobulge growth and/or galactic interaction.

p-type in order to facilitate their potential application in different devices.
Here, we report a systematic study on the equivalent electrical ""doping"" effect
of - single sulfur vacancies (V1S) in monolayer WS2 and MoS2 by studying the
interface interaction of WS2-Au and MoS2-Au contacts. Based on our first
principles calculations, we found that the V1S can significantly alter the
semiconductor behavior of both monolayer WS2 and MoS2 so that they can exhibit
the character of electron acceptor (p-type) as well as electron donor (n-type)
when they are contacted with gold. For relatively low V1S densities
(approximately < 7% for MoS2 and < 3% for WS2), the monolayer TMDC serves as
electron acceptor. As the V1S density increases beyond the threshold densities,
the MoS2 and WS2 play the role of electron donor. The significant impact V1S
can have on monolayer WS2 and MoS2 may be useful for engineering its electrical
behavior and offers an alternative way to tune the semiconductor TMDCs to
exhibit either n-type or p-type behavior.

  gradient for collective neural crest cell migration",,,,,"q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modeling cell interactions such as co-attraction and contact-inhibition of
locomotion is essential for understanding collective cell migration. Here, we
propose a novel deep reinforcement learning model for collective neural crest
cell migration. We apply the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm in
association with a particle dynamics simulation environment to train agents to
determine the migration path. Because of the different migration mechanisms of
leader and follower neural crest cells, we train two types of agents (leaders
and followers) to learn the collective cell migration behavior. For a leader
agent, we consider a linear combination of a global task, resulting in the
shortest path to the target source, and a local task, resulting in a
coordinated motion along the local chemoattractant gradient. For a follower
agent, we consider only the local task. First, we show that the self-driven
forces learned by the leader cell point approximately to the placode, which
means that the agent is able to learn to follow the shortest path to the
target. To validate our method, we compare the total time elapsed for agents to
reach the placode computed using the proposed method and the time computed
using an agent-based model. The distributions of the migration time intervals
calculated using the two methods are shown to not differ significantly. We then
study the effect of co-attraction and contact-inhibition of locomotion to the
collective leader cell migration. We show that the overall leader cell
migration for the case with co-attraction is slower because the co-attraction
mitigates the source-driven effect. In addition, we find that the leader and
follower agents learn to follow a similar migration behavior as in experimental
observations. Overall, our proposed method provides useful insight on how to
apply reinforcement learning techniques to simulate collective cell migration.

study of quantum network protocols for entanglement distribution using the
theory of decision processes, such that optimal protocols (referred to as

evaluating policies. We then provide two algorithms for determining policies,
one of which we prove to be optimal (with respect to fidelity and success

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) regard lesion detection, segmentation and

select 2D MRI slices or regions of interest as the input. In this work, we
present a breast MRI CAD system that can handle 4D multimodal breast MRI data,
and integrate lesion detection, segmentation and characterization with no user
intervention. The proposed CAD system consists of three major stages: region
candidate generation, feature extraction and region candidate classification.
Breast lesions are firstly extracted as region candidates using the novel 3D
multiscale morphological sifting (MMS). The 3D MMS, which uses linear
structuring elements to extract lesion-like patterns, can segment lesions from
breast images accurately and efficiently. Analytical features are then
extracted from all available 4D multimodal breast MRI sequences, including T1-,
T2-weighted and DCE sequences, to represent the signal intensity, texture,
morphological and enhancement kinetic characteristics of the region candidates.
The region candidates are lastly classified as lesion or normal tissue by the
random under-sampling boost (RUSboost), and as malignant or benign lesion by
the random forest. Evaluated on a breast MRI dataset which contains a total of
117 cases with 95 malignant and 46 benign lesions, the proposed system achieves
a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.90 at 3.19 false positives per patient (FPP)
for lesion detection and a TPR of 0.91 at a FPP of 2.95 for identifying
malignant lesions without any user intervention. The average dice similarity
index (DSI) is 0.72 for lesion segmentation. Compared with previously proposed
systems evaluated on the same breast MRI dataset, the proposed CAD system

communication channel to achieve a secure key agreement between two parties
with no prior security association. Their secrecy rate (bit generation rate)
depends heavily on the randomness of the channel, which may reduce
significantly in a stable environment. Existing methods seek to improve the
secrecy rate by injecting artificial noise into the channel. Unfortunately,
noise injection cannot alter the underlying channel state, which depends on the
multipath environment between the transmitter and receiver. Consequently, these
methods are known to leak key bits toward multi-antenna eavesdroppers, which is
capable of filtering the noise through the differential of multiple signal
receptions. This work demonstrates an improved approach to reinforce
physical-layer key generation schemes, e.g., channel randomization. The channel
randomization approach leverages a reconfigurable antenna to rapidly change the
channel state during transmission, and an angle-of-departure (AoD) based
channel estimation algorithm to cancel the changing effects for the intended
receiver. The combined result is a communication channel stable in the eyes of
the intended receiver but randomly changing from the viewpoint of the
eavesdropper. We augmented an existing physical-layer key generation protocol,
iJam, with the proposed approach and developed a full-fledged remote
instrumentation platform to demonstrate its performance. Our evaluations show
that augmentation does not affect the bit error rate (BER) of the intended

location annotation which can be expensive to obtain. To reduce the annotation
cost, one attractive solution is to leverage a large number of unlabeled images
to build a crowd counting model in semi-supervised fashion. This paper tackles
the semi-supervised crowd counting problem from the perspective of feature
learning. Our key idea is to leverage the unlabeled images to train a generic
feature extractor rather than the entire network of a crowd counter. The
rationale of this design is that learning the feature extractor can be more
reliable and robust towards the inevitable noisy supervision generated from the
unlabeled data. Also, on top of a good feature extractor, it is possible to
build a density map regressor with much fewer density map annotations.
Specifically, we proposed a novel semi-supervised crowd counting method which
is built upon two innovative components: (1) a set of inter-related binary
segmentation tasks are derived from the original density map regression task as
the surrogate prediction target; (2) the surrogate target predictors are
learned from both labeled and unlabeled data by utilizing a proposed
self-training scheme which fully exploits the underlying constraints of these
binary segmentation tasks. Through experiments, we show that the proposed
method is superior over the existing semisupervised crowd counting method and
other representative baselines.

  The dimension inference problem depends only on discrete data of the ordering

a construction of a filtration of Dowker complexes, associated to measurements

used to infer the intrinsic dimension. We prove convergence theorems that

(CNNs) by reducing the computation cost at training time. CNN models are
usually trained on high-performance computers and only the trained models are
deployed to edge devices. But the statically trained model cannot adapt
dynamically in a real environment and may result in low accuracy for new
inputs. On-device training by learning from the real-world data after
deployment can greatly improve accuracy. However, the high computation cost
makes training prohibitive for resource-constrained devices. To tackle this
problem, we explore the computational redundancies in training and reduce the
computation cost by two complementary approaches: self-supervised early
instance filtering on data level and error map pruning on the algorithm level.
The early instance filter selects important instances from the input stream to
train the network and drops trivial ones. The error map pruning further prunes
out insignificant computations when training with the selected instances.
Extensive experiments show that the computation cost is substantially reduced
without any or with marginal accuracy loss. For example, when training
ResNet-110 on CIFAR-10, we achieve 68% computation saving while preserving full
accuracy and 75% computation saving with a marginal accuracy loss of 1.3%.
Aggressive computation saving of 96% is achieved with less than 0.1% accuracy
loss when quantization is integrated into the proposed approaches. Besides,
when training LeNet on MNIST, we save 79% computation while boosting accuracy
by 0.2%.

the physical components, making it challenging for neural network models to
achieve the same performance as on the digital hardware. Previous works in
mitigating intrinsic noise assumed the knowledge of the noise model, and
retraining the neural networks accordingly was required. In this paper, we
propose a noise-agnostic method to achieve robust neural network performance
against any noise setting. Our key observation is that the degradation of
performance is due to the distribution shifts in network activations, which are
caused by the noise. To properly track the shifts and calibrate the biased
distributions, we propose a ""noise-aware"" batch normalization layer, which is
able to align the distributions of the activations under variational noise
inherent in the analog environments. Our method is simple, easy to implement,
general to various noise settings, and does not need to retrain the models. We
conduct experiments on several tasks in computer vision, including
classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving robust performance under
a wide range of noise settings, more reliable than existing methods. We believe
that our simple yet general method can facilitate the adoption of analog

This is evidence for streamer formation during corona flashes that occur with

years due to the infinite quality factor (Q-factor) resonance and extremely
localized field. In this study, BICs have been demonstrated by dielectric
metasurfaces with hybrid surface lattice resonance (SLR) in the experiment. By
breaking the symmetry of geometry, SLR can be easily switched between BICs and
quasi-BICs. Comparing with literature, switching between BICs and quasi-BICs is
usually accompanied by wavelength shift. Here, a design rule is proposed to
prevent the wavelength shift when the Q-factor is changing. Also, such a design
also makes subsequent identification of the laser threshold more credible. Due
to the high Q-factor, low threshold laser is one of the intuitive applications
of BICs. Utilize the high localized ability of BICs, low threshold BICs laser
can be achieved by the dielectric metasurface immersed with Rhodamine 6G.
Interestingly, due to the high Q-factor resonance of BICs, the laser signals
and images can be observed in almost transparent samples. Not only the BICs
laser is demonstrated in the experiment, but also the mechanism of BICs is
deeply analyzed. This study can help readers better understand this novel
feature of BICs, and provide the way for engineer BICs metasurfaces. The device
can provide various applications, including laser, optical sensing, non-linear

larval neuromuscular neuron is very small. The percentage of released molecules
was found to be only 4.5% for simple events and 10.7% for complex (i.e.,
oscillating or flickering) events. This large content, combined with partial
release controlled by fluctuations of the fusion pore, offers presynaptic
plasticity that can be widely regulated. Two works published in 2010 suggested
that the Katz principle, [1] was incorrect for all-or-none release and that
only part of the chemical load of vesicles was released during exocytosis, at
least as measured as a full spike during amperometry. [2] The combination of
electrochemical methods to measure both release and vesicle content in 2015
added a wealth of information to support the concept of partial release in
exocytosis. [3] Additionally, this has recently been supported by work with
TIRF microscopy showing 'subquantal' release from vesicles in adrenal
chromaffin cells and using super-resolution STED microscopy. [4] It appears
that the full event generally involves release of only part of the load of
chemical messenger in single-cell model systems like adrenal chromaffin and
PC12 cells. Is this also true at living neurons in a nervous system and to what
extent? To answer this critical question, we quantified the number of
octopamine molecules in the neuromuscular neurons of Drosophila larvae by
adapting an amperometric technique developed in our

increasingly adopted for plasma-based materials processing due to their high
processing rates and lower substrate damage. Past studies related to complex
plasma dynamics and higher harmonics generation in such systems were limited to
constant voltage/current conditions, whereas, industrial systems are mostly
driven by constant power density sources. In the present study, using
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation, we explore the dynamics of collisionless
symmetric capacitive discharges that is operated at constant power densities.
Our focus is on the effect of the driving frequency on the discharge parameters
like the electron density/temperature, the electron energy distribution
function (EEDF), the ion energy distribution function (IEDF), and the
generation of higher harmonics in the device. The simulations are performed for
a driving frequency from 27.12-100 MHz in argon plasma at a gas pressure of 1
Pa and for two values of the power density, namely, 2 kW/m3 and 20 kW/m3. It is
observed that the required discharge voltage for maintaining constant power
density decreases and discharge current increases with an increase in the
driving frequency. A transition frequency is observed at both power densities.
The density decreases (electron temperature increases) before the transition
frequency and the trend is reversed after crossing the transition frequency.
The EEDF shows an enhancement in the population of the mid-energy range of
electrons as the driving frequency increases up to the transition frequency
thereby changing the shape of EEDF from bi-Maxwellian to nearly Maxwellian, and
then transforms into a nearly bi-Maxwellian at higher driving frequencies.

showing that infinitely deep ResNets does not suffer from undesirable

establish analogous backward-propagation results, which directly relate to the

show that the dynamics of quantities of interest converge, at initialization,

Structural Re-parameterization. Such a methodology distinguishes ResRep from

stochastic fluctuations in compute power and communication link qualities

computed by exploiting statistical properties of compute and communication

to distributed non-linear regression and classification problems with
multioutput labels. The key innovation of our work is to exploit distributed

of this model relies on the MTPC scheme, which encodes the interaural time

the advantages of SNN, such as event-driven and power efficiency. The MTPC is
pipelined with two different SNN architectures, the convolutional SNN and
recurrent SNN, by which it shows the applicability to various SNNs. This
proposal is evaluated by the microphone collected location-dependent acoustic

approach relies on a knowledge base integrating varied security data, e.g.,
attacks, attack steps, and security patterns that are generic and re-usable

consists in assisting developers in the design of Attack Defense Trees
expressing the attacker possibilities to compromise an application and the
defenses that may be implemented. These defenses are given under the form of
security pattern combinations. In the second stage, these trees are used to
guide developers in the test case generation. After the test case execution,
test verdicts show whether an application is vulnerable to the threats modelled
by an ADTree. The last stage of the approach checks whether behavioural
properties of security patterns hold in the application traces collected while
the test case execution. These properties are formalised with LTL properties,
which are generated from the knowledge base. Developers do not have to write

transition from conventional centralized learning systems towards large-scale

In this regard, democratized learning (Dem-AI) lays out a holistic philosophy
with underlying principles for building large-scale distributed and
democratized machine learning systems. The outlined principles are meant to
study a generalization in distributed learning systems that goes beyond
existing mechanisms such as federated learning. Moreover, such learning systems
rely on hierarchical self-organization of well-connected distributed learning
agents who have limited and highly personalized data and can evolve and
regulate themselves based on the underlying duality of specialized and
generalized processes. Inspired by Dem-AI philosophy, a novel distributed
learning approach is proposed in this paper. The approach consists of a
self-organizing hierarchical structuring mechanism based on agglomerative
clustering, hierarchical generalization, and corresponding learning mechanism.
Subsequently, hierarchical generalized learning problems in recursive forms are
formulated and shown to be approximately solved using the solutions of
distributed personalized learning problems and hierarchical update mechanisms.
To that end, a distributed learning algorithm, namely DemLearn is proposed.
Extensive experiments on benchmark MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, FE-MNIST, and CIFAR-10
datasets show that the proposed algorithms demonstrate better results in the
generalization performance of learning models in agents compared to the
conventional FL algorithms. The detailed analysis provides useful observations
to further handle both the generalization and specialization performance of the
learning models in Dem-AI systems.

who regularly test, share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as
a contact tests positive for the disease, and opaques who do none of these.

transparency level, disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be

beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace, and simple

differential equationy. This expression is the sum of entropy corresponding to
the two event horizons and the interaction term. The interaction term is a

acceptance (acceptance by halting in a particular configuration, or by stable

propose a hybrid loss function that pays more attention to lesion regions and
encourages high-level contextual consistency. Finally, we segment the lesion
region from the synthesized pseudo DWI, where the segmentation network is based
on switchable normalization and channel calibration for better performance.
Experimental results showed that our framework achieved the top performance on

(DS-Sync) to realize communication efficiency without sacrificing convergence

workers into non-overlap groups to synchronize independently in a
bottleneck-free manner. Meanwhile, it maintains convergence accuracy by
iteratively shuffling workers among different groups to ensure a global

of the most important attack vector for C++ binaries.
  In this paper, we present VTable Pointer Separation (VPS), a practical
binary-level defense against vtable hijacking in C++ applications. Unlike
previous binary-level defenses, which rely on unsound static analyses to match
classes to virtual callsites, VPS achieves a more accurate protection by
restricting virtual callsites to validly created objects. More specifically,
VPS ensures that virtual callsites can only use objects created at valid object
construction sites, and only if those objects can reach the callsite. Moreover,
VPS explicitly prevents false positives (falsely identified virtual callsites)
from breaking the binary, an issue existing work does not handle correctly or
at all. We evaluate the prototype implementation of VPS on a diverse set of
complex, real-world applications (MongoDB, MySQL server, Node.js, SPEC

multiple source domains a model that generalizes well to unseen domains. A main
challenge for DG is that the available source domains often exhibit limited
diversity, hampering the model's ability to learn to generalize. We therefore
employ a data generator to synthesize data from pseudo-novel domains to augment
the source domains. This explicitly increases the diversity of available
training domains and leads to a more generalizable model. To train the
generator, we model the distribution divergence between source and synthesized
pseudo-novel domains using optimal transport, and maximize the divergence. To
ensure that semantics are preserved in the synthesized data, we further impose
cycle-consistency and classification losses on the generator. Our method,
L2A-OT (Learning to Augment by Optimal Transport) outperforms current
state-of-the-art DG methods on four benchmark datasets.

preparation of the initial entangled state, imperfections in the laser pulses,
momentum spread of the initial atomic wave packet, measurement errors,
spontaneous emission, and atom loss. We determine that, for each of these

form, $\overline{\langle \Pi \rangle} = \Pi_0 \cos( N \phi )$, where $\phi$ is
the interferometer phase and $N$ is the number of atoms prepared in the
maximally entangled Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger state. Correspondingly, the
minimum phase uncertainty has the general form, $\Delta\phi = (\Pi_0 N)^{-1}$.
Each error manifests itself through a reduction of the amplitude of the parity
oscillations, $\Pi_0$, below the ideal value of $\Pi_0 = 1$. For each of the
errors, we derive an analytic result that expresses the dependence of $\Pi_0$
on error parameter(s) and $N$, and also obtain a simplified approximate
expression valid when the error is small. Based on the performed analysis,
entanglement-enhanced atom interferometry appears to be feasible with existing

optimise their observing strategy. One of the most ambitious upcoming
spectroscopic surveys is the 4MOST survey. The 4MOST survey facility is a
fibre-fed spectroscopic instrument on the VISTA telescope with a large enough
field of view to survey a large fraction of the southern sky within a few
years. Several Galactic and extragalactic surveys will be carried out
simultaneously, so the combined target density will strongly vary. In this
paper, we describe a new tiling algorithm that can naturally deal with the
large target density variations on the sky and which automatically handles the
different exposure times of targets. The tiling pattern is modelled as a marked
point process, which is characterised by a probability density that integrates
the requirements imposed by the 4MOST survey. The optimal tilling pattern with
respect to the defined model is estimated by the tiles configuration that
maximises the proposed probability density. In order to achieve this
maximisation a simulated annealing algorithm is implemented. The algorithm
automatically finds an optimal tiling pattern and assigns a tentative sky
brightness condition and exposure time for each tile, while minimising the
total execution time that is needed to observe the list of targets in the
combined input catalogue of all surveys. Hence, the algorithm maximises the
long-term observing efficiency and provides an optimal tiling solution for the
survey. While designed for the 4MOST survey, the algorithm is flexible and can
with simple modifications be applied to any other multi-object spectroscopic
survey.

In this architecture, word generation is decomposed into a series of

Deliberation, Abandon and Memory (DAM) module. Each DAM module performs an
adaptive combination of the response-level semantics captured from the encoder
and the word-level semantics specifically selected for generating each word.
Therefore, the responses contain more detailed and non-repetitive descriptions
while maintaining the semantic accuracy. Furthermore, DAM is flexible to
cooperate with existing visual dialogue encoders and adaptive to the encoder
structures by constraining the information selection mode in DAM. We apply DAM
to three typical encoders and verify the performance on the VisDial v1.0

the capability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in dealing with non-Euclidean
data, we use GNNs to differentiate between the propagation patterns of fake and
real news on social media. In particular, we concentrate on two questions: (1)
Without relying on any text information, e.g., tweet content, replies and user
descriptions, how accurately can GNNs identify fake news? Machine learning
models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and avoiding the
dependence on text-based features can make the model less susceptible to the
manipulation of advanced fake news fabricators. (2) How to deal with new,
unseen data? In other words, how does a GNN trained on a given dataset perform
on a new and potentially vastly different dataset? If it achieves
unsatisfactory performance, how do we solve the problem without re-training the
model on the entire data from scratch? We study the above questions on two
datasets with thousands of labelled news items, and our results show that: (1)
GNNs can achieve comparable or superior performance without any text
information to state-of-the-art methods. (2) GNNs trained on a given dataset
may perform poorly on new, unseen data, and direct incremental training cannot
solve the problem---this issue has not been addressed in the previous work that
applies GNNs for fake news detection. In order to solve the problem, we propose
a method that achieves balanced performance on both existing and new datasets,

constrained, in particular the type of galaxy collisions at their origin. We
present MUSE@VLT data of the most prominent outer shell of NGC 474, to
constrain its formation history. The stellar shell spectrum is clearly
detected, with a signal-to-noise ratio of around 65 pix$^{-1}$. We use a full
spectral fitting method to determine the line-of-sight velocity and the age and
metallicity of the shell and associated point-like sources within the MUSE
field of view. We detect six GC candidates and eight PN candidates which are
all kinematically associated to the stellar shell. We show that the shell has
an intermediate metallicity, [M/H] = $-0.83^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$ and a possible
$\alpha$-enrichment, [$\alpha$/Fe] ~ 0.3. Assuming the material of the shell
comes from a lower mass companion, and that the latter had no initial
metallicity gradient, such a stellar metallicity would constrain the mass of
the progenitor to be around 7.4 x 10^8 M$_\odot$, implying a merger mass ratio
of about 1:100. However our census of PNs and earlier photometry of the shell
would suggest a much higher ratio, around 1:20. Given the uncertainties, this
difference is significant only at the ~1sigma level. We discuss the
characteristics of the progenitor, in particular whether the progenitor could
also be composed of stars from the low metallicity outskirts from a more
massive galaxy. Ultimately, the presented data does not allow us to put a firm
constraint on the progenitor mass. We show that at least two globular cluster
candidates possibly associated with the shell are quite young, with ages below
1.5~Gyr. We also note the presence of a young (~1Gyr) stellar population in the
center of NGC 474. The two may have resulted from the same event.

paper, we leverage blockchain as a distributed platform to realize an on-demand

connected devices for witnessing services. A public request is made for witness
statements on the data of a target IoT that is transmitted on its local
network, and subsequently, devices (in close vicinity of the target IoT) offer
witnessing service.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) We develop a system architecture based
on blockchain and smart contract that enables authorities to dynamically avail
a verification service for data of a subject device from a distributed set of
witnesses which are willing to provide (in a privacy-preserving manner) their
local wireless measurement in exchange of monetary return; (2) We then develop
a method to optimally select witnesses in such a way that the verification
error is minimized subject to monetary cost constraints; (3) Lastly, we
evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using real Wi-Fi session traces collected
from a five-storeyed building with more than thirty access points,
representative of a hospital. According to the current pricing schedule of the

of at least seven transiting terrestrial-size, terrestrial-mass planets all
receiving a moderate amount of irradiation. To date, this is the most
observationally favourable system of potentially habitable planets. Since the
announcement of the discovery of TRAPPIST-1 planets in 2016, a growing number
of techniques and approaches have been used and proposed to reveal its true
nature. Here we have compiled a state-of-the-art overview of all the
observational and theoretical constraints that have been obtained so far using
these techniques and approaches. The goal is to get a better understanding of
whether or not TRAPPIST-1 planets can have atmospheres, and if so, what they
are made of. For this, we surveyed the literature on TRAPPIST-1 about topics as
broad as irradiation environment, orbital architecture, transit observations,
density measurements, stellar contamination, and numerical climate and escape
models. Each of these topics adds a brick to our understanding of the likely
atmospheres of the seven planets. We show that (i) HST transit observations,
(ii) density measurements, (iii) atmospheric escape modelling, and (iv) gas
accretion modelling altogether offer solid evidence against the presence of
H2-dominated atmospheres around TRAPPIST-1 planets. This means they likely have
either (i) a high molecular weight atmosphere or (ii) no atmosphere at all.
There are several key challenges ahead to characterize the bulk compositions of
the atmospheres (if present) of TRAPPIST-1 planets. The main one so far is
characterizing and correcting for the effects of stellar contamination.
Fortunately, a new wave of observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and
near-infrared high-resolution ground-based spectrographs on very large
telescopes will bring significant advances in the coming decade.

the form of a network of cosmic defects. Independently of the order of a phase
transition, topology of the defects, and their global or gauge nature, the
defects are expected to emit gravitational waves (GWs) as the network
energy-momentum tensor adapts itself to maintaining {scaling}. We show that the
evolution of any defect network (and for that matter any scaling source) emits
a GW background with spectrum $\Omega_{\rm GW} \propto f^3$ for $f \ll f_0$,
$\Omega_{\rm GW} \propto 1/f^2$ for $f_0 \lesssim f \lesssim f_{\rm eq}$, and
$\Omega_{\rm GW} \propto~const$ (i.e.~exactly scale-invariant) for $f \gg
f_{\rm eq}$, where $f_0$ and $ f_{\rm eq}$ denote respectively the frequencies
corresponding to the present and matter-radiation equality horizons. This
background represents an irreducible emission of GWs from any scaling network
of cosmic defects, with its amplitude characterized only by the symmetry
breaking scale and the nature of the defects. Using classical lattice
simulations we calculate the GW signal emitted by defects created after the
breaking of a global symmetry $O(N) \rightarrow O(N-1)$. We obtain the GW
spectrum for $N$ between 2 and 20 with two different techniques: integrating
over unequal time correlators of the energy momentum tensor, updating our
previous work on smaller lattices, and for the first time, comparing the result
with the real time evolution of the tensor perturbations sourced by the same
defects. Our results validate the equivalence of the two techniques. Using CMB
upper bounds on the defects' energy scale, we discuss the difficulty of
detecting this GW background in the case of global defects.

quantum computation. We analyse a Floquet model with disorder, characterised by
a family of local, time-periodic, random quantum circuits in one spatial
dimension. We observe that the evolution operator enjoys an extra symmetry at
times that are a half-integer multiple of the period. With this we prove that
after the scrambling time, namely when any initial perturbation has propagated
throughout the system, the evolution operator cannot be distinguished from a
(Haar) random unitary when all qubits are measured with Pauli operators. This
indistinguishability decreases as time goes on, which is in high contrast to
the more studied case of (time-dependent) random circuits. We also prove that
the evolution of Pauli operators displays a form of mixing. These results
require the dimension of the local subsystem to be large. In the opposite
regime our system displays a novel form of localisation, produced by the
appearance of effective one-sided walls, which prevent perturbations from
crossing the wall in one direction but not the other.

field, which gives rise to relativistic effects such as the Rashba spin-orbit

ferroelectric phase transition at 25 K are visible in the Raman response and in
the temperature dependences of the carrier density and sheet resistance that

outcomes to the next layer. In the proposed SpinalNet, each layer is split into
three splits: 1) input split, 2) intermediate split, and 3) output split. Input
split of each layer receives a part of the inputs. The intermediate split of
each layer receives outputs of the intermediate split of the previous layer and
outputs of the input split of the current layer. The number of incoming weights

While the accuracy could be largely improved even when the training dataset is

brings smaller updates to deeper CNN layers. In this work, we propose RIFLE - a

updates to the weights of deep CNN layers and improves low-level feature

the overall learning procedure. The experiments show that the use of RIFLE
significantly improves deep transfer learning accuracy on a wide range of

blue horizontal branch (BHB) star. Assuming a luminosity that is characteristic
of BHB stars, the object's radial velocity and proper motions from Gaia Early
Data Release 3 would imply that its Galactic rest-frame velocity exceeds its
local escape velocity. Consequently, the object would be considered a
hypervelocity star, which would prove particularly interesting because its
Galactic trajectory points in our direction. However, based on the
spectroscopic analysis of follow-up observations, we show that the object is
actually a short-period ($P \approx 3.4$ h) single-lined spectroscopic binary
system with a visible B-type star (effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}} =
15\,840\pm160$ K and surface gravity $\log(g) = 4.86\pm0.04$) that is less
luminous than typical BHB stars. Accordingly, the distance of the system is
lower than originally thought, which renders its Galactic orbit bound to the
Galaxy. Nevertheless, it is still an extreme halo object on a highly retrograde
orbit. The abundances of He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Ca are subsolar by
factors from 3 to more than 100, while Fe is enriched by a factor of about 6.
This peculiar chemical composition pattern is most likely caused by atomic
diffusion processes. Combining constraints from astrometry, orbital motion,
photometry, and spectroscopy, we conclude that the visible component is an
unevolved proto-helium white dwarf with a thin hydrogen envelope that was
stripped by a substellar companion through common-envelope ejection. Its unique
configuration renders the binary system an interesting test bed for stellar
binary evolution in general and common-envelope evolution in particular.

substrate is maintained at a fixed temperature, but in the bulk of the fluid
the temperature is allowed to vary. The slope $\varepsilon$ of the liquid/vapor
interface is assumed to be small, as is the ratio of its thickness to that of
the film. Three asymptotic regimes are identified, depending on the
vapor-to-liquid density ratio $\rho_{v}/\rho_{l}$. If $\rho_{v}/\rho_{l}\sim1$
(which implies that the temperature is comparable, but not necessarily close,
to the critical value), the evolution of the interface is driven by the
vertical flow due to liquid/vapor phase transition, with the horizontal flow
being negligible. In the limit $\rho_{v}/\rho_{l}\rightarrow0$, it is the other
way around, and there exists an intermediate regime,
$\rho_{v}/\rho_{l}\sim\varepsilon^{4/3}$, where the two effects are of the same
order. Only the $\rho_{v}/\rho_{l}\rightarrow0$ limit is mathematically similar
to the case of incompressible (Navier--Stokes) liquids, whereas the asymptotic
equations governing the other two regimes are of different types.

that, even when the heavy-quark pair is produced in a color-octet state, ISIs

Regions (CIRs). While CIRs have been explored extensively in the UV band, and
moderately in the X-ray and optical, here we evaluate radio variability from
CIR structures assuming free-free opacity in a dense wind. Our goal is to
conduct a broad parameter study to assess the observational feasibility, and to
this end, we adopt a phenomenological model for a CIR that threads an otherwise
spherical wind. We find that under reasonable assumptions, it is possible to
obtain radio variability at the 10% level. The detailed structure of the folded
light curve depends not only on the curvature of the CIR, the density contrast
of the CIR relative to the wind, and viewing inclination, but also on
wavelength. Comparing light curves at different wavelengths, we find that the
amplitude can change, that there can be phase shifts in the waveform, and the
the entire waveform itself can change. These characterstics could be exploited
to detect the presence of CIRs in dense, hot winds.

in modelling solar-type stars, its abundance in these stars remains a poorly
constrained observational property. This is because the effective temperature
in these stars is not high enough to allow helium ionization, not allowing any
conclusions on its abundance when spectroscopic techniques are employed. To
this end, stellar modellers resort to estimating the initial helium abundance
via a semi-empirical helium-to-heavy element ratio, anchored to the the
standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis value. Depending on the choice of solar
composition used in stellar model computations, the helium-to-heavy element
ratio, ($\Delta Y/\Delta Z$) is found to vary between 1 and 3. In this study,
we use the Kepler ""LEGACY"" stellar sample, for which precise seismic data is

$\Delta Y/\Delta Z$, specifically, 1.4 and 2.0. The stellar grid constructed

been recently widely utilized in robotics to learn the environment and acquire
new skills autonomously. However, an open issue when using deep reinforcement

different learning methods using a simulated robotic arm for the task of

previously trained artificial agent as an advisor (agent-IDeepRL); and (iii)
interactive deep reinforcement learning using a human advisor (human-IDeepRL).
We demonstrate that interactive approaches provide advantages for the learning

magnetic reconnection is presented. The research is based on a particle-in-cell
simulation of asymmetric magnetic reconnection, which include a temperature
gradient across the current layer in addition to density and magnetic field
gradient. We find that none of X-point, flow stagnation point, and local
current density peak coincide. Current and energy balance analyses around the
flow stagnation point and current density peak show consistently that current
dissipation is associated with the divergence of nongyrotropic electron
pressure. Furthermore, the same pressure terms, when combined with shear-type
gradients of the electron flow velocity, also serve to maintain local thermal
energy against convective losses. These effects are similar to those found also
in symmetric magnetic reconnection. In addition, we find here significant
effects related to the convection of current, which we can relate to a
generalized diamagnetic drift by the nongyrotropic pressure divergence.
Therefore, only part of the pressure force serves to dissipate the current

detection (CoSOD) problem for images. CoSOD is an emerging and rapidly growing
extension of salient object detection (SOD), which aims to detect the
co-occurring salient objects in a group of images. However, existing CoSOD
datasets often have a serious data bias, assuming that each group of images
contains salient objects of similar visual appearances. This bias can lead to
the ideal settings and effectiveness of models trained on existing datasets,
being impaired in real-life situations, where similarities are usually semantic
or conceptual. To tackle this issue, we first introduce a new benchmark, called
CoSOD3k in the wild, which requires a large amount of semantic context, making
it more challenging than existing CoSOD datasets. Our CoSOD3k consists of 3,316
high-quality, elaborately selected images divided into 160 groups with
hierarchical annotations. The images span a wide range of categories, shapes,
object sizes, and backgrounds. Second, we integrate the existing SOD techniques
to build a unified, trainable CoSOD framework, which is long overdue in this
field. Specifically, we propose a novel CoEG-Net that augments our prior model
EGNet with a co-attention projection strategy to enable fast common information
learning. CoEG-Net fully leverages previous large-scale SOD datasets and
significantly improves the model scalability and stability. Third, we
comprehensively summarize 40 cutting-edge algorithms, benchmarking 18 of them
over three challenging CoSOD datasets (iCoSeg, CoSal2015, and our CoSOD3k), and
reporting more detailed (i.e., group-level) performance analysis. Finally, we
discuss the challenges and future works of CoSOD. We hope that our study will
give a strong boost to growth in the CoSOD community. The benchmark toolbox and
results are available on our project page at http://dpfan.net/CoSOD3K/.

satisfy all the conditions. We further show that such a model can also be well
fitted to low-$z$ distance measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)

Time-varying $m_e$ in the framework of $\Omega_k\Lambda$CDM is found to be a

become the most popular method for learning graph representations. In recent
years, many efforts have been focused on integrating GCN into the recommender

high-order connectivities between the nodes in user-item bipartite graph.
However, we theoretically and empirically find an inherent drawback existed in
these GCN-based recommendation methods, where GCN is directly applied to
aggregate neighboring nodes will introduce noise and information redundancy.
Consequently, the these models' capability of capturing high-order
connectivities among different nodes is limited, leading to suboptimal
performance of the recommender tasks. The main reason is that the the nonlinear
network layer inside GCN structure is not suitable for extracting non-sematic
features(such as one-hot ID feature) in the collaborative filtering scenarios.
In this work, we develop a new GCN-based Collaborative Filtering model, named
Refined Graph convolution Collaborative Filtering(RGCF), where the construction
of the embeddings of users (items) are delicately redesigned from several
aspects during the aggregation on the graph. Compared to the state-of-the-art

central, relatively to trivial quandles. We extend this work by applying the

article (Part I), we revisit and clarify the foundations of the covering theory

mathematically describe how to navigate between racks and quandles. We explain
the algebraic ingredients at play, and reinforce the homotopical and
topological interpretations of these ingredients. In particular we justify and
insist on the crucial role of the left adjoint of the conjugation functor Conj
between groups and racks (or quandles). We rename this functor Pth, and explain
in which sense it sends a rack to its group of homotopy classes of paths. We
characterize coverings and relative centrality using Pth, but also develop a
more visual ``geometrical'' understanding of these conditions. We use
alternative generalizable and visual proofs for the characterization of central
extensions of racks and quandles. We complete the recovery of M. Eisermann's ad
hoc constructions (weakly universal cover, and fundamental groupoid) from a
Galois-theoretic perspective. We sketch how to deduce M. Eisermann's detailed

long-range scalar field, and the 4D limit emerges as the scalar field goes to
one. Here we report new analysis, results, and force effects from the
long-range Kaluza scalar field. These considerations reveal a strong
electro-gravitic buoyancy force arising from a gravitational coupling between
the electric charge of a body and the scalar field around a planet. A new,
third characteristic lengthscale for the electro-gravitic fields of a body of
mass $M$ and charge $Q$ is identified, $\mu_0 Q^2/M$, to go along with the
Reissner-Nordstrom lengthscales, $GM/c^2$ and $Q\sqrt{G\mu_0 /c^2}$. At atomic
scales, 5D covariance of the source terms requires that the electric, scalar,
and gravitational forces all become proportional to electric charge. We discuss
these results relative to foundational work by Dicke on long range scalar
interactions and the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theory, including how
interaction with the scalar implies a variable rest mass, and the energetics of
the joint scalar-gravitational interaction. We discuss the problems of tuning
the only available free parameter, the invariant 5D length element of the
sources, to neutralize the scalar force and avoid the otherwise-large scalar
force predictions. We conclude that large classical forces are a testable
prediction of 5D general relativity sufficient to falsify the 5D hypothesis.
Yet the emergence of a new physical interaction lengthscale is suggestive of
further unexplored physics of the long range scalar field.

  (ICPR 2020)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigated the threat level of realistic attacks using latent
fingerprints against sensors equipped with state-of-art liveness detectors and
fingerprint verification systems which integrate such liveness algorithms. To
the best of our knowledge, only a previous investigation was done with spoofs
from latent prints. In this paper, we focus on using snapshot pictures of
latent fingerprints. These pictures provide molds, that allows, after some
digital processing, to fabricate high-quality spoofs. Taking a snapshot picture
is much simpler than developing fingerprints left on a surface by magnetic
powders and lifting the trace by a tape. What we are interested here is to
evaluate preliminary at which extent attacks of the kind can be considered a
real threat for state-of-art fingerprint liveness detectors and verification
systems. To this aim, we collected a novel data set of live and spoof images
fabricated with snapshot pictures of latent fingerprints. This data set provide
a set of attacks at the most favourable conditions. We refer to this method and
the related data set as ""ScreenSpoof"". Then, we tested with it the performances
of the best liveness detection algorithms, namely, the three winners of the
LivDet competition. Reported results point out that the ScreenSpoof method is a
threat of the same level, in terms of detection and verification errors, than
that of attacks using spoofs fabricated with the full consensus of the victim.
We think that this is a notable result, never reported in previous work.

possibly the Archean Earth. We show that the Earth-Moon system has lost about
$3~ \times ~10^{31}$ J (99% of its initial mechanical energy budget) as tidal
heat. Tidal heating of roughly 10 W/m$^{-2}$ through the surface on a time
scale of 100 million years could have accounted for a temperature increase of
up to 5 degrees Celsius on the early Earth. This heating effect alone does not
solve the faint-young-sun paradox but it could have played a key role in
combination with other effects. Future studies of the interplay of tidal
heating, the evolution of the solar power output, and the atmospheric
(greenhouse) effects on the early Earth could help in solving the
faint-young-sun paradox.

achieve satisfactory OCT image denoising results. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised OCT image speckle reduction algorithm that does not rely on

disentangled representation and generative adversarial network, the proposed
method first disentangles the noisy image into content and noise spaces by

longer wavelengths the HE11 mode is guided into the underlying Ge layer. The
presence of tapering in NWs further extends the absorption range while
minimizing reflection. This ability to engineer and enhance e-SWIR absorption
lays the groundwork to implement novel photonic devices exploiting all-group IV

as a result of the competition between the AFM and AN3 couplings, which is
absent in the model with the AN2 coupling. The AFM-CAFM and AN3-CAFM phase
transitions are concluded to belong to the weak Ising and weak three-state
Potts universality classes, respectively. Additionally, all three QLRO phases
also feature true LRO of the standard and generalized chiralities, which both
vanish simultaneously at second-order phase transitions with non-Ising critical

virtually every day the impact of the containment policies, the extent of the
recession and measure whether the monetary and fiscal stimuli introduced to

thermodynamic systems, which is nonnegative for any feasible dynamics. When
additional information such as the initial and final states or moments of an
observable is available, it is known that tighter lower bounds on the entropy
production exist according to the classical speed limits and the thermodynamic
uncertainty relations. Here, we obtain a universal lower bound on the total
entropy production in terms of probability distributions of an observable in
the time forward and backward processes. For a particular case, we show that
our universal relation reduces to a classical speed limit, imposing a
constraint on the speed of the system's evolution in terms of the Hatano--Sasa
entropy production. Notably, the newly obtained classical speed limit is
tighter than the previously reported bound by a constant factor. Moreover, we
demonstrate that a generalized thermodynamic uncertainty relation can be
derived from another particular case of the universal relation. Our new
uncertainty relation holds for systems with time-reversal symmetry breaking and
recovers several existing bounds. Our approach provides a unified perspective
on two closely related classes of inequality: classical speed limits and
thermodynamic uncertainty relations.

higher spectral efficiency, lower energy consumption, and improved fairness

conventional cooperative NOMA increases with increasing number of users owing
to successive interference cancellation (SIC) at each user. Space time block
code-aided cooperative NOMA (STBC-CNOMA) offers less numbers of SIC as compared
to that of conventional cooperative NOMA. In this paper, we evaluate the
performance of STBC-CNOMA under practical challenges such as imperfect SIC,
imperfect timing synchronization between distributed cooperating users, and
imperfect channel state information (CSI). We derive closed-form expressions of
the received signals in the presence of such realistic impairments and then use
them to evaluate outage probability. Further, we provide intuitive insights
into the impact of each impairment on the outage performance through asymptotic
analysis at high transmit signal-to-noise ratio. We also compare the complexity
of STBC-CNOMA with existing cooperative NOMA protocols for a given number of
users. In addition, through analysis and simulation, we observe that the impact
of the imperfect SIC on the outage performance of STBC-CNOMA is more
significant compared to the other two imperfections. Therefore, considering the
smaller number of SIC in STBC-CNOMA compared to the other cooperative NOMA
protocols, STBC-CNOMA is an effective solution to achieve high reliability for

To leverage the capability of the classical BO, many extensions, including

been proposed to improve the limitation of the classical BO framework. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-objective (MO) extension, called srMO-BO-3GP, to
solve the MO optimization problems in a sequential setting. Three different
Gaussian processes (GPs) are stacked together, where each of the GP is assigned
with a different task: the first GP is used to approximate the single-objective
function, the second GP is used to learn the unknown constraints, and the third
GP is used to learn the uncertain Pareto frontier. At each iteration, a MO
augmented Tchebycheff function converting MO to single-objective is adopted and
extended with a regularized ridge term, where the regularization is introduced
to smoothen the single-objective function. Finally, we couple the third GP
along with the classical BO framework to promote the richness and diversity of
the Pareto frontier by the exploitation and exploration acquisition function.
The proposed framework is demonstrated using several numerical benchmark
functions, as well as a thermomechanical finite element model for flip-chip
package design optimization.

that a system is meeting its requirements while in use, especially when paired
with static formal verification before the system is in use. This paper
presents a workflow and Runtime Verification (RV) toolchain, Varanus, and their
application to an industrial case study. Using the workflow we manually derive
a Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model from natural-language safety
requirements documents, which Varanus uses as the monitor oracle. This reuse of
the model means that the monitor oracle does not have to be developed
separately, risking inconsistencies between it and the model for static
verification. The approach is demonstrated by the offline RV of a teleoperated
manipulation system, called MASCOT, which enables remote operations inside the
Joint European Torus (JET) fusion reactor. We describe our model of the MASCOT
safety design documents (including how the modelling process revealed an
underspecification in the design) and evaluate the Varanus toolchain's utility.
The workflow and tool provide validation of the safety documents, traceability
of the safety properties from the documentation to the system, and a verified

\emph{economically viable randomness} (EVR), namely, randomness that has
significant economic consequences. Applications of EVR include blockchain-based
lotteries and gambling. An EVR source guarantees (i) secrecy, assuring that the
random bits are kept secret until some predefined condition indicates that they
are safe to reveal (e.g., the lottery's ticket sale closes), and (ii)
robustness, guaranteeing that the random bits are published once the condition
holds. We formalize the EVR problem and solve it on top of an Ethereum-like
blockchain abstraction, which supports smart contracts and a transferable
native coin. Randomness is generated via a distributed open commit-reveal
scheme by game-theoretic agents who strive to maximize their coin holdings.
Note that in an economic setting, such agents might profit from breaking
secrecy or robustness, and may engage in side agreements (via smart contracts)
to this end. Our solution creates an incentive structure that counters such
attacks. We prove that following the protocol gives rise to a stable state,
called Coalition-Proof Nash Equilibrium, from which no coalition comprised of a
subset of the players can agree to deviate. In this stable state, robustness
and secrecy are satisfied. Finally, we implement our EVR source over Ethereum.

thus introduce beneficial angular information for image super-resolution (SR).
However, it is challenging to incorporate angular information due to
disparities among LF images. In this paper, we propose a deformable convolution
network (i.e., LF-DFnet) to handle the disparity problem for LF image SR.
Specifically, we design an angular deformable alignment module (ADAM) for
feature-level alignment. Based on ADAM, we further propose a
collect-and-distribute approach to perform bidirectional alignment between the
center-view feature and each side-view feature. Using our approach, angular
information can be well incorporated and encoded into features of each view,
which benefits the SR reconstruction of all LF images. Moreover, we develop a
baseline-adjustable LF dataset to evaluate SR performance under different
disparity variations. Experiments on both public and our self-developed
datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our method. Our LF-DFnet can
generate high-resolution images with more faithful details and achieve
state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy. Besides, our LF-DFnet is more robust
to disparity variations, which has not been well addressed in literature.

favourable conditions due to the increased energy density of the CMB, and it
allows constraints to be placed on the radio synchrotron-emitting electron
component at high energies that are otherwise inaccessible. We present new
X-ray, optical and radio results from Chandra, HST and the VLA for the core and
resolved jet in the $z=3.69$ quasar PKS J1421-0643. The X-ray jet extends for
about $4.5''$ (32 kpc projected length). The jet's radio spectrum is abnormally
steep and consistent with electrons being accelerated to a maximum Lorentz
factor of about 5000. Results argue in favour of the detection of
inverse-Compton X-rays for modest magnetic field strength of a few nT, Doppler
factor of about 4, and viewing angle of about $15^\circ$, and predict the jet
to be largely invisible in most other spectral bands including the far- and
mid-infrared and high-energy gamma-ray. The jet power is estimated to be about
$3 \times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ which is of order a tenth of the quasar
bolometric power, for an electron--positron jet. The jet radiative power is
only about 0.07 per cent of the jet power, with a smaller radiated power ratio
if the jet contains heavy particles, so most of the jet power is available for
heating the intergalactic medium.

remarkable decrease in the overpotential (25 mV). Interestingly, the behavior
is opposite for the r-plane case, highlighting the significance of the active

Myhill-Nerode theorem to this symbolic setting. Our generalization requires the
use of three relations to capture the additional structure of register
automata. Location equivalence $\equiv_l$ captures that symbolic traces end in
the same location, transition equivalence $\equiv_t$ captures that they share
the same final transition, and a partial equivalence relation $\equiv_r$
captures that symbolic values $v$ and $v'$ are stored in the same register
after symbolic traces $w$ and $w'$, respectively. A symbolic language is
defined to be regular if relations $\equiv_l$, $\equiv_t$ and $\equiv_r$ exist
that satisfy certain conditions, in particular, they all have finite index. We
show that the symbolic language associated to a register automaton is regular,
and we construct, for each regular symbolic language, a register automaton that
accepts this language. Our result provides a foundation for grey-box learning
algorithms in settings where the constraints on data parameters can be
extracted from code using e.g. tools for symbolic/concolic execution or
tainting. We believe that moving to a grey-box setting is essential to overcome
the scalability problems of state-of-the-art black-box learning algorithms.

dielectric particles embedded in a chiral medium. We develop a partial-wave
(Mie) expansion to calculate the optical force acting on a dielectric

When choosing a polarization with the same handedness of the medium, the axial
trap stability is improved, thus allowing for tweezing of high-refractive-index
particles. When the particle is displaced off-axis by an external force, its
equilibrium position is rotated around the optical axis by the mechanical
effect of an optical torque. Both the optical torque and the angle of rotation
are greatly enhanced in the presence of a chiral host medium when considering
radii a few times larger than the wavelength. In this range, the angle of
rotation depends strongly on the microsphere radius and the chirality parameter
of the host medium, opening the way for a quantitative characterization of both
parameters. Measurable angles are predicted even in the case of naturally
occurring chiral solutes, allowing for a novel all-optical method to locally
probe the chiral response at the nanoscale.

Nevertheless, the extension of such object detectors from image to video is not
trivial especially when appearance deterioration exists in videos, \emph{e.g.},
motion blur or occlusion. A valid question is how to explore temporal coherence
across frames for boosting detection. In this paper, we propose to address the
problem by enhancing per-frame features through aggregation of neighboring
frames. Specifically, we present Single Shot Video Object Detector (SSVD) -- a
new architecture that novelly integrates feature aggregation into a one-stage
detector for object detection in videos. Technically, SSVD takes Feature
Pyramid Network (FPN) as backbone network to produce multi-scale features.
Unlike the existing feature aggregation methods, SSVD, on one hand, estimates
the motion and aggregates the nearby features along the motion path, and on the
other, hallucinates features by directly sampling features from the adjacent
frames in a two-stream structure. Extensive experiments are conducted on
ImageNet VID dataset, and competitive results are reported when comparing to
state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, for $448 \times 448$ input, SSVD
achieves 79.2% mAP on ImageNet VID, by processing one frame in 85 ms on an

quantum gravity, grounded in the notion of corner symmetry algebra and its
representations. Here we focus on tetrad gravity and its corner symplectic
potential. We start by performing a detailed decomposition of the various
geometrical quantities appearing in BF theory and tetrad gravity. This provides
a new decomposition of the symplectic potential of BF theory and the simplicity
constraints. We then show that the dynamical variables of the tetrad gravity
corner phase space are the internal normal to the spacetime foliation, which is
conjugated to the boost generator, and the corner coframe field. This allows us
to derive several key results. First, we construct the corner Lorentz charges.
In addition to sphere diffeomorphisms, common to all formulations of gravity,
these charges add a local $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ component to the corner
symmetry algebra of tetrad gravity. Second, we also reveal that the corner
metric satisfies a local $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra, whose Casimir
corresponds to the corner area element. Due to the space-like nature of the
corner metric, this Casimir belongs to the unitary discrete series, and its
spectrum is therefore quantized. This result, which reconciles discreteness of
the area spectrum with Lorentz invariance, is proven in the continuum and
without resorting to a bulk connection. Third, we show that the corner phase
space explains why the simplicity constraints become non-commutative on the
corner. This fact requires a reconciliation between the bulk and corner
symplectic structures, already in the classical continuum theory. Understanding
this leads inevitably to the introduction of edge modes.

binary population formed in the early Universe are likely negligible, we
compute current merger rates in PBH clusters in which the typical PBH resides.
We consider two scenarios: (i) the PBH mass function dictated by the QCD
equation of state and (ii) the PBH mass function dictated by the existence of a
peak in the inflationary perturbation spectrum. In the first scenario, which is
essentially parameter free, we reproduce very well the merger rates for heavy
BHs, the merger rate of mass-asymmetric BHs such as GW190814, a recently
discovered merger of a 23$M_{\odot}$ black hole with a $2.6M_{\odot}$ object,
and can naturally explain why LIGO/Virgo has not yet observed mergers of two
light PBHs from the dominant $\sim 1\,M_{\odot}$ PBH population. In the second
scenario, which has some parameter freedom, we match well the observed rate of
heavy PBHs, but can currently not explain the rate for mass-asymmetric events.
In either case it is tantalizing that in both scenarios PBH merger rates made

be significantly narrowed down. We find that a consistent gravity-driven

about the system state. Storing such metrics over a period of time naturally
raises the motivation of predicting future KPI progress based on past
observations. Although, a variety of time series forecasting methods exist,
forecasting the progress of IT system KPIs is very hard. First, KPI types like
CPU utilization or allocated memory are very different and hard to be expressed
by the same model. Second, system components are interconnected and constantly
changing due to soft- or firmware updates and hardware modernization. Thus a
frequent model retraining or fine-tuning must be expected. Therefore, we
propose a lightweight solution for KPI series prediction based on historic
observations. It consists of a weighted heterogeneous ensemble method composed
of two models - a neural network and a mean predictor. As ensemble method a
weighted summation is used, whereby a heuristic is employed to set the weights.
The modelling approach is evaluated on the available FedCSIS 2020 challenge
dataset and achieves an overall $R^2$ score of 0.10 on the preliminary 10% test
data and 0.15 on the complete test data. We publish our code on the following

Gradient (CG) type methods to avoid the computationally expensive projection
operation. However, the existing CG type methods are not robust to data
corruption. To address this, we propose to robustify CG type methods against
Huber's corruption model and heavy-tailed data. First, we show that the two
Pairwise CG methods are stable, i.e., do not accumulate error. Combined with
robust mean gradient estimation techniques, we can therefore guarantee
robustness to a wide class of problems, but now in a projection-free
algorithmic framework. Next, we consider high dimensional problems. Robust mean
estimation based approaches may have an unacceptably high sample complexity.
When the constraint set is a $\ell_0$ norm ball,
Iterative-Hard-Thresholding-based methods have been developed recently. Yet
extension is non-trivial even for general sets with $O(d)$ extreme points. For
setting where the feasible set has $O(\text{poly}(d))$ extreme points, we
develop a novel robustness method, based on a new condition we call the Robust
Atom Selection Condition (RASC). When RASC is satisfied, our method converges
linearly with a corresponding statistical error, with sample complexity that
scales correctly in the sparsity of the problem, rather than the ambient
dimension as would be required by any approach based on robust mean estimation.

of the infectious COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, individuals are
not used to tracking the required 6-feet (2-meters) distance between themselves
and their surroundings. An active surveillance system capable of detecting
distances between individuals and warning them can slow down the spread of the
deadly disease. Furthermore, measuring social density in a region of interest
(ROI) and modulating inflow can decrease social distancing violation occurrence
chance.
  On the other hand, recording data and labeling individuals who do not follow
the measures will breach individuals' rights in free-societies. Here we propose
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based real-time social distancing detection and
warning system considering four important ethical factors: (1) the system
should never record/cache data, (2) the warnings should not target the
individuals, (3) no human supervisor should be in the detection/warning loop,
and (4) the code should be open-source and accessible to the public. Against
this backdrop, we propose using a monocular camera and deep learning-based
real-time object detectors to measure social distancing. If a violation is
detected, a non-intrusive audio-visual warning signal is emitted without
targeting the individual who breached the social distancing measure. Also, if
the social density is over a critical value, the system sends a control signal
to modulate inflow into the ROI. We tested the proposed method across
real-world datasets to measure its generality and performance. The proposed
method is ready for deployment, and our code is open-sourced.

phenomena such as traffic accidents in geographically distinct entities such as
census tracts or road segments. These models are typically estimated using
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods, which, however,
are computationally expensive and do not scale well to large datasets.
Variational Bayes (VB), a method from machine learning, addresses the
shortcomings of MCMC by casting Bayesian estimation as an optimisation problem
instead of a simulation problem. Considering all these advantages of VB, a VB
method is derived for posterior inference in negative binomial models with
unobserved parameter heterogeneity and spatial dependence. P\'olya-Gamma
augmentation is used to deal with the non-conjugacy of the negative binomial
likelihood and an integrated non-factorised specification of the variational
distribution is adopted to capture posterior dependencies. The benefits of the
proposed approach are demonstrated in a Monte Carlo study and an empirical
application on estimating youth pedestrian injury counts in census tracts of
New York City. The VB approach is around 45 to 50 times faster than MCMC on a
regular eight-core processor in a simulation and an empirical study, while
offering similar estimation and predictive accuracy. Conditional on the
availability of computational resources, the embarrassingly parallel
architecture of the proposed VB method can be exploited to further accelerate
its estimation by up to 20 times.

  Estimating the User Cost of Rail Crowding",,,,,"stat.AP econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crowding valuation of subway riders is an important input to various
supply-side decisions of transit operators. The crowding cost perceived by a
transit rider is generally estimated by capturing the trade-off that the rider
makes between crowding and travel time while choosing a route. However,
existing studies rely on static compensatory choice models and fail to account
for inertia and the learning behaviour of riders. To address these challenges,
we propose a new dynamic latent class model (DLCM) which (i) assigns riders to
latent compensatory and inertia/habit classes based on different decision
rules, (ii) enables transitions between these classes over time, and (iii)
adopts instance-based learning theory to account for the learning behaviour of
riders. We use the expectation-maximisation algorithm to estimate DLCM, and the
most probable sequence of latent classes for each rider is retrieved using the
Viterbi algorithm. The proposed DLCM can be applied in any choice context to
capture the dynamics of decision rules used by a decision-maker. We demonstrate
its practical advantages in estimating the crowding valuation of an Asian
metro's riders. To calibrate the model, we recover the daily route preferences
and in-vehicle crowding experiences of regular metro riders using a
two-month-long smart card and vehicle location data. The results indicate that
the average rider follows the compensatory rule on only 25.5% of route choice
occasions. DLCM estimates also show an increase of 47% in metro riders'
valuation of travel time under extremely crowded conditions relative to that
under uncrowded conditions.

timely status updates to multiple clients via adaptive non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA)/orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Specifically, the BS is able to
adaptively switch between NOMA and OMA for the downlink transmission to
optimize the information freshness of the network, characterized by the Age of
Information (AoI) metric. If the BS chooses OMA, it can only serve one client
within each time slot and should decide which client to serve; if the BS
chooses NOMA, it can serve more than one client at the same time and needs to
decide the power allocated to the served clients. For the simple two-client
case, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and develop the
optimal policy for the BS to decide whether to use NOMA or OMA for each
downlink transmission based on the instantaneous AoI of both clients. The
optimal policy is shown to have a switching-type property with obvious decision
switching boundaries. A near-optimal policy with lower computation complexity
is also devised. For the more general multi-client scenario, inspired by the
proposed near-optimal policy, we formulate a nonlinear optimization problem to
determine the optimal power allocated to each client by maximizing the expected
AoI drop of the network in each time slot. We resolve the formulated problem by
approximating it as a convex optimization problem. We also derive the upper
bound of the gap between the approximate convex problem and the original
nonlinear, nonconvex problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of
the adopted approximation. The performance of the adaptive NOMA/OMA scheme by
solving the convex optimization is shown to be close to that of max-weight
policy solved by exhaustive search...

perturbation-based methods are used to improve the mean extracted power of a
heaving point absorber subject to regular and irregular waves. This objective
is achieved by optimizing the resistive and reactive coefficients of the power
take-off (PTO) mechanism using the ES approach. The optimization results are
verified against analytical solutions and the extremum of reference-to-output
maps. The numerical results demonstrate that except for the self-driving ES
algorithm, the other four ES schemes reliably converge for the two-parameter
optimization problem, whereas the former is more suitable for optimizing a
single-parameter. The results also show that for an irregular sea state, the
sliding mode and perturbation-based ES schemes have better convergence to the
optimum, in comparison to other ES schemes considered here. The convergence of
PTO coefficients towards the performance-optimal values are tested for widely
different initial values, in order to avoid bias towards the extremum. We also
demonstrate the adaptive capability of ES control by considering a case in

The current
(and in fact only viable) approach to such problems, pioneered by Guth and
Katz, requires a variety of tools from algebraic geometry, most notably (i) the
polynomial partitioning technique, and (ii) the study of algebraic surfaces
that are ruled by lines or, in more recent studies, by algebraic curves of some
constant degree. By exploiting and refining these tools, we obtain new and
improved bounds for point-curve incidence problems in $R^3$.
  Incidences of this kind have been considered in several previous studies,
starting with Guth and Katz's work on points and lines. Our results, which are
based on the work of Guth and Zahl concerning surfaces that are doubly ruled by
curves, provide a grand generalization of most of the previous results. We
reconstruct the bound for points and lines, and improve, in certain significant
ways, recent bounds involving points and circles (in Sharir, Sheffer and Zahl),
and points and arbitrary constant-degree algebraic curves (in Sharir, Sheffer
and Solomon). While in these latter instances the bounds are not known (and are
strongly suspected not) to be tight, our bounds are, in a certain sense, the
best that can be obtained with this approach, given the current state of
knowledge.
  As an application of our point-curve incidence bound, we show that the number
of triangles spanned by a set of $n$ points in $R^3$ and similar to a given
triangle is $O(n^{15/7})$, which improves the bound of Agarwal et al. Our

intended. Here we first discuss an empirical investigation in which students in
a large algebra-based physics course were given opportunities to work through
research-validated tutorials outside of class as self-study tools. Students
were provided these optional tutorials after traditional instruction in
relevant topics and were then given quizzes that included problems that were
identical to the tutorial problems with regard to the physics principles
involved but had different contexts. We find that students who worked through
the tutorials as self-study tools struggled to transfer their learning to solve
problems that used the same physics principles. On the other hand, students who
worked on the tutorials in supervised, one-on-one situations performed
significantly better than them. These empirical findings suggest that many
introductory physics students may not engage effectively with self-paced
learning tools unless they are provided additional incentives and support,
e.g., to aid with self-regulation. Inspired by the empirical findings, we
propose a holistic theoretical framework to help create learning environments

hyperparameter space enables a natural group-sparse recovery formulation, which
when coupled with HyperBand (a multi-armed bandit strategy), leads to
improvement over existing hyperparameter optimization methods. Experimental
results on image datasets such as CIFAR-10 confirm the benefits of our
approach. In the second part of this paper, we establish a connection between
NAS and structured sparse recovery. Building upon ``one-shot'' approaches in
NAS, we propose a novel algorithm that we call CoNAS by merging ideas from
one-shot approaches with a techniques for learning low-degree sparse Boolean
polynomials. We provide theoretical analysis on the number of validation error
measurements. Finally, we validate our approach on several datasets and
discover novel architectures hitherto unreported, achieving competitive (or
better) results in both performance and search time compared to the existing
NAS approaches.

use our dual-branch architecture as a universal representation framework to
design two sketch-specific deep models: (i) We propose a deep hashing model for
sketch retrieval, where a novel hashing loss is specifically designed to
accommodate both the abstract and messy traits of sketches. (ii) We propose a
deep embedding model for sketch zero-shot recognition, via collecting a
large-scale edge-map dataset and proposing to extract a set of semantic vectors
from edge-maps as the semantic knowledge for sketch zero-shot domain alignment.
Both deep models are evaluated by comprehensive experiments on million-scale

  We present results of radiation hydrodynamics modelling of SN Refsdal.
According to our calculations, the SN Refsdal progenitor is likely to be a more
massive and energetic version of SN 1987A, i.e. a blue supergiant star with the
following parameters: the progenitor radius $R_0 = (50 \pm 1) R_{\odot}$, the
total mass $M_{tot}= (25\pm 2) M_{\odot}$, the radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass
$M_{^{56}\mathrm{Ni}} = (0.26 \pm 0.05) \,M_{\odot}$, and the total energy
release $E_{burst}=(4.7 \pm 0.8)\times10^{51}$ erg. Reconstruction of SN light
curves allowed us to obtain time delays and magnifications for the images S2-S4
relative to S1 with higher accuracy than previous template-based estimates of
Rodney \& et al. (2016). The measured time delays are $\Delta t_{S2-S1} =
9.5^{+2.6}_{-2.7} $ days, $\Delta t_{S3-S1} = 4.2^{+2.3}_{-2.3} $ days, and
$\Delta t_{S4-S1} = 30^{+7.8}_{-8.2} $ days. The obtained magnification ratios
are $\mu_{S2/S1}= 1.14 \pm 0.02$, $\mu_{S3/S1} = 1.01 \pm 0.02 $, and
$\mu_{S4/S1} = 0.35\pm 0.02$. We estimate the Hubble constant $H_0 =
68.6^{+13.6}_{-9.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ via re-scaling the time delays
predicted by different lens models to match the values obtained in this work.
With more photometric data on the fifth image SX, we will be able to further
refine the time delay and magnification estimates for SX and obtain competitive
constraints on $H_0$.

viscoelastic damping in controlling base-excited vibrations. Specifically, the
focus is on investigating the robustness of the nonlinear base isolation
performance in controlling the system response due to a wide set of possible
excitation spectra. The dynamic model is derived to study a simple structure
whose base isolation is provided via a Rubber-Layer Roller Bearing (RLRB)
(rigid cylinders rolling on rigid plates with highly damping rubber coatings)
equipped with a nonlinear cubic spring, thus presenting both nonlinear damping
and stiffness. We found that, under periodic loading, due to the non-monotonic
bell-shaped viscoelastic damping arising from the viscoelastic rolling
contacts, different dynamic regimes occur mostly depending on whether the
damping peak is overcome or not. Interestingly, in the former case, poorly
damped self-excited vibrations may be triggered by the steep damping decrease.
Moreover, in order to investigate the robustness of the isolation performance,
we consider a set of real seismic excitations, showing that tuned nonlinear
RLRB provide loads isolation in a wider range of excitation spectra, compared
to generic linear isolators. This is peculiarly suited for applications (such
as seismic and failure engineering) in which the specific excitation spectrum
is unknown a priori, and blind design on statistical data has to be employed.

been thought to be robust to structural perturbations by mapping the
topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model of a solid-state system. However, the
edge states at the two ends of a finite topological dimer chain will interact
as a result of near-field coupling. This leads to deviation from topological
protection by the chiral symmetry from the exact zero energy, weakening the
robustness of the topological edge state. With the aid of non-Hermitian
physics, the splitting frequencies of edge states can be degenerated again and
topological protection recovered by altering the gain or loss strength of the
structure. This point of coalescence is known as the exceptional point (EP).
The intriguing physical properties of EPs in topological structures give rise
to many fascinating and counterintuitive phenomena. In this work, based on a
finite non-Hermitian dimer chain composed of ultra-subwavelength resonators, we
propose theoretically and verify experimentally that the sensitivity of
topological edge states is greatly affected when the system passes through the
EP. Using the EP of a non-Hermitian dimer chain, we realize a new sensor that
is sensitive to perturbation at the end of the structure and yet topologically
protected from internal perturbation. Our demonstration of a non-Hermitian
topological structure with an EP paves the way for the development of novel
sensors that are not sensitive to internal manufacturing errors but are highly
sensitive to changes in the external environment.

description of the behavior of regular and random arrays of nanometric active
sites. It is further shown how they can be applied for establishing a useful
semi-analytical approximation of the arrays responses under diffusion limited
conditions when they involve the common situation of active sites with
identical sizes. This approximation is general and, as exemplified for
different type of arrays, can be employed for describing the behavior of any
array involving arbitrary distributions of their active sites onto the
substrate surface. Furthermore, this efficient approach allows statistical
characterization of active sites distributions of any array based on
chronoamperometric data.

on electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), small aircraft
which can land and takeoff vertically, and which are powered by rechargeable
(typically lithium-ion) batteries. Design, analysis, and operation of eVTOLs
requires fast and accurate prediction of Li-ion battery performance throughout
the lifetime of the battery. eVTOL battery performance modeling must be
particularly accurate at high discharge rates to ensure accurate simulation of
the high power takeoff and landing portions of the flight. In this work, we
generate a battery performance and thermal behavior dataset specific to eVTOL
duty cycles. We use this dataset to develop a battery performance and
degradation model (Cellfit) which employs physics-informed machine learning in
the form of Universal Ordinary Differential Equations (U-ODE's) combined with
an electrochemical cell model and degradation models which include solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth, lithium plating, and charge loss. We show
that Cellfit with U-ODE's is better able to predict battery degradation than a
mechanistic battery degradation model. We show that the improved accuracy of
the degradation model improves the accuracy of the performance model. We
believe that Cellfit will prove to be a valuable tool for eVTOL designers.

  a genetic algorithm model","23 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CE cs.NE eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the essential aspects of power system planning is generation expansion
planning (GEP). The purpose of GEP is to enhance construction planning and
reduce the costs of installing different types of power plants. This paper
proposes a method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) for GEP in the presence of
wind power plants. Since it is desired to integrate the maximum possible wind
power production in GEP, the constraints for incorporating different levels of
wind energy in power generation are investigated comprehensively. This will
allow obtaining the maximum reasonable amount of wind penetration in the
network. Besides, due to the existence of different wind regimes, the
penetration of strong and weak wind on GEP is assessed. The results show that
the maximum utilization of wind power generation capacity could increase the
exploitation of more robust wind regimes. Considering the growth of the wind
farm industry and the cost reduction for building wind power plants, the
sensitivity of GEP to the variations of this cost is investigated. The results
further indicate that for a 10% reduction in the initial investment cost of
wind power plants, the proposed model estimates that the overall cost will be
minimized.
