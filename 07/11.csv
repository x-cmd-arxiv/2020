presenting a normal form which we show may be efficiently computed alongside

many networks, while nodes are anonymous to outside observers, the existence of
a link between individuals implies the possibility of one node revealing
identifying information about its neighbor. Moreover, while the identities of
the accounts are likely hidden to an observer, the network of interaction
between two anonymous accounts is often available. For example, in blockchain
cryptocurrencies, transactions between two anonymous accounts are published
openly. Here we consider what happens if one (or more) parties in such a
network are deanonymized by an outside identity. These compromised individuals
could leak information about others with whom they interacted, which could then
cascade to more and more nodes' information being revealed. We use a
percolation framework to analyze the scenario outlined above and show for
different likelihoods of individuals possessing information on their
counter-parties, the fraction of accounts that can be identified and the
idealized minimum number of steps from a deanonymized node to an anonymous node
(a measure of the effort required to deanonymize that individual). We further
develop a greedy algorithm to estimate the \emph{actual} number of steps that
will be needed to identify a particular node based on the noisy information
available to the attacker. We apply our framework to three real-world networks:
(1) a blockchain transaction network, (2) a network of interactions on the dark
web, and (3) a political conspiracy network. We find that in all three
networks, beginning from one compromised individual, it is possible to
deanonymize a significant fraction of the network ($>50$%) within less than 5
steps. Overall these results provide guidelines for investigators seeking to

classified as blazars or blazar candidates, one of the most elusive classes of
active galaxies. Additional blazars can also be hidden within the sample of
unidentified or unassociated $\gamma$-ray sources (UGSs) that constitute about
one-third of all gamma-ray sources detected to date. We recently confirmed that
the large majority of Fermi blazars of the BL Lac subclass have an X-ray
counterpart. Using the X-ray properties of a BL Lac training set and combining
these with archival multifrequency information, we aim to search for UGSs that
could have a BL Lac source within their $\gamma$-ray positional uncertainty
regions. We reduced and analyzed the Swift X-ray observations of a selected
sample of 327 UGSs. We then compared the X-ray fluxes and hardness ratios of
all sources detected in the pointed fields with those of known Fermi BL Lacs.
We find at least one X-ray source, lying within the $\gamma$-ray positional
uncertainty at 95% confidence level, for 223 UGSs and a total of 464 X-ray
sources in all fields analyzed. The X-ray properties of a large fraction of
them, eventually combined with radio, infrared, and optical information,
exhibit BL Lac multi-frequency behavior, thus allowing us to select
high-confidence BL Lac candidates; some of them were recently observed during
our optical spectroscopic campaign which confirmed their nature. We find that
out of 50 X-ray sources that were confirmed as BL Lacs through optical
spectroscopy, 12 do not show canonical mid-infrared or radio BL Lac properties.
This indicates that the selection of X-ray BL Lac candidates is a strong method
to find new counterparts within Fermi UGSs. Finally, we pinpoint a sample of 32
Swift/XRT candidate counterparts to Fermi UGSs that are most likely BL Lac
objects.

stocks. A major challenge to ending illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU)
fishing is improving our ability to identify whether a vessel is fishing
illegally and where illegal fishing is likely to occur in the ocean. However,
monitoring the oceans is costly, time-consuming, and logistically challenging
for maritime authorities to patrol. To address this problem, we use vessel
tracking data and machine learning to predict illegal fishing on the Patagonian
Shelf, one of the world's most productive regions for fisheries. Specifically,
we focus on Chinese fishing vessels, which have consistently fished illegally
in this region. We combine vessel location data with oceanographic seascapes --
classes of oceanic areas based on oceanographic variables -- as well as other
remotely sensed oceanographic variables to train a series of machine learning
models of varying levels of complexity. These models are able to predict
whether a Chinese vessel is operating illegally with 69-96% confidence,
depending on the year and predictor variables used. These results offer a
promising step towards preempting illegal activities, rather than reacting to
them forensically.

another image, has been a topic of considerable progress in recent years.
Research over that time has been dominated by transferring aspects of color and
texture, yet these factors are only one component of style. Other factors of
style include composition, the projection system used, and the way in which
artists warp and bend objects. Our contribution is to introduce a neural
architecture that supports transfer of geometric style. Unlike recent work in
this area, we are unique in being general in that we are not restricted by
semantic content. This new architecture runs prior to a network that transfers
texture style, enabling us to transfer texture to a warped image. This form of
network supports a second novelty: we extend the NST input paradigm. Users can
input content/style pair as is common, or they can chose to input a
content/texture-style/geometry-style triple. This three image input paradigm
divides style into two parts and so provides significantly greater versatility
to the output we can produce. We provide user studies that show the quality of
our output, and quantify the importance of geometric style transfer to style
recognition by humans.

such fractal sets when they are structured with respect to multiplicatively
independent bases. Our main results in this direction parallel the works of
Furstenberg, Hochman-Shmerkin, Shmerkin, Wu, and Lindenstrauss-Meiri-Peres and
include:
  -a classification of all subsets of the positive integers that are
simultaneously $\times r$- and $\times s$-invariant;

theory to build a bridge between the continuous and discrete regimes. For the

significantly less parameters than all other methods with comparable results.

  For a quiver with potential $(Q,S)$, we show that if $k$ is a vertex not

  Our techniques involve only basic linear algebra and elementary algebraic
geometry, and do not require to assume Jacobi-finiteness. Thus, the paper
yields a new and more general proof of the mutation invariance of generic
Caldero-Chapoton functions, generalizing and providing a new natural geometric
perspective on results of Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky and Plamondon. (For
Jacobi-finite non-degenerate quivers with potential, this invariance was shown
by Plamondon using the machinery of Ginzburg dg-algebras and Hom-finite
generalized cluster categories.)
  We apply our results, together with results of Mills, Muller and Qin, to
prove that for any choice of geometric coefficient systems, not necessarily of
full rank, the cluster algebra associated to a possibly punctured surface with

SPIDERS now consists of about 27,000 new optical spectra of galaxies selected
within 4,000 photometric red sequences, each associated with an X-ray source.
The excellent spectrograph efficiency and a robust analysis pipeline yield a
spectroscopic redshift measurement success rate exceeding 98%, with a median
velocity accuracy of 20 km s$^{-1}$ (at $z=0.2$). Using the catalogue of 2,740
X-ray galaxy clusters confirmed with DR16 spectroscopy, we reveal the

Universe up to $z\sim0.6$. We highlight the homogeneity of the member galaxy
spectra among distinct regions of the galaxy cluster phase space. Aided by
accurate spectroscopic redshifts and by a model of the sample selection

phase-locking is unlikely and that it is partially phase-locked states that are
important in applications. Despite this, while there has been much attention
given to the existence and stability of fully phase-locked states in the finite
N Kuramoto model, the partially phase-locked states have received much less
attention. In this paper, we present two related results. Firstly, we derive an
analytical criterion that, for sufficiently strong coupling, guarantees the
existence of a partially phase-locked state by proving the existence of an
attracting ball around a fixed point of a subset of the oscillators. We also
derive a larger invariant ball such that any point in it will asymptotically
converge to the attracting ball. Secondly, we consider the large N
(thermodynamic) limit for the Kuramoto system with randomly distributed
frequencies. Using some results of De Smet and Aeyels on partial entrainment,
we derive a deterministic condition giving almost sure existence of a partially
entrained state for sufficiently strong coupling when the natural frequencies
of the individual oscillators are independent identically distributed random
variables, as well as upper and lower bounds on the size of the largest cluster
of partially entrained oscillators. Interestingly in a series on numerical
experiments we find that the observed size of the largest entrained cluster is
predicted extremely well by the upper bound.

perform long-term simulations of oscillatory dynamics on different paradigmatic

ring networks with fractal connectivities, and small-world networks with
various rewiring probability. Among these networks, a small-world network with
intermediate rewiring probability best mimics the findings achieved with the

topologies, either no spontaneously occurring epileptic-seizure-related

for developing and operating large-scale services. Incidents are created to
ensure timely communication of service issues and, also, their resolution.
Prior work on incident management has been heavily focused on the challenges
with incident triaging and de-duplication. In this work, we address the
fundamental problem of structured knowledge extraction from service incidents.
We have built SoftNER, a framework for unsupervised knowledge extraction from
service incidents. We frame the knowledge extraction problem as a Named-entity
Recognition task for extracting factual information. SoftNER leverages
structural patterns like key,value pairs and tables for bootstrapping the
training data. Further, we build a novel multi-task learning based BiLSTM-CRF
model which leverages not just the semantic context but also the data-types for
named-entity extraction. We have deployed SoftNER at Microsoft, a major cloud
service provider and have evaluated it on more than 2 months of cloud
incidents. We show that the unsupervised machine learning based approach has a
high precision of 0.96. Our multi-task learning based deep learning model also

results confirm that the s.f. cross sections are larger than the d.f. cross
sections and the effect increases with the projectile mass. Furthermore the
strong absorption radius parameter extracted from the $S$ matrices calculated
with the s.f. has a stable value $r_s$ =1.3 - 1.4 fm for all projectile masses
in the range of incident energies 40-100AMeV. This indicates that a clear
geometrical separation can be made between the region of surface reactions, the
region of strong absorption into other channels and the region of weak nuclear
interaction. The d.f. results are instead much scattered and the separation
between surface reactions and other channels does not seem to be consistent.
Excellent agreement with recent experimental results confirms the validity of
our approach.

challenge for sport scientists for several decades. There has been a lot of
work on understanding the physiological concepts behind it. The concepts of
Critical Power (CP) and Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC) have been discussed often
in recent cycling performance related articles. CP is a power that can be
maintained by a cyclist for a long time; meaning pedaling at or below this
limit, theoretically, can be continued for infinite amount of time. However,
there is a limited source of energy for generating power above CP. This limited
energy source is AWC. After burning energy from this tank, a cyclist can
recover some by pedaling below CP. In this paper we utilize the concepts of CP
and AWC to mathematically model muscle fatigue and recovery of a cyclist. Then,
the models are used to formulate an optimal control problem for a time trial
effort on a 10.3 km course located in Greenville SC. The course is simulated in
a laboratory environment using a CompuTrainer. At the end, the optimal
simulation results are compared to the performance of one subject on
CompuTrainer.

Specifically, we find that the wave speed decays with an increase of a finite
relaxation time of flux. Our analytical predictions are well corroborated with

EBLM J0608-59/TOI-1338 is a low-mass eclipsing binary system with a recently
discovered circumbinary planet identified by TESS. Here, we perform
high-resolution spectroscopy during primary eclipse to measure the projected
stellar obliquity of the primary component. The obliquity is low, and thus the
primary star is aligned with the binary and planetary orbits with a projected
spin-orbit angle $\beta = 2.8 \pm 17.1$ deg. The rotation period of $18.1 \pm

consistent with gyrochronology and weak tidal interaction with the binary
companion. Our result, combined with the known coplanarity of the binary and

considered whether the spectrum of the faint secondary star could affect our
measurements. We show through simulations that the effect is negligible for our

bayesian network, representative of the data generation procedure, along with
the sensitive nodes, that result in unfairness, are given. We quantify Edge
Flow, which is the belief flowing along an edge by attenuating the indirect
path influences, and use it to quantify Edge Unfairness. We prove that
cumulative unfairness is non-existent in any decision, like judicial bail,
towards any sensitive groups, like race, when the edge unfairness is absent,
given an error-free linear model of conditional probability. We then measure
the potential to mitigate the cumulative unfairness when edge unfairness is
decreased. Based on these measures, we propose an unfair edge prioritization
algorithm that prioritizes the unfair edges and a discrimination removal
procedure that de-biases the generated data distribution. The experimental
section validates the specifications used for quantifying the above measures.

to guarantee stability. In this paper, we formally show that there are indeed
nontrivial state representations under which the canonical TD algorithm is
stable, even when learning off-policy. We analyze representation learning
schemes that are based on the transition matrix of a policy, such as
proto-value functions, along three axes: approximation error, stability, and
ease of estimation. In the most general case, we show that a Schur basis
provides convergence guarantees, but is difficult to estimate from samples. For

demonstrating that these stable representations can be learned using stochastic

vector autoregressive (CNAR) model, which utilizes the network structure to
characterize the dependence and intra-community homogeneity of the high
dimensional time series. The CNAR model greatly increases the flexibility and
generality of the network vector autoregressive (Zhu et al, 2017, NAR) model by
allowing heterogeneous network effects across different network communities. In
addition, the non-community-related latent factors are included to account for
unknown cross-sectional dependence. The number of network communities can
diverge as the network expands, which leads to estimating a diverging number of
model parameters. We obtain a set of stationary conditions and develop an
efficient two-step weighted least-squares estimator. The consistency and
asymptotic normality properties of the estimators are established. The
theoretical results show that the two-step estimator improves the one-step
estimator by an order of magnitude when the error admits a factor structure.
The advantages of the CNAR model are further illustrated on a variety of

connected subgraphs of dense graphs. In this setting, given an edge in a
connected graph $G = (V, E)$, an algorithm locally decides its membership in a
sparse connected subgraph $G^* = (V, E^*)$, where $E^* \subseteq E$ and $|E^*|

  While most prior results in this area require assumptions on $G$ or that

nonlinearities. We call these flow-based likelihoods (FBL). We analyze the
accuracy and precision of the reconstructed likelihoods on mock Gaussian data,

We nevertheless demonstrate that the likelihood can be reconstructed to a
precision equal to that of sampling error due to a finite sample size. We then
apply FBLs to mock weak lensing convergence power spectra, a cosmological
observable that is significantly non-Gaussian (NG). We find that the FBL
captures the NG signatures in the data extremely well, while other commonly
used data-driven likelihoods, such as Gaussian mixture models and independent
component analysis, fail to do so. This suggests that works that have found
small posterior shifts in NG data with data-driven likelihoods such as these
could be underestimating the impact of non-Gaussianity in parameter
constraints. By introducing a suite of tests that can capture different levels
of NG in the data, we show that the success or failure of traditional
data-driven likelihoods can be tied back to the structure of the NG in the
data. Unlike other methods, the flexibility of the FBL makes it successful at
tackling different types of NG simultaneously. Because of this, and
consequently their likely applicability across datasets and domains, we
encourage their use for inference when sufficient mock data are available for

Array (ALMA) observations of the molecular interstellar medium at an
unprecedented linear resolution of ~0.5 pc, in combination with existing
stellar kinematic information. These ALMA observations reveal a central
disc/torus of molecular gas clearly rotating around the black hole. This disc
is surrounded by a morphologically and kinematically complex flocculent
distribution of molecular clouds, that we resolve in detail. Continuum emission
is detected from the central parts of NGC 404, likely arising from the
Rayleigh-Jeans tail of emission from dust around the nucleus, and potentially
from dusty massive star-forming clumps at discrete locations in the disc.
Several dynamical measurements of the black hole mass in this system have been
made in the past, but they do not agree. We show here that both the observed
molecular gas and stellar kinematics independently require a ~5x10$^5$ Msun
black hole once we include the contribution of the molecular gas to the
potential. Our best estimate comes from the high-resolution molecular gas
kinematics, suggesting the black hole mass of this system is
5.5$^{+4.1}_{-3.8}\times$10$^5$ Msun (at the 99% confidence level), in good
agreement with our revised stellar kinematic measurement and broadly consistent
with extrapolations from the black hole mass - velocity dispersion and black
hole mass - bulge mass relations. This highlights the need to accurately
determine the mass and distribution of each dynamically important component
around intermediate-mass black holes when attempting to estimate their masses.

to construct a manifestly topological quadrupolar response action given by a

We measure this effect on 156 face-on star-forming galaxies from the Mapping

effect is small but systematic, with the integrated dust-corrected H$\alpha$

$10$ per cent), and depends on the specific star formation rate of the galaxy.
Given the spatial resolution of MaNGA, these are lower limits for the effect.

which can be tuned to any level of assembly bias. Fitting the parameters to our
semi-analytic model, we demonstrate that the corresponding mock catalogue
recovers the target level of GAB as well as the occupancy variations. Our
results enable producing realistic mock catalogues and directly inform
theoretical modelling of assembly bias and attempts to detect it in the
Universe.

bottlenecks for transient and multi-messenger astronomy, identifying eight
broad areas of concern. Some of these are very similar to the challenges faced
by many astronomers engaging in international collaboration, for example, data
access policies, funding, theoretical and computational resources and workforce
equity. Others, including, alerts, telescope coordination and
target-of-opportunity implementation, are strongly linked to the time domain
and are particularly challenging as we respond to transients. To address these
bottlenecks we offer thirty-five specific recommendations, some of which are
simply starting points and require development. These recommendations are not
only aimed at collaborative groups and individuals, but also at the various
organizations who are essential to making transient collaborations efficient
and effective: including the International Astronomical Union, observatories,
projects, scientific journals and funding agencies. We hope those involved in
transient research will find them constructive and use them to develop
collaborations with greater impact and more inclusive teams.

factor $F_\pi(Q^2)$ and the integrated modulus of the timelike form factor. For
$F_\pi(Q^2)$, the QCD light-cone sum rule with a dominant twist-2 term is used.
Adopting for the pion twist-2 distribution amplitude a certain combination of
the first few Gegenbauer polynomials, it is possible to fit their coefficients
$a_{2,4,6,...}$ (Gegenbauer moments) from this equation, employing the measured
pion timelike form factor. For the exploratory fit we use the data of the BaBar
collaboration. The results definitely exclude the asymptotic twist-2
distribution amplitude. Also the model with a single $a_2\neq 0$ is disfavoured
by the fit. Considering the models with $a_{n>2}\neq 0$, we find that the
fitted values of the second and fourth Gegenbauer moments cover the intervals
$a_2 (1 \mbox{GeV}) = (0.22 - 0.33) $, $a_4 (1 \mbox{GeV}) = (0.12 - 0.25) $.
The higher moments starting from $a_{8}$ are consistent with zero, albeit with
large uncertainties. The spacelike pion form factor obtained in two different
ways, from the dispersion relation and from the light-cone sum rule, agrees,
within uncertainties, with the measurement by the Jefferson Lab $F_\pi$

Federated learning, with the main idea of communicating only what is needed for
learning, has been recently introduced as a general approach for distributed
learning to enhance learning and improve security. However, federated learning
by itself does not guarantee any privacy for data subjects. To quantify and
control how much privacy is compromised in the worst-case, we can use
differential privacy.
  In this paper we combine additively homomorphic secure summation protocols
with differential privacy in the so-called cross-silo federated learning
setting. The goal is to learn complex models like neural networks while
guaranteeing strict privacy for the individual data subjects. We demonstrate
that our proposed solutions give prediction accuracy that is comparable to the
non-distributed setting, and are fast enough to enable learning models with
millions of parameters in a reasonable time.
  To enable learning under strict privacy guarantees that need privacy
amplification by subsampling, we present a general algorithm for oblivious
distributed subsampling. However, we also argue that when malicious parties are
present, a simple approach using distributed Poisson subsampling gives better
privacy.
  Finally, we show that by leveraging random projections we can further
scale-up our approach to larger models while suffering only a modest
performance loss.

users can access most websites free of charge, they need to pay a heavy cost on
their privacy and blindly trust third parties and intermediaries that absorb
great amounts of adrevenues and user data. This is one of the reasons users opt
out from advertising by resorting ad blockers thatin turn cost publishers
millions of dollars in lost adrevenues. Existing privacy-preserving advertising
approaches(e.g., Adnostic, Privad, Brave Ads) from both industry and academia
cannot guarantee the integrity of the performance analytics they provide to
advertisers, while they also rely on centralized management that users have to
trust without being able to audit. In this paper, we propose THEMIS, a novel
privacy-by-design ad platform that is decentralized and requires zero trust
from users. THEMIS (i) provides auditability to all participants, (ii) rewards
users for viewing ads, and (iii) allows advertisers to verify the performance

step forward towards an understanding of planetary systems. It however requires
a model able to (i) predict all the necessary observable quantities (not only
masses and orbits, but also radii, luminosities, magnitudes, or evaporation
rates) and (ii) address the large range in relevant planetary masses (from Mars
mass to super-Jupiters) and distances (from stellar-grazing to wide orbits).
Methods. We have developed a combined global end-to-end planetary formation and
evolution model, the Generation III Bern model, based on the core accretion
paradigm. This model solves as directly as possible the underlying differential
equations for the structure and evolution of the gas disc, the dynamical state
of the planetesimals, the internal structure of the planets yielding their
planetesimal and gas accretion rates, disc-driven orbital migration, and the
gravitational interaction of concurrently forming planets via a full N-body
calculation. Importantly, the model also follows the long-term evolution of the
planets on Gigayear timescales after formation including the effects of cooling
and contraction, atmospheric escape, bloating, and stellar tides. Results. To
test the model, we compared it with classical scenarios of Solar System
formation. For the terrestrial planets, we find that we obtain a giant impact
phase provided enough embryos (~100) are initially emplaced in the disc. For
the giant planets, we find that Jupiter-mass planets must accrete their core
shortly before the dispersal of the gas disc to prevent strong inward migration
that would bring them to the inner edge of the disc. Conclusions. The model can
form planetary systems with a wide range of properties. We find that systems
with only terrestrial planets are often well-ordered while giant-planet bearing
systems show no such similarity.

initial number of Moon-mass embryos per disc: 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100. The last
is our nominal population around 1 Sun-mass stars. The properties of giant
planets do not change much as long as there are at least 10 embryos in each
system. The study of giants can thus be done with simulations requiring less
computational resources. For inner terrestrial planets, only the 100-embryos
population is able to attain the giant-impact stage. In that population, each
planetary system contains on average 8 planets more massive than 1 $M_\oplus$.
The fraction of systems with giants planets at all orbital distances is 18%,
but only 1.6% are at > 10 au. Systems with giants contain on average 1.6 such
planets. The frequency of terrestrial and super-Earth planets peaks at a
stellar [Fe/H] of -0.2 and 0.0, respectively, being limited at lower [Fe/H] by
a lack of building blocks, and by (for them) detrimental growth of more massive
dynamically active planets at higher [Fe/H]. The frequency of more massive
planets (Neptunian, giants) increases monotonically with [Fe/H]. The fast
migration of planets in the 5-50 $M_\oplus$ range is reduced by the presence of
multiple lower-mass inner planets in the multi-embryos populations. We present
one of the most comprehensive simulations of (exo)planetary system formation
and evolution to date. For theory, they provide the framework to
observationally test the global statistical consequences of theoretical models
for specific physical processes. This is a important ingredient towards the
development of a standard model of planetary formation and evolution.

explained by planet formation theory. Here, we investigate the properties of
inner super-Earths and outer giant planets that form according to a core
accretion scenario. We study the mutual relations between these planet species
in synthetic planetary systems and compare them to the observed exoplanet
population. We invoked the Generation 3 Bern model of planet formation and
evolution to simulate 1000 multi-planet systems. We then confronted these
synthetic systems with the observed sample, taking into account the detection
bias that distorts the observed demographics. The formation of warm
super-Earths and cold Jupiters in the same system is enhanced compared to the
individual appearances, although it is weaker than what has been proposed
through observations. We attribute the discrepancy to warm and dynamically
active giant planets that frequently disrupt the inner systems, particularly in
high-metallicity environments. In general, a joint occurrence of the two planet
types requires intermediate solid reservoirs in the originating protoplanetary
disk. Furthermore, we find differences in the volatile content of planets in
different system architectures and predict that high-density super-Earths are
more likely to host an outer giant. This correlation can be tested
observationally.

since they can come into contact with infected patients. TB is a serious,
contagious, and potentially deadly disease. Early detection of the disease,
even when it is in latent form, prevents the spread of the disease and helps
with treatment. Currently, there are two types of TB diagnostic tests on the
market: skin test and blood test. The cost of the blood test is much higher
than the skin test. However, the possibility of getting a false positive or
false negative result in skin test is higher especially for persons with
specific characteristics, which can increase costs. In this study, we
categorize healthcare employees into multiple risk groups based on the
department they work in, the specific job they do, and their birth country. We
create a Markov decision process (MDP) model to decide which TB test should be
taken by each employee group to minimize the total costs related to testing,
undetected infections, employees' time lost. Due to the curse of
dimensionality, we use approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to obtain a
near-optimal solution. By analyzing this solution to the ADP we specify not
only the type but the frequency with which each test should be taken. Based on
this analysis, we propose a simple policy that can be used by healthcare
facilities since such facilities may not have the expertise or the resources to
develop and solve sophisticated optimization models.

static analysis problem. The seminal work of Andersen gave a worst-case cubic
$O(n^3)$ time points-to analysis algorithm for C, where $n$ is proportional to
the number of program variables. An algorithm is truly subcubic if it runs in
$O(n^{3-\delta})$ time for some $\delta > 0$. Despite decades of extensive
effort on improving points-to analysis, the cubic bound remains unbeaten. The
best combinatorial analysis algorithms have a ""slightly subcubic"" $O(n^3 /
\text{log } n)$ complexity. It is an interesting open problem whether points-to
analysis can be solved in truly subcubic time.
  In this paper, we prove that a truly subcubic $O(n^{3-\delta})$ time
combinatorial algorithm for inclusion-based points-to analysis is unlikely: a
truly subcubic combinatorial points-to analysis algorithm implies a truly
subcubic combinatorial algorithm for Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM). BMM
is a well-studied problem, and no truly subcubic combinatorial BMM algorithm
has been known. The fastest combinatorial BMM algorithms run in time $O(n^3/
\text{log}^4 n)$.
  Our result includes a simplified proof of the BMM-hardness of
Dyck-reachability. The reduction is interesting in its own right. First, it is
slightly stronger than the existing BMM-hardness results because our reduction
only requires one type of parenthesis in Dyck-reachability
($D_1$-reachability). Second, we formally attribute the ""cubic bottleneck"" to
the need to solve $D_1$-reachability, which captures the semantics of pointer
references/dereferences. This new perspective enables a more general reduction
that applies to programs with arbitrary pointer statements types. Last, our
reduction based on $D_1$-reachability shows that demand-driven points-to
analysis is as hard as the exhaustive counterpart.

achieving good performance in digital communications systems employing
time-multiplexed transmission. In this work we focus on \emph{frame
synchronization} for linear channels with memory in which the channel impulse
response is periodic and the additive Gaussian noise is correlated and
cyclostationary. Such channels appear in many communications scenarios,
including narrowband power line communications and interference-limited
wireless communications. We derive frame synchronization algorithms based on
simplifications of the optimal likelihood-ratio test, assuming the channel
impulse response is unknown at the receiver, which is applicable to many
practical scenarios. The computational complexity of each of the derived
algorithms is characterized, and a procedure for selecting nearly optimal
synchronization sequences is proposed. The algorithms derived in this work
achieve better performance than the noncoherent correlation detector, and, in
fact, facilitate a controlled tradeoff between complexity and performance.

find that the particle attains stationary state in both $x$ and $v$. We compute
the non-equilibrium joint stationary state of $x$ and $v$ and also study the
late time relaxation of the distribution function. On the other hand, for
partial resetting, the joint distribution is always in the transient state. At
large $t$, the position distribution possesses a scaling behaviour $(x/
\sqrt{t})$ which we rigorously derive. Next, we study the first passage time
properties with an absorbing wall at the origin. For complete resetting, we
find that the mean first passage time is rendered finite by the resetting
mechanism. We explicitly derive the expressions for the mean first passage time
and the survival probability at large $t$. However, in stark contrast, for
partial resetting, we find that resetting does not render finite mean first
passage time. This is because even though $x$ is brought to $x_0$, the large
fluctuation in $v$ ($\sim \sqrt{t}$) can take the particle substantially far

quasar systems at z < 1, two of which are previously unknown out of eight
observed, based on the presence of characteristic broad emission lines in each
component, while highlighting that the continuum of one object in one of the
pairs is reddened. In all cases, the [OIII]5007 emission lines have mild
velocity offsets, thus the joint [OIII] line profile is not double-peaked. We
find a dual quasar fraction of 0.26+/-0.18% and no evidence for evolution. A
comparison with the Horizon-AGN simulation seems to support the case of no
evolution in the dual quasar fraction when broadly matching the quasar
selection. These results may indicate a scenario in which the frequency of the
simultaneous triggering of luminous quasars is not as sensitive as expected to
the cosmic evolution of the merger rate or gas content of galaxies.

a seeded four-wave mixing process in an atomic rubidium vapor cell. More than
1.2~dB quantum advantage for the measurement sensitivity is obtained at faint
absorption levels ($\leq 10\%$). We also present a detailed theoretical
analysis to show that the observed quantum advantage when corrected for optical

sub-shot-noise measurement of absorption that requires neither homodyne/lock-in

many circumstances where sub-shot-noise-level absorption measurements are

neighborhoods (denoted by CFON coloring) is an assignment of colors to the
vertices such that every vertex has a uniquely colored vertex in its open
neighborhood. The minimum number of colors required for a CFON coloring of $G$
is the CFON chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{ON}(G)$.
  The decision problem that asks whether $\chi_{ON}(G) \leq k$ is NP-complete.
We obtain the following results:
  * Bodlaender, Kolay and Pieterse [WADS 2019] showed the upper bound
$\chi_{ON}(G)\leq {\sf fvs}(G)+3$, where ${\sf fvs}(G)$ denotes the size of a
minimum feedback vertex set of $G$. We show the improved bound of
$\chi_{ON}(G)\leq {\sf fvs}(G)+2$, which is tight, thereby answering an open
question in the above paper.
  * We study the relation between $\chi_{ON}(G)$ and the pathwidth of the graph
$G$, denoted ${\sf pw}(G)$. The above paper from WADS 2019 showed the upper
bound $\chi_{ON}(G) \leq 2{\sf tw}(G)+1$ where ${\sf tw}(G)$ stands for the
treewidth of $G$. This implies an upper bound of $\chi_{ON}(G) \leq 2{\sf
pw}(G)+1$. We show an improved bound of $\chi_{ON}(G) \leq \lfloor
\frac{5}{3}({\sf pw}(G)+1) \rfloor$.
  * We prove new bounds for $\chi_{ON}(G)$ with respect to the structural
parameters neighborhood diversity and distance to cluster, improving existing
results.
  * We also study the partial coloring variant of the CFON coloring problem,
which allows vertices to be left uncolored. Let $\chi^*_{ON}(G)$ denote the
minimum number of colors required to color $G$ as per this variant. Abel et.
al. [SIDMA 2018] showed that $\chi^*_{ON}(G) \leq 8$ when $G$ is planar. They
asked if fewer colors would suffice for planar graphs. We answer this question
by showing that $\chi^*_{ON}(G) \leq 5$ for all planar $G$.
  All our bounds are a result of constructive algorithmic procedures.

that can arise in nonatomic network congestion games when a fraction of the

remainder is completely selfish (e.g., human commuters). We study the
worst-case harm of altruism in such scenarios in terms of the perversity index,

exactly half of the traffic is altruistic, but it gracefully vanishes when the
fraction of altruistic traffic approaches either 0 or 1. Second, we show that
the harm of altruism is linearly increasing in a natural measure of the

an conditional generative adversarial model by 1) generating an image based on

EMIXER also enables self-supervision to leverage vast amount of unlabeled data.
Extensive experiments with real X-ray reports data illustrate how data

radial velocity distribution and the correlation between galaxy colour and
effective radius with the projected spatial distribution. We also obtain the
luminosity function of the early-type galaxies and the distribution of stellar

Additionally, we correlate the central galaxy distribution with an X-ray

the colour-magnitude relation (CMR) have a velocity distribution strongly
concentrated towards the values of the dominant galaxies and are homogeneously
distributed throughout the cluster. Those bluer than the CMR, in turn, have a
much more extended radial velocity distribution and are concentrated towards
the centre of the cluster. We also identify 12 candidates to ultra diffuse

for linear groups. We offer two different computations of these contributions:
one, based on truncation, is expressed in terms of regularized Rankin-Selberg
periods of Eisenstein series and Flicker-Rallis intertwining periods. The

can pass a two-dimensional test posed by gravitational lensing -- to reproduce
a particularly detailed Einstein ring in the core of the galaxy cluster Abell
3827. We find that when we require the lensing mass distribution to strictly
follow the shape (ellipticity and position angle) of the light distribution of
cluster member galaxies, intracluster stars, and the X-ray emitting
intracluster medium, we cannot reproduce the Einstein ring, despite allowing
the mass-to-light ratios of these visible components to freely vary with radius
to mimic alternative gravity theories. Alternatively, we show that the detailed
features of the Einstein ring are accurately reproduced by allowing a smooth,
freely oriented DM halo in the lens model, with relatively small contributions
from the visible components at a level consistent with their observed
brightnesses. This dominant DM component is constrained to have the same
orientation as the light from the intracluster stars, indicating that the
intracluster stars trace the gravitational potential of this component. The
Einstein ring of Abell 3827 therefore presents a new challenge for alternative
gravity theories: not only must such theories find agreement between the total
lensing mass and visible mass, but they must also find agreement between the
projected sky distribution of the lensing mass and that of the visible matter,
a more stringent test than has hitherto been posed by lensing data.

participants, called miners, according to their share of the total
computational power. Sufficiently large miners can perform selfish mining -
deviate from the protocol to gain more than their fair share. Such systems are
thus secure if all miners are smaller than a threshold size so their best
response is following the protocol.
  To find the threshold, one has to identify the optimal strategy for miners of
different sizes, i.e., solve a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, because
of the PoW difficulty adjustment mechanism, the miners' utility is a non-linear
ratio function. We therefore call this an Average Reward Ratio (ARR) MDP.
Sapirshtein et al.\ were the first to solve ARR MDPs by solving a series of
standard MDPs that converge to the ARR MDP solution.
  In this work, we present a novel technique for solving an ARR MDP by solving
a single standard MDP. The crux of our approach is to augment the MDP such that
it terminates randomly, within an expected number of rounds. We call this
Probabilistic Termination Optimization (PTO), and the technique applies to any
MDP whose utility is a ratio function. We bound the approximation error of PTO
- it is inversely proportional to the expected number of rounds before
termination, a parameter that we control. Empirically, PTO's complexity is an
order of magnitude lower than the state of the art.
  PTO can be easily applied to different blockchains. We use it to tighten the
bound on the threshold for selfish mining in Ethereum.

optimization objectives. For instance, the reinforcement learning approaches
tend to optimize on the \textit{comfort} aspect of the socially compliant
navigation, whereas the inverse reinforcement learning approaches are designed
to achieve \textit{natural} behavior. In this paper, we propose NaviGAN, a

an adversarial training framework that can learn to generate a navigation path

cost-effective and high-performance optoelectronic devices. Unlike a planar PN
junction, a radial-junction geometry maximizes the optical interaction in the
three-dimensional (3D) structures, while effectively extracting the generated
carriers via the conformal PN junction. In this paper, we report
characterizations of radial PN junctions that consist of p-type Si micropillars
created by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) and an n-type layer formed by
phosphorus gas diffusion. We use electron-beam induced current (EBIC)
microscopy to access the 3D junction profile from the sidewall of the pillars.
Our EBIC images reveal uniform PN junctions conformally constructed on the 3D
pillar array. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations and EBIC modeling, we estimate
local carrier separation/collection efficiency that reflects the quality of the
PN junction. We find the EBIC efficiency of the pillar array increases with the
incident electron beam energy, consistent with the EBIC behaviors observed in a
high-quality planar PN junction. The magnitude of the EBIC efficiency of our
pillar array is about 70 % at 10 kV, slightly lower than that of the planar
device (about 81 %). We suggest that this reduction could be attributed to the
unpassivated pillar surface and the unintended recombination centers in the
pillar cores introduced during the DRIE processes. Our results support that the
depth-dependent EBIC approach is ideally suitable for evaluating PN junctions
formed on micro/nanostructured semiconductors with various geometry.

  Control",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the fluctuating nature of the wind and the increasing use of wind
energy as a power source, wind power will have an increasing negative influence
on the stability of the power grid. In this paper, a model predictive control
strategy is introduced that not only stabilizes the power produced by wind
farms, but also creates the possibility to perform power reference tracking
with wind farms. With power reference tracking, it is possible for grid
operators to adapt the power production to a change in the power demand and to
counteract fluctuations that are introduced by other power generators. In this
way, wind farms can actually contribute to the stabilization of the power grid
when this is necessary instead of negatively influencing it. A low-fidelity
control-oriented wind farm model is developed and employed in the developed
distributed model predictive controller. In this control model, the wake
dynamics are taken into account and consequently, the model's order is
relatively large. This makes it, from a computational point of view,
challenging for a centralized model predictive control to provide real-time
control for large wind farms. Therefore, the controller proposed in this paper
is a distributed model predictive control. Here, the central control problem is
divided into smaller local control problems that are solved in parallel on
local controllers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and
brings the application of model predictive control in a wind farm a step closer
to practical implementation. The proposed control solution is tested in
simulations on a 10 and 64 turbine wind farm.

finite-density $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $N_f = 2$ flavours of rooted staggered
sea quarks, in combination with Wilson-Dirac and Domain Wall valence quarks.
The pion mass is reasonably small with $m_{\pi}/m_{\rho} \approx 0.4$. We
concentrate in particular on the vicinity of the chiral crossover, where we
find the low-frequency electric conductivity to be most sensitive to small
changes in fermion density. Working in the low-density QCD-like regime with
spontaneously broken chiral symmetry, we obtain an estimate of the first
nontrivial coefficient $c(T)$ of the expansion of conductivity $\sigma(T,\mu) =
\sigma(T,0) \left(1 + c(T) (\mu/T)^2 + O(\mu^4)\right)$ in powers of $\mu$,
which has rather weak temperature dependence and takes its maximal value $c(T)
\approx 0.10 \pm 0.07$ around the critical temperature. At larger densities and
lower temperatures, the conductivity quickly grows towards the diquark
condensation phase, and also becomes closer to the free quark result. As a
by-product of our study we confirm the conclusions of previous studies with
heavier pion that for $SU(2)$ gauge theory the ratio of crossover temperature
to pion mass $T_c/m_{\pi} \approx 0.4$ at $\mu=0$ is significantly smaller than
in real QCD.

formation in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which predict $\gtrsim 0.01$
M$_\odot$ of ejecta dust forming within $\sim 1000$ days, and observations at
these epochs, which infer much lower masses. We demonstrate that, in the
optically thin case, these low dust masses are robust despite significant
observational and model uncertainties. For a sample of 11 well-observed CCSNe,
no plausible model reaches carbon dust masses above $10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$, or
silicate masses above $\sim 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$. Optically thick models can
accommodate larger dust masses, but the dust must be clumped and have a low
($<0.1$) covering fraction to avoid conflict with data at optical wavelengths.
These values are insufficient to reproduce the observed infrared fluxes, and
the required covering fraction varies not only between SNe but between epochs
for the same object. The difficulty in reconciling large dust masses with
early-time observations of CCSNe, combined with well-established detections of
comparably large dust masses in supernova remnants, suggests that a mechanism
for late-time dust formation is necessary.

$0.4<z<1.0$ and $0.37<z<0.77$ respectively for the HI line. Fifty of the 53
radio sources observed have reliable optical redshifts, giving a total redshift
path $\Delta z$ = 21.37. This was a spectroscopically-untargeted survey, with
no prior assumptions about the location of the lines in redshift space. Four
intervening HI lines were detected, two of them new. In each case, the

existence of a low-loss frequency window with anomalous nonmonotonic dispersion

whether a given piece of text conveys the meaning of a given semantic tag. The
problem of semantic tagging is largely solved with supervised learning and
today, deep learning models are widely perceived to be better for semantic
tagging. However, there is no comprehensive study supporting the popular
belief. Practitioners often have to train different types of models for each
semantic tagging task to identify the best model. This process is both
expensive and inefficient.
  We embark on a systematic study to investigate the following question: Are
deep models the best performing model for all semantic tagging tasks? To answer
this question, we compare deep models against ""simple models"" over datasets
with varying characteristics. Specifically, we select three prevalent deep
models (i.e. CNN, LSTM, and BERT) and two simple models (i.e. LR and SVM), and
compare their performance on the semantic tagging task over 21 datasets.
Results show that the size, the label ratio, and the label cleanliness of a
dataset significantly impact the quality of semantic tagging. Simple models
achieve similar tagging quality to deep models on large datasets, but the
runtime of simple models is much shorter. Moreover, simple models can achieve
better tagging quality than deep models when targeting datasets show worse
label cleanliness and/or more severe imbalance. Based on these findings, our
study can systematically guide practitioners in selecting the right learning
model for their semantic tagging task.

detected or ruled out. A future limit of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}<0.027$ could rule
out any generic axion-like particle across a wide range of masses as long as
the reheating temperature is not too low, or alternatively, a future
cosmological detection of such an axion-like particle could become the tightest

singular elliptic equations involving one-Laplacian is studied. Equations
treated here also contains another well-behaving elliptic operator such as
$p$-Laplacian with $1<p<\infty$. The problem is that one-Laplacian is too
singular on degenerate points, what is often called facet, which makes it
difficult to obtain even Lipschitz regularity of weak solutions. This
difficulty is overcome by making suitable approximation schemes, and by
avoiding analysis on facet for approximated solutions. The key estimate is a
local a priori uniform Lipschitz estimate for classical solutions to
regularized equations, which is proved by Moser's iteration. Another local a
priori uniform Lipschitz bounds can also be obtained by De Giorgi's truncation.
Proofs of local Lipschitz estimates in this paper are rather classical and
elementary in the sense that nonlinear potential estimates are not used at all.

Quasi-Periodic WaveNet (QPNet) is proposed to improve the limited pitch
controllability of vanilla WaveNet (WN) using pitch-dependent dilated
convolution neural networks (PDCNNs). Specifically, as a probabilistic
autoregressive generation model with stacked dilated convolution layers, WN
achieves high-fidelity audio waveform generation. However, the pure-data-driven
nature and the lack of prior knowledge of audio signals degrade the pitch
controllability of WN. For instance, it is difficult for WN to precisely
generate the periodic components of audio signals when the given auxiliary
fundamental frequency ($F_{0}$) features are outside the $F_{0}$ range observed
in the training data. To address this problem, QPNet with two novel designs is
proposed. First, the PDCNN component is applied to dynamically change the
network architecture of WN according to the given auxiliary $F_{0}$ features.
Second, a cascaded network structure is utilized to simultaneously model the
long- and short-term dependencies of quasi-periodic signals such as speech. The
performances of single-tone sinusoid and speech generations are evaluated. The
experimental results show the effectiveness of the PDCNNs for unseen auxiliary
$F_{0}$ features and the effectiveness of the cascaded structure for speech
generation.

a consistent model to match the observational data. A simple two-phase model
assuming a hot component and an ionized warm component can accommodate all the
three observations. The total amount of the gas in individual halos is inferred
to be comparable to the universal baryon fraction corresponding to the halo
mass. The inferred temperature of the hot component is comparable to the halo
virial temperature. The fraction of the hot component increases from
$(15-40)\%$ for $10^{12.5}{M}_\odot$ halos to $(40-60)\%$ for
$10^{14.5}{M}_\odot$ halos, where the ranges reflect uncertainties in the

a large number of filters or weights without any perceptible drop in accuracy.
The number of parameters and that of FLOPs are usually the reported metrics to
measure the quality of the pruned models. However, the gain in speed for these
pruned models is often overlooked in the literature due to the complex nature
of latency measurements. In this paper, we show the limitation of filter
pruning methods in terms of latency reduction and propose LayerPrune framework.
LayerPrune presents a set of layer pruning methods based on different criteria
that achieve higher latency reduction than filter pruning methods on similar
accuracy. The advantage of layer pruning over filter pruning in terms of
latency reduction is a result of the fact that the former is not constrained by
the original model's depth and thus allows for a larger range of latency
reduction. For each filter pruning method we examined, we use the same filter
importance criterion to calculate a per-layer importance score in one-shot. We
then prune the least important layers and fine-tune the shallower model which
obtains comparable or better accuracy than its filter-based pruning
counterpart. This one-shot process allows to remove layers from single path
networks like VGG before fine-tuning, unlike in iterative filter pruning, a
minimum number of filters per layer is required to allow for data flow which
constraint the search space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
examine the effect of pruning methods on latency metric instead of FLOPs for
multiple networks, datasets and hardware targets. LayerPrune also outperforms
handcrafted architectures such as Shufflenet, MobileNet, MNASNet and ResNet18
by 7.3%, 4.6%, 2.8% and 0.5% respectively on similar latency budget on ImageNet
dataset.

of genomic DNA. Several approaches were proposed to quantify the fidelity of
DNA polymerase. Direct measurements of the error frequency of the replication
products definitely give the true fidelity but turn out very hard to implement.
Two biochemical kinetic approaches, the steady-state assay and the
transient-state assay, were then suggested and widely adopted. In these assays,
the error frequency is indirectly estimated by using the steady-state or the
transient-state kinetic theory combined with the measured kinetic rates.
However, whether these indirectly estimated fidelities are equivalent to the
true fidelity has never been clarified theoretically, and in particular there
are different strategies to quantify the proofreading efficiency of DNAP but
often lead to inconsistent results. The reason for all these confusions is that
it's mathematically challenging to formulate a rigorous and general theory of
the true fidelity. Recently we have succeeded to establish such a theoretical
framework. In this paper, we develop this theory to make a comprehensive
examination on the theoretical foundation of the kinetic assays and the
relation between fidelities obtained by different methods. We conclude that
while the steady-state assay and the transient-state assay can always measure
the true fidelity of exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases, they only do so for
exonuclease-efficient DNA polymerases conditionally (the proper way to use
these assays to quantify the proofreading efficiency is also suggested). We
thus propose a new kinetic approach, the single-molecule assay, which
indirectly but precisely characterizes the true fidelity of either
exonuclease-deficient or exonuclease-efficient DNA polymerases.

used to enhance the reliability and reduce the collision risks of the AV, e.g.,
under bad weather conditions. The problem of the iRDRC is to decide when to use
the communication mode or the radar mode to maximize the data throughput while
minimizing the miss detection probability of unexpected events given the
uncertainty of surrounding environment. To solve the problem, we develop a deep
reinforcement learning algorithm that allows the AV to quickly obtain the

Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms baseline schemes

handful of samples at test time, which has been predominantly tackled with the
idea of meta-learning. However, meta-learning approaches essentially learn
across a variety of few-shot tasks and thus still require large-scale training
data with fine-grained supervision to derive a generalized model, thereby
involving prohibitive annotation cost. In this paper, we advance the few-shot
classification paradigm towards a more challenging scenario, i.e.,
cross-granularity few-shot classification, where the model observes only coarse
labels during training while is expected to perform fine-grained classification
during testing. This task largely relieves the annotation cost since
fine-grained labeling usually requires strong domain-specific expertise. To
bridge the cross-granularity gap, we approximate the fine-grained data
distribution by greedy clustering of each coarse-class into pseudo-fine-classes
according to the similarity of image embeddings. We then propose a
meta-embedder that jointly optimizes the visual- and semantic-discrimination,
in both instance-wise and coarse class-wise, to obtain a good feature space for
this coarse-to-fine pseudo-labeling process. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our

Prandtl number ($Pr$) of 0.71 (corresponding to the working fluids of air). The
Lagrangian point particle model was used to describe the motion of
microparticles in the turbulence. Our results show that the suspended particles
are homogeneously distributed in the turbulence for the Stokes number ($St$)
less than $10^{-3}$, and they tend to cluster into bands for $10^{-3} \lesssim
St \lesssim 10^{-2}$. At even larger $St$, the microparticles will quickly
sediment in the convection. We also calculate the mean-square displacement
(MSD) of the particle's trajectories. At short time intervals, the MSD exhibits
a ballistic regime, and it is isotropic in vertical and lateral directions; at
longer time intervals, the MSD reflects a confined motion for the particles,
and it is anisotropic in different directions. We further obtained a phase
diagram of the particle deposition positions on the wall, and we identified
three deposition states depending on the particle's density and diameter. An
interesting finding is that the dispersed particles preferred to deposit on the
vertical wall where the hot plumes arise, which is verified by tilting the cell

electrons or holes via sd exchange interaction and boost the thermopower over
the conventional diffusive thermopower. P-type magnon-drag thermopower has been
observed in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic metallic and degenerate
semiconductors. However, it has been less reported for intrinsic or n-type
magnetic semiconductors; therefore, the impact of magnon-bipolar carrier drag
on thermopower has remained unexplored. Here, a theoretical model for
magnon-bipolar carrier drag thermopower is derived based on the magnon-carrier
interaction lifetimes. The model predicts that the bipolar carrier drag
thermopower becomes independent of both the carrier and magnon relaxation
times. A proof of concept experiment is presented that confirms this
prediction. We also report the observation of magnon-carrier drag thermopower
in n-type and intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors experimentally. The p-type
antiferromagnetic MnTe is doped with different amounts of Cr to produce
non-degenerate and n-type semiconductors of various carrier concentrations. Cr
dopants have a donor nature and create ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic clusters
due to the Cr3+ oxidation state. Heat capacity measurements confirm the
presence of magnons in Cr-doped MnTe. It is shown that the magnon-drag

spontaneous collective synchronization. We study here a nontrivial
generalization of the Kuramoto model by including an interaction that breaks
explicitly the rotational symmetry of the model. In an inertial frame (e.g.,
the laboratory frame), the Kuramoto model does not allow for a stationary
state, that is, a state with time-independent value of the so-called Kuramoto
(complex) synchronization order parameter $z\equiv re^{i\psi}$; Note that a
time-independent $z$ implies $r$ and $\psi$ both time independent, with the
latter fact corresponding to a state in which $\psi$ rotates at zero frequency
(no rotation). In this backdrop, we ask: Does the introduction of the
symmetry-breaking term suffice to allow for the existence of a stationary state
in the laboratory frame? Compared to the original model, we reveal a rather
rich phase diagram of the resulting model, with the existence of both
stationary and standing wave phases. While in the former the synchronization
order parameter $r$ has a long-time value that is time independent, one has in
the latter an oscillatory behavior of the order parameter as a function of time
that nevertheless yields a non-zero and time-independent time average. Our
results are based on numerical integration of the dynamical equations as well
as an exact analysis of the dynamics by invoking the so-called Ott-Antonsen
ansatz that allows to derive a reduced set of time-evolution equations for the
order parameter.

  Accelerated FedAvg",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) learns a model jointly from a set of participating
devices without sharing each other's privately held data. The characteristics
of non-i.i.d. data across the network, low device participation, high
communication costs, and the mandate that data remain private bring challenges
in understanding the convergence of FL algorithms, particularly with regards to
how convergence scales with the number of participating devices. In this paper,
we focus on Federated Averaging (FedAvg)--arguably the most popular and
effective FL algorithm class in use today--and provide a unified and
comprehensive study of its convergence rate. Although FedAvg has recently been
studied by an emerging line of literature, a systematic study of how FedAvg's
convergence scales with the number of participating devices in the fully
heterogeneous FL setting is lacking--a crucial issue whose answer would shed
light on the performance of FedAvg in large FL systems in practice. We fill
this gap by providing a unified analysis that establishes convergence
guarantees for FedAvg under strongly convex smooth, convex smooth problems, and
overparameterized strongly convex smooth problems. We show that FedAvg enjoys
linear speedup in each case, although with different convergence rates and
communication efficiencies. While there have been linear speedup results from
distributed optimization that assumes full participation, ours are the first to
establish linear speedup for FedAvg under both statistical and system
heterogeneity. For strongly convex and convex problems, we also characterize
the corresponding convergence rates for the Nesterov accelerated FedAvg
algorithm, which are the first linear speedup guarantees for momentum variants
of FedAvg in convex settings. Empirical studies of the algorithms in various
settings have supported our theoretical results.

achieved competitive results in semi-supervised learning. This paper
theoretically analyzes how GAN-based semi-supervised learning (GAN-SSL) works.
We first prove that, given a fixed generator, optimizing the discriminator of
GAN-SSL is equivalent to optimizing that of supervised learning. Thus, the
optimal discriminator in GAN-SSL is expected to be perfect on labeled data.
Then, if the perfect discriminator can further cause the optimization objective
to reach its theoretical maximum, the optimal generator will match the true
data distribution. Since it is impossible to reach the theoretical maximum in
practice, one cannot expect to obtain a perfect generator for generating data,
which is apparently different from the objective of GANs. Furthermore, if the
labeled data can traverse all connected subdomains of the data manifold, which
is reasonable in semi-supervised classification, we additionally expect the
optimal discriminator in GAN-SSL to also be perfect on unlabeled data. In
conclusion, the minimax optimization in GAN-SSL will theoretically output a
perfect discriminator on both labeled and unlabeled data by unexpectedly
learning an imperfect generator, i.e., GAN-SSL can effectively improve the
generalization ability of the discriminator by leveraging unlabeled
information.

one ribbon are highly correlated with those through the other, therefore
belonging to the same current system. The non-neutrality factor of this current
system is independent of the flare magnitude, implying that both direct and
return currents participate in flares. J-shaped flares are distinct from
non-J-shaped flares in the following aspects: 1) Electric current densities
within J-shaped SRA are significantly smaller than those within non-J-shaped
SRA, but J-shaped SRA and its associated magnetic flux are also significantly
larger. 2) Electric currents through SRA are positively correlated with the
flare magnitude, but J-shaped flares show stronger correlation than
non-J-shaped flares. 3) The majority (75\%) of J-shaped flares are eruptive,
while the majority (86\%) of non-J-shaped flares are confined; accordingly,
hosting active regions of J-shaped flares are more likely to be sigmoidal than
non-J-shaped flares. Thus, J-shaped flares constitute a distinct subset of
two-ribbon flares, probably the representative of eruptive ones. Further, we
found that combining SRA and its associated magnetic flux has the potential to
differentiate eruptive from confined flares.

density behaviour, a canonical variable density (VD) mixing extracted from a
supersonic streamwise vortex protocol, shock bubble interaction (SBI), is
numerically studied and compared with a counterpart of passive scalar (PS)
mixing. It is meaningful to observe that the maximum concentration decays much
faster in VD SBI than in PS SBI regardless of the shock Mach number (Ma = 1.22
~ 4). The quasi-Lamb-Oseen type velocity distribution in the PS SBI is found by
analyzing the azimuthal velocity that stretches the bubble. Meanwhile, for the
VD SBI, an additional stretching enhanced by the secondary baroclinic vorticity
(SBV) production contributes to the faster-mixing decay. The underlying
mechanism of the SBV-enhanced stretching is further revealed through the
density and velocity difference between the shocked light bubble and the heavy
ambient air. By combining the SBV-accelerated stretching model and the initial
shock compression, a novel mixing time estimation for VD SBI is theoretically
proposed by solving the advection-diffusion equation under a deformation field
of an axisymmetric vortex with the additional SBV induced azimuthal velocity.
Based on the mixing time model, a mixing enhancement number defined by the
ratio of VD and PS mixing time further reveals the contribution from the
variable-density effect, which implies a better control of density distribution
for mixing enhancement in a supersonic streamwise vortex.

oscillation-mediated viscosity drop observed experimentally. We compare the
time-dependent components of the stress and microstructure tensors to
discrete-element simulations. Although the model correctly captures the main
qualitative behaviour, it generally over-predicts the microstructural
anisotropy in steady shear, and it under-predicts the number of particle
contacts in oscillating shear. It also does not fully capture the correct
variation in phase angle between the transverse component of the microstructure
and the shear rate oscillations, as the amplitude of the latter is increased.
These discrepancies suggest avenues for future improvements to the model.

While the dissipation mainly controls the passive scalar mixing rate, an
objective definition of variable-density mixing rate characterizing the
macroscopic mixing formation is still lacking, and the fundamental behavior of
mixing rate evolution is not yet well understood. Here, we first show that the
variable-density mixing of shock bubble interaction is distinctly different
from the previous observations in the passive scalar mixing. The
widely-accepted hyperbolic conservation of the first moment of concentration in
the scalar mixing, i.e., the conservation of the mean concentration, is
violated in variable-density flows. We further combine the compositional
transport equation and the divergence relation for the miscible flows to
provide the evidence that the existence of density gradient accelerated mixing
rate, decomposed by the accelerated dissipation term and redistributed
diffusion term, contributes to the anomalous decrease or increase of the mean
concentration depending on Atwood number. Further analyzing a number of
simulations for the cylindrical or spherical bubbles under a broad range of
shock Mach numbers, Reynolds numbers, and Peclet numbers, the density gradient
accelerated mixing rate exhibits weak dependent on Peclet numbers, and
identifies an Atwood number range with high mixing rate, which can be
theoretically predicted based on the mode of hyperbolic conservation violation
behavior.

shock-wave/jet interaction (OS/JI for short), extracted from a wall-mount ramp
injector in scramjet, is studied through Large-eddy simulation method. Shocked
helium jet is deformed into a pair of streamwise vortex with a co-rotating
companion vortex showing the lift-off characteristic immediately after shock.
Based on the objective coordinate system in frame of oblique shock structure,
it is found that the nature of three-dimensional lift-off structure of a
shockinduced streamwise vortex is inherently and precisely controlled by a
two-stage growth mode of structure kinetics of a shock bubble interaction (SBI
for short). The striking similar structures between OS/JI and SBI support the
proposition that the lift-off of streamwise vortex is the result of a
underlying two-dimensional vortical motion. By considering the first stage
impulsive linear growth rate, an improved vortex propagation model suitable for
SBI is proposed and validated. The lift-off phenomena of both numerical OS/JI
case in this paper and wall-mounted ramp injector cases in literature are well
explained under the two-stage structure kinetics model of SBI. This model
further predicts that for higher free stream Mach number (M > 5), increasing
ramp compression shows little effect on elevating streamwise vortex while
evident lift-off may occur for lower Mach number (M < 3.5), which offers the

responsible for the observed polarisation in the (sub-)millimetre wavelength
range of several protoplanetary disks. Although the degree of polarisation
produced by scattering is highly dependent on the dust model, early studies
investigating this mechanism relied on the assumption of single grain sizes and
simple density distribution of the dust. However, in the dense inner regions
where this mechanism is usually most efficient, the existence of dust grains
with sizes ranging from nanometres to millimetres has been confirmed.
Additionally, the presence of gas forces larger grains to migrate vertically
towards the disk midplane, introducing a dust segregation in the vertical
direction. Using polarisation radiative transfer simulations, we analyse the
dependence of the resulting scattered light polarisation at 350 $\mu$m, 850
$\mu$m, 1.3 mm, and 2 mm on various parameters describing protoplanetary disks,
including the effect of dust grain settling. We find that the different disk
parameters change the degree of polarisation mostly by affecting the anisotropy
of the radiation field, the optical depth, or both. It is therefore very
challenging to deduce certain disk parameter values directly from polarisation
measurements alone. However, assuming a high dust albedo, it is possible to
trace the transition from optically thick to optically thin disk regions. The
degree of polarisation in most of the considered disk configurations is lower
than what is found observationally, implying the necessity to revisit models
that describe the dust properties and disk structure.

application of this method, we restrict our attention to a frequency

this way, we are able to highlight that the LB method provides the correct

inaccurate solutions. When coupling to a dynamical fluid, on the other hand, we
present the first self-consistent solution of the RTE with LB methods within a

recognition problem. Enhancing the feature's discriminative power is one of the
key problems to improve its performance. Metric learning technology is often
applied to address this need, while achieving a good tradeoff between
underfitting and overfitting plays the vital role in metric learning. Hence, we
propose a novel ensemble cascade metric learning (ECML) mechanism. In
particular, hierarchical metric learning is executed in the cascade way to
alleviate underfitting. Meanwhile, at each learning level, the features are
split into non-overlapping groups. Then, metric learning is executed among the
feature groups in the ensemble manner to resist overfitting. Considering the
feature distribution characteristics of faces, a robust Mahalanobis metric
learning method (RMML) with closed-form solution is additionally proposed. It
can avoid the computation failure issue on inverse matrix faced by some
well-known metric learning approaches (e.g., KISSME). Embedding RMML into the
proposed ECML mechanism, our metric learning paradigm (EC-RMML) can run in the
one-pass learning manner. Experimental results demonstrate that EC-RMML is
superior to state-of-the-art metric learning methods for face verification.
And, the proposed ensemble cascade metric learning mechanism is also applicable
to other metric learning approaches.

the interpretability methods indicated that spurious feature correlations may

distinctions are the basic analytical concepts needed to unpack and analyze
morphisms, duality, and universal constructions in the Sets, the category of
sets and functions. The analysis extends directly to other concrete categories
(groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.) where the objects are sets with a certain
type of structure and the morphisms are functions that preserve that structure.
Then the elements & distinctions-based definitions can be abstracted in purely
arrow-theoretic way for abstract category theory. In short, the language of
elements & distinctions is the conceptual language in which the category of
sets is written, and abstract category theory gives the abstract arrows version
of those definitions.

operators by replacing weak convergence with the unbounded absolutely weak
convergence ( $uaw$-convergence) in the definition of a continuous operator

reflexive Banach lattices in terms of these spaces of operators. Moreover,
motivated by characterizing of a reflexive Banach lattice in terms of unbounded
absolutely weakly Cauchy sequences, we consider pre-unbounded operators between
Banach lattices which maps $uaw$-Cauchy sequences to weakly ( $uaw$- or norm)
convergent sequences. This allows us to characterize $KB$-spaces and reflexive
spaces in terms of these operators, too. Furthermore, we consider the unbounded
Banach-Saks property as an unbounded version of the weak Banach-Saks property.
There are many considerable relations between spaces possessing the unbounded
Banach-Saks property with spaces fulfilled by different types of the known
Banach-Saks property. In particular, we characterize order continuous Banach
lattices in terms of these relations, as well.

self-consistent set of maps for different cosmological probes. Each realization
is generated from the same underlying simulated density field, and contains
full-sky maps of different probes, namely weak lensing shear, galaxy
overdensity including RSD, CMB lensing, and CMB temperature anisotropies from
the ISW effect. The lightcone generation performed by UFalcon is parallelized
and based on the replication of a large periodic volume simulated with the
GPU-accelerated $N$-Body code PkdGrav3. The post-processing to construct the
lightcones requires only a runtime of about 1 walltime-hour corresponding to
about 100 CPU-hours. We use a randomization procedure to increase the number of
quasi-independent full-sky UFalcon map-realizations, which enables us to
compute an accurate multi-probe covariance matrix. Using this framework, we
forecast cosmological parameter constraints by performing a multi-probe
likelihood analysis for a combination of simulated future stage-IV-like
surveys. We find that the inclusion of the cross-correlations between the
probes significantly increases the information gain in the parameter
constraints. We also find that the use of a non-Gaussian covariance matrix is
increasingly important, as more probes and cross-correlation power spectra are
included. A version of the UFalcon package currently including weak
gravitational lensing is publicly available.

  The application of mathematical probability theory in statistics is quite
controversial. Controversies regard both the interpretation of probability, and
approaches to statistical inference. After having given an overview of the main
approaches, I will propose a re-interpretation of frequentist probability. Most
statisticians are aware that probability models interpreted in a frequentist
manner are not really true in objective reality, but only idealisations. I
argue that this is often ignored when actually applying frequentist methods and
interpreting the results, and that keeping up the awareness for the essential
difference between reality and models can lead to a more appropriate use and
interpretation of frequentist models and methods, called
""frequentism-as-model"". This is elaborated showing connections to existing
work, appreciating the special role of independently and identically
distributed observations and subject matter knowledge, giving an account of how
and under what conditions models that are not true can be useful, giving
detailed interpretations of tests and confidence intervals, confronting their
implicit compatibility logic with the inverse probability logic of Bayesian
inference, re-interpreting the role of model assumptions, appreciating
robustness, and the role of ""interpretative equivalence"" of models. Epistemic
probability shares the issue that its models are only idealisations, and an
analogous ""epistemic-probability-as-model"" can also be developed.

  The extra stress tensor describing the elastic response of the fluid is in
our case purely spherical, which is a simplification from the physical point of
view. The model nevertheless exhibits features that require novel mathematical
ideas in order to deal with the technically complex structure of the associated

(RTMF) controller for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with uncertainties.
The controller is based on the second order sliding mode (SOSM) algorithm
(super twisting) which is the most effective and popular in the family of
higher order sliding modes (HOSM). The use of super twisting algorithm (STA)
eliminates the chattering problem encountered in traditional sliding mode
control while retaining its robustness properties. The proposed robust tracking
controller can guarantee the asymptotic stability of tracking error in the
presence of time varying uncertain parameter and exogenous disturbances.
Finally, this strategy is implemented on a magnetic levitation system (MagLev)
which is inherently unstable and nonlinear. While implementing this proposed
RTMF controller for MagLev system, a super twisting observer (STO) is used to
estimate the unknown state i.e the velocity of the ball which is not directly
available for measurement. It has been observed that the RTMF controller based
on STA-STO pair, is not good enough to achieve SOSM for a chosen sliding
surface using continuous control. As a remedy, continuous RTMF controller based
on STA is implemented with a higher order sliding mode observer (HOSMO). The
simulated as well as the experimental results are provided to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed controller-observers pair.

escape dynamics is shown to exhibit exponential tails. We examine the

scene graph is useful in many applications at the intersection of vision and
language. We consider a challenging problem of compositional generalization
that emerges in this task due to a long tail data distribution. Current scene
graph generation models are trained on a tiny fraction of the distribution
corresponding to the most frequent compositions, e.g. <cup, on, table>.
However, test images might contain zero- and few-shot compositions of objects
and relationships, e.g. <cup, on, surfboard>. Despite each of the object
categories and the predicate (e.g. 'on') being frequent in the training data,
the models often fail to properly understand such unseen or rare compositions.
To improve generalization, it is natural to attempt increasing the diversity of
the training distribution. However, in the graph domain this is non-trivial. To
that end, we propose a method to synthesize rare yet plausible scene graphs by
perturbing real ones. We then propose and empirically study a model based on
conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) that allows us to generate
visual features of perturbed scene graphs and learn from them in a joint
fashion. When evaluated on the Visual Genome dataset, our approach yields
marginal, but consistent improvements in zero- and few-shot metrics. We analyze
the limitations of our approach indicating promising directions for future
research.

ICRBI algorithm achieves the best performance at the cost of the highest

This work proposes a rather universal dynamics-based characterization of one
large class of $Z$-type HOTIs without specifically relying on any symmetry
considerations. The key element of our innovative approach is to connect
quantum quench dynamics with nested configurations of the so-called band
inversion surfaces (BISs) of momentum-space Hamiltonians as a sum of operators
from the Clifford algebra (a condition that can be relaxed), thereby making it
possible to dynamically detect each and every order of topology on an equal
footing. Given that experiments on synthetic topological matter can directly
measure the winding of certain pseudospin texture to determine topological
features of BISs, the topological invariants defined through nested BISs are
all within reach of ongoing experiments. Further, the necessity of having
nested BISs in defining higher-order topology offers a unique perspective to
investigate and engineer higher-order topological phase transitions.

collaborative software development. However, the isolation caused by branches
may impose challenges on the upcoming merging process. Recently, companies like
Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Spotify, among others, have adopted
trunk-based development together with feature toggles. This strategy enables
collaboration without the need for isolation through branches, potentially
reducing the merging challenges. However, the literature lacks evidence about
the benefits and limitations of feature toggles to collaborative software
development. Objective/Method: In this paper, we study the effects of applying
feature toggles on 949 open-source projects written in 6 different programming
languages. We first identified the moment in which each project adopted a
feature toggles framework. Then, we observed whether the adoption implied
significant changes in the frequency or complexity of branch merges and the
number of defects, and the average time to fix them. Finally, we compared the
obtained results with results obtained from a set of control projects that do
not use feature toggles frameworks. Results/Conclusion: We could observe a
reduction in the average merge effort and an increase in the average total time
needed to fix defects after adopting feature toggles frameworks. However, we
could not confirm that this increase was influenced by the use of feature
toggles.

convectively heated from the bottom with heat transfer coefficient of 50 W/m2K
and free stream temperature 305 K, while both vertical walls of cavity are
isothermal at temperature of 296 K. The top wall is adiabatic and all walls are
opaque for radiation heat transfer. For collimated case, a small

been created on the left wall and a collimated irradiation of value 1000 W/m2
at an angle 45 is applied on this semitransparent window. The results reveal
that the diffuse radiation has little effect on the dynamics of two rolls

two rolls significantly and also the heat transfer characteristics. This
further changes with the optical thickness of the fluid. The left vortex is
bigger in size than the right vortex for collimated beam in transparent fluid,

Earth system sciences. However, the diversity of resilience concepts and a
certain (sometimes intended) openness of proposed definitions can lead to
misunderstandings and may impede their application to complex systems
modelling. We propose a guideline that aims to ease communication as well as to
support systematic development of research questions and models in the context
of resilience. It can be applied independently of the modelling framework or
underlying theory of choice. At the heart of this guideline is a checklist
consisting of four questions to be answered: (i) Resilience of what? (ii)
Resilience regarding what? (iii) Resilience against what? (iv) Resilience how?
We refer to the answers to these resilience questions as the ""system"", the
""sustainant"", the ""adverse influence"", and the ""response options"". The term
'sustainant' is a neologism describing the feature of the system (state,
structure, function, pathway, ...) that should be maintained (or restored
quickly enough) in order to call the system resilient.
  The use of this proposed guideline in the field of Earth system resilience is
demonstrated for the application example of a potential climate tipping
element: the Amazon rainforest. The example illustrates the diversity of
possible answers to the checklist's questions as well as their benefits in
structuring the modelling process. The guideline supports the modeller in
communicating precisely what is actually meant by 'resilience' in a specific

the resilience concept.

by a magnetic flux running along a higher dimensional cosmic string in the
presence of a flat boundary orthogonal to the string. In our analysis we assume
that the quantum field obeys Dirichlet or Neunmann conditions on the flat
boundary. In order to develop this analysis we calculate the corresponding
Wightman function. As consequence of the boundary, the Wightamn function is
expressed in term of two contributions: The first one corresponds to the
boundary-free cosmic string Wightman function, while the second one is induced
by the boundary. The boundary-induced contributions have opposite signs for
Dirichlet and Newman scalars. Because the analysis of vacuum current and
polarization effects in the boundary-free cosmic string spacetime have been
developed in the literature, here we are mainly interested in the calculations
of the effects induced by the boundary. Regarding to the induced current, we
show that, depending on the condition adopted, the boundary-induced azimuthal
current can cancel or intensifies the total induced azimuthal current on the
boundary; moreover, the boundary-induced azimuthal current is a periodic odd
function of the magnetic flux. As to the vacuum expectation values of the field
squared and the energy-momentum tensor, the boundary-induced contributions are
even functions of magnetic flux. In particular, we consider some special cases
of the boundary-induced part of the energy density and evaluate the normal
vacuum force on the boundary.

validated through simulation. By using focused illumination of selected parts

warning a human audience via their pattern of motions or behavior. And
furthermore that this approach has unique advantages such as flexibility and
mobility over other forms of user interface.
  In this paper, we present a user study to understand how human participants
perceived and interpreted swarm behaviors of micro-drone Crazyflie quadcopters
flying three different flight formations to bridge the psychological gap
between front-end technologies (drones) and the human observers' emotional
perceptions. We ask the question whether a human observer would in fact
consider a swarm of drones in their immediate vicinity to be nonthreatening
enough to be a vehicle for communication, and whether a human would intuit some
communication from the swarm behavior, despite the lack of verbal or written
language.
  Our results show that there is statistically significant support for the
thesis that a human participant is open to interpreting the motion of drones as
having intent and to potentially interpret their motion as communication. This
supports the potential use of drone swarms as a communication resource,
emergency guidance situations, policing of public events, tour guidance, etc.

Multi-column architecture is widely adopted to overcome these challenges,

Further performance improvements are thus restricted. In this paper, we propose
a novel crowd counting framework called Pyramid Scale Network (PSNet) to

three Pyramid Scale Modules (PSM) to efficiently capture multi-scale features,
which integrate a message passing mechanism and an attention mechanism into
multi-column architecture. Moreover, for feature similarity, a novel loss
function named Multi-column variance loss is introduced to make the features

developing countries as an effective solution for controlling vehicular
pollution, both sound and air. As carpooling decreases the number of vehicles
used by commuters, it results in multiple benefits like mitigation of traffic
and congestion on the roads, reduced demand for parking facilities, lesser
energy or fuel consumption and most importantly, reduction in carbon emission,
thus improving the quality of life in cities. This work presents a hybrid GA-A*
algorithm to obtain optimal routes for the carpooling problem in the domain of
multi-objective optimization having multiple conflicting objectives. Though
Genetic algorithm provides optimal solutions, A* algorithm because of its
efficiency in providing the shortest route between any two points based on
heuristics, enhances the optimal routes obtained using Genetic algorithm. The
refined routes, obtained using the GA-A* algorithm, are further subjected to
dominance test to obtain non-dominating solutions based on Pareto-Optimality.
The routes obtained maximize the profit of the service provider by minimizing
the travel and detour distance as well as pick-up/drop costs while maximizing
the utilization of the car. The proposed algorithm has been implemented over
the Salt Lake area of Kolkata. Route distance and detour distance for the
optimal routes obtained using the proposed algorithm are consistently lesser
for the same number of passengers when compared with the corresponding data
obtained using the existing algorithm. Various statistical analyses like
boxplots have also confirmed that the proposed algorithm regularly performed
better than the existing algorithm using only Genetic Algorithm.

how to determine a reasonable exit based on numerous factors in a changing

simulation based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), referred to as the

facilitate state-to-action mapping. The DNN framework applies Rainbow Deep
Q-Network (DQN), a DRL algorithm that integrates several advanced DQN methods,
to improve data utilization and algorithm stability, and further divides the
action space into eight isometric directions for possible pedestrian choices.
We compare MultiExit-DRL with two conventional multi-exit evacuation simulation
models in three separate scenarios: 1) varying pedestrian distribution ratios,
2) varying exit width ratios, and 3) varying open schedules for an exit. The
results show that MultiExit-DRL presents great learning efficiency while
reducing the total number of evacuation frames in all designed experiments. In
addition, the integration of DRL allows pedestrians to explore other potential
exits and helps determine optimal directions, leading to the high efficiency of
exit utilization.

to temporal information processing capability, low power consumption, and high
biological plausibility. However, the formulation of efficient and
high-performance learning algorithms for SNNs is still challenging. Most
existing learning methods learn weights only, and require manual tuning of the
membrane-related parameters that determine the dynamics of a single spiking
neuron. These parameters are typically chosen to be the same for all neurons,
which limits the diversity of neurons and thus the expressiveness of the
resulting SNNs. In this paper, we take inspiration from the observation that
membrane-related parameters are different across brain regions, and propose a
training algorithm that is capable of learning not only the synaptic weights
but also the membrane time constants of SNNs. We show that incorporating
learnable membrane time constants can make the network less sensitive to
initial values and can speed up learning. In addition, we reevaluate the
pooling methods in SNNs and find that max-pooling will not lead to significant
information loss and have the advantage of low computation cost and binary
compatibility. We evaluate the proposed method for image classification tasks

invaluable for clinical decision-making. One promising new approach is to
integrate image-based risk models based on deep neural networks. However, one
must take care when using such models, as selection of training data influences
the patterns the network will learn to identify. With this in mind, we trained
networks using three different criteria to select the positive training data
(i.e. images from patients that will develop cancer): an inherent risk model
trained on images with no visible signs of cancer, a cancer signs model trained
on images containing cancer or early signs of cancer, and a conflated model
trained on all images from patients with a cancer diagnosis. We find that these
three models learn distinctive features that focus on different patterns, which
translates to contrasts in performance. Short-term risk is best estimated by
the cancer signs model, whilst long-term risk is best estimated by the inherent
risk model. Carelessly training with all images conflates inherent risk with
early cancer signs, and yields sub-optimal estimates in both regimes. As a
consequence, conflated models may lead physicians to recommend preventative
action when early cancer signs are already visible.

the high dimensionality of the lattice and the lack of modeling of agent
vehicle behaviors. We propose to apply the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as a
speed feedback policy to address both of these limitations. IDM both enables
the responsive behavior of the agents, and uniquely determines the acceleration
and speed profile of the ego vehicle on a given path. Therefore, only a spatial
lattice is needed, while discretization of higher order dimensions is no longer
required. Additionally, we propose a directed-graph map representation to
support the implementation and execution of lattice planners. The map can
reflect local geometric structure, embed the traffic rules adhering to the
road, and is efficient to construct and update. We show that FELP is more
efficient compared to other existing lattice planners through runtime
complexity analysis, and we propose two variants of FELP to further reduce the
complexity to polynomial time. We demonstrate the improvement by comparing FELP
with an existing spatiotemporal lattice planner using simulations of a merging
scenario and continuous highway traffic. We also study the performance of FELP
under different traffic densities.

a format for the requirements and a method to ensure that the crucial

creating a control problem dependency graph and verifying whether it is

arrivals and exponential service times, we present a policy that is maximally
stable while using a positive (but arbitrarily small) message rate, and
$\log_2(n)$ bits of memory. Second, we show that within a certain broad class
of policies, a dispatching policy that exchanges $o\big(n^2\big)$ messages per
unit of time, and with $o(\log(n))$ bits of memory, cannot be maximally stable.
Thus, as long as the message rate is not too excessive, a logarithmic memory is
necessary and sufficient for maximal stability.

measurements associates with a system. So far, properties that make such an
interpretation possible rely on the assumption of ideal projective
measurements. Here we show that the same properties hold even when considering
generalized measurements, and therefore such an interpretation stands
completely general. Thus, observational entropy is a well-defined quantifier to
test how influential a given series of measurements is in information
extraction. Our generalized measurement framework allows us to explore how the
measurement probe and schemes influence information extraction, tasks
impossible within the projective measurement framework. We provide theoretical
lower bounds to the probe dimension and show that a qubit probe can perfectly
extract information from any multi-dimensional quantum system. Furthermore, we
compare the repeated measurement scheme, in which a pointer repeatedly measures
the system of interest, to the repeated contact scheme, in which the pointer
repeatedly stores information of the measured observable and is measured only
at the end of the protocol. Here, we find that in most cases the repeated
contact scheme has a higher observational entropy implying that the observer
can extract the most amount of quantum information using this scheme. Finally,
we discuss observational entropy as a tool for quantum state inference. Further
developed, this could find wide applications in quantum information processing
and help determine the best read-out procedures from quantum memories.

agent (PCA) models for HIV prevention have been used successfully in many
populations, but there have been notable failures. In recent years, network
interventionists have suggested that these failures could be attributed to PCA
selection procedures. The change agents themselves who are selected to do the

concern, we tested a new PCA intervention for YEH, with three arms: (1) an arm
using an artificial intelligence (AI) planning algorithm to select PCA, (2) a
popularity arm--the standard PCA approach--operationalized as highest degree
centrality (DC), and (3) an observation only comparison group (OBS). PCA models
that promote HIV testing, HIV knowledge, and condom use are efficacious for
YEH. Both the AI and DC arms showed improvements over time. AI-based PCA
selection led to better outcomes and increased the speed of intervention
effects. Specifically, the changes in behavior observed in the AI arm occurred
by 1 month, but not until 3 months in the DC arm. Given the transient nature of
YEH and the high risk for HIV infection, more rapid intervention effects are
desirable.

  multiscale mechanical analysis through probabilistic machine learning","30 pages, 25 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.CE cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Concurrent multiscale finite element analysis (FE2) is a powerful approach
for high-fidelity modeling of materials for which a suitable macroscopic
constitutive model is not available. However, the extreme computational effort
associated with computing a nested micromodel at every macroscopic integration
point makes FE2 prohibitive for most practical applications. Constructing
surrogate models able to efficiently compute the microscopic constitutive
response is therefore a promising approach in enabling concurrent multiscale
modeling. This work presents a reduction framework for adaptively constructing
surrogate models based on statistical learning. The nested micromodels are
replaced by a machine learning surrogate model based on Gaussian Processes
(GP). The need for offline data collection is bypassed by training the GP
models online based on data coming from a small set of fully-solved anchor
micromodels that undergo the same strain history as their associated macro
integration points. The Bayesian formalism inherent to GP models provides a
natural tool for uncertainty estimation through which new observations or
inclusion of new anchors are triggered. The surrogate constitutive manifold is
constructed with as few micromechanical evaluations as possible by enhancing
the GP models with gradient information and the solution scheme is made robust
through a greedy data selection approach embedded within the conventional
finite element solution loop for nonlinear analysis. The sensitivity to model
parameters is studied with a tapered bar example with plasticity, while the
applicability of the model to more complex cases is demonstrated with the
elastoplastic analysis of a plate with multiple cutouts and a crack growth
example for mixed-mode bending. Significant efficiency gains are obtained
without resorting to offline training.

discussing the value of performing secondary studies in an academic context.
Goal: The main goal of this study is to provide an overview on the use of
secondary studies in an academic context. Method: Two empirical research
methods were used. Initially, we conducted an SM to identify the available and
relevant studies on the use of secondary studies as a research methodology for
conducting SE research projects. Secondly, a survey was performed with 64 SE
researchers to identify their perception related to the value of performing
secondary studies to support their research projects. Results: Our results show
benefits of using secondary studies in the academic context, such as, providing
an overview of the literature as well as identifying relevant research
literature on a research area enabling to find reasons to explain why a
research project should be approved for a grant and/or supporting decisions
made in a research project. Difficulties faced by SE graduate students with
secondary studies are that they tend to be conducted by a team and it demands
more effort than a traditional review. Conclusions: Secondary studies are
valuable to graduate students. They should consider conducting a secondary
study for their research project due to the benefits and contributions provided
to develop the overall project. However, the advice of an experienced
supervisor is essential to avoid bias. In addition, the acquisition of skills
can increase student's motivation to pursue their research projects and prepare

tunable parameters. As the structure of this model is highly constrained,
predictive relationships between constants may be obtained. In Chapters 4-6,
the masses of the tau, the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, and a Higgs-like scalar boson
are calculated as functions of $\alpha$, $m_e$, and $m_\mu$. They are shown to
be $1.776867409(43)$ GeV/$c^2$, $80.3785(22)$ GeV/$c^2$, $91.1876(35)$

$G_N=6.67430(230)\times 10^{-11}~\mathrm{m}^3\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-2}$,

suggests the existence of a unifying relationship between lepton generations,

GeV/c 16O-AgBr collisions has been performed in the pseudorapidity phase space.
Multifractal moments Gq as the function of pseudorapidity bin size for
different order of the moments, q have been calculated. The power-law behaviour
has been observed in the considered data sets. The variation of multifractal
dimensions, Dq and multifractal spectral function, f($\alpha$q) with order of
the moments, q have been studied thoroughly. Dq is found to decrease with
increasing order of the moments, q indicating thereby a self-similar behaviour
in the multiparticle production in the considered collisions. We have also
found a concave downward curve of multifractal spectral function with maxima
q=0.
