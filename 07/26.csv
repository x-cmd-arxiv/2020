distributed computing in edge networks at scale. A key challenge in providing
this capability is the requirement for judicious management of the
heterogeneous communication and computation resources that exist at the edge to
meet processing needs. In this paper, we develop an optimization methodology
that considers the network topology jointly with device and network resource
allocation to minimize total D2D overhead, which we quantify in terms of time
and energy required for task processing. Variables in our model include task
assignment, CPU allocation, subchannel selection, and beamforming design for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless devices. We propose two methods
to solve the resulting non-convex mixed integer program: semi-exhaustive search
optimization, which represents a ""best-effort"" at obtaining the optimal
solution, and efficient alternate optimization, which is more computationally
efficient. As a component of these two methods, we develop a novel coordinated
beamforming algorithm which we show obtains the optimal beamformer for a common
receiver characteristic. Through numerical experiments, we find that our
methodology yields substantial improvements in network overhead compared with
local computation and partially optimized methods, which validates our joint
optimization approach. Further, we find that the efficient alternate
optimization scales well with the number of nodes, and thus can be a practical
solution for D2D computing in large networks.

atmospheric loss rates by comparing grids of 1D models to the data. We also
performed coupled interior structure and atmospheric loss calculations, which
suggest that the bulk atmospheres (winds) of the planets would be at most
modestly enhanced (depleted) in helium relative to their primordial

a novel Bayesian framework for case-cohort Cox regression that avoids the

al. [MNRAS 480, L58 (2018)] and Liu and Lai [ApJ 863, 68 (2018)], yet allowing
the spins to have random initial orientations. We confirm the existence of a
dynamical attractor that drives the spin-orbit angle at the end of the LK
evolution to a value given by the initial angle between the spin and the outer
orbital angular momentum (instead of to a specific value of the effective
spin). Secondly, we follow the (inner) binary's evolution further to the merger
to study the final spin-spin alignment. We generalize the effective potential
theory to include orbital eccentricity, which allows us to efficiently evolve
the system in the early inspiral stages. We further find that the spin-spin and
spin-orbit alignments are correlated and the correlation is determined by the
initial spin-orbit angle. For systems with the spin vectors initially in the
orbital plane, the final spins strongly disfavor an aligned configuration and
could thus lead to a greater value of the GW recoil than a uniform spin-spin
alignment would predict. Lastly, we study the maximum eccentricity excitation
that can be achieved during the LK process, including the effects of
gravitational-wave radiation. We find that when the tertiary mass is a
super-massive BH and the inner binary is massive, then even with the maximum LK
excitation, the residual eccentricity is typically less than 0.1 when the
binary's orbital frequency reaches 10 Hz, and a decihertz detector would be
necessary to follow such a system's orbital evolution.

problem of non-rigid groupwise point set registration. Compared to previous
non-learning approaches, our proposed method gains competitive advantages by
leveraging the power of deep neural networks to effectively and efficiently
learn to align a large number of highly deformed 3D shapes with superior
performance. Unlike most learning-based methods that use an explicit feature
encoding network to extract the per-shape features and their correlations, our
model leverages a model-free learnable latent descriptor to characterize the
group relationship. More specifically, for a given group we first define an
optimizable Group Latent Descriptor (GLD) to characterize the gruopwise
relationship among a group of point sets. Each GLD is randomly initialized from
a Gaussian distribution and then concatenated with the coordinates of each
point of the associated point sets in the group. A neural network-based decoder
is further constructed to predict the coherent drifts as the desired
transformation from input groups of shapes to aligned groups of shapes. During
the optimization process, GP-Aligner jointly updates all GLDs and weight
parameters of the decoder network towards the minimization of an unsupervised
groupwise alignment loss. After optimization, for each group our model
coherently drives each point set towards a middle, common position (shape)
without specifying one as the target. GP-Aligner does not require large-scale
training data for network training and it can directly align groups of point
sets in a one-stage optimization process. GP-Aligner shows both accuracy and
computational efficiency improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art
methods for groupwise point set registration. Moreover, GP-Aligner is shown
great efficiency in aligning a large number of groups of real-world 3D shapes.

different and occurs by tunneling in response to solvent fluctuations. Here, we
develop the theory of coupled ion-electron transfer, in which ions and solvent
molecules fluctuate cooperatively to facilitate electron transfer. We derive a
general formula of the reaction rate that depends on the overpotential, solvent
properties, the electronic structure of the electron donor/acceptor, and the
excess chemical potential of ions in the transition state. For Faradaic
reactions, the theory predicts curved Tafel plots with a
concentration-dependent reaction-limited current. For moderate overpotentials,
our formula reduces to the Butler-Volmer equation and explains its relevance,
not only in the well-known limit of large electron-transfer (solvent

electrode host material couples with ion insertion. In the case of lithium iron

the square of the relativistic intervals. Minkowski spacetime is described as a
four dimensional `vector space' that can be decomposed everywhere into a
spacelike hyperplane - which obeys the Euclidean axioms in [Tarski and Givant,

calculated according to Pythagoras' theorem. We conclude with a Representation

applications such as transistors, thermoelectrics, and laser gain media. Yet
measuring the thermal conductivity tensor of such materials remains a
challenge, particularly for materials lacking in-plane symmetry (i.e.,
transversely anisotropic materials). This paper demonstrates thermal
conductivity tensor measurements for transversely anisotropic materials, by
extending beam-offset frequency-domain thermoreflectance (BO-FDTR) methods
which had previously been limited to transversely isotropic materials.
Extensive sensitivity analysis is used to determine an appropriate range of
heating frequencies and beam offsets to extract various tensor elements. The
new technique is demonstrated on a model transversely anisotropic material,
x-cut quartz (<110> {\alpha}-SiO2), by combining beam offset measurements from
different sample orientations to reconstruct the full in-plane thermal
conductivity tensor. The technique is also validated by measurements on two
transversely isotropic materials, sapphire and highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite (HOPG). The anisotropic measurements demonstrated very good
self-consistency in correctly identifying isotropic directions when present,
with residual anisotropy errors below 4% for sapphire and 2% for HOPG and
quartz. Finally, a computational case study (simulated experiment) shows how
the arbitrary in-plane thermal conductivity tensor of a fictitious material
with high in-plane anisotropy can in principle be obtained from only a single
sample orientation, rather than multiple orientations like the experiments on
x-cut quartz.

of evaluating and modifying devices in the physical device space, candidate
device layouts are defined in a constraint-free latent space and mathematically
transformed to the physical device space, which robustly imposes geometric
constraints. Modifications to the physical devices, specified by inverse design
algorithms, are made to their latent space representations using
backpropagation. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we apply
reparameterization to enforce strict minimum feature size constraints in local
and global topology optimizers for metagratings. We anticipate that concepts in
reparameterization will provide a general and meaningful platform to
incorporate physics and physical constraints in any gradient-based optimizer,
including machine learning-enabled global optimizers.

(spontaneous) regime, in which the correlated photon pairs are produced.
Spontaneous PDC (SPDC) plays a very important role for quantum optics as a
variety of quantum states is produced via SPDC. In the high-gain case PDC leads
to generation of bright states having up to hundreds mW mean power. With such
states almost any nonlinear optical interaction or light-matter interaction
becomes more efficient. Even being macroscopically bright, the produced states
maintain nonclassical properties as, for example, the fluctuations of electric
field quadratures are squeezed below the shot-noise level. The high-gain PDC
could be used not only in the same applications as SPDC, it also can provide
new ones. Apart from that the high-gain PDC has many remarkable spectral and
statistical properties, which are in the focus of this work. The description
starts from the PDC generation in normal and anomalous group velocity
dispersion ranges. The spectrum and mode content of high-gain PDC is considered
as well as their change with the parametric gain are demonstrated. Then, there
are the interference effects emerging from the PDC correlations presented,
namely the macroscopic analogue of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. In
addition, it is shown how spatial and temporal walk-off matching could be used
for the generation of giant narrowband twin beams. Finally, the statistical
properties of high-gain PDC are reviewed as well as their use for multiphoton
effects is demonstrated. Photon-number fluctuations of PDC are studied via
normalized correlation functions and probability distributions. These
fluctuations enhance the generation efficiency for multiphoton effects by
orders of magnitude and lead to tremendously fluctuating light described by
heavy-tailed photon-number probability distributions.

that, in general, they do not vanish (in the thermodynamic limit) and the
quantum uncertainty around the macroscopic current density disappears
exponentially fast with an exponential rate proportional to the squared
deviation of the current from its macroscopic value and the inverse current
fluctuation, with respect to growing space (volume) scales.

cross-lingual phone labels for DNN-BNF model training. Finally, BNFs are
extracted as the subword-discriminative feature representation. A second aim of
this work is to investigate the robustness of our approach's effectiveness to
different amounts of training data. The results on Libri-light and the
ZeroSpeech 2017 databases show that APC is effective in front-end feature
pretraining. Our whole system outperforms the state of the art on both
databases. Cross-lingual phone labels for English data by a Dutch ASR
outperform those by a Mandarin ASR, possibly linked to the larger similarity of
Dutch compared to Mandarin with English. Our system is less sensitive to
training data amount when the training data is over 50 hours. APC pretraining
leads to a reduction of needed training material from over 5,000 hours to
around 200 hours with little performance degradation.

Therefore, we explore using outputs of multi-scale random convolutions as new

improves the performance on domain generalization benchmarks and is scalable to
ImageNet. In particular, in the challenging scenario of generalizing to the

learn temporal proximity of the nodes. We find that real dynamic attributed
graphs exhibit complex co-evolution of node attributes and graph structure.
Learning node embeddings for forecasting change of node attributes and birth

a novel framework called CoEvoGNN for modeling dynamic attributed graph
sequence. It preserves the impact of earlier graphs on the current graph by
embedding generation through the sequence. It has a temporal self-attention
mechanism to model long-range dependencies in the evolution. Moreover, CoEvoGNN
optimizes model parameters jointly on two dynamic tasks, attribute inference
and link prediction over time. So the model can capture the co-evolutionary
patterns of attribute change and link formation. This framework can adapt to
any graph neural algorithms so we implemented and investigated three methods
based on it: CoEvoGCN, CoEvoGAT, and CoEvoSAGE. Experiments demonstrate the
framework (and its methods) outperform strong baselines on predicting an entire

  To address the bottleneck of preprocessing, we introduce two optimizations

efficiently manages memory and threading for high throughput execution. We
implement these optimizations in a novel system, Smol, and evaluate Smol on

show how to learn representations from gigapixel size images end-to-end. HATNet
extends the bag-of-words approach and uses self-attention to encode global

tissue structures without any explicit supervision. It outperforms the previous
best network Y-Net, which uses supervision in the form of tissue-level
segmentation masks, by 8%. Importantly, our analysis reveals that HATNet learns

$U(1)_{X}$ gauge group and additional particles. In particular, we have
extended the particle content by three right handed neutrinos, two singlet
scalars and two vector like leptons. Charged assignments under different gauge
groups are such that the model is gauge anomaly free and the anomaly
contributions cancel among generations. Once the symmetry gets broken then
three physical Higgses are produced, one axion like particle (ALP), which also
acts as the keV scale FIMP dark matter, is produced and the remaining component
is absorbed by the extra gauge boson. Firstly, we have successfully generated
neutrino mass by the type-I seesaw mechanism for normal hierarchy with the
$3\sigma$ bound on the oscillation parameters. The ALP in the present model can
explain the Xenon-1T electron recoil signal at keV scale through its coupling
with the electron. We also have vector like leptons which help in producing the
dark matter from their decay by the freeze in mechanism. Electron and tauon get
mass from dimensional-5 operators at Planck scale and if we consider the vevs
$v_{1,2} \simeq 10^{12}$ GeV then we can obtain the correct value of the
electron mass but not the tauon mass. Vector like leptons help in getting the
correct value of the tauon mass through another higher dimensional operator
which also has a role in DM production by the $2 \rightarrow 2$ process, giving
the correct ballpark value of relic density for suitable reheat temperature of
the Universe. We have shown that the ALP production by the higher dimensional
operator can explain the electron, tauon mass and Xenon-1T signal
simultaneously whereas the decay production can not explain all of them
together.

planets, into highly eccentric orbits where the material gets disrupted by
tidal forces and then accreted onto the star. This can occur through a
planet-planet scattering process triggered by the stellar mass loss during the
post main-sequence evolution of planetary systems. So far, studies of the
$N$-body dynamics of this process have used artificial planetary system
architectures built ad hoc. In this work, we attempt to go a step further and
study the dynamical instability provided by more restrictive systems, that, at
the same time allow us an exploration of a wider parameter space: the hundreds
of multiple planetary systems found around main-sequence (MS) stars. We find
that most of our simulated systems remain stable during the MS, Red and
Asymptotic Giant Branch and for several Gyr into the WD phases of the host
star. Overall, only $\approx$ 2.3$\%$ of the simulated systems lose a planet on
the WD as a result of dynamical instability. If the instabilities take place
during the WD phase most of them result in planet ejections with just 5
planetary configurations ending as a collision of a planet with the WD. Finally
3.2$\%$ of the simulated systems experience some form of orbital scattering or
orbit crossing that could contribute to the pollution at a sustained rate if
planetesimals are present in the same system.

achieving strong performance in all domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness

supplemented with partition functions, state lifetimes, cooling functions,
Land\'e g-factors, temperature-dependent cross sections, opacities, pressure
broadening parameters, $k$-coefficients and dipoles. This paper presents the
latest release of the database which has been expanded to consider 80 molecules
and 190 isotopologues totaling over 700 billion transitions. While the
spectroscopic data is concentrated at infrared and visible wavelengths,
ultraviolet transitions are being increasingly considered in response to
requests from observers. The core of the database comes from the ExoMol project
which primarily uses theoretical methods, albeit usually fine-tuned to
reproduce laboratory spectra, to generate very extensive line lists for studies
of hot bodies. The data has recently been supplemented by line lists deriving
from direct laboratory observations, albeit usually with the use of ab initio
transition intensities. A major push in the new release is towards accurate
characterisation of transition frequencies for use in high resolution studies
of exoplanets and other bodies.

  Infectious Diseases such as COVID-19",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is unfolding as a major
international crisis whose influence extends to every aspect of our daily
lives. Effective testing allows infected individuals to be quarantined, thus
reducing the spread of COVID-19, saving countless lives, and helping to restart
the economy safely and securely. Developing a good testing strategy can be
greatly aided by contact tracing that provides health care providers
information about the whereabouts of infected patients in order to determine
whom to test. Countries that have been more successful in corralling the virus
typically use a ``test, treat, trace, test'' strategy that begins with testing
individuals with symptoms, traces contacts of positively tested individuals via
a combinations of patient memory, apps, WiFi, GPS, etc., followed by testing
their contacts, and repeating this procedure. The problem is that such
strategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources. This is
especially the case with COVID-19, where symptoms may show up several days
after the infection (or not at all, there is evidence to suggest that many
COVID-19 carriers are asymptotic, but may spread the virus). Such greedy
strategies, miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and flare
up in the future.
  In this paper, we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential
learning-based resource allocation problem with constraints, where the input to
the problem is provided by a time-varying social contact graph obtained through
various contact tracing tools. We then develop efficient learning strategies
that minimize the number of infected individuals. These strategies are based on
policy iteration and look-ahead rules. We investigate fundamental performance
bounds, and ensure that our solution is robust to errors in the input graph as
well as in the tests themselves.

hybrid architecture, namely CNN-TT, is capable of maintaining a good quality
performance with a reduced model parameter size. CNN-TT is composed of several
convolutional layers at the bottom for feature extraction to improve speech
quality and a tensor-train (TT) output layer on the top to reduce model
parameters. We first derive a new upper bound on the generalization power of
the convolutional neural network (CNN) based vector-to-vector regression
models. Then, we provide experimental evidence on the Edinburgh noisy speech
corpus to demonstrate that, in single-channel speech enhancement, CNN
outperforms DNN at the expense of a small increment of model sizes. Besides,
CNN-TT slightly outperforms the CNN counterpart by utilizing only 32\% of the
CNN model parameters. Besides, further performance improvement can be attained
if the number of CNN-TT parameters is increased to 44\% of the CNN model size.
Finally, our experiments of multi-channel speech enhancement on a simulated
noisy WSJ0 corpus demonstrate that our proposed hybrid CNN-TT architecture
achieves better results than both DNN and CNN models in terms of
better-enhanced speech qualities and smaller parameter sizes.

text processing scenarios on a particular text domain (Twitter) and application
(sentiment classification). Skip gram-based word embeddings are developed to
include Twitter colloquial words, emojis, and hashtag keywords that are often
removed for being unavailable in conventional literature corpora. Our
experiments reveal negative effects on sentiment classification of two common
text processing steps: 1) stop word removal and 2) averaging of word vectors to
represent individual tweets. New effective steps for 1) including non-ASCII
emoji characters, 2) measuring word importance from word embedding, 3)
aggregating word vectors into a tweet embedding, and 4) developing linearly
separable feature space have been proposed to optimize the sentiment
classification pipeline. The best combination of text processing steps yields
the highest average area under the curve (AUC) of 88.4 (+/-0.4) in classifying
14,640 tweets with three sentiment labels. Word selection from context-driven
word embedding reveals that only the ten most important words in Tweets
cumulatively yield over 98% of the maximum accuracy. Results demonstrate a
means for data-driven selection of important words in tweet classification as
opposed to using pre-built word dictionaries. The proposed tweet embedding is
robust to and alleviates the need for several text processing steps.

the laws of thermodynamics to length scales of nanometers. Here we review this
""nanothermodynamics,"" and stress how it also applies to large systems that
subdivide into a heterogeneous distribution of internal subsystems that we call
""regions."" We emphasize that the true thermal equilibrium of most systems often
requires that these regions are in the fully-open generalized ensemble, with a
distribution of region sizes that is not externally constrained, which we call
the ""nanocanonical"" ensemble. We focus on how nanothermodynamics impacts the
statistical mechanics of specific models. One example is an ideal gas of
indistinguishable atoms in a large volume that subdivides into an ensemble of
small regions of variable volume, with separate regions containing atoms that
are distinguishable from those in other regions. Combining such subdivided
regions yields the correct entropy of mixing, avoiding Gibbs paradox without
resorting to macroscopic quantum symmetry for semi-classical particles. Other
models are based on Ising-like spins (binary degrees of freedom), which are
solved analytically in one-dimension, making them suitable examples for
introductory courses in statistical physics. A key result is to quantify the
net increase in entropy when large systems subdivide into small regions of
variable size. Another result is to show similarity in the equilibrium
properties of a two-state model in the nanocanonical ensemble and a three-state
model in the canonical ensemble. Thus, emergent phenomena may alter the thermal
behavior of microscopic models, and the correct ensemble is necessary for
accurate predictions.

Current dominant algorithms train a well-generalized model initialization which

generalization capability of the initialization, which is measured by the
performance of the adapted model on the query set of each task. Unfortunately,
this generalization measure, evidenced by empirical results, pushes the
initialization to overfit the meta-training tasks, which significantly impairs
the generalization and adaptation to novel tasks. To address this issue, we
actively augment a meta-training task with ""more data"" when evaluating the
generalization. Concretely, we propose two task augmentation methods, including
MetaMix and Channel Shuffle. MetaMix linearly combines features and labels of
samples from both the support and query sets. For each class of samples,
Channel Shuffle randomly replaces a subset of their channels with the

augmentation improves the generalization of meta-learning. Moreover, both

attention because this phase displays the highest observed critical
temperature. We focus on the evaluation of the critical temperature, isotope
coefficient, and their pressure dependence of this phase (Fm3m phase of the
LaH10 compound). By combining the method of two coupling constants, describing
the interaction with the optical and acoustic modes, and two characteristic
frequencies with first-principle calculations we are able to analyze the role
of the light hydrogen in the amplitude of the critical temperature in this
unique compound. Specifically, the critical temperature of 254 K and the
isotope coefficient of 0.45 are evaluated at high pressure, and the results are
in good agreement with the experimental data. The peculiar decrease in the
value of the critical temperature upon further increase in pressure is
explained by the presence of a flat region on the Fermi surface and the
appearance of a two-gap structure, which should be experimentally observable by
tunneling spectroscopy.

positive and negative predictive value of screening tests undertaken
sequentially. Where a is the sensitivity, b is the specificity, $\phi$ is the
pre-test probability, the combined positive predictive value, $\rho(\phi)$, of
$n$ serial positive tests, is described by:
  $\rho(\phi) =
\frac{\phi\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{n}a_n}{\phi\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{n}a_n+(1-\phi)\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-b_n)}$
  If the positive serial iteration is interrupted at term position $n_i-k$ by a
conflicting negative result, then the resulting negative predictive value is
given by:
  $\psi(\phi) =
\frac{[(1-\phi)b_{n-}]\displaystyle\prod_{i=b_{1+}}^{b_{(n-1)+}}(1-b_{n+})}{[\phi(1-a_{n-})]\displaystyle\prod_{i=a_{1+}}^{a_{(n-1)+}}a_{n+}+[(1-\phi)b_{n-}]\displaystyle\prod_{i=b_{1+}}^{b_{(n-1)+}}(1-b_{n+})}$
  Finally, if the negative serial iteration is interrupted at term position
$n_i-k$ by a conflicting positive result, then the resulting positive
predictive value is given by: $\lambda(\phi)= \frac{\phi
a_{n+}\displaystyle\prod_{i=a_{1-}}^{a_{(n-1)-}}(1-a_{n-})}{\phi
a_{n+}\displaystyle\prod_{i=a_{1-}}^{a_{(n-1)-}}(1-a_{n-})+[(1-\phi)(1-b_{n+})]\displaystyle\prod_{i=b_{1-}}^{b_{(n-1)-}}b_{n-}}$
  The aforementioned equations provide a measure of the predictive value in
different possible scenarios in which serial testing is undertaken. Their
clinical utility is best observed in conditions with low pre-test probability
where single tests are insufficient to achieve clinically significant
predictive values and likewise, in clinical scenarios with a high pre-test
probability where confirmation of disease status is critical.

that your virtual hands are your real hands. Manipulating the representation of
the body, namely the avatar, is a potentially powerful tool for the design of
innovative interactive systems in VR. In this study, we investigated
interactive behavior in VR by using the methods of experimental psychology.
Objects with handles are known to potentiate the afforded action. Participants
tend to respond faster when the handle is on the same side as the responding
hand in bi-manual speed response tasks. In the first experiment, we
successfully replicated this affordance effect in a Virtual Reality (VR)
setting. In the second experiment, we showed that the affordance effect was
influenced by the avatar, which was manipulated by two different hand types: 1)
hand models with full finger tracking that are able to grasp objects, and 2)
capsule-shaped -- fingerless -- hand models that are not able to grasp objects.
We found that less than 5 minutes of adaptation to an avatar, significantly
altered the affordance perception. Counter intuitively, action planning was
significantly shorter with the hand model that is not able to grasp. Possibly,
fewer action possibilities provided an advantage in processing time. The
presence of a handle speeded up the initiation of the hand movement but slowed
down the action completion because of ongoing action planning. The results were
examined from a multidisciplinary perspective and the design implications for
VR applications were discussed.

is proposed for dense correspondence between two nearly isometric shapes. The
key idea is to use dual information, such as spatial and spectral, or local and
global features, in a complementary and effective way, and extract more
accurate information from current iteration to use for the next iteration. In
each DIR iteration, starting from current correspondence, a zoom-in process at
each point is used to select well matched anchor pairs by a local mapping
distortion criterion. These selected anchor pairs are then used to align
spectral features (or other appropriate global features) whose dimension
adaptively matches the capacity of the selected anchor pairs. Thanks to the
effective combination of complementary information in a data-adaptive way, DIR
is not only efficient but also robust to render accurate results within a few
iterations. By choosing appropriate dual features, DIR has the flexibility to
handle patch and partial matching as well. Extensive experiments on various
data sets demonstrate the superiority of DIR over other state-of-the-art
methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

imprecision noise and back-action noise can be arbitrarily suppressed by
manipulating the amplitudes of the input coherent fields, however, the force
noise power spectral density cannot be reduced below the level of thermal
fluctuations. Therefore, we consider a nonstationary protocol that involves
non-thermal dissipative state preparation followed by a finite time
measurement, which allows one to perform measurements with a signal-to-noise
much greater than the maximum possible in a stationary measurement scenario. We
analyse two different measurement schemes in the nonstationary transient
regime, a back-action evading measurement, which implies modifying the drive
asymmetry configuration upon arrival of the force, and a nonstationary
measurement that leaves the drive asymmetry configuration unchanged. Conditions
for optimal force noise sensitivity are determined, and the corresponding force

equidistribute its mass over the standard Euclidean basis $\{e_0,e_1,\ldots,

the same measure maximizes the expectation of
$\arccos^\alpha(\frac{x}{|x|}\cdot \frac{y}{|y|})$ for any exponent $\alpha >
1$. The kernel $\arccos^\alpha(\frac{x}{|x|}\cdot \frac{y}{|y|})$ represents
the objective of an infinite-dimensional quadratic program. We verify discrete
and continuous versions of this {milder} conjecture in a non-empty range
$\alpha > \alpha_{\Delta^d} \ge 1$, and establish uniqueness of the resulting
maximizer $\hat \mu$ up to rotation. We show $\hat \mu$ no longer maximizes
when $\alpha<\alpha_{\Delta^d}$. At the endpoint $\alpha=\alpha_{\Delta^d}$ of
this range, we show another maximizer $\mu$ must also exist which is not a
rotation of $\hat \mu$. For the continuous version of the conjecture, an
appendix provided by Bilyk et al in response to an earlier draft of this work
combines with the present improvements to yield $\alpha_{\Delta^d}<2$. The
original conjecture $\ald=1$ remains open (unless $d=1$).
  However, in the maximum possible range $\alpha>1$, we show $\hat \mu$ and its
rotations maximize the aforementioned expectation uniquely on a sufficiently
small ball in the $L^\infty$-Kantorovich-Rubinstein-Wasserstein metric
$d_\infty$ from optimal transportation; the same is true for any measure $\mu$

can lead to single bubble nucleation, offering a unique platform for studying
nanoscale bubble behavior, which is still poorly understood. Accordingly, we
investigate bubble nucleation and collapse inside solid-state nanopores filled
with electrolyte solutions and find that there exists a clear correlation
between homo/heterogeneous bubble nucleation and the pore diameter. As the pore
diameter is increased from 280 nm to 525 nm, the nucleation regime transitions
from predominantly periodic homogeneous nucleation to a non-periodic mixture of
homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation. A transition barrier between the
homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation regimes is defined by considering the
relative free-energy costs of cluster formation. A thermodynamic model
considering the transition barrier and contact-line pinning on curved surfaces
is constructed, which determines the possibility of heterogeneous nucleation.
It is shown that the experimental bubble generation behavior is closely
captured by our thermodynamic analysis, providing important information for
controlling the periodic homogeneous nucleation of bubbles in nanopores.

density correlation between separate points because the particles are
independent. But the joint spatial and temporal correlation is non-zero (and
easily calculable) because each individual particle moves in a straight line.
The same holds for particle flux density correlation. The equivalent 'quantum
kinetic theory' correlations are evaluated here via Feynman paths with their
direct access to geometry and topology. The calculation is exact, yielding
known special functions, but it is quite primitive physically. No heat bath,
and no multi-particle statistics are invoked (the gas is thus 'Boltzmann').
Formally it reduces to path analysis of Brownian motion, in fact, of Brownian
loops (suitably analytically continued). A check of the results is their
correct classical limit. Attention is paid to the all-time-integral of the flux
density correlation, with its topological significance. A particle's random
path, in the presence of a fixed hypothetical hoop of arbitrary shape,
accumulates a random linking number by repeatedly passing through it,
positively or negatively. The mean is zero and the mean square is infinite,
uninformatively. The interest lies in two separate arbitrary hoops: the linking
numbers are correlated, their average product grows linearly, and is calculated
from the flux density correlation. For a charged particle this would produce a
correlation the induced Ampere magnetic circulation around the hoops.

In addition, we find that our intermediate-to-high redshift cluster galaxies
follow parallel sequences with respect to the local specific angular
momentum-stellar mass relation, although displaying lower angular momentum

unfavorable carbonate complex formation becomes favorable by switching the
reaction from endothermic to exothermic in the presence of water. Further, we
find that small binding energy does not necessarily imply physisorption. It can
also give rise to chemisorption, where the loss in energy due to repulsive
Hartree and Madelung interactions is comparable to the energy gained through
the chemical bonding. Such a scenario is demonstrated for the CO$_2$ adsorption
on (010) and (101) facets. Though (001) remains the most reactive surface, if

influence of important parameters such as membership assignments, type of data
objects, and distance or similarity functions. The proposed method, called
Bounded Fuzzy Possibilistic Method (BFPM) addresses different issues that
previous clustering or classification methods have not sufficiently considered
in their membership assignments. In fuzzy methods, the object's memberships
should sum to 1. Hence, any data object may obtain full membership in at most
one cluster or class. Possibilistic methods relax this condition, but the
method can be satisfied with the results even if just an arbitrary object
obtains the membership from just one cluster, which prevents the objects'
movement analysis. Whereas, BFPM differs from previous fuzzy and possibilistic
approaches by removing these restrictions. Furthermore, BFPM provides the
flexible search space for objects' movement analysis. Data objects are also
considered as fundamental keys in learning methods, and knowing the exact type
of objects results in providing a suitable environment for learning algorithms.
The Thesis introduces a new type of object, called critical, as well as
categorizing data objects into two different categories: structural-based and
behavioural-based. Critical objects are considered as causes of
miss-classification and miss-assignment in learning procedures. The Thesis also
proposes new methodologies to study the behaviour of critical objects with the
aim of evaluating objects' movements (mutation) from one cluster or class to
another. The Thesis also introduces a new type of feature, called dominant,
that is considered as one of the causes of miss-classification and
miss-assignments. Then the Thesis proposes new sets of similarity functions,
called Weighted Feature Distance (WFD) and Prioritized Weighted Feature
Distance (PWFD).

prediction: (i) multimodality in both training data and predictions and (ii)
constant time inference regardless of number of agents. Existing trajectory
predictions are fundamentally limited by lack of diversity in training data,
which is difficult to acquire with sufficient coverage of possible modes. Our
first contribution is an automatic method to simulate diverse trajectories in
the top-view. It uses pre-existing datasets and maps as initialization, mines
existing trajectories to represent realistic driving behaviors and uses a
multi-agent vehicle dynamics simulator to generate diverse new trajectories
that cover various modes and are consistent with scene layout constraints. Our
second contribution is a novel method that generates diverse predictions while
accounting for scene semantics and multi-agent interactions, with constant-time
inference independent of the number of agents. We propose a convLSTM with novel
state pooling operations and losses to predict scene-consistent states of
multiple agents in a single forward pass, along with a CVAE for diversity. We
validate our proposed multi-agent trajectory prediction approach by training
and testing on the proposed simulated dataset and existing real datasets of
traffic scenes. In both cases, our approach outperforms SOTA methods by a large
margin, highlighting the benefits of both our diverse dataset simulation and
constant-time diverse trajectory prediction methods.

heterogeneous mobility and proliferation rate. The cell phenotypic state is
described by a continuous structuring variable and the evolution of the local
cell population density function (i.e. the cell phenotypic distribution at each
spatial position) is governed by a non-local advection-reaction-diffusion
equation. We report on the results of numerical simulations showing that, in
the case where the cell mobility is bounded, compactly supported travelling
fronts emerge. More mobile phenotypic variants occupy the front edge, whereas
more proliferative phenotypic variants are selected at the back of the front.
In order to explain such numerical results, we carry out formal asymptotic
analysis of the model equation using a Hamilton-Jacobi approach. In summary, we
show that the locally dominant phenotypic trait (i.e. the maximum point of the
local cell population density function along the phenotypic dimension)
satisfies a generalised Burgers' equation with source term, we construct
travelling-front solutions of such transport equation and characterise the
corresponding minimal speed. Moreover, we show that, when the cell mobility is
unbounded, front edge acceleration and formation of stretching fronts may
occur. We briefly discuss the implications of our results in the context of
glioma growth.

business and privacy concerns. Many data protection regulations, including the
EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer
Protection Act (CCPA), set out strict restrictions and obligations on the
collection and processing of personal data. Moreover, machine learning models
themselves can be used to derive personal information, as demonstrated by
recent membership and attribute inference attacks. Anonymized data, however, is
exempt from the obligations set out in these regulations. It is therefore
desirable to be able to create models that are anonymized, thus also exempting
them from those obligations, in addition to providing better protection against
attacks.
  Learning on anonymized data typically results in significant degradation in
accuracy. In this work, we propose a method that is able to achieve better
model accuracy by using the knowledge encoded within the trained model, and
guiding our anonymization process to minimize the impact on the model's
accuracy, a process we call accuracy-guided anonymization. We demonstrate that
by focusing on the model's accuracy rather than generic information loss
measures, our method outperforms state of the art k-anonymity methods in terms
of the achieved utility, in particular with high values of k and large numbers
of quasi-identifiers.
  We also demonstrate that our approach has a similar, and sometimes even
better ability to prevent membership inference attacks as approaches based on
differential privacy, while averting some of their drawbacks such as
complexity, performance overhead and model-specific implementations. This makes
model-guided anonymization a legitimate substitute for such methods and a
practical approach to creating privacy-preserving models.

techniques can learn intricate user behavior patterns, it relies on a vast

mechanism. XDBoost's components operate sequentially similar to boosting;
However, unlike conventional boosting, XDBoost does not sum the predictions

artificial features and enhances CTR prediction by retraining the model using
these features. Comprehensive experiments conducted to illustrate the
effectiveness of XDBoost on two datasets demonstrated its ability to outperform
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for CTR prediction.

across individual users and tasks and groundtruth data is difficult to obtain.
Thus, prior work has mostly focused on simpler target-search tasks or on
establishing general interest, where gaze behavior is less complex. From the
literature, we identify six metrics that capture different aspects of the gaze
behavior during decision-making and combine them in a voting scheme. We
empirically show, that this accounts for the large variations in gaze behavior
and out-performs standalone metrics. Importantly, it offers an intuitive way to
control the amount of detected information, which is crucial for different UI
adaptation schemes to succeed. We show the applicability of our approach by
developing a room-search application that changes the visual saliency of
content detected as relevant. In an empirical study, we show that it detects up
to 97% of relevant elements with respect to user self-reporting, which allows
us to meaningfully adapt the interface, as confirmed by participants. Our
approach is fast, does not need any explicit user input and can be applied
independent of task and user.

disentanglement of appearance and shape from human images. Most existing
endeavours pursuit this goal by either using training images with annotations
or regulating the training process with external clues such as human skeleton,
body segmentation or cloth patches etc. In this paper, we aim to address this
challenge in a more unsupervised manner---we do not require any annotation nor
any external task-specific clues. To this end, we formulate an
encoder-decoder-like network to extract both the shape and appearance features
from input images at the same time, and train the parameters by three losses:
feature adversarial loss, color consistency loss and reconstruction loss. The
feature adversarial loss mainly impose little to none mutual information
between the extracted shape and appearance features, while the color
consistency loss is to encourage the invariance of person appearance
conditioned on different shapes. More importantly, our unsupervised

input itself in order to obtain clean appearance features. Without using fixed
input human skeleton, our network better preserves the conditional human
posture while requiring less supervision. Experimental results on DeepFashion

disentanglement and is able to synthesis novel images of comparable quality
with state-of-the-art weakly-supervised or even supervised methods.

pedestrian detection, the overall performance of algorithm still needs further
improvement for practical applications, \emph{e.g.}, a good trade-off between
the accuracy and efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a series of
systematic optimization strategies for the detection pipeline of one-stage
detector, forming a single shot anchor-based detector (SADet) for efficient and
accurate pedestrian detection, which includes three main improvements. Firstly,
we optimize the sample generation process by assigning soft tags to the outlier
samples to generate semi-positive samples with continuous tag value between $0$
and $1$, which not only produces more valid samples, but also strengthens the
robustness of the model. Secondly, a novel Center-$IoU$ loss is applied as a
new regression loss for bounding box regression, which not only retains the
good characteristics of IoU loss, but also solves some defects of it. Thirdly,
we also design Cosine-NMS for the postprocess of predicted bounding boxes, and
further propose adaptive anchor matching to enable the model to adaptively
match the anchor boxes to full or visible bounding boxes according to the
degree of occlusion, making the NMS and anchor matching algorithms more
suitable for occluded pedestrian detection. Though structurally simple, it
presents state-of-the-art result and real-time speed of $20$ FPS for
VGA-resolution images ($640 \times 480$) on challenging pedestrian detection
benchmarks, i.e., CityPersons, Caltech, and human detection benchmark

due to un-observable person-specific factors. Achieving high accuracy typically
requires labeled data from test users which may not be attainable in real
applications. We observe that there exists a strong relationship between what
users are looking at and the appearance of the user's eyes. In response to this
understanding, we propose a novel dataset and accompanying method which aims to
explicitly learn these semantic and temporal relationships. Our video dataset
consists of time-synchronized screen recordings, user-facing camera views, and
eye gaze data, which allows for new benchmarks in temporal gaze tracking as
well as label-free refinement of gaze. Importantly, we demonstrate that the
fusion of information from visual stimuli as well as eye images can lead
towards achieving performance similar to literature-reported figures acquired
through supervised personalization. Our final method yields significant
performance improvements on our proposed EVE dataset, with up to a 28 percent
improvement in Point-of-Gaze estimates (resulting in 2.49 degrees in angular

time approximation schemes (EPTAS) for fundamental classes of stochastic
combinatorial optimization problems. Given an error parameter $\epsilon>0$,
such algorithmic schemes attain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in only
$t(\epsilon)\cdot poly(n)$ time, where $t(\cdot)$ is some function that depends
only on $\epsilon$. Technically speaking, our approach relies on presenting
tailor-made reductions to a newly-introduced multi-dimensional extension of the
Santa Claus problem [Bansal-Sviridenko, STOC'06]. Even though the
single-dimensional problem is already known to be APX-Hard, we prove that an
EPTAS can be designed under certain structural assumptions, which hold for our
applications.
  To demonstrate the versatility of our framework, we obtain an EPTAS for the
adaptive ProbeMax problem as well as for its non-adaptive counterpart; in both
cases, state-of-the-art approximability results have been inefficient
polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) [Chen et al., NIPS'16; Fu et al.,

derive an EPTAS for the Free-Order Prophets problem [Agrawal et al., EC'20] and
for its cost-driven generalization, Pandora's Box with Commitment [Fu et al.,

and the neutral/charged pion and rho meson spectra under magnetic fields. The
dynamical AMM of quarks, its coupling with magnetic field causes Zeeman
splitting of the dispersion relation of quarks thus changes the magnetism
properties and meson mass spectra under magnetic fields. It is found that
including the AMM of quarks cannot fully understand lattice results of the
magnetized matter: The AMM of quarks reduces the dynamical quark mass thus
causes the inverse magnetic catalysis around $T_c$. The neutral pion mass is
very sensitive to the AMM, it decreases with magnetic field quickly, and the
charged pion mass shows a nonlinear behavior, i.e., firstly linearly increases
with the magnetic field and then saturates at strong magnetic field. For rho
meson, it is observed that AMM reduces the mass of neutral rho meson mass with
different $s_z$, and reduces the mass of $s_z=+1,0$ component charged rho meson
mass but enhances the $s_z=-1$ component charged rho meson mass. The magnetic
susceptibility at low temperature can be either positive or negative with

from Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the Bayesian sparsity model.
Compared with the regression problem, RVM classification is difficult to be
conducted because there is no closed-form solution for the weight parameter
posterior. Original RVM classification algorithm used Newton's method in
optimization to obtain the mode of weight parameter posterior then approximated
it by a Gaussian distribution in Laplace's method. It would work but just
applied the frequency methods in a Bayesian framework. This paper proposes a
Generic Bayesian approach for the RVM classification. We conjecture that our
algorithm achieves convergent estimates of the quantities of interest compared
with the nonconvergent estimates of the original RVM classification algorithm.
Furthermore, a Fully Bayesian approach with the hierarchical hyperprior
structure for RVM classification is proposed, which improves the classification
performance, especially in the imbalanced data problem. By the numeric studies,
our proposed algorithms obtain high classification accuracy rates. The Fully
Bayesian hierarchical hyperprior method outperforms the Generic one for the
imbalanced data classification.

Transient Factory, was observed with various telescopes starting a few days
after the estimated explosion time of 2011 Dec. 5 UT and up to 432 rest-frame
days thereafter. The rising part of the light curve was monitored only in the
R_PTF filter band, and maximum in this band was reached ~30 rest-frame days
after the estimated explosion time. The light curve and spectra of PTF11rka are
consistent with the core-collapse explosion of a ~10 Msun carbon-oxygen core
evolved from a progenitor of main-sequence mass 25--40 Msun, that liberated a
kinetic energy (KE) ~ 4 x 10^{51} erg, expelled ~8 Msun of ejecta (Mej), and
synthesised ~0.5 Msun of 56Nichel. The photospheric spectra of PTF11rka are
characterised by narrow absorption lines that point to suppression of the
highest ejecta velocities ~>15,000 km/s. This would be expected if the ejecta
impacted a dense, clumpy circumstellar medium. This in turn caused them to lose
a fraction of their energy (~5 x 10^50 erg), less than 2% of which was
converted into radiation that sustained the light curve before maximum
brightness. This is reminiscent of the superluminous SN 2007bi, the light-curve
shape and spectra of which are very similar to those of PTF11rka, although the
latter is a factor of 10 less luminous and evolves faster in time. PTF11rka is
in fact more similar to gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe) in luminosity,
although it has a lower energy and a lower KE/Mej ratio.

and uncalibrated scenarios, for non-Lambertian surfaces based on deep learning.
We first introduce a fully convolutional deep network for calibrated
photometric stereo, which we call PS-FCN. Unlike traditional approaches that
adopt simplified reflectance models to make the problem tractable, our method
directly learns the mapping from reflectance observations to surface normal,
and is able to handle surfaces with general and unknown isotropic reflectance.
At test time, PS-FCN takes an arbitrary number of images and their associated
light directions as input and predicts a surface normal map of the scene in a
fast feed-forward pass. To deal with the uncalibrated scenario where light
directions are unknown, we introduce a new convolutional network, named LCNet,
to estimate light directions from input images. The estimated light directions
and the input images are then fed to PS-FCN to determine the surface normals.
Our method does not require a pre-defined set of light directions and can
handle multiple images in an order-agnostic manner. Thorough evaluation of our
approach on both synthetic and real datasets shows that it outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both calibrated and uncalibrated scenarios.

  Comprehensive Survey",,,,,"eess.SP cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Joint radar and communication (JRC) has recently attracted substantial
attention. The first reason is that JRC allows individual radar and
communication systems to share spectrum bands and thus improves the spectrum
utilization. The second reason is that JRC enables a single hardware platform,
e.g., an autonomous vehicle or a UAV, to simultaneously perform the
communication function and the radar function. As a result, JRC is able to
improve the efficiency of resources, i.e., spectrum and energy, reduce the
system size, and minimize the system cost. However, there are several
challenges to be solved for the JRC design. In particular, sharing the spectrum
imposes the interference caused by the systems, and sharing the hardware
platform and energy resource complicates the design of the JRC transmitter and
compromises the performance of each function. To address the challenges,
several resource management approaches have been recently proposed, and this
paper presents a comprehensive literature review on resource management for
JRC. First, we give fundamental concepts of JRC, important performance metrics
used in JRC systems, and applications of the JRC systems. Then, we review and
analyze resource management approaches, i.e., spectrum sharing, power
allocation, and interference management, for JRC. In addition, we present
security issues to JRC and provide a discussion of countermeasures to the
security issues. Finally, we highlight important challenges in the JRC design
and discuss future research directions related to JRC.

quantum corrections is the DeWitt-Vilkovisky's (DV) covariant effective action
formalism that is gauge invariant and background field invariant. We use the
DeWitt-Vilkovisky method to study formal and cosmological aspects of quantum
fields in curved spacetime, and take initial steps towards studying quantum
gravitational corrections in cosmological setting. The thesis comprises of
mainly two parts. We first study the formal aspects of rank-2 antisymmetric
tensor field which appear in the low energy limit of superstring models and are
thus relevant in the early universe, in particular the quantization and quantum
equivalence properties, for the case with and without spontaneous Lorentz
violation. The effective action is generalized for gauge theories whose gauge
parameters possess additional symmetries. When used in the case of
spontaneously Lorentz violating antisymmetric tensor field model, it is found
that classical equivalence with a vector theory breaks down at one-loop level
due to the presence of Lorentz violating terms. The final chapter of this
thesis is devoted to taking first steps towards exploring applications of DV
method in early universe cosmology. We calculate perturbatively the covariant
one-loop quantum gravitational effective action for a scalar field model
inspired by the recently proposed nonminimal natural inflation model. The
effective potential is evaluated taking into account the finite corrections,
and an order-of-magnitude estimate of the one-loop corrections reveals that
gravitational and non-gravitational corrections have same or comparable

extensive research attention in the past two decades. The majority of prior

interacting with a robotic agent and observing its performance over time, a
rational human agent will update his/her trust in the robotic agent
accordingly. Based on this premise, we develop a personalized trust prediction
model based on Beta distribution and learn its parameters using Bayesian
inference. Our proposed model adheres to three major properties of trust
dynamics reported in prior empirical studies. We tested the proposed method
using an existing dataset involving 39 human participants interacting with four
drones in a simulated surveillance mission. The proposed method obtained a Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.072, significantly outperforming existing

method for finite-dimensional parametrized Hamiltonian systems modeling

typical of transport problems, the full model is approximated on local reduced
spaces that are adapted in time using dynamical low-rank approximation
techniques. The reduced dynamics is prescribed by approximating the symplectic
projection of the Hamiltonian vector field in the tangent space to the local
reduced space. This ensures that the canonical symplectic structure of the
Hamiltonian dynamics is preserved during the reduction. In addition, accurate
approximations with low-rank reduced solutions are obtained by allowing the
dimension of the reduced space to change during the time evolution. Whenever
the quality of the reduced solution, assessed via an error indicator, is not
satisfactory, the reduced basis is augmented in the parameter direction that is
worst approximated by the current basis. Extensive numerical tests involving
wave interactions, nonlinear transport problems, and the Vlasov equation
demonstrate the superior stability properties and considerable runtime speedups
of the proposed method as compared to global and traditional reduced basis

and a class label. In reality, it is more common to encounter multivariate TSC
(MTSC) problems where multiple series are associated with a single label.
Despite this, much less consideration has been given to MTSC than the
univariate case. The UEA archive of 30 MTSC problems released in 2018 has made
comparison of algorithms easier. We review recently proposed bespoke MTSC
algorithms based on deep learning, shapelets and bag of words approaches. The
simplest approach to MTSC is to ensemble univariate classifiers over the
multivariate dimensions. We compare the bespoke algorithms to these dimension
independent approaches on the 26 of the 30 MTSC archive problems where the data
are all of equal length. We demonstrate that the independent ensemble of
HIVE-COTE classifiers is the most accurate, but that, unlike with univariate
classification, dynamic time warping is still competitive at MTSC.

and their changes over time, gender and reported location on the complete
online archives (42 million records) of the major US newspaper (The New York

male cases, we find the presence of gender bias in all Italian newspapers, with
reported single female deaths to be about one-third of those involving single
men. We show evidence of censorship in Italian newspapers both during World War
1 and during the Italian Fascist regime. Censorship in all countries during
World Wars and in Italy during the Fascist period is a historically ascertained
fact, but so far there was no estimate on the amount on censorship in newspaper
reporting: in this work we estimate that about $75\%$ of domestic deaths and
suicides were not reported. This is also confirmed by statistical analysis of
the distribution of the least significant digit of the number of reported
deaths.
  We also find that the distribution function of the number of articles vs. the
number of deaths reported in articles follows a power law, which is broken
(with fewer articles being written) when reporting on few deaths occurring in
foreign countries. The lack of articles is found to grow with geographical
distance from the nation where the newspaper is being printed.

Using the Wigner formulation of quantum mechanics we show the equivalence of
the quantum-mechanical and kinetic approaches in the limit of collisionless
neutrino propagation (in a background medium). Based on this observation we
also argue that solutions of the kinetic equation account for the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle and the related effect of wave packet separation (for
single neutrinos), as well as the Pauli exclusion principle, if the initial
conditions are consistent with these fundamental quantum principles. Such
initial conditions can be constructed e.g. by identifying the matrix of
densities with the (reduced) single-particle Wigner function computed using
initial conditions for the neutrino wave function. Hence the neutrino momentum
uncertainty is an integral part of the initial conditions for the matrix of

technology for future wireless communication systems since it can intelligently

model, which is impractical and can cause significant performance degradation
in realistic wideband systems. To address this issue, we first study the dual
phase- and amplitude-squint effect of reflected signals and present a
simplified practical IRS reflection model for wideband signals. Then, an IRS
enhanced wideband multiuser multi-input single-output orthogonal frequency

design the transmit beamformer and IRS reflection for the case of using both
continuous and discrete phase shifters to maximize the average sum-rate over
all subcarriers. By exploiting the relationship between sum-rate maximization
and mean square error (MSE) minimization, the original problem is equivalently
transformed into a multi-block/variable problem, which can be efficiently
solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Complexity and convergence
for both cases are analyzed or illustrated. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm can offer significant average sum-rate enhancement
compared to that achieved using the ideal IRS reflection model, which confirms
the importance of the use of the practical model for the design of wideband

distribute a list of keys of SARS-CoV-2 infected users that is fetched by the
app once per day. Its success, however, depends on its adoption. In this
poster, we characterize the early adoption of the app using Netflow traces
captured directly at its hosting infrastructure. We show that the app generated
traffic from allover Germany---already on the first day. We further observe
that local COVID-19 outbreaks do not result in noticeable traffic increases.

of acoustics by providing nonconventional couplings between momentum and strain
in constitutive relations. Sharing the common ground with electromagnetics, the
realization of acoustic bianisotropy enables the exotic manipulation of
acoustic waves in cooperation with a properly designed inverse bulk modulus and
mass density. While the control of entire constitutive parameters substantiates
intriguing theoretical and practical applications, a Willis metamaterial that
enables independently and precisely designed polarizabilities has yet to be
developed to overcome the present restrictions of the maximum Willis bound and
the nonreciprocity inherent to the passivity of metamaterials. Here, by
extending the recently developed concept of virtualized metamaterials, we
propose acoustic Willis metamaterials that break the passivity and reciprocity
limit while also achieving decoupled control of all constitutive parameters
with designed frequency responses. By instituting basis convolution kernels
based on parity symmetry for each polarization response, we experimentally
demonstrate bianisotropy beyond the limit of passive media. Furthermore, based
on the notion of inverse design of the frequency dispersion by means of digital
convolution, purely nonreciprocal media and media with a broadband,
flat-response Willis coupling are also demonstrated. Our approach offers all
possible independently programmable extreme constitutive parameters and
frequency dispersion tunability accessible within the causality condition and
provides a flexible platform for realizing the full capabilities of acoustic
metamaterials.

for performing creative tasks. Such creative ML approaches have seen wide use
in the domains of visual art and music for applications such as image and music
generation and style transfer. However, similar creative ML techniques have not
been as widely adopted in the domain of game design despite the emergence of
ML-based methods for generating game content. In this paper, we argue for
leveraging and repurposing such creative techniques for designing content for
games, referring to these as approaches for Game Design via Creative ML
(GDCML). We highlight existing systems that enable GDCML and illustrate how
creative ML can inform new systems via example applications and a proposed
system.

  SIR Infection Theory","12 pages, 10 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The SIR infection theory initiated by Kermack-Mckendrick in 1927 discusses
the infection in an isolated population with uniform properties such as the
uniform population distribution. In the infection, there exist two aspects: (1)
The quantitative aspect and (2) the temporal aspect. Since the SIR theory is a
mean-field theory, it can't match both aspects simultaneously. If the
quantitative aspect is matched, the temporal aspect can't be matched, versa.
The infection starts from a cluster, and it spreads to different places
increasing the size of the infection. In general, even in the case of the
infection in a big city, the infection grows within a limited population.
Namiki found and named this kind of population as an effective population. He
proposes that if the hypothesis is adopted, the quantitative and temporal
aspects can be matched simultaneously.
