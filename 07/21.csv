for urban transportation. Roboat II is capable of accurate simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), receding horizon tracking control and
estimation, and path planning. Roboat II is designed to maximize the internal
space for transport and can carry payloads several times of its own weight.
Moreover, it is capable of holonomic motions to facilitate transporting,
docking, and inter-connectivity between boats. The proposed SLAM system
receives sensor data from a 3D LiDAR, an IMU, and a GPS, and utilizes a factor
graph to tackle the multi-sensor fusion problem. To cope with the complex
dynamics in the water, Roboat II employs an online nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC), where we experimentally estimated the dynamical model of the
vessel in order to achieve superior performance for tracking control. The
states of Roboat II are simultaneously estimated using a nonlinear moving
horizon estimation (NMHE) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that Roboat II is
able to successfully perform online mapping and localization, plan its path and
robustly track the planned trajectory in the confined river, implying that this
autonomous vessel holds the promise on potential applications in transporting
humans and goods in many of the waterways nowadays.

With the
advent of helioseismology, we were able to probe its internal layers with
unprecedented precision. However, the current state of solar modelling is still
stained by tedious issues. One of these problems is related to the disagreement
between models computed with recent photospheric abundances and helioseismic
constraints. We use solar evolutionary models as initial conditions for
reintegrations of their structure using Ledoux discriminant inversions. The
resulting models are defined as seismic solar models, satisfying the equations
of hydrostatic equilibrium. They will allow us to better constrain the internal
structure of the Sun and provide complementary information to that of
evolutionary models. These seismic models were computed using various reference
models with different equations of state, abundances and opacity tables. We
check the robustness of our approach by confirming the good agreement of our
seismic models in terms of sound speed, density and entropy proxy inversions as
well as frequency-separation ratios of low-degree pressure modes. Our method
allows us to determine with an excellent accuracy the Ledoux discriminant
profile of the Sun and compute full profiles of this quantity. Our models show
an agreement with seismic data of ~0.1% in sound speed, density and entropy
proxy as well as with the observed frequency-separation ratios. They surpass
all standard and non-standard evolutionary models including ad-hoc changes
aiming at reproducing helioseismic constraints. The obtained seismic Ledoux
discriminant profile as well as the consistent structure obtained from our

high-resolution scans of healthy subjects and a subject with Multiple

in rapid bursts that are separated by much longer intervals of stasis during
which mutations accumulate but no major phenotypic change occurs. Punctuated
equilibrium has been originally proposed within the framework of paleobiology,
to explain the lack of transitional forms that is typical of the fossil record.
Theoretically, punctuated equilibrium has been linked to self-organized
criticality (SOC), a model in which the size of avalanches in an evolving
system is power-law distributed, resulting in increasing rarity of major
events. We show here that, under the weak-mutation limit, a large population
would spend most of the time in stasis in the vicinity of saddle points in the
fitness landscape. The periods of stasis are punctuated by fast transitions, in
lnNe time (Ne, effective population size), when a new beneficial mutation is
fixed in the evolving population, which moves to a different saddle, or on much
rarer occasions, from a saddle to a local peak. Thus, punctuated equilibrium is
the default mode of evolution under a simple model that does not involve SOC or
other special conditions.

integral K\""ahler classes $[\omega_j]$ on $N$ that are not necessarily colinear

synchronization between watermark encoder and decoder. And the local geometric
distortion is a famous challenge in the watermark field. Although a lot of
geometric distortions resilient watermarking schemes have been proposed, few of
them perform well against local geometric distortion like random bending attack
(RBA). To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel watermark
synchronization process and the corresponding watermarking scheme. In our
scheme, the watermark bits are represented by random patterns. The message is
encoded to get a watermark unit, and the watermark unit is flipped to generate
a symmetrical watermark. Then the symmetrical watermark is embedded into the
spatial domain of the host image in an additive way. In watermark extraction,
we first get the theoretically mean-square error minimized estimation of the
watermark. Then the auto-convolution function is applied to this estimation to
detect the symmetry and get a watermark units map. According to this map, the
watermark can be accurately synchronized, and then the extraction can be done.
Experimental results demonstrate the excellent robustness of the proposed
watermarking scheme to local geometric distortions, global geometric
distortions, common image processing operations, and some kinds of combined
attacks.

Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices is known to have issues related
to the high number of qubits needed and the noise associated with multi-qubit
gates. In this paper, we propose a variational QML algorithm using a dressed
quantum network to address these issues. Using the ""super compressed encoding""
scheme that we follow here, the classical encoding layer in our dressed network
drastically scales down the input-dimension, before feeding the input to the
variational quantum circuit. Hence, the number of qubits needed in our quantum
circuit goes down drastically. Also, unlike in most other existing QML
algorithms, our quantum circuit consists only of single-qubit gates, making it
robust against noise. These factors make our algorithm suitable for
implementation on NISQ hardware. To support our argument, we implement our
algorithm on real NISQ hardware and thereby show accurate classification using
popular machine learning data-sets like Fisher's Iris, Wisconsin's Breast
Cancer (WBC), and Abalone. Then, to provide an intuitive explanation for our
algorithm's working, we demonstrate the clustering of quantum states, which
correspond to the input-samples of different output-classes, on the Bloch
sphere (using WBC and MNIST data-sets). This clustering happens as a result of
the training process followed in our algorithm. Through this Bloch-sphere-based
representation, we also show the distinct roles played (in training) by the
adjustable parameters of the classical encoding layer and the adjustable
parameters of the variational quantum circuit. These parameters are adjusted
iteratively during training through loss-minimization.

such algorithms are biased towards the training dataset. Thus, the
transferability of deep-learning-based operators are challenging, especially
when the goal is to apply the learned operator on a new dataset/domain. Lack of
transferability of learned operator across domains hinders the applicability of
deep learning algorithms in processing seismic data. Unlike camera images, the
comprehensively labeled seismic datasets are not available. Moreover, from one
task to another, the training parameters should be tuned. To remedy this
shortcoming, we have developed a workflow that transfers the learned operator
from the camera images to the seismic domain, without modifying its training
parameters. The similarities in the algorithms and optimization methods in
camera and seismic data processing allow us to do so. Accordingly, by
incorporating feed-forward de-noising convolutional neural networks (DnCNN) in

Regularized Learning of the target task using models that have been pre-trained
from source datasets, and Multitask Learning with both source and target
datasets to train a shared backbone neural network. In this work, we aim to
improve the multitask paradigm for deep transfer learning via Cross-domain
Mixup (XMixup). While the existing multitask learning algorithms need to run
backpropagation over both the source and target datasets and usually consume a
higher gradient complexity, XMixup transfers the knowledge from source to
target tasks more efficiently: for every class of the target task, XMixup
selects the auxiliary samples from the source dataset and augments training
samples via the simple mixup strategy. We evaluate XMixup over six real world
transfer learning datasets. Experiment results show that XMixup improves the
accuracy by 1.9% on average. Compared with other state-of-the-art transfer

  In this paper, we present an algorithm that solves linear systems in sparse

This speedup holds for any input matrix $A$ with $o(n^{\omega

and often high-dimensional parameter space that can be expensive to evaluate.
Traditional active search techniques like Bayesian optimization trade off
exploration and exploitation over consecutive evaluations, and have
historically focused on single or small (<5) numbers of examples evaluated per
round. As modern data sets grow, so does the need to scale active search to
large data sets and batch sizes. In this paper, we present a general
hierarchical framework based on bandit algorithms to scale active search to
large batch sizes by maximizing information derived from the unique structure
of each dataset. Our hierarchical framework, Hierarchical Batch Bandit Search
(HBBS), strategically distributes batch selection across a learned embedding
space by facilitating wide exploration of different structural elements within
a dataset. We focus our application of HBBS on modern biology, where large
batch experimentation is often fundamental to the research process, and
demonstrate batch design of biological sequences (protein and DNA). We also
present a new Gym environment to easily simulate diverse biological sequences
and to enable more comprehensive evaluation of active search methods across
heterogeneous data sets. The HBBS framework improves upon standard performance,
wall-clock, and scalability benchmarks for batch search by using a broad
exploration strategy across coarse partitions and fine-grained exploitation
within each partition of structured data.

proteins, that makes them the most abundant among the structural proteins. The
repertoires of motifs for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were divergent but nearly
coincided for different isolates of SARS-CoV-2. We obtained the distributions
of assembly/packaging signals over the genomes with non-overlapping windows of
width 432 nt. Finally, using the spectral entropy, we compared the load from
point mutations and indels during virus age for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We
found the higher mutational load on SARS-CoV. In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 can be
treated as a ""newborn"" virus. These observations may be helpful in practical
medical applications and are of basic interest.

limited to the Class 0 phase, hampering our understanding of their origin and

already during Class I phase, which, therefore, represents a crucial step in
the future planetary system chemical composition. Hence, the study of hot
corinos in Class I protostars has become of paramount importance. Here we
report the discovery of a hot corino towards the prototypical Class I protostar
L1551 IRS5, obtained within the ALMA Large Program FAUST. We detected several
lines from methanol and its isopotologues ($^{13}$CH$_{\rm 3}$OH and CH$_{\rm
2}$DOH), methyl formate and ethanol. Lines are bright toward the north
component of the IRS5 binary system, and a possible second hot corino may be
associated with the south component. The methanol lines non-LTE analysis
constrains the gas temperature ($\sim$100 K), density
($\geq$1.5$\times$10$^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$), and emitting size ($\sim$10 au in
radius). All CH$_{\rm 3}$OH and $^{13}$CH$_{\rm 3}$OH lines are optically
thick, preventing a reliable measure of the deuteration. The methyl formate and
ethanol relative abundances are compatible with those measured in Class 0 hot
corinos. Thus, based on the present work, little chemical evolution from Class
0 to I hot corinos occurs.

regularized delta, (ii) more realistic polarization potential, representing
long-range part of the atom-ion interaction. For the former we obtain
analytical results for energies of bound states. For the latter we perform
numerical calculations based on the application of finite element method. Then,
we move to the case of a single atom interacting with one-dimensional (1D)
infinite chain of static ions. Such a setup resembles Kronig-Penney model of a
1D crystalline solid, where energy spectrum exhibits band structure behaviour.
For this system, we derive analytical results for the band structure of bound

calculations, considering polarization potential to model atom-impurity

propose a self-supervised learning algorithm for learning a neural network
high-level policy, which is useful for online hyperparameter adaptations in
highly dynamic environments. We demonstrate the importance of incorporating the

to deploy attention based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) locally to

However, in the presence of occlusions and pose variations, different channels
respond differently, and further that the response intensity of a channel
differ across spatial locations. Also, modern facial expression
recognition(FER) architectures rely on external sources like landmark detectors
for defining attention. Failure of landmark detector will have a cascading
effect on FER. Additionally, there is no emphasis laid on the relevance of
features that are input to compute complementary context information.
Leveraging on the aforementioned observations, an end-to-end architecture for

(SCAN), without seeking any information from the landmark detectors. SCAN is
complemented by a complementary context information (CCI) branch. Further,
using efficient channel attention (ECA), the relevance of features input to CCI

from a few waveform examples is a challenging inverse problem in audio signal
processing, with numerous applications in musical acoustics as well as
structural engineering. We propose to address this problem via a combination of
time--frequency analysis and supervised machine learning. We start by
synthesizing a dataset of sounds using the functional transformation method.
Then, we represent each percussive sound in terms of its time-invariant
scattering transform coefficients and formulate the parametric estimation of
the resonator as multidimensional regression with a deep convolutional neural
network. We interpolate scattering coefficients over the surface of the drum as
a surrogate for potentially missing data, and study the response of the neural
network to interpolated samples. Lastly, we resynthesize drum sounds from
scattering coefficients, therefore paving the way towards a deep generative
model of drum sounds whose latent variables are physically interpretable.

conditions, and increasingly also in data taken during solar flares. The
chromosphere is known for its 3-minute signals, which are particularly strong
over sunspot umbrae. These signals are thought to be driven by photospheric
disturbances and their periods determined by the chromosphere's acoustic
cut-off frequency. A small number of observations have shown the chromospheric
3-minute signals to be affected by energetic events such as solar flares,
however the link between flare activity and these oscillatory signals remains
unclear. In this work we present evidence of changes to the oscillatory
structure of the chromosphere over a sunspot which occurs during the impulsive
phase of an M1 flare. Using imaging data from the CRISP instrument across the
H$\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 {\AA} spectral lines, we employed a method of fitting
models to power spectra to produce maps of areas where there is evidence of
oscillatory signals above a red noise background. Comparing results taken
before and after the impulsive phase of the flare, we found that the
oscillatory signals taken after the start of the flare differ in two ways: the
locations of oscillatory signals had changed and the typical periods of the
oscillations had tended to increase (in some cases increasing from $\lt$100s to
$\sim$200s). Both of these results can be explained by a restructuring of the
magnetic field in the chromosphere during the flare activity, which is backed
up by images of coronal loops showing clear changes to magnetic connectivity.
These results represent one of the many ways that active regions can be
affected by solar flare events.

framework is unclear due to both ethical as well as technical considerations,
the latter of which include trade-offs between measures of fairness and model
performance that are not well-understood for predictive models of clinical
outcomes. To inform the ongoing debate, we conduct an empirical study to
characterize the impact of penalizing group fairness violations on an array of
measures of model performance and group fairness. We repeat the analyses across
multiple observational healthcare databases, clinical outcomes, and sensitive
attributes. We find that procedures that penalize differences between the
distributions of predictions across groups induce nearly-universal degradation
of multiple performance metrics within groups. On examining the secondary
impact of these procedures, we observe heterogeneity of the effect of these
procedures on measures of fairness in calibration and ranking across
experimental conditions. Beyond the reported trade-offs, we emphasize that
analyses of algorithmic fairness in healthcare lack the contextual grounding
and causal awareness necessary to reason about the mechanisms that lead to
health disparities, as well as about the potential of algorithmic fairness
methods to counteract those mechanisms. In light of these limitations, we
encourage researchers building predictive models for clinical use to step
outside the algorithmic fairness frame and engage critically with the broader
sociotechnical context surrounding the use of machine learning in healthcare.

undermining the adaptation efficacy of id-related features. In this paper, we
seek to improve adaptation by purifying the representation space to be adapted.
To this end, we propose a joint learning framework that disentangles
id-related/unrelated features and enforces adaptation to work on the id-related
feature space exclusively. Our model involves a disentangling module that
encodes cross-domain images into a shared appearance space and two separate
structure spaces, and an adaptation module that performs adversarial alignment
and self-training on the shared appearance space. The two modules are
co-designed to be mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate that

incorporates a cylindrical projection into multi-view feature learning,
predicts bounding box parameters per pillar rather than per point or per

existence of Majorana zero modes in vortices. As iron-based superconductors
with band inversion and $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing can give rise to time-reversal
invariant second-order topological superconductivity, manifested by the
presence of helical Majorana hinge states in three dimensions, we are motivated
to investigate the interplay between the second-order topology and the vortex
lines in both weak- and strong-Zeeman-field regimes. In the weak-Zeeman-field
regime, we find that vortex lines far away from the hinges are topologically
nontrivial in the weakly doped regime, regardless of whether the second-order
topology is present or not. However, when the superconductor falls into the
second-order topological phase and a topological vortex line is moved close to
the helical Majorana hinge states, we find that their hybridization will
trivialize the vortex line and transfer robust Majorana zero modes to the
hinges. Furthermore, when the Zeeman field is large enough, we find that the
helical Majorana hinge states are changed into chiral Majorana hinge modes and
thus a chiral second-order topological superconducting phase is realized. In
this regime, the vortex lines are always topologically trivial, no matter how
far away they are from the chiral Majorana hinge modes. By incorporating a
realistic assumption of inhomogeneous superconductivity, our findings can
explain the recent experimental observation of the peculiar coexistence and
evolution of topologically nontrivial and trivial vortex lines in iron-based
superconductors.

theories of elasticity for an evolution of quasi-static anti-plane fracture.
The classical linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), with conventional
linear relationship between stress and strain, has a well documented
inconsistency through which it predicts a singular cracktip strain. This
clearly violates the basic tenant of the theory which is a first order
approximation to finite elasticity. To overcome the issue, we investigate a new
class of material models which predicts uniform and bounded strain throughout
the body. The nonlinear model allows the strain value to remain small even if
the stress value tends to infinity, which is achieved by an implicit
relationship between stress and strain. A major objective of this paper is to
couple a nonlinear bulk energy with diffusive crack employing the phase-field
approach. Towards that end, an iterative L-scheme is employed and the numerical
model is augmented with a penalization technique to accommodate irreversibility
of crack. Several numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the
capability and the performance of the proposed framework We observe the
naturally bounded strain in the neighborhood of the crack-tip, leading to
different bulk and crack energies for fracture propagation.

binary Kuiper-belt population. Its origins are vital to understanding the
formation of other Kupier-belt objects (KBO) and binaries, and the evolution of
the outer solar-system. The Pluto-Charon system is believed to form following a
giant impact between two massive KBOs at relatively low velocities. However,
the likelihood of a random direct collision between two of the most massive
KBOs is low, and is further constrained by the requirement of a low-velocity
collision, making this a potentially fine-tuned scenario. Here we expand our
previous studies and suggest that the proto-Pluto-Charon system was formed as a
highly inclined wide-binary, which was then driven through
secular/quasi-secular evolution into a direct impact. Since wide-binaries are
ubiquitous in the Kuiper-belt with many expected to be highly inclined, our
scenario is expected to be robust. We use analytic tools and few-body
simulations of the triple Sun-(proto-)Pluto-Charon system to show that a large
parameter-space of initial conditions leads to such collisions. The velocity of
such an impact is the escape velocity of a bound system, which naturally
explains the low-velocity impact. The dynamical evolution and the origins of
the Pluto-Charon system could therefore be traced to similar secular origins as
those of other binaries and contact-binaries (e.g. Arrokoth), and suggest they
play a key role in the evolution of KBOs.

a protostellar jet+outflow (HH 900) and, with a blue-shifted velocity of ~10
km/s, is travelling faster than it should be if its kinematics were set by the
turbulent velocity dispersion of the precursor cloud. Its outer layers are
currently still subject to heating, but comparing the internal and external
pressures implies that the globule is in a post-collapse phase. Intriguingly
the outflow is bent, implying that the YSO responsible for launching it is
comoving with the globule, which requires that the star formed after the
globule was up to speed since otherwise it would have been left behind. We
conclude that the most likely scenario is one in which the cloud was much
larger before being subject to radiatively-driven implosion, which accelerated
the globule to the high observed speeds under the photoevaporative rocket
effect and triggered the formation of the star responsible for the outflow. The
globule may now be in a quasi-steady state following collapse. Finally, the HH
900 YSO is likely $\gtrsim$1 M$_{\odot}$ and may be the only star forming in
the globule. It may be that this process of triggered star formation has
prevented the globule from fragmenting to form multiple stars (e.g., due to
heating) and has produced a single higher mass star.

($M_\mathrm{stellar} < 10^{9.5} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We find that
overmassive black holes (BHs), with respect to the mean scaling relations with
their host galaxies, drive hotter and faster outflows and lead to significantly
reduced gas mass fractions. They are also more likely to display a
kinematically misaligned ionized gas component in our mock MaNGA velocity maps,
although we caution that cosmic inflows and mergers contribute to misalignments
as well. While in the local Universe the majority of AGN in dwarfs are much
dimmer than the stellar component, for $z \geq 2$ there is a significant
population that outshines their hosts. These high-redshift overmassive BHs
contribute to the quenching of dwarfs, whereas at late cosmic times supernova
(SN) feedback is more efficient. While our results are overall in good
agreement with X-ray observations of AGN in dwarfs, the lack of high-luminosity
X-ray AGN in FABLE at low redshifts highlights an interesting possibility that
SN feedback could be too strong in FABLE's dwarfs, curtailing AGN growth and
feedback. We predict that future observations may uncover many more AGN in

findings were tested assuming that neutrinos are massless; in this paper we
extend the analysis to massive-neutrino cosmologies. In particular, we examine

if it is possible to detect the neutrino masses using the shift of the LP

statistics in structure formation. Many theoretical models (such as
Press-Schechter theory) are based on the notion that it could be universal,
meaning independent of redshift and cosmology, when expressed in the
appropriate variables. However, simulations exhibit persistent
non-universalities in the mass functions of the virial mass and other commonly
used spherical overdensity definitions. We systematically study the
universality of mass functions over a wide range of mass definitions, for the
first time including the recently proposed splashback mass, Msp. We confirm
that, in LambdaCDM cosmologies, all mass definitions exhibit varying levels of
non-universality that increase with peak height and reach between 20% and 500%
at the highest masses we can test. Mvir, M200m, and Msp exhibit similar levels
of non-universality. There are, however, two regimes where the splashback mass
functions are significantly more universal. First, they are universal to 10% at
z<2, whereas spherical overdensity definitions experience an evolution due to
dark energy. Second, when additionally considering self-similar cosmologies
with extreme power spectra, splashback mass functions are remarkably universal
(to between 40% and 60%) whereas their spherical overdensity counterparts reach
non-universalities between 180% and 450%. These results strongly support the
notion that the splashback radius is a physically motivated definition of the

of ETH. We discuss and propose protocols to independently measure fluctuations
and dissipations as well as higher-order time ordered correlation functions. We
first show how the emergence of fluctuation dissipation relations from a
nonequilibrium initial state can be observed for the 2D Bose-Hubbard model in
superconducting qubits or quantum gas microscopes. Then we focus on the
long-range transverse field Ising model (LTFI), which can be realized with
trapped ions. The LTFI exhibits rich thermalization phenomena: For strong
transverse fields, we observe prethermalization to an effective
magnetization-conserving Hamiltonian in the fluctuation dissipation relations.
For weak transverse fields, confined excitations lead to non-thermal features
resulting in a violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relations up to long
times. Moreover, in an integrable region of the LTFI, thermalization to a
generalized Gibbs ensemble occurs and the fluctuation-dissipation relations
enable an experimental diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. Our work presents a
theory-independent way to characterize thermalization in quantum simulators and
paves the way to quantum simulate condensed matter pump-probe experiments.

spectra targeted as quasars (QSOs) will need to move beyond its historical
reliance on human experts. Instead, automatic classifiers will increasingly
become the dominant classification method, leaving only small fractions of
spectra to be visually inspected in ambiguous cases. In order to maximise
classification accuracy, making best use of available classifiers will be of
great importance, particularly when looking to identify and eliminate
distinctive failure modes. In this work, we demonstrate that the machine
learning-based classifier QuasarNET will be of use for future surveys such as
the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), comparing its performance to
the DESI pipeline classifier redrock. During the first of four passes across
its footprint DESI will need to select high-$z$ ($z\geq2.1$) QSOs for
reobservation, and so we first assess the classifiers' performance at
identifying high-$z$ QSOs from single-exposure spectra. We then quantify the
classifiers' abilities to construct QSO catalogues in both low- and high-$z$
bins, using coadded spectra to simulate end-of-survey data. For such tasks,
QuasarNET is able to outperform redrock in its current form, identifying
approximately 99% of high-$z$ QSOs from single exposures and producing QSO
catalogues with sub-percent levels of contamination. By combining QuasarNET and
redrock's outputs, we can further improve the classification strategies to
identify up to 99.5% of high-$z$ QSOs from single exposures and reduce final
QSO catalogue contamination to below 0.5%. These combined strategies address
DESI's QSO classification needs effectively.

Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) to measure the shapes of dwarf galaxies out to four
effective radii for a sample of dwarfs at 0.005<z<0.2 and
10^7<M_star/M_sun<10^9.6. We find that dwarfs are slightly triaxial, with a
<B/A> >~ 0.75 (where the ellipsoid is characterized by three principle
semi-axes constrained by C<=B<=A). At M_star>10^8.5 M_sun, the galaxies grow
from thick disk-like near their centers towards the spheroidal extreme at four
effective radii. We also see that although blue dwarfs are, on average,
characterized by thinner discs than red dwarfs, both blue and red dwarfs grow
more spheroidal as a function of radius. This relation also holds true for a
comparison between field and satellite dwarfs. This uniform trend towards
relatively spheroidal shapes as a function of radius is consistent with an
in-situ formation mechanism for stellar outskirts around low-mass galaxies, in
agreement with proposed models where star formation feedback produces round
stellar outskirts around dwarfs.

disordered hopping problem on the underlying Fock-space graph. A crucial
feature of the effective Fock-space disorder is that the Fock-space site
energies are strongly correlated -- maximally so for sites separated by a
finite distance on the graph. Motivated by this, and to understand the effect
of such correlations more fundamentally, we study Anderson localisation on
Cayley trees and random regular graphs, with maximally correlated disorder.
Since such correlations suppress short distance fluctuations in the disorder
potential, one might naively suppose they disfavour localisation. We find
however that there exists an Anderson transition, and indeed that localisation
is more robust in the sense that the critical disorder scales with graph
connectivity $K$ as $\sqrt{K}$, in marked contrast to $K\ln K$ in the
uncorrelated case. This scaling is argued to be intimately connected to the
stability of many-body localisation. Our analysis centres on an exact recursive
formulation for the local propagators as well as a self-consistent mean-field
theory; with results corroborated using exact diagonalisation.

controlling the shape of the potential of the inflaton which is identified with
the volume modulus. The model provides a phenomenological successful
small-field inflation for a value of the parameter that makes the minimum very

phenomena, including electron hydrodynamics, quantum field theoretic anomalies,
and extreme magnetoresistances and mobilities. However, the scattering
mechanisms central to these behaviors remain largely unexplored. Here we reveal
signatures of significant phonon-electron scattering in the type-II Weyl
semimetal WP$_{2}$ via temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Over a large
temperature range, we find that the decay rates of the lowest energy $A_{1}$
modes are dominated by phonon-electron rather than phonon-phonon scattering. In
conjunction with first-principles calculations, a combined analysis of the
momentum, energy, and symmetry-allowed decay paths indicates this results from
intraband scattering of the electrons. The excellent agreement with theory
further suggests that such results could be true for the acoustic modes. We
thus provide evidence for the importance of phonons in the transport properties

filaments and sheets of the cosmic web at several redshifts. We find that at
all times the magnitude of halo spins correlates with the web environment,
being largest in filaments, and, for the first time, we show that it also
correlates with filament thickness as well as the angle between
spin-orientation and the spine of the host filament. For example, massive
haloes in thick filaments spin faster than their counterparts in thin
filaments, while for low-mass haloes the reverse is true. We also have studied
the evolution of alignment between halo spin orientations and the preferential
axes of filaments and sheets. The alignment varies with halo mass, with the
spins of low-mass haloes being predominantly along the filament spine, while
those of high-mass haloes being predominantly perpendicular to the filament
spine. On average, for all halo masses, halo spins become more perpendicular to
the filament spine at later times. At all redshifts, the spin alignment shows a
considerable variation with filament thickness, with the halo mass
corresponding to the transition from parallel to perpendicular alignment
varying by more than one order of magnitude. The environmental dependence of
halo spin magnitude shows little evolution for $z\leq2$ and is likely a
consequence of the correlations in the initial conditions or high redshift
effects

below this characteristic crossover mass, $\text{M}_{\text{c}}$. In this paper,
we measure the redshift evolution and scale dependence of halo spin bias at the
low-mass end and demonstrate that the inversion of the signal is entirely
produced by the effect of splashback haloes. These low-mass haloes tend to live
in the vicinity of significantly more massive haloes, thus sharing their
large-scale bias properties. We further show that the location of the
redshift-dependent crossover mass scale $\text{M}_{\text{c}}(z)$ is completely
determined by the relative abundance of splashbacks in the low- and high-spin
subpopulations. Once splashback haloes are removed from the sample, the
intrinsic mass dependence of spin bias is recovered. Since splashbacks have
been shown to account for some of the assembly bias signal at the low-mass end,
our results unveil a specific link between two different secondary bias trends:
spin bias and assembly bias.

in the Higgs-like regime. In this paper, we study this behavior in more depth,

complete preheating although a severe fine-tuning is required among the model

neutral, as-yet-undiscovered hadron in the standard model. The existence of a
compact color-flavor-spin singlet sexaquark (S, uuddss) with mass ~2m_p, is
compatible with current knowledge. The S interacts with baryons primarily via a
Yukawa interaction of coupling strength alpha_SN, mediated by omega and phi
vector mesons having mass ~1 GeV. If it exists, the S is a very attractive DM
candidate. The relic abundance of S Dark Matter (SDM) is established when the
Universe transitions from the quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase at ~150
MeV and is in remarkable agreement with the observed Omega_DM/Omega_b =
5.3+-0.1; this is a no-free-parameters result because the relevant parameters
are known from QCD. Survival of this relic abundance to low temperature
requires the breakup amplitude gtilde <~ 2 10^-6, comfortably compatible with
theory expectations and observational bounds because the breakup amplitude is
dynamically suppressed and many orders of magnitude smaller, as we show. The
scattering cross section can differ by orders of magnitude from Born
approximation, depending on alpha_SN, requiring reanalysis of observational
limits. We use direct detection experiments and cosmological constraints to
determine the allowed region of alpha_SN. For a range of allowed values, we
predict exotic nuclear isotopes at a detectable level with mass offset ~2 amu.
The most promising approaches for detecting the sexaquark in accelerator
experiments are to search for a long-interaction-length neutral particle
component in the central region of relativistic heavy ion collisions or using a
beam-dump setup, and to search for evidence of missing particle production
characterized by unbalanced baryon number and strangeness using Belle-II or

compactification makes a complete computation of the low energy effective
theory infeasible. A common strategy to solve this problem is to consider
Calabi-Yau manifolds with discrete symmetries, which effectively reduce the
number of moduli and make the computation of the truncated Effective Field
Theory possible. In this approach, however, the couplings (e.g., the masses) of
the truncated fields are left undetermined. In the present paper we discuss the
tree-level mass spectrum of type-IIB flux compactifications at Large Complex
Structure, focusing on models with a reduced one-dimensional complex structure
sector. We compute the tree-level spectrum for the dilaton and complex
structure moduli, \emph{including the truncated fields}, which can be expressed
entirely in terms of the known couplings of the reduced theory. We show that
the masses of this set of fields are naturally heavy at vacua consistent with
the KKLT construction, and we discuss other phenomenologically interesting
scenarios where the spectrum involves fields much lighter than the gravitino.
We also derive the probability distribution for the masses on the ensemble of
flux vacua, and show that it exhibits universal features independent of the
details of the compactification. We check our results on a large sample of flux
vacua constructed in an orientifold of the Calabi-Yau
$\mathbb{WP}^4_{[1,1,1,1,4]}$. Finally, we also discuss the conditions under
which the spectrum derived here could arise in more general compactifications.

Smith",,,,"math.AC math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An $R$-algebra $S$ is $R$-solid if there exists a nonzero $R$-linear map $S

Frobenius splittings implicitly rely on the $R$-solidity of $R^{1/p}$.
Following recent results of the first two authors on the Frobenius
non-splitting of certain excellent $F$-pure rings, in this paper we use the
notion of solidity to systematically study the notion of excellence, with an
emphasis on $F$-singularities. We show that for rings $R$ essentially of finite
type over complete local rings of characteristic $p$, reducedness implies the
$R$-solidity of $R^{1/p}$, $F$-purity implies Frobenius splitting, and $F$-pure
regularity implies split $F$-regularity. We demonstrate that Henselizations and
completions are not solid, providing obstructions for the $R$-solidity of
$R^{1/p}$ for arbitrary excellent rings. This also has negative consequences
for the solidity of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras, an important example of which
are absolute integral closures of excellent local rings in prime
characteristic. We establish a close relationship between the solidity of
absolute integral closures and the notion of Japanese rings. Analyzing the
Japanese property reveals that Dedekind domains $R$ for which $R^{1/p}$ is
$R$-solid are excellent, despite our recent examples of excellent Euclidean
domains with no nonzero $p^{-1}$-linear maps. Additionally, we show that while
perfect closures are often solid in algebro-geometric situations, there exist
locally excellent domains with solid perfect closures whose absolute integral
closures are not solid. In an appendix, Karen E. Smith uses the solidity of
absolute integral closures to characterize the test ideal for a large class of
Gorenstein domains of prime characteristic.

data-generating models by using simple architectures that do not require
significant fine-tuning of hyperparameters. However, VAEs are known to suffer
from over-regularization which can lead to failure to escape local maxima. This
phenomenon, known as posterior collapse, prevents learning a meaningful latent
encoding of the data. Recent methods have mitigated this issue by
deterministically moment-matching an aggregated posterior distribution to an
aggregate prior. However, abandoning a probabilistic framework (and thus
relying on point estimates) can both lead to a discontinuous latent space and
generate unrealistic samples. Here we present Hierarchical Empirical Bayes
Autoencoder (HEBAE), a computationally stable framework for probabilistic
generative models. Our key contributions are two-fold. First, we make gains by
placing a hierarchical prior over the encoding distribution, enabling us to
adaptively balance the trade-off between minimizing the reconstruction loss
function and avoiding over-regularization. Second, we show that assuming a
general dependency structure between variables in the latent space produces
better convergence onto the mean-field assumption for improved posterior
inference. Overall, HEBAE is more robust to a wide-range of hyperparameter
initializations than an analogous VAE. Using data from MNIST and CelebA, we
illustrate the ability of HEBAE to generate higher quality samples based on FID
score than existing autoencoder-based approaches.

would like to be able to test is whether the input does not contain certain
forbidden small substructures. In the setting of graphs, such a result was
obtained by Alon et al., who proved that for any finite family of graphs ${\cal

  It is natural to ask if one can go one step further and prove that more
elaborate properties involving induced subgraphs are also testable. One such
generalization of the result of Alon et al. was formulated by Goldreich and
Shinkar who conjectured that for any finite family of graphs ${\cal F}$, and
any linear inequality involving the densities of the graphs $F \in {\cal F}$ in

certain restricted model of graph property testing. Our main result in this

of this type are not testable even in the classical (i.e. unrestricted) model

  The proof deviates significantly from prior non-testability results in this

dark matter self-annihilates, these objects turn into prime targets for
indirect searches, in particular with gamma-ray telescopes. Incidentally, the
Fermi-LAT catalog already contains many unidentified sources that might be
associated with subhalos. In this paper, we determine the probability for
subhalos to be identified as gamma-ray pointlike sources from their predicted
distribution properties. We use a semi-analytical model for the Galactic
subhalo population, which, in contrast to cosmological simulations, can be made
fully consistent with current kinematic constraints in the Milky Way and has no
resolution limit. The model incorporates tidal stripping effects from a
realistic distribution of baryons in the Milky Way. The same baryonic
distribution contributes a diffuse gamma-ray foreground which adds up to that,
often neglected in subhalo searches, generated by the smooth dark matter and
the unresolved subhalos. This configuration implies a correlation between
pointlike subhalo signals and diffuse background. Based on this semi-analytical
modeling, we generate mock gamma-ray data assuming an idealized telescope
resembling Fermi-LAT and perform a likelihood analysis to estimate the current
and future sensitivity to subhalos in the relevant parameter space. We find a
number of detectable subhalos of order ${\cal O}(<1)$ for optimistic model
parameters and a WIMP mass of 100~GeV, maximized for a cored host halo. This
barely provides support to the current interpretation of several Fermi
unidentified sources as subhalos. We also find it more likely to detect the
smooth Galactic halo itself before subhalos, should dark matter in the GeV-TeV

recently proposed a unified approach to handle both issues concurrently using a

submodel has a parametric component while the remaining models are
unrestricted. We show that while their estimating function is MR in theory, the
possibility for multiply robust inference is complicated by the fact that
parametric models for different components of the union model are not variation
independent and therefore the MR property is unlikely to hold in practice. To
address this, we propose an alternative transparent parametrization of the
likelihood function, which makes explicit the model dependencies between
various nuisance functions needed to evaluate the MR efficient score. The
proposed method is genuinely doubly-robust (DR) in that it is consistent and
asymptotic normal if one of two sets of modeling assumptions holds. We evaluate

  International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming",,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The study of phase transition behaviour in SAT has led to deeper
understanding and algorithmic improvements of modern SAT solvers. Motivated by
these prior studies of phase transitions in SAT, we seek to study the behaviour
of size and compile-time behaviour for random k-CNF formulas in the context of
knowledge compilation.
  We perform a rigorous empirical study and analysis of the size and runtime
behavior for different knowledge compilation forms (and their corresponding
compilation algorithms): d-DNNFs, SDDs and OBDDs across multiple tools and
compilation algorithms. We employ instances generated from the random k-CNF
model with varying generation parameters to empirically reason about the
expected and median behavior of size and compilation-time for these languages.
Our work is similar in spirit to the early work in CSP community on phase
transition behavior in SAT/CSP. In a similar spirit, we identify the
interesting behavior with respect to different parameters: clause density and
solution density, a novel control parameter that we identify for the study of
phase transition behavior in the context of knowledge compilation. Furthermore,
we summarize our empirical study in terms of two concrete conjectures; a
rigorous study of these conjectures will possibly require new theoretical
tools.

discretize the system using the numerical schemes of PDOs, deriving
approximately equivariant convolutions (PDO-eConvs). Theoretically, the
approximation error of PDO-eConvs is of the quadratic order. It is the first

Extensive experiments on rotated MNIST and natural image classification show
that PDO-eConvs perform competitively yet use parameters much more efficiently.

skew-symmetry and the tightly nonlinear coupling of the differential operators.
We demonstrate that a symmetry-preserving Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov~(JFNK)
method mimics a balance between convective transport and turbulence
dissipation. We present a wavelet method as an effective symmetry preserving
discretization technique. The symmetry-preserving JFNK method for solving
equations of nonhydrostatic atmospheric flows has been examined using two
benchmark simulations of penetrative convection -- a) dry thermals rising in a
neutrally stratified and stably stratified environment, and b) urban heat
island circulations for effects of the surface heat flux $H_0$ varying in the
range of $25 \le H_0 \le 930$Wm$^{-2}$.The results show that an eddy viscosity
model provides the necessary dissipation of the subgrid-scale modes, while the
symmetry-preserving JFNK method provides the conservation of mass and energy at
a satisfactory level. Comparisons of the results from a laboratory experiment
of heat island circulation and a field measurement of potential temperature
also suggest the modelling accuracy of the present symmetry-preserving JFNK

  Engineering (CASE)",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new generation of automated bin picking systems using deep learning is
evolving to support increasing demand for e-commerce. To accommodate a wide
variety of products, many automated systems include multiple gripper types
and/or tool changers. However, for some objects, sequential grasp failures are
common: when a computed grasp fails to lift and remove the object, the bin is
often left unchanged; as the sensor input is consistent, the system retries the
same grasp over and over, resulting in a significant reduction in mean
successful picks per hour (MPPH). Based on an empirical study of sequential
failures, we characterize a class of ""sequential failure objects"" (SFOs) --
objects prone to sequential failures based on a novel taxonomy. We then propose
three non-Markov picking policies that incorporate memory of past failures to
modify subsequent actions. Simulation experiments on SFO models and the EGAD
dataset suggest that the non-Markov policies significantly outperform the
Markov policy in terms of the sequential failure rate and MPPH. In physical
experiments on 50 heaps of 12 SFOs the most effective Non-Markov policy
increased MPPH over the Dex-Net Markov policy by 107%.

non-integrable/renormalizable. We present a numerical study of the evolution of

implied magnitudes of the frequency glitches are Delta f/f = (9+\-2)E-10 and
Delta f/f = (3.7+/-0.7)E-10, at epochs 2010.9 and 2014.4, respectively. The
updated timing solutions also rule out our previous suggestion of a large
glitch in the frequency derivative fdot. No other canonical pulsar with such a
small spin-down rate (fdot = -1.2E-16 Hz/s) or surface dipole magnetic field
strength (B_s = 9.8E10 G) has been observed to glitch; the glitch activity
parameter of 1E 1207.4-5209 is larger than that of more energetic pulsars.
Alternative parameterizations that do not involve glitches can fit the data,
but they have timing residuals or a second frequency derivative fddot that are
orders of magnitude larger than in pulsars with similar spin-down parameters.
These timing properties of 1E 1207.4-5209 further motivate the leading theory
of central compact objects, that an initial B-field of normal strength was
buried in the neutron star crust by fallback of supernova ejecta, suppressing
the surface dipole field. The slow reemergence of the buried field may be
involved in triggering glitches or excess timing noise.

magnitude of the accessible spin-motion coupling. Here, we show how momentum
can also be transferred perpendicular to a single laser beam due to the
gradient in its transverse profile. By controlling the transverse gradient at
the position of the ion through beam shaping, the relative strength of the
sidebands and carrier can be tuned to optimize the desired interaction and
suppress undesired, off-resonant effects that can degrade gate fidelity. We

thermal equilibrium. Our approach starts from first principles, the ten
different classes of linear and anti-linear state transformations in fermionic
Fock spaces, and symmetries defined via invariance properties of the dynamical
equation for the density matrix. The object of classification are then the
generators of reversible dynamics, dissipation and fluctuations featuring in
the generally irreversible and interacting dynamical equations. A sharp
distinction between the symmetries of equilibrium and out of equilibrium
dynamics, respectively, arises from the different role played by `time' in
these two cases: In unitary quantum mechanics as well as in `micro-reversible'
thermal equilibrium, anti-linear transformations combined with an inversion of
time define time reversal symmetry. However, out of equilibrium an inversion of
time becomes meaningless, while anti--linear transformations in Fock space
remain physically significant, and hence must be considered in autonomy. The
practical consequence of this dichotomy is a novel realization of antilinear
symmetries (six out of the ten fundamental classes) in non-equilibrium quantum
dynamics that is fundamentally different from the established rules of thermal
equilibrium. At large times, the dynamical generators thus symmetry classified
determine the steady state non-equilibrium distributions for arbitrary
interacting systems. To illustrate this principle, we consider the fixation of
a symmetry protected topological phase in a system of interacting lattice
fermions. More generally, we consider the practically important class of mean
field interacting systems, represented by Gaussian states. This class is
naturally described in the language of non-Hermitian matrices, which allows us
to compare to previous classification schemes in the literature.

develop a model of the relative quality of external viewpoints using Gibsonian
affordances. In this approach, viewpoints for the affordances are rated based
on the psychomotor behavior of human operators and clustered into manifolds of

in a study with 31 expert robot operators for 4 affordances (Reachability,

clustered into ranked manifolds using agglomerative hierarchical clustering.
The results show the validity of the affordance-based approach by confirming
that there are manifolds of statistically significantly different viewpoint
values, viewpoint values are statistically significantly dependent on the
affordances, and viewpoint values are independent of a robot. Furthermore, the
best manifold for each affordance provides a statistically significant
improvement with a large Cohen's d effect size (1.1-2.3) in performance

discovery of new attacks leading the way. To take away an attacker's advantage
of reconnaissance, researchers have proposed proactive defense methods such as
Moving Target Defense (MTD). To find good movement strategies, researchers have
modeled MTD as leader-follower games between the defender and a
cyber-adversary. We argue that existing models are inadequate in sequential
settings when there is incomplete information about a rational adversary and
yield sub-optimal movement strategies. Further, while there exists an array of
work on learning defense policies in sequential settings for cyber-security,
they are either unpopular due to scalability issues arising out of incomplete
information or tend to ignore the strategic nature of the adversary simplifying
the scenario to use single-agent reinforcement learning techniques. To address
these concerns, we propose (1) a unifying game-theoretic model, called the
Bayesian Stackelberg Markov Games (BSMGs), that can model uncertainty over
attacker types and the nuances of an MTD system and (2) a Bayesian Strong

crucial application class for hardware optimizations. However, detailed
profiling and characterization of DNN training remains difficult as these
applications often run for hours to days on real hardware. Prior works exploit
the iterative nature of DNNs to profile a few training iterations. While such a
strategy is sound for networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where
the nature of the computation is largely input independent, we observe in this
work that this approach is sub-optimal for sequence-based neural networks
(SQNNs) such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The amount and nature of
computations in SQNNs can vary for each input, resulting in heterogeneity
across iterations. Thus, arbitrarily selecting a few iterations is insufficient
to accurately summarize the behavior of the entire training run. To tackle this
challenge, we carefully study the factors that impact SQNN training iterations
and identify input sequence length as the key determining factor for variations
across iterations. We then use this observation to characterize all iterations
of an SQNN training run (requiring no profiling or simulation of the
application) and select representative iterations, which we term SeqPoints. We
analyze two state-of-the-art SQNNs, DeepSpeech2 and Google's Neural Machine
Translation (GNMT), and show that SeqPoints can represent their entire training
runs accurately, resulting in geomean errors of only 0.11% and 0.53%,
respectively, when projecting overall runtime and 0.13% and 1.50% when
projecting speedups due to architectural changes. This high accuracy is
achieved while reducing the time needed for profiling by 345x and 214x for the
two networks compared to full training runs. As a result, SeqPoint can enable
analysis of SQNN training runs in mere minutes instead of hours or days.

enumerating all the columns is usually unrealistic, such linear programs are
commonly solved by column generation, which is often still computationally
challenging due to the intractability of the subproblem in many applications.
Instead of iteratively introducing one column at a time as in column
generation, our proposed method involves sampling a collection of columns
according to a user-specified randomization scheme and solving the linear
program consisting of the sampled columns. While similar methods for solving
large-scale linear programs by sampling columns (or, equivalently, sampling
constraints in the dual) have been proposed in the literature, in this paper we
derive an upper bound on the optimality gap that holds with high probability.
This bound converges at a rate $1 / \sqrt{K}$, where $K$ is the number of
sampled columns, to the optimality gap of a linear program related to the
sampling distribution. We analyze the gap of this latter linear program, which
we dub the distributional counterpart, and derive conditions under which this

hundred meters per second in the five-minute band at the photosphere, to
amplitudes of several kilometers per second in the three-minute band at the

that applying the DDR in cosmic opacity tests is tricky. Its applicability is
strongly limited because of a non-unique interpretation of the $D_L$ data in

processing techniques. Using the discrete Fourier transform, we decompose the
the electromagnetic field distributions into orthogonal cylindrical modes and
convert the azimuthally varying metasurface constituent parameters into their
respective spectra. Then, by invoking appropriate boundary conditions, we set
up systems of algebraic equations which can be rearranged to either predict the
scattered fields of prespecified metasurfaces, or to synthesize metasurfaces
which support arbitrarily stipulated field transformations. The proposed
framework facilitates the efficient evaluation of field distributions that
satisfy local power conservation, which is one of the key difficulties involved
with the design of passive and lossless scalar metasurfaces. It represents a
promising solution to circumvent the need for active components, controlled
power dissipation, or tensorial surface polarizabilities in many state-of-the
art conformal metasurface-based devices. To demonstrate the robustness and the
versatility of the proposed technique, we design several devices intended for
different applications and numerically verify them using finite element
simulations.

attention from the community thanks to its similarities with the bright black
hole system GRS 1915+105. Both systems exhibit a wide range of highly
structured X-ray variability during outburst, with time scales from few seconds
to tens of minutes, which make them unique in the study of mass accretion in
LMXBs. In this work we present a general overview into the long-term evolution
of IGR J17091-3624, using Swift/XRT observations from the onset of the
2011-2013 outburst in February 2011 to the end of the last bright outburst in
November 2016. We found 4 re-flares during the decay of the 2011 outburst, but
no similar re-flares appear to be present in the latter one. We studied in
detail the period with the lowest flux observed in the last 10 years, just at
the tail end of the 2011-2013 outburst, using Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations. We observed changes in flux as high as a factor of 10 during this
period of relative quiescence, without strong evidence of softening in the
spectra. This result suggests that the source has not been observed at its true
quiescence so far. By comparing the spectral properties at low luminosities of
IGR J17091-3624 and those observed for a well studied population of LMXBs, we
concluded that IGR J17091-3624 is most likely to host a black hole as a compact

signals play a major role in organizing this behavior. There are a number of
experimental observations in these systems which await a comprehensive
explanation. These include: the internal strains are tensile even for clusters
that expand by proliferation; the tractions on the substrate are often confined
to the edges of the cluster; there can exist density waves within the cluster;
clusters can exhibit collective durotaxis when individual cells show no effect;
and for cells in an annulus there is a transition between expanding clusters
with proliferation and the case where cells fill the annulus and rotate around
it. We formulate a mechanical model to examine these effects. We use a
molecular clutch picture which allows ""stalling"" -- inhibition of cell
contraction by external forces. Stalled cells are passive from a physical point
of view and the un-stalled cells are active. By attaching cells to the
substrate and to each other, and taking into account contact inhibition of
locomotion, we get a simple picture for many of these findings as well as
predictions that could be tested.

one of the spatial coordinates, the boundary of these solutions contains two
annulus-like surfaces in addition to the constant-r surface. For these
solutions, we show that these annuli surfaces receive electric, magnetic and
mass/energy fluxes, therefore, they have nontrivial contributions to these

magnetic charge and mass in the $n=0$ case, while $\Phi_e$ and $\Phi_m$ are the
electric and magnetic potentials. The calculated thermodynamic quantities obey
the first law of thermodynamics while the entropy is the area of the horizon.
Furthermore, all these quantities obey Smarr's relation. We show the

the design of the system architecture to achieve high performance in terms of
parallelization, query processing time, aggregation of heterogeneous data types
(e.g., time series, images, structured data, among others), and difficulty in
reproducing scientific research remain a major challenge. This is specifically
true for health sciences research, where the systems must be i) easy to use
with the flexibility to manipulate data at the most granular level, ii)
agnostic of programming language kernel, iii) scalable, and iv) compliant with
the HIPAA privacy law. In this paper, we review the existing literature for
such big data systems for scientific research in health sciences and identify
the gaps of the current system landscape. We propose a novel architecture for
software-hardware-data ecosystem using open source technologies such as Apache
Hadoop, Kubernetes and JupyterHub in a distributed environment. We also
evaluate the system using a large clinical data set of 69M patients.

The experiments are performed with recognized network architectures to show
that the approximate multipliers can produce predictions that are nearly as

outstripping our ability to review them effectively. Unfortunately, I argue
that most, if not all of these publications or commercial algorithms make
several fundamental errors. I argue that because everyone (and therefore every

excels on different types of patients or in different contexts. Consequently,
we should vote many algorithms together, weighted by their overall performance,
their independence from each other, and a set of features that define the
context (i.e., the features that maximally discriminate between the situations
when one algorithm outperforms another). This approach not only provides a
better performing classifier or predictor but provides confidence intervals so
that a clinician can judge how to respond to an alert. Moreover, I argue that a
sufficient number of (mostly) independent algorithms that address the same

orbits over 4.56 Gy. It is calibrated on the current population of the asteroid
belt. The model provides the number of asteroid impacts on different worlds at
any time throughout the solar system history. We combine the results with an
impactor-crater scaling relationship to determine the crater distribution of
Ceres and Vesta and compare these theoretical predictions with observations. We
find that: (i) The Ceres and Vesta chronologies are similar, whereas they
significantly differ from the lunar chronology. Therefore, using the lunar
chronology for main belt asteroids, as often done in previous publications, is
incorrect. (ii) The model results match the number and size distribution of
large (diameter $>90$ km) craters observed on Vesta, but overestimate the
number of large craters on Ceres. This implies that large crater erasure is
required for Ceres. (iii) In a model where planetary migration/instability
happens early, the probability to form the Rheasilvia basin on Vesta during the
last 1 Gy is 10\%, a factor of $\sim1.5$ higher than for the late instability
case and $\sim2.5$ times higher than found in previous studies. Thus, while the
formation of the Rheasilvia at $\sim1$ Gy ago (Ga) would be somewhat unusual,
it cannot be ruled out at more than $\simeq1.5\sigma$. In broader context, our
work provides a self-consistent framework for modeling asteroid crater records.

dominated by four cold flows, termed Big, Little, Up and Down. If we are
outside the tricusp cross-section the dark matter density on Earth is dominated

functionality of the chip is recovered once it is programmed with the secret

past decade, different attacks have been proposed to break logic locking,
simultaneously motivating researchers to develop more secure countermeasures.
In this paper, we propose a novel stuck-at fault-based differential fault
analysis (DFA) attack, which can be used to break logic locking that relies on
a stored secret key. This proposed attack is based on self-referencing, where
the secret key is determined by injecting faults in the key lines and comparing
the response with its fault-free counterpart. A commercial ATPG tool can be
used to generate test patterns that detect these faults, which will be used in
DFA to determine the secret key. One test pattern is sufficient to determine
one key bit, which results in at most |K| test patterns to determine the entire
secret key of size |K|. The proposed attack is generic and can be extended to

this purpose, the data-processing program is supposed to be open to the owner,
so its functionality can be evaluated before trust can be established. However,
increasingly there are application scenarios in which the program itself needs

  To this end, this paper presents CAT, a new model for TEE-based confidential
attestation. Our model is inspired by Proof-Carrying Code, where a code
generator produces proof together with the code and a code consumer verifies
the proof against the code on its compliance with security policies. Given that
the conventional solutions do not work well under the resource-limited and
TCB-frugal TEE, we propose a new design that allows an untrusted out-enclave

Our design strategically moves most of the workload to the code generator,

keeping the consumer simple. Also, the whole consumer can be made public and
verified through a conventional attestation. We implemented this model on Intel

routine biomolecular applications, there have been growing demands on
developing polarizable force fields for handling more complicated biomolecular
processes. Here we focus on a recently proposed polarizable Gaussian Multipole
(pGM) model for biomolecular simulations. A key benefit of pGM is its screening
of all short-range electrostatic interactions in a physically consistent
manner, which is critical for stable charge-fitting and is needed to reproduce
molecular anisotropy. Another advantage of pGM is that each atom's multipoles
are represented by a single Gaussian function or its derivatives, allowing for
more efficient electrostatics than other Gaussian-based models. In this study
we present an efficient formulation for the pGM model defined with respect to a
local frame formed with a set of covalent basis vectors. The covalent basis
vectors are chosen to be along each atom's covalent bonding directions. The new
local frame allows molecular flexibility during molecular simulations and
facilitates an efficient formulation of analytical electrostatic forces without
explicit torque computation. Subsequent numerical tests show that analytical
atomic forces agree excellently with numerical finite-difference forces for the
tested system. Finally, the new pGM electrostatics algorithm is interfaced with
the PME implementation in Amber for molecular simulations under the periodic
boundary conditions. To validate the overall pGM/PME electrostatics, we
conducted an NVE simulation for a small water box of 512 water molecules. Our

combined with other genetic and environmental factors, is vital for developing
new superior crop species that help feed the world's growing population. Recent
advances in machine learning, in particular deep learning, have shown promise
in mitigating this bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning
method for counting on-ear corn kernels in-field to aid in the gathering of
real-time data and, ultimately, to improve decision making to maximize yield.
We name this approach DeepCorn, and show that this framework is robust under
various conditions. DeepCorn estimates the density of corn kernels in an image
of corn ears and predicts the number of kernels based on the estimated density
map. DeepCorn uses a truncated VGG-16 as a backbone for feature extraction and
merges feature maps from multiple scales of the network to make it robust
against image scale variations. We also adopt a semi-supervised learning
approach to further improve the performance of our proposed method. Our
proposed method achieves the MAE and RMSE of 41.36 and 60.27 in the corn kernel
counting task, respectively. Our experimental results demonstrate the
superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other

to only require fractional routability of the selected demands (the
all-or-nothing flow setting). For the general form (no congestion, general

for augmented samples. To this end, we propose a novel semantic data
augmentation algorithm to complement traditional approaches. The proposed
method is inspired by the intriguing property that deep networks are effective
in learning linearized features, i.e., certain directions in the deep feature
space correspond to meaningful semantic transformations, e.g., changing the
background or view angle of an object. Based on this observation, translating
training samples along many such directions in the feature space can
effectively augment the dataset for more diversity. To implement this idea, we
first introduce a sampling based method to obtain semantically meaningful
directions efficiently. Then, an upper bound of the expected cross-entropy (CE)
loss on the augmented training set is derived by assuming the number of
augmented samples goes to infinity, yielding a highly efficient algorithm. In
fact, we show that the proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA)
algorithm amounts to minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds minimal
extra computational cost to a normal training procedure. In addition to
supervised learning, ISDA can be applied to semi-supervised learning tasks
under the consistency regularization framework, where ISDA amounts to
minimizing the upper bound of the expected KL-divergence between the augmented
features and the original features. Although being simple, ISDA consistently
improves the generalization performance of popular deep models (e.g., ResNets
and DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN,
ImageNet, and Cityscapes.

designs for the considered spectrum sharing problem by maximizing the output
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the radar receiver while
maintaining certain communication throughput and power constraints. The first
is a joint design where the subchannel powers of both the radar and
communication systems are jointly optimized. Since the resulting problem is
highly nonconvex, we introduce a reformulation by combining the power variables
of both systems into a single stacked variable, which allows us to bypass a
conventional computationally intensive alternating optimization procedure. The
resulting problem is then solved via a quadratic transform method along with a
sequential convex programming (SCP) technique. The second is a unilateral
design which optimizes the radar transmission power with fixed communication
power. The unilateral design is suitable for cases where the communication
system pre-exists while the radar occasionally joins the channel as a secondary

procedure. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed joint and unilateral designs in comparison with a subcarrier

three types of odometer measurement models in the INS/OD integrated system.
Specifically, in the pulse velocity model, a preliminary Kalman filter is
designed to obtain accurate vehicle velocity from the accumulated pulses; the
pulse increment model is accordingly obtained by integrating the pulse
velocity; a new pulse accumulation model is proposed by augmenting the
travelled distance into the system state. The three types of measurements,
along with the nonhonolomic constraint (NHC), are implemented in the standard

characteristics, the multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) approach is
exploited to further enhance the performance. Simulations and long-distance

proposed methods. It is shown that the standard pulse velocity measurement
achieves the superior performance, whereas the accumulated pulse measurement is
most favorable with the MMAE enhancement.

edges arrive over time. When an edge $e_t = (u_t, v_t)$ arrives at time step
$t$, the algorithm must orient the edge either as $v_t \rightarrow u_t$ or $u_t
\rightarrow v_t$, with the objective of minimizing the maximum discrepancy of
any vertex, i.e., the absolute difference between its in-degree and out-degree.
Edges correspond to pairs of persons wanting to ride together, and orienting
denotes designating the driver. The discrepancy objective then corresponds to
every person driving close to their fair share of rides they participate in.
  In this paper, we design efficient algorithms which can maintain
polylog$(n,T)$ maximum discrepancy (w.h.p) over any sequence of $T$ arrivals,
when the arriving edges are sampled independently and uniformly from any given
graph $G$. This provides the first polylogarithmic bounds for the online
(stochastic) carpooling problem. Prior to this work, the best known bounds were
$O(\sqrt{n \log n})$-discrepancy for any adversarial sequence of arrivals, or
$O(\log\!\log n)$-discrepancy bounds for the stochastic arrivals when $G$ is
the complete graph.
  The technical crux of our paper is in showing that the simple greedy
algorithm, which has provably good discrepancy bounds when the arriving edges
are drawn uniformly at random from the complete graph, also has polylog
discrepancy when $G$ is an expander graph. We then combine this with known
expander-decomposition results to design our overall algorithm.

reachability analysis. However, testing reachability from a root set is
inadequate for determining whether an actor is garbage because an unreachable
actor may send a message to a reachable actor. Instead, it is sufficient to
check termination (sometimes also called quiescence): an actor is terminated if
it is not currently processing a message and cannot receive a message in the
future. Moreover, many actor frameworks provide all actors with access to file
I/O or external storage; without inspecting an actor's internal code, it is
necessary to check that the actor has terminated to ensure that it may be
garbage collected in these frameworks. Previous algorithms to detect actor
garbage require coordination mechanisms such as causal message delivery or
nonlocal monitoring of actors for mutation. Such coordination mechanisms
adversely affect concurrency and are therefore expensive in distributed
systems. We present a low-overhead reference listing technique (called DRL) for
termination detection in actor systems. DRL is based on asynchronous local
snapshots and message-passing between actors. This enables a decentralized
implementation and transient network partition tolerance. The paper provides a
formal description of DRL, shows that all actors identified as garbage have
indeed terminated (safety), and that all terminated actors--under certain
reasonable assumptions--will eventually be identified (liveness).

which aims to parse a video into temporal event segments and label them as
either audible, visible, or both. Such a problem is essential for a complete
understanding of the scene depicted inside a video. To facilitate exploration,
we collect a Look, Listen, and Parse (LLP) dataset to investigate audio-visual
video parsing in a weakly-supervised manner. This task can be naturally
formulated as a Multimodal Multiple Instance Learning (MMIL) problem.
Concretely, we propose a novel hybrid attention network to explore unimodal and
cross-modal temporal contexts simultaneously. We develop an attentive MMIL
pooling method to adaptively explore useful audio and visual content from
different temporal extent and modalities. Furthermore, we discover and mitigate
modality bias and noisy label issues with an individual-guided learning
mechanism and label smoothing technique, respectively. Experimental results
show that the challenging audio-visual video parsing can be achieved even with
only video-level weak labels. Our proposed framework can effectively leverage
unimodal and cross-modal temporal contexts and alleviate modality bias and
noisy labels problems.

combination of the information contained in the data and the information
contributed by the model, quantifying the contribution of the model relative to
the information in the data is often non-trivial. Here, we provide a measure of
the contribution of the BYM framework by first considering the simple
Poisson-gamma setting in which quantifying the prior's contribution is quite
clear. We then propose a relationship between gamma and lognormal priors that
we then extend to cover the framework proposed by BYM. Following a brief
simulation study in which we illustrate the accuracy of our lognormal
approximation of the gamma prior, we analyze a dataset comprised of
county-level heart disease-related death data across the United States. In
addition to demonstrating the potential for the BYM framework to correspond to
a highly informative prior specification, we also illustrate the sensitivity of
death rate estimates to changes in the informativeness of the BYM framework.

problem, federated learning has been emerging as a new paradigm of machine
learning. Federated learning tends to utilize various privacy preserving
mechanisms to protect the transferred intermediate data, among which
homomorphic encryption strikes a balance between security and ease of
utilization. However, the complicated operations and large operands impose
significant overhead on federated learning. Maintaining accuracy and security
more efficiently has been a key problem of federated learning. In this work, we
investigate a hardware solution, and design an FPGA-based homomorphic
encryption framework, aiming to accelerate the training phase in federated
learning. The root complexity lies in searching for a compact architecture for
the core operation of homomorphic encryption, to suit the requirement of
federated learning about high encryption throughput and flexibility of
configuration. Our framework implements the representative Paillier homomorphic
cryptosystem with high level synthesis for flexibility and portability, with
careful optimization on the modular multiplication operation in terms of

achieves a near-optimal execution clock cycle, with a better DSP-efficiency

technology. Especially, an estimation of the energy gap between a ground state
and excited state of a target Hamiltonian corresponding to a molecule is
essential. In the previous approach, an energy of the ground state and that of
the excited state are estimated separately, and the energy gap can be
calculated from the subtraction between them. Here, we propose a direct
estimation of the energy gap between the ground state and excited state of the
target Hamiltonian with quantum annealing. The key idea is to combine a Ramsey
type measurement with the quantum annealing. This provides an oscillating
signal with a frequency of the energy gap, and a Fourier transform of the
signal let us know the energy gap. Based on typical parameters of
superconducting qubits, we numerically investigate the performance of our
scheme when we estimate an energy gap between the ground state and first
excited state of the Hamiltonian. We show robustness against non-adiabatic
transitions between the ground state and first-excited state. Our results pave
a new way to estimate the energy gap of the Hamiltonian for quantum chemistry.

based on deep imaging from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS).
Applying a new definition for the UDG class based on galaxy scaling relations,
we define samples of 44 and 26 UDGs using expansive and restrictive selection
criteria, respectively. Our UDG sample includes objects that are significantly
fainter than previously known UDGs: i.e., more than half are fainter than
$\langle\mu\rangle_e \sim27.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The UDGs in Virgo's core
region show some evidence for being structurally distinct from ""normal"" dwarf
galaxies, but this separation disappears when considering the full sample of
galaxies throughout the cluster. UDGs are more centrally concentrated in their
spatial distribution than other Virgo galaxies of similar luminosity, while
their morphologies demonstrate that at least some UDGs owe their diffuse nature
to physical processes---such as tidal interactions or low-mass mergers---that
are at play within the cluster environment. The globular cluster (GC) systems
of Virgo UDGs have a wide range in specific frequency ($S_N$), with a higher
mean $S_N$ than ""normal"" Virgo dwarfs, but a lower mean $S_N$ than Coma UDGs at
fixed luminosity. Their GCs are predominantly blue, with a small contribution
from red clusters in the more massive UDGs. The combined GC luminosity function
is consistent with those observed in dwarf galaxies, showing no evidence of
being anomalously luminous. The diversity in their morphologies and their GC
properties suggests no single process has given rise to all objects within the
UDG class. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that UDGs are simply
those systems that occupy the extended tails of the galaxy size and surface
brightness distributions.

mitigate membership inference (MI) attack. However, in this work, we challenge
this observation by proposing new MI attacks to utilize the information of
augmented data. MI attack is widely used to measure the model's information
leakage of the training set. We establish the optimal membership inference when
the model is trained with augmented data, which inspires us to formulate the MI
attack as a set classification problem, i.e., classifying a set of augmented
instances instead of a single data point, and design input permutation
invariant features. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed approach
universally outperforms original methods when the model is trained with data
augmentation. Even further, we show that the proposed approach can achieve
higher MI attack success rates on models trained with some data augmentation
than the existing methods on models trained without data augmentation. Notably,
we achieve a 70.1% MI attack success rate on CIFAR10 against a wide residual
network while the previous best approach only attains 61.9%. This suggests the
privacy risk of models trained with data augmentation could be largely
underestimated.

produce workload-specific scheduling strategies that focus on long-term
performance benefits while being adaptive to previously-unseen data access

that learned schedulers can offer significant performance improvements over
hand-crafted scheduling heuristics. Ultimately, we make the case that this is a

system reliability. Therefore, power utilities are often interested in
identifying the maximum IBR penetration limit for their system. The proposed
research presents a methodology to identify the IBR penetration threshold
beyond which voltage, frequency, and tie-line limits will be exceeded. The
sensitivity of the IBR penetration threshold to momentary cessation due to low
voltages, transmission versus distribution connected solar generation, and
stalling of induction motors are also analyzed. Dynamic simulation studies
conducted on a 24,000-bus model of the Western Interconnection (WI) demonstrate
the practicality of the proposed approach.

objective is to accurately classify initial correspondences obtained by
matching local geometric descriptors into inliers and outliers. Although the
spatial distribution of correspondences is irregular, inliers are expected to
be geometrically compatible with each other. Based on such observation, we
propose a novel representation for 3D correspondences, dubbed compatibility
feature (CF), to describe the consistencies within inliers and inconsistencies
within outliers. CF consists of top-ranked compatibility scores of a candidate
to other correspondences, which purely relies on robust and rotation-invariant
geometric constraints. We then formulate the grouping problem as a
classification problem for CF features, which is accomplished via a simple
multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. Comparisons with nine state-of-the-art
methods on four benchmarks demonstrate that: 1) CF is distinctive, robust, and
rotation-invariant; 2) our CF-based method achieves the best overall
performance and holds good generalization ability.

generalization approaches mainly focused on learning invariant features and
stacking the learned features from each source domain to generalize to a new
target domain while ignoring the label information, which will lead to
indistinguishable features with an ambiguous classification boundary. For this,
one possible solution is to constrain the label-similarity when extracting the
invariant features and to take advantage of the label similarities for
class-specific cohesion and separation of features across domains. Therefore we
adopt optimal transport with Wasserstein distance, which could constrain the
class label similarity, for adversarial training and also further deploy a
metric learning objective to leverage the label information for achieving
distinguishable classification boundary. Empirical results show that our
proposed method could outperform most of the baselines. Furthermore, ablation

the difference of the second-order dispersion between two optical paths of the

curve must be only determined by the intrinsic indistinguishability between the

between Feynman paths; (2) unbalanced dispersion effect in two paths cannot be
cancelled and will broaden the interference curve thus providing a way to
measure the second-order dispersion coefficient. Our results suggest a more

integration of virtualized servers into networks and brings cloud services
closer to end devices. In contrast to the cloud server, the computing capacity
of fog nodes is limited and thus a single fog node might not be capable of
computing-intensive tasks. In this context, task offloading can be particularly
useful at the fog nodes by selecting the suitable nodes and proper resource
management while guaranteeing the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of the
users. This paper studies the design of a joint task offloading and resource
allocation control for heterogeneous service tasks in multi-fog nodes systems.
This problem is formulated as a partially observable stochastic game, in which
each fog node cooperates to maximize the aggregated local rewards while the
nodes only have access to local observations. To deal with partial
observability, we apply a deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) approach to
approximate the optimal value functions. The solution is then compared to a
deep Q-network (DQN) and deep convolutional Q-network (DCQN) approach to
evaluate the performance of different neural networks. Moreover, to guarantee
the convergence and accuracy of the neural network, an adjusted
exploration-exploitation method is adopted. Provided numerical results show

Enthusiasm for the development of effective statistical inference procedures
for quantiles and their functions has been high for the past decade. In this
article, we study inference methods for quantiles when multiple samples from
linked populations are available. The research problems we consider have a wide
range of applications. For example, to study the evolution of the economic
status of a country, economists monitor changes in the quantiles of annual
household incomes, based on multiple survey datasets collected annually. Even
with multiple samples, a routine approach would estimate the quantiles of
different populations separately. Such approaches ignore the fact that these
populations are linked and share some intrinsic latent structure. Recently,
many researchers have advocated the use of the density ratio model (DRM) to
account for this latent structure and have developed more efficient procedures
based on pooled data. The nonparametric empirical likelihood (EL) is
subsequently employed. Interestingly, there has been no discussion in this
context of the EL-based likelihood ratio test (ELRT) for population quantiles.
We explore the use of the ELRT for hypotheses concerning quantiles and
confidence regions under the DRM. We show that the ELRT statistic has a
chi-square limiting distribution under the null hypothesis. Simulation
experiments show that the chi-square distributions approximate the
finite-sample distributions well and lead to accurate tests and confidence
regions. The DRM helps to improve statistical efficiency. We also give a

recent methods for image matching resort to deeply stacked convolutional
layers. These models, however, are both monolithic and static in the sense that
they typically use a specific level of features, e.g., the output of the last
layer, and adhere to it regardless of the images to match. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach to visual correspondence that dynamically composes
effective features by leveraging relevant layers conditioned on the images to
match. Inspired by both multi-layer feature composition in object detection and
adaptive inference architectures in classification, the proposed method, dubbed
Dynamic Hyperpixel Flow, learns to compose hypercolumn features on the fly by
selecting a small number of relevant layers from a deep convolutional neural
network. We demonstrate the effectiveness on the task of semantic
correspondence, i.e., establishing correspondences between images depicting
different instances of the same object or scene category. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that the proposed method greatly improves matching
performance over the state of the art in an adaptive and efficient manner.

invariant to moderate translation but not to rotation in image classification.
This paper proposes a deep CNN model, called CyCNN, which exploits polar
mapping of input images to convert rotation to translation. To deal with the
cylindrical property of the polar coordinates, we replace convolution layers in
conventional CNNs to cylindrical convolutional (CyConv) layers. A CyConv layer
exploits the cylindrically sliding windows (CSW) mechanism that vertically
extends the input-image receptive fields of boundary units in a convolutional
layer. We evaluate CyCNN and conventional CNN models for classification tasks
on rotated MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets. We show that if there is no data
augmentation during training, CyCNN significantly improves classification
accuracies when compared to conventional CNN models. Our implementation of

systems imposes many challenges on direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. Most
conventional scenarios assume that the far-field planar wavefronts hold. In
this paper, we investigate the DoA estimation problem in short-range MIMO
communications, where the effect of near-field spherical wave is
non-negligible. By converting it into a regression task, a novel DoA estimation
framework based on complex-valued deep learning (CVDL) is proposed for the
near-field region in short-range MIMO communication systems. Under the
assumption of a spherical wave model, the array steering vector is determined
by both the distance and the direction. However, solving this regression task
containing a massive number of variables is challenging, since datasets need to
capture numerous complicated feature representations. To overcome this, a
virtual covariance matrix (VCM) based on received signals is constructed, and
thus such features extracted from the VCM can deal with the complicated
coupling relationship between the direction and the distance. Although the
emergence of wireless big data driven by future communication networks promotes
deep learning-based wireless signal processing, the learning algorithms of
complex-valued signals are still ongoing. This paper proposes a one-dimensional
(1-D) residual network that can directly tackle complex-valued features due to
the inherent 1-D structure of signal subspace vectors. In addition, we put
forth a cropped VCM based policy which can be applied to different antenna
sizes. The proposed method is able to fully exploit the complex-valued
information. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
CVDL approach over the baseline schemes in terms of the accuracy of DoA
estimation.

However, such systems showing similar non-equilibrium magnetic response can be

Canonical spin glass is the most well studied member of this class and has been
extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically over the last
five decades. In canonical spin glasses, the low temperature magnetic state
obtained by cooling across the spin glass transition temperature in presence of
an applied magnetic field is known as the field cooled (FC) state. This FC
state in canonical spin glass is widely believed as an equilibrium state
arising out of a thermodynamic second order phase transition. Here, we show
that the FC state in canonical spin glass is not really an equilibrium state of
the system. We report careful dc magnetization and ac susceptibility
measurements on two canonical spin glass systems, AuMn (1.8%) and AgMn (1.1%).
The dc magnetization in the FC state shows clear temperature dependence. In
addition, the magnetization shows a distinct thermal hysteresis in the
temperature regime below the spin glass transition temperature. On the other
hand, the temperature dependence of ac susceptibility has clear frequency
dispersion below spin glass transition in the FC state prepared by cooling the
sample in the presence of a dc-bias field. We further distinguish the
metastable response of the FC state of canonical spin glass from the metastable
response the FC state in an entirely different class of glassy magnetic system
namely magnetic glass, where the non-equilibrium behavior is associated with
the kinetic-arrest of a first order magnetic phase transition.

higher frequency band such as the mmWave band. In this chapter, IoT based CR
network in uplink communication is proposed alongside employing NOMA techniques
for optimal throughput, and energy efficiency for a medical infrastructure.
Numerical results show that effectual throughput and energy efficiency for a
High Reliable Communication (HRC) device and Moderate Reliable Communication
(MRC) device improve over 83.13% and 73.95%, respectively and their
corresponding energy efficacy values show vast improvement (83.11% and 73.96%
respectively). Likewise, for interference case both the throughput and the
energy efficiency improve approximately over 93% for all devices.

  Logical Analysis of Data",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prevention of cyber attacks on the critical network resources has become an
important issue as the traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are no
longer effective due to the high volume of network traffic and the deceptive
patterns of network usage employed by the attackers. Lack of sufficient amount
of labeled observations for the training of IDSs makes the semi-supervised IDSs
a preferred choice. We propose a semi-supervised IDS by extending a data
analysis technique known as Logical Analysis of Data, or LAD in short, which
was proposed as a supervised learning approach. LAD uses partially defined
Boolean functions (pdBf) and their extensions to find the positive and the
negative patterns from the past observations for classification of future
observations. We extend the LAD to make it semi-supervised to design an IDS.
The proposed SSIDS consists of two phases: offline and online. The offline
phase builds the classifier by identifying the behavior patterns of normal and
abnormal network usage. Later, these patterns are transformed into rules for
classification and the rules are used during the online phase for the detection
of abnormal network behaviors. The performance of the proposed SSIDS is far
better than the existing semi-supervised IDSs and comparable with the
supervised IDSs as evident from the experimental results.

paramount importance when making decisions with societal impacts such as
transport control, financial activities, and medical diagnosis. While current
model interpretation methodologies focus on using locally linear functions to
approximate the models or creating self-explanatory models that give
explanations to each input instance, they do not focus on model interpretation
at the subpopulation level, which is the understanding of model interpretations
across different subset aggregations in a dataset. To address the challenges of
providing explanations of an ML model across the whole dataset, we propose
SUBPLEX, a visual analytics system to help users understand black-box model
explanations with subpopulation visual analysis. SUBPLEX is designed through an
iterative design process with machine learning researchers to address three
usage scenarios of real-life machine learning tasks: model debugging, feature
selection, and bias detection. The system applies novel subpopulation analysis
on ML model explanations and interactive visualization to explore the
explanations on a dataset with different levels of granularity. Based on the
system, we conduct user evaluation to assess how understanding the
interpretation at a subpopulation level influences the sense-making process of
interpreting ML models from a user's perspective. Our results suggest that by
providing model explanations for different groups of data, SUBPLEX encourages
users to generate more ingenious ideas to enrich the interpretations. It also
helps users to acquire a tight integration between programming workflow and
visual analytics workflow. Last but not least, we summarize the considerations
observed in applying visualization to machine learning interpretations.

matter could exist inside the cores of neutron stars above 2.0 solar masses
($M_{\odot}$)~\cite{Annala:2019puf}. We revisit the holographic model in
Ref.~\cite{bch, bhp} and implement the equation of states~(EoS) of multiquark
nuclear matter to interpolate the pQCD EoS in the high-density region with the
nuclear EoS known at low densities. For sufficiently large energy density
scale~($\epsilon_{s}$) of the model, it is found that multiquark phase is

fractional polarization of thermal dust emission first increases with the grain
temperature and then decreases once the grain temperature exceeds $\simeq$
25-32 K. The latter trend differs from the prediction of the popular RAdiative
Torques (RATs) alignment theory which implies a monotonic increase of the
polarization fraction with the grain temperature. We perform numerical modeling
of polarized dust emission for the $\rho$ Oph-A cloud and calculate the degree
of dust polarization by simultaneously considering the dust grain alignment and
rotational disruption by RATs. Our modeling results could successfully
reproduce both the rising and declining trends of the observational data.
Moreover, we show that the alignment of only silicate grains or a mixture of
silicate-carbon grains within a composite structure can reproduce the
observational trends, assuming that all dust grains follow a power-law size
distribution. Although there are a number of simplifications and limitations to
our modeling, our results suggest grains in $\rho$ Oph-A cloud have a composite

generalizes and improves upon the previous results of Bansal, Jiang, Singla,

$\|v_t\|_2\leq 1$ for each $t$, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(1)$

$\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ bound. For Tusn\'{a}dy's problem of minimizing the
discrepancy of axis-aligned boxes, we obtain an $O(\log^{d+4} T)$ bound for
arbitrary distribution over points. Previous techniques only worked for product

Banaszczyk setting, where given a symmetric convex body $K$ with Gaussian
measure at least $1/2$, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(1)$ discrepancy with
respect to the norm given by $K$ for input distributions with sub-exponential
tails.
  Our key idea is to introduce a potential that also enforces constraints on
how the discrepancy vector evolves, allowing us to maintain certain
anti-concentration properties. For the Banaszczyk setting, we further enhance
this potential by combining it with ideas from generic chaining. Finally, we
also extend these results to the setting of online multi-color discrepancy.

completion problem from partial and noisy observations for third-order tensors.
Because of sparsity and nonnegativity, the underlying tensor is decomposed into
the tensor-tensor product of one sparse nonnegative tensor and one nonnegative
tensor. We propose to minimize the sum of the maximum likelihood estimation for
the observations with nonnegativity constraints and the tensor $\ell_0$ norm
for the sparse factor. We show that the error bounds of the estimator of the
proposed model can be established under general noise observations. The
detailed error bounds under specific noise distributions including additive
Gaussian noise, additive Laplace noise, and Poisson observations can be
derived. Moreover, the minimax lower bounds are shown to be matched with the
established upper bounds up to a logarithmic factor of the sizes of the
underlying tensor. These theoretical results for tensors are better than those
obtained for matrices, and this illustrates the advantage of the use of
nonnegative sparse tensor models for completion and denoising. Numerical
experiments are provided to validate the superiority of the proposed
tensor-based method compared with the matrix-based approach.

audios and videos which contain audio and/or visual modalities. To address the
extended speech separation problem, we introduce a large-scale dataset named
Sign Language News Speech (SLNSpeech) dataset in which three modalities of
audio, visual, and sign language are coexisted. Then, we design a general deep
learning network for the self-supervised learning of three modalities,
particularly, using sign language embeddings together with audio or
audio-visual information for better solving the speech separation task.
Specifically, we use 3D residual convolutional network to extract sign language
features and use pretrained VGGNet model to exact visual features. After that,
an improved U-Net with skip connections in feature extraction stage is applied
for learning the embeddings among the mixed spectrogram transformed from source
audios, the sign language features and visual features. Experiments results
show that, besides visual modality, sign language modality can also be used
alone to supervise speech separation task. Moreover, we also show the
effectiveness of sign language assisted speech separation when the visual

video-level labels, i.e. person identities who appear in the video, in contrast
to the more precise framelevel annotations. Towards this goal, we propose a
multiple instance attention learning framework for person re-identification
using such video-level labels. Specifically, we first cast the video person
re-identification task into a multiple instance learning setting, in which
person images in a video are collected into a bag. The relations between videos
with similar labels can be utilized to identify persons, on top of that, we
introduce a co-person attention mechanism which mines the similarity
correlations between videos with person identities in common. The attention
weights are obtained based on all person images instead of person tracklets in
a video, making our learned model less affected by noisy annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the related
methods on two weakly labeled person re-identification datasets.

aperiodically ordered geometries have shown the existence of certain critical
parameter regimes where this conventional wisdom is upended, as the optical
response of finite-size samples may depart considerably from the predictions of
standard effective-medium theory. In these regimes, characterized by a mixed
evanescent/propagating light transport, different classes of spatial (dis)order
have been shown to induce distinctive effects in the optical response, in terms
of anomalous transmission, localization, enhancement, absorption and lasing.
Here, we further expand these examples by considering a quasiperiodic scenario
based on a modified-Fibonacci geometry. Among the intriguing features of this
model there is the presence of a scale parameter that controls the transition
from perfectly periodic to quasiperiodic scenarios of different shades. Via an
extensive parametric study, this allows us to identify the
quasiperiodicity-induced anomalous effects, and to elucidate certain
distinctive mechanisms and footprints. Our results hold potentially interesting
implications for the optical probing of structural features at a resolution
much smaller than the wavelength, and could also be leveraged to design novel
types of absorbers and low-threshold lasers.

bias within MT responses of a flat earth and spherical earth. Apparent
resistivity and phases are calculated by setting the time period and

performance of MANN for long temporal sequence data. To address these problems,
here we introduce a novel Distributed Associative Memory architecture (DAM)
with Memory Refreshing Loss (MRL) which enhances the relation reasoning
performance of MANN. Inspired by how the human brain works, our framework
encodes data with distributed representation across multiple memory blocks and
repeatedly refreshes the contents for enhanced memorization similar to the
rehearsal process of the brain. For this procedure, we replace a single
external memory with a set of multiple smaller associative memory blocks and
update these sub-memory blocks simultaneously and independently for the
distributed representation of input data. Moreover, we propose MRL which
assists a task's target objective while learning relational information
existing in data. MRL enables MANN to reinforce an association between input
data and task objective by reproducing stochastically sampled input data from
stored memory contents. With this procedure, MANN further enriches the stored
representations with relational information. In experiments, we apply our
approaches to Differential Neural Computer (DNC), which is one of the
representative content-based addressing memory models and achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on both memorization and relational reasoning

challenging. Herein, we propose a machine-learning architecture to rapidly but
reasonably predict electronic density of states (DOS) patterns of metallic NPs
via a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and the crystal graph
convolutional neural network (CGCNN). By applying PCA, one can convert a
mathematically high-dimensional DOS image to a low-dimensional vector. The
CGCNN plays a key role in reflecting the effects of local atomic structures on
the DOS patterns of NPs with only a few of material features (e.g., melting
temperature, the number of d electrons, and atomic radius) that are easily
obtained from a periodic table. The PCA-CGCNN model is applicable for all pure
and bimetallic NPs, in which a handful DOS training sets that are easily
obtained with the typical DFT method, such as bulk, slab, and small-sized NPs,
are considered. Although there is a small loss of accuracy with the PCA-CGCNN
method compared to DFT calculations, the prediction speed is much faster than
that of DFT methods and is not nearly as affected by the system sizes of NPs.
Our approach not only can be immediately applied to predict electronic
structures of actual nanometer scaled NPs to be experimentally synthesized, but
also be used to explore correlations between atomic structures and other
spectrum image data of the materials (e.g., X-ray diffraction, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy).

extrapolations from magnetogram observations over Solar Cycle 24, as well as
for a simple illustrative model of a single bipolar region in a dipolar

primarily from linking between strong active regions and their overlying field,
so that the total unsigned helicity correlates with the product of photospheric
and open fluxes. Within each active region, positive and negative helicity may
be unbalanced, but the signed helicity is only around a tenth of the unsigned
helicity. Interestingly, in Cycle 24, there is a notable peak in unsigned
helicity caused by a single large active region. On average, the total unsigned
helicity at the resolution considered is approximately twice the typical signed
helicity of a single real active region, according to non-potential models in

network monitoring in large-scale IoT networks by per-flow sampling, wherein
the controller keeps track of all the active flows in the network and samples
the IoT devices on each flow path to collect real-time flow statistics. There
is a tradeoff between the controller's sampling preference and the balancing of
loads among devices. On the one hand, the controller may prefer to sample some
of the IoT devices on the flow path because they yield more accurate flow
statistics. On the other hand, it is desirable to sample the devices uniformly
so that their energy consumptions and lifespan are balanced. This paper
formulates the flow sampling problem in large-scale SDIoT networks by means of
a Markov decision process and devises policies that strike a good balance
between these two goals. Three classes of policies are investigated: the
optimal policy, the state-independent policies, and the index policies
(including the Whittle index and a second-order index policies). The
second-order index policy is the most desired policy among all: 1) in terms of
performance, it is on an equal footing with the Whittle index policy, and
outperforms the state-independent policies by much; 2) in terms of complexity,
it is much simpler than the optimal policy, and is comparable to
state-independent policies and the Whittle index policy; 3) in terms of
realizability, it requires no prior information on the network dynamics, hence
is much easier to implement in practice.

active topic in the fields of vision and language. However, existing methods
tend to yield overly general captions and consist of some of the most frequent

Figure 1). This is primarily due to (i) the conservative characteristic of
traditional training objectives that drives the model to generate correct but
hardly discriminative captions for similar images and (ii) the uneven word
distribution of the ground-truth captions, which encourages generating highly
frequent words/phrases while suppressing the less frequent but more concrete

is faced with a challenge that these models are often applied as a ""black-box"".
This has led to an increased interest in interpretable machine learning, where
post hoc interpretation presents a useful mechanism for generating
interpretations of complex learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach underpinned by an extended framework of Bayesian networks for
generating post hoc interpretations of a black-box predictive model. The
framework supports extracting a Bayesian network as an approximation of the
black-box model for a specific prediction. Compared to the existing post hoc
interpretation methods, the contribution of our approach is three-fold.
Firstly, the extracted Bayesian network, as a probabilistic graphical model,
can provide interpretations about not only what input features but also why
these features contributed to a prediction. Secondly, for complex decision
problems with many features, a Markov blanket can be generated from the
extracted Bayesian network to provide interpretations with a focused view on
those input features that directly contributed to a prediction. Thirdly, the
extracted Bayesian network enables the identification of four different rules
which can inform the decision-maker about the confidence level in a prediction,
thus helping the decision-maker assess the reliability of predictions learned
by a black-box model. We implemented the proposed approach, applied it in the
context of two well-known public datasets and analysed the results, which are
made available in an open-source repository.

the quantum criticality of the curvature function near a topological phase

photodetector is excited by the optical cavity modes and drives the current
flow as a function of incident light drives the Varactor diode at which the

momentum diffusion coefficients, and spatial diffusion coefficient. At the
minimum location $k_0$ of the dispersion relation, where the velocity vanishes,
$F(k)$ varies linearly with velocity with an isotropic friction coefficient; if
$k_0=0$, the momentum diffusion is also isotropic and $F(k_0)=0$; if $k_0>0$,
it is not, and $F(k_0)$ is nonzero but subleading with respect to friction by
one order in $T$. The velocity time correlation function, whose integral is the
spatial diffusion coefficient, decays with the mean velocity damping rate if
$k_0=0$; if $k_0>0$, it has a second exponential component, with an amplitude
and a damping rate lower by a factor $\propto T$ (it is the velocity direction
thermalization rate). We also characterize force and momentum diffusion close

exact to leading order in $T$. We illustrate them in the BCS approximation, for
a fermionic quasiparticle (an unpaired fermion) in a superfluid of spin 1/2

black holes (PBHs) representing all of dark matter (DM) in our Universe. The
gravitational waves (GWs) induced by the curvature perturbations are inevitably
generated during the formation of these PBHs, and fall in the frequency band of
LISA. Such scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are supposed to be
definitely detected by LISA even when the second-order local-type
non-Gaussianity characterized by the parameter $F_{\rm NL}$ is taken into
account. In this letter, we give a comprehensive analysis of the GWs induced by
the local-type non-Gaussian curvature perturbations up to the third-order
denoted by the non-linear parameter $G_{\rm NL}$, and find that a log-dependent
slope of SIGWs in the infrared region is generically predicted and the
amplitude of SIGWs can be further suppressed by several orders of magnitude.
Therefore, the null-detection of SIGWs by LISA cannot rule out the possibility
of PBHs making up all of DM.

  Rectification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distortion is widely existed in the images captured by popular wide-angle
cameras and fisheye cameras. Despite the long history of distortion
rectification, accurately estimating the distortion parameters from a single
distorted image is still challenging. The main reason is these parameters are
implicit to image features, influencing the networks to fully learn the
distortion information. In this work, we propose a novel distortion
rectification approach that can obtain more accurate parameters with higher
efficiency. Our key insight is that distortion rectification can be cast as a
problem of learning an ordinal distortion from a single distorted image. To
solve this problem, we design a local-global associated estimation network that
learns the ordinal distortion to approximate the realistic distortion
distribution. In contrast to the implicit distortion parameters, the proposed
ordinal distortion have more explicit relationship with image features, and
thus significantly boosts the distortion perception of neural networks.
Considering the redundancy of distortion information, our approach only uses a
part of distorted image for the ordinal distortion estimation, showing
promising applications in the efficient distortion rectification. To our
knowledge, we first unify the heterogeneous distortion parameters into a
learning-friendly intermediate representation through ordinal distortion,
bridging the gap between image feature and distortion rectification. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, with approximately 23%
improvement on the quantitative evaluation while displaying the best
performance on visual appearance.

our previous model by including the jet collimation by the cocoon

propagation in BNS mergers and in collapsars to test our models. Our models are
consistent with numerical simulations in every aspect (the jet head radius, the
cocoon's lateral width, the jet opening angle including collimation, the cocoon
pressure, and the jet-cocoon morphology). The energy composition of the cocoon
is found to be different depending on whether the ambient medium is expanding

formation has the Jeans mass, that is when gravity is stronger than thermal

planetesimals found forming in streaming instability simulations in the

it reproduced the exact dynamics well for high photon frequencies of the laser

usually determined in a myopic round-based way dependent on the results of
previous rounds. Together with the hard constraint that no two players meet
more than once during the tournament, at some point it might become infeasible
to schedule a next round. For tournaments with $n$ players and match sizes of
$k\geq2$ players, we prove that we can always guarantee $\lfloor
\frac{n}{k(k-1)} \rfloor$ rounds. We show that this bound is tight. This
provides a simple polynomial time constant factor approximation algorithm for
the social golfer problem.
  We extend the results to the Oberwolfach problem. We show that a simple
greedy approach guarantees at least $\lfloor \frac{n+4}{6} \rfloor$ rounds for
the Oberwolfach problem. This yields a polynomial time
$\frac{1}{3+\epsilon}$-approximation algorithm for any fixed $\epsilon>0$ for
the Oberwolfach problem. Assuming that El-Zahar's conjecture is true, we
improve the bound on the number of rounds to be essentially tight.

degradation. T91 steel specimens were separately neutron irradiated to 2.14 dpa

Advanced Test Reactor. Atom probe tomography was used to investigate the
segregation driven formation of Mn-Ni-Si-rich (MNSPs) and Cu-rich (CRP)
co-precipitates. The precipitates increase in size and, slightly, in volume
fraction at the higher irradiation temperature and dose, while their
corresponding compositions were very similar, falling near the Si(Mn,Ni) phase
field in the Mn-Ni-Si projection of the Fe-based quaternary phase diagram.
While the structure of the precipitates has not been characterized, this
composition range is distinctly different than that of the typically cited
G-phase. The precipitates are composed of CRP with MNSP appendages. Such
features are often observed in neutron irradiated reactor pressure vessel (RPV)
steels. However, the Si, Ni, Mn, P and Cu solutes concentrations are lower in
the T91 than in typical RPV steels. Thus, in T91 precipitation primarily takes
place in solute segregated regions of line and loop dislocations. These results
are consistent with the model for radiation induced segregation driven
precipitation of MNSPs proposed by Ke et al. Cr-rich alpha prime ($\alpha$')

using diffusion maps, a manifold learning technique capable of finding the
variables that optimally describe the variations in a dataset in the sense of
preserving pairwise relationships among the data points. The method is applied
to the 2010 US decennial census. In contrast to other methods the proposed
procedure does not select particular columns from the census, but rather
constructs an indicator of deprivation from the complete dataset. Due to its
construction the proposed index does not introduce biases except those already
present in the source data, does not require normative judgment regarding the
desirability of certain life styles, and is highly resilient against attempts
of partisan manipulation. We demonstrate that the new index aligns well with
established income-based deprivation indices but deviates in aspects that are
perceived as problematic in some of the existing indices. The proposed
procedure provides an efficient way for constructing accurate, high resolution
indices. These indices can thus have the potential to become powerful tools for
the academic study of social structure as well as political decision making.

for 2D materials with diverse magnetic structures as well as effective probes
for their magnetic symmetries, which is key to understanding intralayer
magnetic order and interlayer magnetic coupling. Here we apply second harmonic
generation (SHG), a technique acutely sensitive to symmetry breaking, to probe
the magnetic structure of a new 2D magnetic semiconductor, CrSBr. We find that
CrSBr monolayers are ferromagnetically ordered below 146 K, an observation
enabled by the discovery of a giant magnetic dipole SHG effect in the
centrosymmetric 2D structure. In multilayers, the ferromagnetic monolayers are
coupled antiferromagnetically, with the N\'eel temperature notably increasing
with decreasing layer number. The magnetic structure of CrSBr, comprising spins
co-aligned in-plane with rectangular unit cell, differs markedly from the
prototypical 2D hexagonal magnets CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 with out-of-plane moments.
Moreover, our SHG analysis suggests that the order parameters of the
ferromagnetic monolayer and the antiferromagnetic bilayer are the magnetic
dipole and the magnetic toroidal moments, respectively. These findings
establish CrSBr as an exciting 2D magnetic semiconductor and SHG as a powerful
tool to probe 2D magnetic symmetry, opening the door to the exploration of

the `Hubble tension'. I review the SH0ES analyses by Riess and collaborators
and point out some internal inconsistencies, including a discrepancy between
the relative distances inferred from Cepheids of two of the primary geometric
distance anchors, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and NGC 4258. I then ask
`what would it take to make SH0ES compatible with early time measurements?'.
The answer is a systematic bias of 0.1 - 0.15 mag in the intercept of the
Cepheid period-luminosity relations of SH0ES galaxies. Such a bias resolves the
Hubble tension, the tension between the distance anchors, and the difference
between SH0ES and the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance ladder, as
measured and calibrated by Freedman and collaborators. I show that the
difference between the TRGB and SH0ES values of H0 is caused mainly by a
systematic calibration offset. In the short term, observational efforts should
be focussed on improving the calibrations of the distance anchors and nearby
galaxies, rather than trying to measure distance moduli to more supernovae host
galaxies. I argue that an independent distance estimate to NGC 4258 is
particularly critical. With such observations, it should be possible, on a
relatively short timescale, to establish definitively whether the Hubble
tension really exists.

be deduced from the observed shape of a flare. The example clouds result in
significant flares lasting for various time scales.

occurring in the conclusion of the O'Nan-Scott theorem. Several of the other
classes have been described as the automorphism groups of geometric or
combinatorial structures such as affine spaces or Cartesian decompositions, but
such structures for diagonal groups have not been studied.
  The main purpose of this paper is to describe and characterise such
structures, which we call diagonal semilattices. Unlike the diagonal groups in
the O'Nan-Scott theorem, which are defined over finite characteristically
simple groups, our construction works over any group, finite or infinite.
  A diagonal semilattice depends on a dimension m and a group T. For m=2, it is
a Latin square, the Cayley table of T, though in fact any Latin square
satisfies our axioms. However, for m>=3, the group T emerges naturally and
uniquely from the axioms. (The situation somewhat resembles projective
geometry, where projective planes exist in profusion but higher-dimensional
structures are coordinatised by an algebraic object, a division ring.)
  A diagonal semilattice is contained in the partition lattice on a set, and we
provide an introduction to the calculus of partitions. Many of the concepts and
constructions come from experimental design in statistics.
  We also determine when a diagonal group can be primitive, or quasiprimitive
(these conditions are equivalent for diagonal groups).
  Associated with the diagonal semilattice is a graph, the diagonal graph,
which has the same automorphism group except in four small cases with m<=3. The
class of diagonal graphs includes some well-known families, Latin-square graphs
and folded cubes. We obtain partial results on the chromatic number of a
diagonal graph, and mention an application to synchronization.

with a volume collapse around 5%. Theoretical explanations have focused on the
idea of electrons transferring from the extended s-orbital to the compact
f-orbital. However, experimental measurement has been unable to detect any
associated change in the magnetic properties of the f-electrons. Here we
resolve this discrepancy by showing that there is no significant volume
collapse, beyond what is typical in high pressure phase transformations. We
present density functional theory calculations of solid gadolinium under high
pressure using a range of methods, and revisit the experimental situation using
X-ray diffraction (XRD). The standard lanthanide pressure-transformation
sequence involving different stackings of close-packed planes: hcp to 9R to
dhcp to fcc to d-fcc is reproduced. The so-called ""volume collapsed""
high-pressure phase is shown to be an unusual stacking of close-packed planes,
with Fddd symmetry and a density change less than 2%. The distorted fcc (d-fcc)
structure is revealed to arise as a consequence of antiferromagnetism. The
theoretical results are shown to be remarkably robust to various treatments of
the f-electrons. The key result is that there is no XRD evidence for volume
collapse in Gadolinium. The sequence of phase transitions is well described by
standard DFT. There is no need for special treatment of the f-electrons or
evidence of f-electron bonding. Noting previous spectroscopic evidence is that
there is no change in the f-electrons we conclude that high pressure Gadolinium
has no complicated f-electron physics such as Mott-Hubbard, Kondo or valence
transition.

model fully accounts for uncertainty and can handle irregular grids of
observations while maintaining explicit formulations, by modelling the mean

jointly predicts semantic segmentation and signed distance map(SDM) of object

predicted SDMs of labeled and unlabeled data so that our network is able to
capture shape-aware features more effectively. Experiments on the Atrial

a challenging, highly ill-posed problem with practical implications in medical

security. Regularizing priors are necessary to reduce artifacts by improving
the condition of such problems. Recently, it was shown that one effective way
to learn the priors for strongly scattering yet highly structured 3D objects,
e.g. layered and Manhattan, is by a static neural network [Goy et al, Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. 116, 19848-19856 (2019)]. Here, we present a radically
different approach where the collection of raw images from multiple angles is
viewed analogously to a dynamical system driven by the object-dependent forward
scattering operator. The sequence index in angle of illumination plays the role
of discrete time in the dynamical system analogy. Thus, the imaging problem
turns into a problem of nonlinear system identification, which also suggests
dynamical learning as better fit to regularize the reconstructions. We devised
a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with a novel split-convolutional
gated recurrent unit (SC-GRU) as the fundamental building block. Through
comprehensive comparison of several quantitative metrics, we show that the
dynamic method improves upon previous static approaches with fewer artifacts
and better overall reconstruction fidelity.

on the basis of Crida & Charnoz's model of satellite formation from a
hypothetical ancient massive rings, adjacent pairs must pass 1st-order
mean-motion resonances without being trapped. The trapping could be avoided by
fast orbital migration and/or excitation of the satellite's eccentricity caused
by gravitational interactions between the satellites and the rings (the disk),
which are still unknown. In our research, we investigate the satellite orbital
evolution due to interactions with the disk through full N-body simulations. We
performed global high-resolution N-body simulations of a self-gravitating
particle disk interacting with a single satellite. We used $N \sim 10^5$
particles for the disk. Gravitational forces of all the particles and their
inelastic collisions are taken into account. As a result, dense
short-wavelength wake structure is created by the disk self-gravity and global
spiral arms with $m \sim$ a few is induced by the satellite. The self-gravity
wakes regulate the orbital evolution of the satellite, which has been
considered as a disk spreading mechanism but not as a driver for the orbital
evolution. The self-gravity wake torque to the satellite is so effective that
the satellite migration is much faster than that was predicted with the spiral
arms torque. It provides a possible model to avoid the resonance capture of
adjacent satellite pairs and establish the current orbital configuration of
Saturn's mid-sized satellites.

series of interlinked principal-agent problems, leading to a sequence of
Stackelberg equilibria. More precisely, the principal can contract with the
managers to incentivise them to act in her best interest, despite only
observing the net benefits of the total hierarchy. Managers in turn subcontract
with the agents below them. Both agents and managers independently control in
continuous time a stochastic process representing their outcome. First, we show
through a continuous-time adaptation of Sung's model that, even if the agents
only control the drift of their outcome, their manager controls the volatility
of their continuation utility. This first simple example justifies the use of
recent results on optimal contracting for drift and volatility control, and
therefore the theory of second-order backward stochastic differential
equations, developed in the theoretical part of this paper, dedicated to a more
general model. The comprehensive approach we outline highlights the benefits of
considering a continuous-time model and opens the way to obtain comparative
statics. We also explain how the model can be extended to a large-scale
principal-agent hierarchy. Since the principal's problem can be reduced to only
an $m$-dimensional state space and a $2m$-dimensional control set, where $m$ is
the number of managers immediately below her, and is therefore independent of
the size of the hierarchy below these managers, the dimension of the problem

cellular form of prion protein (PrPC) into the beta-sheet-rich scrapie form
(PrPSc) and the subsequent aggregation of PrPSc into amyloid fibrils. Recent
studies demonstrated that a naturally occurring variant V127 of human PrPC is
intrinsically resistant to prion conversion and aggregation, and can completely
prevent prion diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains
elusive. Herein we perform multiple microsecond molecular dynamics simulations
on both wildtype (WT) and V127 variant of human PrPC to understand at atomic
level the protective effect of V127 variant. Our simulations show that G127V
mutation not only increases the rigidity of the S2-H2 loop between strand-2
(S2) and helix-2 (H2), but also allosterically enhances the stability of the H2
C-terminal region. Interestingly, previous studies reported that animals with
rigid S2-H2 loop usually do not develop prion diseases, and the increase in H2
C-terminal stability can prevent misfolding and oligomerization of prion
protein. The allosteric paths from G/V127 to H2 C-terminal region are
identified using dynamical network analyses. Moreover, community network
analyses illustrate that G127V mutation enhances the global correlations and
intra-molecular interactions of PrP, thus stabilizing the overall PrPC
structure and inhibiting its conversion into PrPSc. This study provides
mechanistic understanding of human V127 variant in preventing prion conversion
which may be helpful for the rational design of potent anti-prion compounds.

general classes: blind backdoor removal, offline backdoor inspection, online
backdoor inspection, and post backdoor removal. Accordingly, we review
countermeasures, and compare and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We
have also reviewed the flip side of backdoor attacks, which are explored for i)
protecting intellectual property of deep learning models, ii) acting as a
honeypot to catch adversarial example attacks, and iii) verifying data deletion

near the superconducting temperature. The result and its quantum many-body
analysis indicate that a polarized current is induced by non-dissipative
acceleration of charge, which is amplified by superconducting fluctuations.
This will lead to petahertz functions of superconductors and of strongly
correlated systems.

channel state information (CSI) is crucial to achieve its promising passive

correlated over the IRS reflecting elements due to the limited training with
discrete phase shifts, which degrade the data transmission rate and
reliability. In this paper, we focus on investigating the effect of CSI errors
to the outage performance in an IRS-aided multiuser downlink communication
system. Specifically, we aim to jointly optimize the active transmit precoding
vectors at the access point (AP) and passive discrete phase shifts at the IRS
to minimize the AP's transmit power, subject to the constraints on the maximum
CSI-error induced outage probability for the users. First, we consider the
single-user case and derive the user's outage probability in terms of the mean
signal power (MSP) and variance of the received signal at the user. Since there
is a trade-off in tuning these two parameters to minimize the outage
probability, we propose to maximize their weighted sum with the optimal weight
found by one-dimensional search. Then, for the general multiuser case, since
the users' outage probabilities are difficult to obtain in closed-form due to
the inter-user interference, we propose a novel constrained stochastic
successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm, which replaces the
non-convex outage probability constraints with properly designed convex
surrogate approximations. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed robust beamfoming algorithms and show their significant performance
improvement over various benchmark schemes.

verifying correctness of programs, by establishing that two implementations are

establishing that a modified program is equivalent to the source one. There
exist several equivalence relations for programs, and bisimulations are among
the most versatile of these equivalences. Among bisimulation relations one
distinguishes strong bisimulation, that requires that each action of a program
is simulated by a single action of the equivalent program, a weak bisimulation
that is a coarser relation, allowing some of the actions to be invisible or
internal moves, and thus not simulated by the equivalent program.
  pNet is a generalisation of automata that model open systems. They feature
variables and hierarchical composition. Open pNets are pNets with holes, i.e.
placeholders inside the hierarchical structure that can be filled later by
sub-systems.
  This article defines bisimulation relations for the comparison of systems
specified as pNets. We first define a strong bisimulation for open pNets. We
then define an equivalence relation similar to the classical weak bisimulation,
and study its properties. Among these properties we are interested in
compositionality: if two systems are proven equivalent they will be
undistinguishable by their context, and they will also be undistinguishable
when their holes are filled with equivalent systems. We identify sufficient
conditions on the automata to ensure compositionality of strong and weak
bisimulation. The article is illustrated with a transport protocol running

attention recently since abundant training samples are difficult to obtain in
practical applications. Meta-learning has been proposed to address this issue,
which focuses on quickly adapting a predictor as a base-learner to new tasks,
given limited labeled samples. However, a critical challenge for meta-learning
is the representation deficiency since it is hard to discover common
information from a small number of training samples or even one, as is the
representation of key features from such little information. As a result, a
meta-learner cannot be trained well in a high-dimensional parameter space to
generalize to new tasks. Existing methods mostly resort to extracting less
expressive features so as to avoid the representation deficiency. Aiming at
learning better representations, we propose a meta-learning approach with
complemented representations network (MCRNet) for few-shot image
classification. In particular, we embed a latent space, where latent codes are
reconstructed with extra representation information to complement the
representation deficiency. Furthermore, the latent space is established with
variational inference, collaborating well with different base-learners, and can
be extended to other models. Finally, our end-to-end framework achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in image classification on three standard few-shot

instance segmentation. However, in order to train a model with good
generalization ability, voluminous pixel-level annotations are demanded which
is quite expensive and time-consuming for acquisition. In this paper, we
propose to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for instance segmentation
with improved accuracy by knowledge distillation. We propose a novel
Mask-guided Mean Teacher framework with Perturbation-sensitive Sample Mining
(MMT-PSM), which consists of a teacher and a student network during training.
Two networks are encouraged to be consistent both in feature and semantic level
under small perturbations. The teacher's self-ensemble predictions from
$K$-time augmented samples are used to construct the reliable pseudo-labels for
optimizing the student. We design a novel strategy to estimate the sensitivity
to perturbations for each proposal and select informative samples from massive
cases to facilitate fast and effective semantic distillation. In addition, to
eliminate the unavoidable noise from the background region, we propose to use
the predicted segmentation mask as guidance to enforce the feature distillation
in the foreground region. Experiments show that the proposed method improves
the performance significantly compared with the supervised method learned from
labeled data only, and outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.

active role in their treatment choices, supported by clinicians and patient
decision aids (PDAs). The purpose of this study is to explore barriers and
possible facilitators to SDM and a PDA in the prostate cancer trajectory. In
the process we identify possible actions that organizations and individuals can
take to support implementation in practice.
  Methods: We use the Ottawa Model of Research Use as a framework to determine
the barriers and facilitators to SDM and PDAs from the perspective of
clinicians. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with urologists (n=4),
radiation oncologists (n=3), and oncology nurses (n=2), focusing on the current
decision-making process experienced by these stakeholders. Questions included
their attitudes towards SDM and PDAs, barriers to implementation and possible
strategies to overcome them.
  Results: Time pressure and patient characteristics were cited as major
barriers by 55% of the clinicians we interviewed. Structural factors such as
external quotas for certain treatment procedures were also considered as
barriers by 44% of the clinicians. Facilitating factors involved organizational
changes to em-bed PDAs in the treatment trajectory, training in using PDAs as a
tool for SDM, and clinician motivation by disseminating positive clinical
outcomes. Our findings also suggest a role for external stakeholders such as
healthcare insurers in creating economic incentives to facilitate
implementation.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of a multi-faceted
implementation strategy to support SDM. While clinician motivation and patient
activation are essential, structural/economic barriers may hamper
implementation. Action must also be taken at the administrative and policy
levels to foster a collaborative environment for SDM and, in the process, for
PDAs.

approximately solves the KKT system of a parametric equality constrained
mini-max subproblem, which avoids the requirement that any primal or dual
iterate is an interior-point. The method has some similarities to the
warmstarting interior-point methods in relaxing the interior-point requirement
and is easily extended for solving problems with general inequality

difficulty that appears with many interior-point methods for nonlinear programs
and improve the ill conditioning of existing primal-dual interior-point methods
as the barrier parameter is small. A new smoothing approach is introduced to
develop our relaxation method and promote convergence of the method. Under
suitable conditions, it is proved that our method can be globally convergent
and locally quadratically convergent to the KKT point of the original problem.
The preliminary numerical results on a well-posed problem for which many
interior-point methods fail to find the minimizer and a set of test problems

or in isolation. Memes are the most popular form, belonging to the former
class. In this paper, we present our approaches for the Memotion Analysis
problem as posed in SemEval-2020 Task 8. The goal of this task is to classify
memes based on their emotional content and sentiment. We leverage techniques
from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) towards the
sentiment classification of internet memes (Subtask A). We consider Bimodal
(text and image) as well as Unimodal (text-only) techniques in our study
ranging from the Na\""ive Bayes classifier to Transformer-based approaches. Our
results show that a text-only approach, a simple Feed Forward Neural Network
(FFNN) with Word2vec embeddings as input, performs superior to all the others.
We stand first in the Sentiment analysis task with a relative improvement of
63% over the baseline macro-F1 score. Our work is relevant to any task
concerned with the combination of different modalities.

equations with multiscale coefficients is the accurate computation of effective
quantities, such as the homogenized coefficients. Computing homogenized
coefficients requires solving local corrector problems followed by upscaling
relevant local data. The most naive way of computing homogenized coefficients
is by solving a local elliptic problem, which is known to suffer from the
so-called resonance error dominating all other errors inherent in multiscale
computations. A far more efficient modelling strategy, based on adding an
exponential correction term to the standard local elliptic problem, has
recently been proved to result in exponentially decaying error bounds with
respect to the size of the local geometry. The questions in relation with the
accuracy and computational efficiency of this approach has been previously
addressed in the context of periodic homogenization. The present article
concerns the extension of mathematical and numerical study of this modified
elliptic corrector problem to stochastic homogenization problems. In
particular, we assume a stationary, ergodic micro-structure and i) establish
the well-posedness of the corrector equation, ii) analyse the bias (or the
systematic error) originating from additional exponential correction term in
the model. Numerical results corroborating our theoretical findings are
presented.

unique probe of the interfacial structure of nano- and microscale objects in
water. However, the full surface vibrational stretch mode spectrum has not been
measured yet, even though it would be extremely informative to do so. The
reason for this is that probing the vibrational modes of interfacial water
requires a full understanding of how the linear absorptive properties of the
bulk aqueous medium influence the sum frequency scattering process. Here, we
have simulated vibrational sum frequency scattering spectra of the interface of
nanoscale objects dispersed in water. We analyzed the effect of the infrared
pulse absorption on the outcome of surface vibrational sum frequency scattering
measurements. We find that both infrared absorption as well as the type of
optical detection can drastically modify the measured vibrational interfacial

of the main vibrational stretch mode and the introducing of a new high
frequency peak. This last feature is enhanced by non-resonant interactions.

challenge through jointly enforcing visual and temporal consistency in the
combination of a local one-hot classification and a global multi-class
classification. The local one-hot classification assigns images in a training
batch with different person IDs, then adopts a Self-Adaptive Classification
(SAC) model to classify them. The global multi-class classification is achieved
by predicting labels on the entire unlabeled training set with the Memory-based
Temporal-guided Cluster (MTC). MTC predicts multi-class labels by considering
both visual similarity and temporal consistency to ensure the quality of label
prediction. The two classification models are combined in a unified framework,
which effectively leverages the unlabeled data for discriminative feature

the superiority of proposed method in both unsupervised and unsupervised domain

depends on the details of the contact dynamics between the system and the

This gives a strong negative answer to conjectures of Spielman and Teng [ST06]

  In contrast to prior work proving PPAD-hardness after smoothing by noise of
magnitude $1/\operatorname{poly}(n)$ [CDT09], our smoothed complexity result is
not proved via hardness of approximation for Nash equilibria. This is by
necessity, since Nash equilibria can be approximated to constant error in
quasi-polynomial time [LMM03]. Our results therefore separate smoothed
complexity and hardness of approximation for Nash equilibria in two-player
games.
  The key ingredient in our reduction is the use of a random zero-sum game as a
gadget to produce two-player games which remain hard even after smoothing. Our
analysis crucially shows that all Nash equilibria of random zero-sum games are
far from pure (with high probability), and that this remains true even after

soft and hard X-ray spectra. Although, when the compact object (e.g., a WD or
an NS) has a finite surface, its rapid rotation, the stellar magnetic field
could cause deformation of the spherical symmetry. Earlier studies for
Keplerian disc showed that a deviation from the spherical symmetry of the
compact object could affect the observed light curve and spectra at high
frequencies. Here, we have explored the effect of the non-spherical nature of a
compact object on the hydrodynamics of an optically thin, geometrically thick

have been branching and cutting planes. Recently, several authors have
developed core point methods for solving symmetric integer linear programs

lattice-free. It has been shown that for symmetric ILPs, optimizing over the
set of core points gives the same answer as considering the entire space.
Existing core point techniques rely on the number of core points (or
equivalence classes) being finite, which requires special symmetry groups. In
this paper we develop some new methods for solving symmetric ILPs (based on
outer approximations of core points) that do not depend on finiteness but are
more efficient if the group has large disjoint cycles in its set of generators.

asking whether there exists a function satisfying a desired specification

Lyapunov functions for linear, non-linear (polynomial), and for parametric
models. For non-linear models, the algorithm also determines a region of
validity for the Lyapunov function. We exploit an inductive framework to
synthesise Lyapunov functions, starting from parametric templates. The
inductive framework comprises two elements: a learner proposes a Lyapunov
function, and a verifier checks its validity - its lack is expressed via a
counterexample (a point over the state space), for further use by the learner.
Whilst the verifier uses the SMT solver Z3, thus ensuring the overall soundness
of the procedure, we examine two alternatives for the learner: a numerical
approach based on the optimisation tool Gurobi, and a sound approach based
again on Z3. The overall technique is evaluated over a broad set of benchmarks,

that the product ""reproduction number x percentage of susceptible"" is kept
after a certain date strictly below the critical level of one, although the

simultaneously produces dynamical axions and solves the strong CP problem. The
strong dynamics arises from a new $Sp$ or $SU(4)$ hypercolor gauge group
containing QCD colored hyperfermions that confines at a high scale. The
hypercolor global symmetry is weakly gauged by the Standard Model electroweak
gauge group and an enlarged color group, $SU(N+3) \times SU(N)'$. When
hyperfermion condensates form, they not only lead to an $SU(5)/SO(5)$ composite
Higgs model but also spontaneously break the enlarged color group to $SU(3)_c
\times SU(N)_D$. At lower energies, the $SU(N)_D$ group confines, producing two
dynamical axions that eliminates all CP violation. Furthermore, small
instantons from the $SU(N)'$ group can enhance the axion mass, giving rise to
TeV scale axion masses that can be detected at collider experiments. Our model
provides a way to unify the composite Higgs with dynamical axions, without
introducing new elementary scalar fields, while also extending the range of
axion masses that addresses the strong CP problem.

thematic analysis method for analysing the extracted data. We identified nine
challenges that can affect the development of secure mHealth apps. Such as 1)
lack of security guidelines and regulations for developing secure mHealth apps,
2) developers lack of knowledge and expertise for secure mHealth app
development, 3) lack of stakeholders involvement during mHealth app
development, etc . Based on our analysis, we have presented a conceptual
framework which highlights the correlation between the identified challenges.
We conclude that our findings can help them identify their weaknesses and
improve their security practices. Similarly, mHealth apps developers can
identify the challenges they face to develop mHealth apps that do not pose
security risks for users. Our review is a step towards providing insights into
the development of secure mHealth apps. Our proposed conceptual framework can

attractors for interval maps by showing that they need not be closed. This
disproves a conjecture by Kolyada, Misiurewicz, and Snoha. We give a criterion
in terms of Xiong's attracting center that completely characterizes which
interval maps have all $s\alpha$-limit sets closed, and we show that our
criterion is satisfied in the piecewise monotone case. We apply Blokh's models
of solenoidal and basic $\omega$-limit sets to solve four additional
conjectures by Kolyada, Misiurewicz, and Snoha relating topological properties
of $s\alpha$-limit sets to the dynamics within them. For example, we show that
the isolated points in a $s\alpha$-limit set of an interval map are always
periodic, the non-degenerate components are the union of one or two transitive
cycles of intervals, and the rest of the $s\alpha$-limit set is nowhere dense.
Moreover, we show that $s\alpha$-limit sets in the interval are always both
$F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$. Finally, since $s\alpha$-limit sets need not be
closed, we propose a new notion of $\beta$-limit sets to serve as backward
attractors. The $\beta$-limit set of $x$ is the smallest closed set to which
all backward orbit branches of $x$ converge, and it coincides with the closure
of the $s\alpha$-limit set. At the end of the paper we suggest several new
problems about backward attractors.

capture properties of unitary operations relevant for numerous applications in
quantum information and quantum computing. The former constitute subsets of
unitary channels that are epsilon-close to any unitary channel in the diamond
norm. The latter are ensembles of unitaries that (approximately) recover Haar
averages of polynomials in entries of unitary channels up to order $t$.
  In this work we establish quantitative connections between these two notions.
Specifically, we prove that, for a fixed dimension $d$ of the Hilbert space,
unitaries constituting $\delta$-approximate $t$-expanders form $\epsilon$-nets
for $t\simeq\frac{d^{5/2}}{\epsilon}$ and
$\delta=\left(\frac{\epsilon^{3/2}}{d}\right)^{d^2}$. We also show that
$\epsilon$-nets can be used to construct $\delta$-approximate unitary
$t$-designs for $\delta= \epsilon t$. Finally, we prove that the degree of an
exact unitary $t$-design necessary to obtain an $\epsilon$-net must grow at
least fast as $\frac1\epsilon$ (for fixed $d$) and not slower than $d^2$ (for
fixed $\epsilon$). This shows near optimality of our result connecting
$t$-designs and $\epsilon$-nets.
  We apply our findings in the context of quantum computing. First, we show
that that approximate t-designs can be generated by shallow random circuits
formed from a set of universal two-qudit gates in the parallel and sequential
local architectures. Our gate sets need not to be symmetric (i.e. contain gates
together with their inverses) or consist of gates with algebraic entries. We
also show a non-constructive version of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem for general
universal gate sets. Our main technical contribution is a new construction of

$\mathsf{F}_\lambda$ arise in the context of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ higher spin six
vertex models, and are multiparameter deformations of the classical
Hall-Littlewood symmetric polynomials. We obtain a refined Cauchy identity
expressing a weighted sum of the product of two $\mathsf{F}_\lambda$'s as a
determinant. The determinant is of Izergin-Korepin type: it is the partition
function of the six vertex model with suitably decorated domain wall boundary
conditions. The proof of equality of two partition functions is based on the
Yang-Baxter equation.
  We rewrite our Izergin-Korepin type determinant in a different form which
includes one of the sets of variables in a completely symmetric way. This
determinantal identity might be of independent interest, and also allows to
directly link the spin Hall-Littlewood rational functions with (the
Hall-Littlewood particular case of) the interpolation Macdonald polynomials. In
a different direction, a Schur expansion of our Izergin-Korepin type
determinant yields a deformation of Schur symmetric polynomials.
  In the spin-$\frac12$ specialization, our refined Cauchy identity leads to a
summation identity for eigenfunctions of the ASEP (Asymmetric Simple Exclusion
Process), a celebrated stochastic interacting particle system in the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This produces explicit integral
formulas for certain multitime probabilities in ASEP.

analyzing the Earth's surface. Existing models assume a closed-set setting
where both the training and testing classes belong to the same label set.
However, due to the unique characteristics of satellite imagery with an
extremely vast area of versatile cover materials, the training data are bound
to be non-representative. In this paper, we study the problem of open-set land
cover classification that identifies the samples belonging to unknown classes
during testing, while maintaining performance on known classes. Although
inherently a classification problem, both representative and discriminative
aspects of data need to be exploited in order to better distinguish unknown
classes from known. We propose a representative-discriminative open-set
recognition (RDOSR) framework, which 1) projects data from the raw image space
to the embedding feature space that facilitates differentiating similar
classes, and further 2) enhances both the representative and discriminative
capacity through transformation to a so-called abundance space. Experiments on
multiple satellite benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. We also show the generality of the proposed approach by achieving
promising results on open-set classification tasks using RGB images.

The partitioning process is based on the binomial distribution. If the classes

iterations in the Amplitude Amplification algorithm can be drastically reduced
compared to the standard version. In the more likely case in which the relevant
classes are not known in advance, their selection can be configured at run

such as binary search. In particular, we apply this method in the context of
our previously introduced Quantum Dictionary pattern, where keys and values are
encoded in two separate registers, and the value-encoding method is independent
of the type of superposition used in the key register. We consider this type of

was largely ignored. Scarcely any of the papers mentioned uncertainty in the

simulations. In this paper we describe a new algorithm for the generation of
randomly disordered chemically heterogeneous surfaces and use it to explore the
adsorption behaviour of four model nonionic surfactants. Using novel analysis
methods we interrogate both the global surface coverage (adsorption isotherm)
and behaviour in localised regions. We observe trends in adsorption
characteristics as surfactant size, head/tail ratio, and surface topology are
varied and connect these to underlying physical mechanisms. We believe that our

observations of rapid magnetic field reversals known as switchbacks. These
switchbacks are extensively found in the near-Sun solar wind, appear to occur
in patches, and have possible links to various phenomena such as magnetic
reconnection near the solar surface. As switchbacks are associated with faster
plasma flows, we questioned whether they are hotter than the background plasma
and whether the microphysics inside a switchback is different to its
surroundings. We have studied the reduced distribution functions from the Solar
Probe Cup instrument and considered time periods with markedly large angular
deflections, to compare parallel temperatures inside and outside switchbacks.
We have shown that the reduced distribution functions inside switchbacks are
consistent with a rigid phase space rotation of the background plasma. As such,
we conclude that the proton core parallel temperature is the same inside and
outside of switchbacks, implying that a T-V relationship does not hold for the
proton core parallel temperature inside magnetic field switchbacks. We further
conclude that switchbacks are consistent with Alfv\'enic pulses travelling
along open magnetic field lines. The origin of these pulses, however, remains
unknown. We also found that there is no obvious link between radial Poynting
flux and kinetic energy enhancements suggesting that the radial Poynting flux
is not important for the dynamics of switchbacks.

is formulated by coupling linear elasticity with deformation systems. The
classical linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) model is derived based on
the assumption of small strain values. However, since the strain values in the
model are linearly proportional to the stress values, the strain value can be
large if the stress value increases. Thus this results in the contradiction of
the assumption to LEFM and it is one of the major disadvantages of the model.
In particular, this singular behavior of the strain values is often observed
especially near the crack-tip, and it may not accurately predict realistic
phenomena. Thus, we investigate the framework of a new class of theoretical
model, which is known as the nonlinear strain-limiting model. The advantage of
the nonlinear strain-limiting models over LEFM is that the strain value remains
bounded even if the stress value tends to the infinity. This is achieved by
assuming the nonlinear relation between the strain and stress in the derivation
of the model. Moreover, we consider the quasi-static fracture propagation by
coupling with the phase-field approach to present the effectiveness of the
proposed strain-limiting model. Several numerical examples to evaluate and
validate the performance of the new model and algorithms are presented.
Detailed comparisons of the strain values, fracture energy, and fracture
propagation speed between nonlinear strain-limiting model and LEFM for the
quasi-static fracture propagation are discussed.

handle practical surveillance scenarios. As an optional paradigm, to exploit
the low latency and asynchronous nature of neuromorphic vision sensors (NVS),
we also propose a continuous-time tracker with C++ implementation where each

contains infinitely many members which are not geometrically isomorphic to each

type equation of the form $x^{3}+Ny^{3} = Lz^{n}$, where $N$ and $L$ are
suitably chosen integers. In this sense, our construction is an extension of
the family of odd degree $n$ which was previously found by Shimizu and the

prime divisor which satisfies a certain indivisibility conjecture of
Ankeny-Artin-Chowla-Mordell type. In this time, we focus on the complementary
cases, namely the cases of even degrees and exceptional odd degrees.
Consequently, our recipe works well as a whole. This means that we can
unconditionally obtain infinitely many non-singular plane curves of every

gives a conclusion of the classical story of searching explicit ternary forms

estimation and is usually constructed by calculating the inner product between
two feature vectors. However, the standard inner product in the commonly-used
cost volume may limit the representation capacity of flow models because it
neglects the correlation among different channel dimensions and weighs each
dimension equally. To address this issue, we propose a learnable cost volume
(LCV) using an elliptical inner product, which generalizes the standard inner
product by a positive definite kernel matrix. To guarantee its positive
definiteness, we perform spectral decomposition on the kernel matrix and
re-parameterize it via the Cayley representation. The proposed LCV is a
lightweight module and can be easily plugged into existing models to replace
the vanilla cost volume. Experimental results show that the LCV module not only
improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks, but
also promotes their robustness against illumination change, noises, and
adversarial perturbations of the input signals.

reduce the high computation and memory cost when training and predicting based
on large-scale datasets with kernel SVMs. A popular one is the linearization
framework, which successfully builds a bridge between the $L_1$-loss kernel SVM
and the $L_1$-loss linear SVM. For linear SVMs, very recently, a semismooth
Newton's method is proposed. It is shown to be very competitive and have low
computational cost. Consequently, a natural question is whether it is possible
to develop a fast semismooth Newton's algorithm for kernel SVMs. Motivated by
this question and the idea in linearization framework, in this paper, we focus
on the $L_2$-loss kernel SVM and propose a semismooth Newton's method based
linearization and approximation approach for it. The main idea of this approach
is to first set up an equivalent linear SVM, then apply the Nystr\""om method to
approximate the kernel matrix, based on which a reduced linear SVM is obtained.
Finally, the fast semismooth Newton's method is employed to solve the reduced
linear SVM. We also provide some theoretical analyses on the approximation of
the kernel matrix. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it maintains
low computational cost and keeps a fast convergence rate. Results of extensive

actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood.
This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control
the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic

especially on the ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one

parameters. Finally, some forecasts are made using four scenarios with
time-dependent control measures so as to determine which would reflect on the

approaches for the numerical modelling of multiscale materials with
multiphysics behaviours. This work concerns the conceptual and numerical
modelling of poroelastically coupled dual-scale materials such as naturally
fractured rock. Apart from a few exceptions, previous poroelastic DC models
have assumed isotropy of the constituents and the dual-material. Additionally,
it is common to assume that only one continuum has intrinsic stiffness
properties. Finally, little has been done into validating whether the DC
paradigm can capture the global poroelastic behaviours of explicit numerical
representations at the DC modelling scale. We address the aforementioned
knowledge gaps in two steps. First, we utilise a homogenisation approach based
on Levin's theorem to develop a previously derived anisotropic poroelastic
constitutive model. Our development incorporates anisotropic intrinsic
stiffness properties of both continua. This addition is in analogy to
anisotropic fractured rock masses with stiff fractures. Second, we perform
numerical modelling to test the dual-continuum model against fine-scale
explicit equivalents. In doing, we present our hybrid numerical framework, as
well as the conditions required for interpretation of the numerical results.
The tests themselves progress from materials with isotropic to anisotropic
mechanical and flow properties. The fine-scale simulations show anisotropy can
have noticeable effects on deformation and flow behaviour. However, our
numerical experiments show the DC approach can capture the global poroelastic
behaviours of both isotropic and anisotropic fine-scale representations.

LIDAR applications. A phased array ideally requires that the field produced by
each element in the array (a pixel) is fully controllable in phase and
amplitude (ideally constant). This is needed to realize a phase gradient along
a direction in the array, and thus beam steering in that direction. In
practice, grating lobes appear if the pixel size is not sub-wavelength, which
is an issue for many optical technologies. Furthermore, the phase performance
of an optical pixel may not span the required $2\pi$ phase range, or may not
produce a constant amplitude over its phase range. These limitations result in
imperfections in the phase gradient, which in turn introduce undesirable
secondary lobes. We discuss the effects of non-ideal pixels on beam formation,
in a general and technology-agnostic manner. By examining the strength of
secondary lobes with respect to the main lobe, we quantify beam steering
quality, and make recommendations on the pixel performance required for beam
steering within prescribed specifications. By applying appropriate compensation
strategies, we show that it is possible to realize high-quality beam steering
even when the pixel performance is non-ideal, with intensity of the secondary
lobes be two orders of magnitude smaller than the main lobe.

pruning algorithm on each layer, the sparsity of back-propagation gradients can
be increased dramatically without degrading training accuracy and convergence
rate. Moreover, to utilize both \textit{natural sparsity} (resulted from ReLU

algorithm), a sparse-aware architecture is proposed for training acceleration.
This architecture supports forward and back-propagation of CNN by adopting

heterogeneous media is presented. A static order parameter smoothly bridges the
discontinuity at material interfaces, while an evolving phase-field captures
the regularized crack. The key novelty is the combination of a strain energy
split with a partial rank-I relaxation in the vicinity of the diffuse
interface. The former is necessary to account for physically meaningful crack
kinematics like crack closure, the latter ensures the mechanical jump
conditions throughout the diffuse region. The model is verified by a
convergence study, where a circular bi-material disc with and without a crack
is subjected to radial loads. For the uncracked case, analytical solutions are
taken as reference. In a second step, the model is applied to crack
propagation, where a meaningful influence on crack branching is observed, that
underlines the necessity of a reasonable homogenization scheme. The presented
model is particularly relevant for the combination of any variational strain

neutrally buoyant, infinitesimally small or Lagrangian particle motion. The
de-jure fluid mechanics framework for the description of inertial particle
dynamics is provided by the Maxey-Riley equation. Derived from first principles
- a result of over a century of research since the pioneering work by Sir
George Stokes - the Maxey-Riley equation is a Newton-type-law with several
forces including (mainly) flow, added mass, shear-induced lift, and drag
forces. In this paper we present an overview of recent efforts to port the
Maxey-Riley framework to oceanography. These involved: 1) including the
Coriolis force, which was found to explain behavior of submerged floats near
mesoscale eddies; 2) accounting for the combined effects of ocean current and
wind drag on inertial particles floating at the air-sea interface, which helped
understand the formation of great garbage patches and the role of anticyclonic
eddies as plastic debris traps; and 3) incorporating elastic forces, which are
needed to simulate the drift of pelagic Sargassum. Insight on the nonlinear
dynamics of inertial particles in every case was possible to be achieved by
investigating long-time asymptotic behavior in the various Maxey-Riley equation
forms, which represent singular perturbation problems involving slow and fast
variables.

an internal combustion engine. This transportation model suffers from low
vehicle utilization and causes environmental pollution. This paper studies the
use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) operating in a Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) scheme
and tackles the related management challenges. We assume a number of customers
acting as cooperative agents requesting a set of alternative trips and EVs
distributed across a number of pick-up and drop-off stations. In this setting,
we propose congestion management algorithms which take as input the trip
requests and calculate the EV-to-customer assignment aiming to maximize trip
execution by keeping the system balanced in terms of matching demand and
supply. We propose a Mixed-Integer-Programming (MIP) optimal offline solution
which assumes full knowledge of customer demand and an equivalent online greedy
algorithm that can operate in real time. The online algorithm uses three
alternative heuristic functions in deciding whether to execute a customer
request: (a) The sum of squares of all EVs in all stations, (b) the percentage
of trips' destination location fullness and (c) a random choice of trip
execution. Through a detailed evaluation, we observe that (a) provides an
increase of up to 4.8% compared to (b) and up to 11.5% compared to (c) in terms
of average trip execution, while all of them achieve close to the optimal
performance. At the same time, the optimal scales up to settings consisting of
tenths of EVs and a few hundreds of customer requests.

improved by complementing the expert annotations with seemingly uninformative

on Mars, but short timescale wind variability is not explicitly represented.
The local wind erosion and dust deposition model can be useful for more
accurate local wind friction, wind friction threshold, horizontal sand flux and
vertical dust flux modeling on Mars. Such a model based on the model of Zender
\cite{Zender} is proposed in this article. It includes different methods of
threshold wind friction estimation and takes into account the influence of
atmospheric electric fields on sand and dust elevation processes. The model
parameterized for the Earth was tested on data acquired in Morocco field
campaign 2013-2014 (Esposito et al.,) \cite{Esposito}, \cite{Esposito2}. Wind
friction, wind friction threshold, horizontal sand flux and vertical dust flux
were simulated by using the following inputs measured in the field: wind speed,
wind direction, air temperature, air pressure, air humidity, solar irradiation
and surface roughness length. The same inputs are supposed to be measured by
DREAMs equipment on Mars (except for the surface roughness length which can be
estimated for Mars according the method of Hebrard \cite{Hebrard}). Simulated
and experimental values have shown a good agreement. The model was adapted to
Martian conditions and applied to the data of Viking lander. The local wind
erosion and dust deposition model parameterized for Mars may serve 1) to
analyze local lander/rovers data, 2) a source of local parameters/inputs (like
threshold wind friction velocity, sand and dust fluxes) for the MGCM (Mars
Global Circulation Model).

performance across a variety of games: from those involving perfect-information
(such as Go) to those involving imperfect-information (such as Starcraft). Such
technological developments from AI-labs have ushered concomitant applications
across the world of business - where an AI brand tag is fast becoming
ubiquitous. A corollary of such widespread commercial deployment is that when
AI gets things wrong - an autonomous vehicle crashes; a chatbot exhibits racist
behaviour; automated credit scoring processes discriminate on gender etc. -
there are often significant financial, legal and brand consequences and the
incident becomes major news. As Judea Pearl sees it, the underlying reason for
such mistakes is that, 'all the impressive achievements of deep learning amount
to just curve fitting'. The key, Judea Pearl suggests, is to replace reasoning
by association with causal-reasoning - the ability to infer causes from
observed phenomena. It is a point that was echoed by Gary Marcus and Ernest
Davis in a recent piece for the New York Times: 'we need to stop building
computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical
patterns in data sets - often using an approach known as Deep Learning - and
start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately
grasp three basic concepts: time, space and causality'. In this paper,
foregrounding what in 1949 Gilbert Ryle termed a category mistake, I will offer
an alternative explanation for AI errors: it is not so much that AI machinery
cannot grasp causality, but that AI machinery - qua computation - cannot
understand anything at all.

assumption that the target matrix has certain intrinsic structures. For image
data related matrix recovery problems, approximate low-rankness and smoothness
are the two most commonly imposed structures. For approximately low-rank matrix
recovery, the robust principal component analysis (PCA) is well-studied and
proved to be effective. For smooth matrix problem, 2d fused Lasso and other
total variation based approaches have played a fundamental role. Although both
low-rankness and smoothness are key assumptions for image data analysis, the
two lines of research, however, have very limited interaction. Motivated by
taking advantage of both features, we in this paper develop a framework named
projected robust PCA (PRPCA), under which the low-rank matrices are projected
onto a space of smooth matrices. Consequently, a large class of image matrices
can be decomposed as a low-rank and smooth component plus a sparse component. A
key advantage of this decomposition is that the dimension of the core low-rank
component can be significantly reduced. Consequently, our framework is able to
address a problematic bottleneck of many low-rank matrix problems: singular
value decomposition (SVD) on large matrices. Theoretically, we provide explicit
statistical recovery guarantees of PRPCA and include classical robust PCA as a
special case.
