on-demand coverage is established to overcome the cost-ineffectiveness of

implemented to cope with the spectrum scarcity problem. To this end, a

state information (CSI). Under the on-board energy constraints of UAVs and
interference temperature constraints from UAV swarm to satellite users, we
present iterative multi-domain resource allocation algorithms to improve

plane endowed with two transverse foliations Fs and Fu) which reflects the
normal structure of the flow endowed with the center-stable and center unstable
foliations. A flow is R-covered if Fs (or Fu) is trivial.
  From one Anosov flow one can build infinitely many others by
Dehn-Goodman-Fried surgeries. This paper investigates how these surgeries
modify the bi-foliated plane.
  We first noticed that surgeries along some specific periodic orbits do not
modify the bi-foliated plane: for instance,
  - surgeries on families of orbits corresponding to disjoint simple closed
geodesics do not affect the bi-foliated plane associated to the geodesic flow
of a hyperbolic surface (Theorem 1);
  - Fe2 associates a (non-empty) finite family of periodic orbits, called
pivots, to any non-R-covered Anosov flow. Surgeries on pivots do not affect the
branching structure of the bi-foliated plane (Theorem 2)
  We consider the set Surg(A) of Anosov flows obtained by Dehn-Goodman-Fried
surgery from the suspension flows of Anosov automorphisms A in SL(2,Z) of the
torus T2.
  Every such surgery is associated to a finite set of couples (C,m(C)), where
the C are periodic orbits and the m(C) integers. When all the m(C) have the
same sign, Fenley proved that the induced Anosov flow is R-covered and twisted
according to the sign of the surgery. We analyse here the case where the
surgeries are positive on a finite set X and negative on another set Y.
  Among other results, we show that given any flow X in Surg(A) :
  - there exists e>0 such that for every e-dense periodic orbit C, every flow
obtained from X by a non trivial surgery along C is R-covered (Theorem 4).
  - there exist periodic orbits C+,C- such that every flow obtained from X by
surgeries with distinct signs on C+ and C- is non-R-covered (Theorem 5).

planned twice per year. We have analyzed the available data to quantify the
source behavior on a long term scale and examine the stability level on
timescales from hour to years. As a result, the source flux variability appears
to be contained within less than +/- 5% around a ~ 20 yr mean value, for broad
bands covering the 20 keV - 400 keV energy domain, above which statistic limits
any firm conclusion. In term of spectral shape, the Band model provides a good
description of the observed emission between 20 keV and 2.2 MeV. The averaged

a high energy slope of -2.32 +/- 0.02 and a characteristic energy E c of 531

training datasets. Previous work has investigated training models with
differential privacy (DP) guarantees through adding DP noise to the gradients.
However, such solutions (specifically, DPSGD), result in large degradations in
the accuracy of the trained models. In this paper, we aim at training deep
learning models with DP guarantees while preserving model accuracy much better
than previous works. Our key technique is to encode gradients to map them to a
smaller vector space, therefore enabling us to obtain DP guarantees for
different noise distributions. This allows us to investigate and choose noise
distributions that best preserve model accuracy for a target privacy budget. We
also take advantage of the post-processing property of differential privacy by
introducing the idea of denoising, which further improves the utility of the
trained models without degrading their DP guarantees. We show that our
mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-art DPSGD; for instance, for the same
model accuracy of $96.1\%$ on MNIST, our technique results in a privacy bound
of $\epsilon=3.2$ compared to $\epsilon=6$ of DPSGD, which is a significant

  Central Venous Pressure",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An optical imaging system is proposed for quantitatively assessing jugular
venous response to altered central venous pressure. The proposed system
assesses sub-surface optical absorption changes from jugular venous waveforms
with a spatial calibration procedure to normalize incident tissue illumination.
Widefield frames of the right lateral neck were captured and calibrated using a
novel flexible surface calibration method. A hemodynamic optical model was
derived to quantify jugular venous optical attenuation (JVA) signals, and
generate a spatial jugular venous pulsatility map. JVA was assessed in three
cardiovascular protocols that altered central venous pressure: acute central
hypovolemia (lower body negative pressure), venous congestion (head-down tilt),
and impaired cardiac filling (Valsalva maneuver). JVA waveforms exhibited
biphasic wave properties consistent with jugular venous pulse dynamics when
time-aligned with an electrocardiogram. JVA correlated strongly (median,
interquartile range) with invasive central venous pressure during graded
central hypovolemia (r=0.85, [0.72, 0.95]), graded venous congestion (r=0.94,
[0.84, 0.99]), and impaired cardiac filling (r=0.94, [0.85, 0.99]). Reduced JVA
during graded acute hypovolemia was strongly correlated with reductions in
stroke volume (SV) (r=0.85, [0.76, 0.92]) from baseline (SV: 79$\pm$15 mL, JVA:
0.56$\pm$0.10 a.u.) to -40 mmHg suction (SV: 59$\pm$18 mL, JVA: 0.47$\pm$0.05
a.u.; p$<$0.01). The proposed non-contact optical imaging system demonstrated
jugular venous dynamics consistent with invasive central venous monitoring
during three protocols that altered central venous pressure. This system
provides non-invasive monitoring of pressure-induced jugular venous dynamics in
clinically relevant conditions where catheterization is traditionally required,
enabling monitoring in non-surgical environments.

self-focusing Kerr and absorption nonlinearities. The nonlinear loss is
balanced by power influx from the peripheral reservoir stored in slowly
decaying tails of the azimuthons. These modes are excited by a superposition of
two Bessel beams with opposite vorticities, $\pm s$, and slightly different
conicities. The excited azimuthon exhibits opposite vorticity in its center to
that of the input Bessel-beam superposition due to spontaneous inversion of the
topological charge in the course of the azimuthon formation. Unlike azimuthons
in loss-free media, number $N$ of rotating intensity maxima and $s$ are not
mutually independent, being related by $N=2s$. The robustness of the rotating
azimuthons is enhanced in comparison to similar static dissipative patterns.
They can be excited in almost any transparent material, in the range of
intensities for which the nonlinear absorption, induced by multiphoton
absorption, is relevant. Close to the ionization threshold, the rotating
azimuthons reproduce recently observed helical filaments of light in air and
CS$_{2}$.

that their broad side faces down, because this is a stable fixed point of their
angular dynamics at small particle Reynolds number. Turbulence randomises the
orientations to some extent, and this affects the reflection patterns of
polarised light from turbulent clouds containing ice crystals. An overdamped
theory predicts that turbulence-induced fluctuations of the orientation are
very small when the settling number Sv (a dimensionless measure of the settling
speed) is large. At small Sv, by contrast, the overdamped theory predicts that
turbulence randomises the orientations. This overdamped theory neglects the
effect of particle inertia. Therefore we consider here how particle inertia
affects the orientation of small crystals settling in turbulent air. We find
that it can significantly increase the orientation variance, even when the
Stokes number St (a dimensionless measure of particle inertia) is quite small.
We identify different asymptotic parameter regimes where the tilt-angle
variance is proportional to different inverse powers of Sv. We estimate
parameter values for ice crystals in turbulent clouds and show that they cover
several of the identified regimes. The theory predicts how the degree of
alignment depends on particle size, shape and turbulence intensity, and that
the strong horizontal alignment of small crystals is only possible when the
turbulent energy dissipation is weak, of the order of $1\,$cm$^2$/s$^3$ or
less.

upon arrival an item's actual size is unknown; only its probabilistic
information is available to the decision maker. Without knowing this size, the
decision maker must irrevocably pack the item into an available bin or place it
in a new bin. Once packed in a bin, the decision maker observes the item's

large penalty cost and the corresponding bin is unusable for the rest of the

two galaxies have a total population larger than zero at 2$\sigma$ level. We
estimate the stellar mass, the total number of GCs and the GC specific
frequency ($S_N$). Most of the candidates span a range of stellar masses of
$10^7-10^8$~M$_{\odot}$. Based on the GC population of these newly discovered

  Shocks",,,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cepheids are pulsating variable stars with a periodic chromospheric response
at UV wavelengths close to their minimum radius phase. Recently, an X-ray
variable signature was captured in observations during the \emph{maximum}
radius phase. This X-ray emission came as a surprise and is not understood. In
this work, we use the modern astrophysical code, PLUTO, to investigate the
effects of pulsations on Cepheid X-ray emission. We run a number of
hydrodynamic numerical simulations with a variety of initial and boundary
conditions in order to explore the capability of shocks to produce the observed
phase-dependent X-ray behavior. Finally we use the Simulated Observations of
X-ray Sources (SOXS) package to create synthetic spectra for each simulation
case and link our simulations to observables. We show that, for certain
conditions, we can reproduce observed X-ray fluxes at phases 0.4--0.8 when the
Cepheid is at maximum radius. Our results span a wide range of mass-loss rates,
$2\times10^{-13}$--$3\times10^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and peak X-ray
luminosities, $5\times10^{-17}$--$1.4\times10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We
conclude that Cepheids exhibit \textit{two component emission} with (a) shock
waves being responsible for the phase dependent variable emission (phases 0.2 -
0.6), and (b) a separate quiescent mechanism being the dominant emission
mechanism for the remaining phases.

  Euler Equations",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the behavior of solutions to the incompressible $2d$ Euler equations
near two canonical shear flows with critical points, the Kolmogorov and
Poiseuille flows, with consequences for the associated Navier-Stokes problems.
  We exhibit a large family of new, non-trivial stationary states of analytic
regularity, that are arbitrarily close to the Kolmogorov flow on the square
torus $\mathbb{T}^2$. This situation contrasts strongly with the setting of
some monotone shear flows, such as the Couette flow: in both cases the
linearized problem exhibits an ""inviscid damping"" mechanism that leads to
relaxation of perturbations of the base flows back to nearby shear flows. While
this effect persists nonlinearly for suitably small and regular perturbations
of some monotone shear flows, for the Kolmogorov flow our result shows that
this is not possible.
  Our construction of these stationary states builds on a degeneracy in the
global structure of the Kolmogorov flow on $\mathbb{T}^2$. In this regard both
the Kolmogorov flow on a rectangular torus and the Poiseuille flow in a channel
are very different, and we show that the only stationary states near them must
indeed be shears, even in relatively low regularity $H^3$ resp. $H^{5+}$.
  In addition, we show that this behavior is mirrored closely in the related
Navier-Stokes settings: the linearized problems near the Poiseuille and
Kolmogorov flows both exhibit an enhanced rate of dissipation. Previous work by
us and others shows that this effect survives in the full, nonlinear problem
near the Poiseuille flow and near the Kolmogorov flow on rectangular tori,
provided that the perturbations lie below a certain threshold. However, we show
here that the corresponding result cannot hold near the Kolmogorov flow on
$\mathbb{T}^2$.

for exploration of nearby star systems. A challenging aspect of such technology
is returning scientific observational data to earth. We compare two
configurations for achieving this. A direct configuration utilizes optical
transmission from the probe to a terrestrial receiver employing a large photon
collector. In a relay configuration, probes spaced at uniform intervals act as
regenerative repeaters for the scientific data, which eventually arrives at a
terrestrial receiver from the most recently launched probe. A number of
advantages and disadvantages of the relay configuration are discussed. A
numerical comparison approximates equal probe mass in the two cases by using
the same optical transmit power and equivalent total transmit plus receive
aperture area. When the total downlink data rate is equal, the relay
configuration benefits from a smaller terrestrial receive collector, but also
requires very frequent launches to achieve higher data rates due to the
limitations on relay probe receive aperture area. The direct configuration can
achieve higher data rates without such frequent launches by increasing
terrestrial collector area. A single-point failure problem in the relay
configuration can be addressed by introducing relay-bypass modes, but only at
the expense of further increases in launch rate or reductions in data volume,
as well as a considerable increase in design and operational complexity. Taking
into account launch and collector area costs, the direct configuration is found
to achieve lower overall cost by a wide margin over a range of cost parameter
values and data rates.

recent ALMA observations reveals a wavelength dependent radial profile of the

the role of charge localization in proton-transfer dynamics is not well

contributions of coupled electron-nuclear non-adiabatic dynamics in the
presence of exchange and correlation functional errors. In this work, we
address this problem by simulating a model system of ionized linear H-bonded
water clusters using real-time Time Dependent Density Functional Theory
(rt-TDDFT)-based Ehrenfest dynamics. Our aim is to understand how
self-interaction error in semilocal exchange and correlation functionals
affects the probability of proton transfer. In particular, we show that for
H-bonded (H$_2$O)$_n^+$ chains (with $n>3$), the proton-transfer probability
attains a maximum, becoming comparable to that predicted by hybrid functionals.
This is because the formation of hemibonded-type geometries is largely
suppressed in extended H-bonded structures. We also show how the degree of
localization of the initial photo-hole is connected to the probability of a
proton-transfer reaction, as well as to the separation between electronic and
nuclear charge. These results are compared to those obtained with adiabatic
dynamics where the initial wavefunction is allowed to relax to the ground state
of the ion cluster, explaining why different functionals and dynamical
approaches lead to quantitatively different results.

computer graphics techniques is challenging, because it requires the difficult
step of capturing detailed appearance and geometry models. Recent studies have
demonstrated promising results by learning scene representations that
implicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However,
existing approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by the
limited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections of
camera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery from
these representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. In
this work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene
representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines
a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to
model local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying
voxel structures with a differentiable ray-marching operation from only a set
of posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novel
views can be accelerated by skipping the voxels containing no relevant scene
content. Our method is typically over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art
(namely, NeRF(Mildenhall et al., 2020)) at inference time while achieving
higher quality results. Furthermore, by utilizing an explicit sparse voxel
representation, our method can easily be applied to scene editing and scene
composition. We also demonstrate several challenging tasks, including
multi-scene learning, free-viewpoint rendering of a moving human, and
large-scale scene rendering. Code and data are available at our website:

additional photocurrent. Based on the principle of detailed balance, we
calculate a limiting solar conversion efficiency of 85% for fully concentrated

equal areas. Ideal and nonideal solar thermoradiative-photovoltaic systems
outperform solar thermophotovoltaic converters for low bandgaps and practical
absorber temperatures. Their performance enhancement results from a high
tolerance to nonradiative generation/recombination and an ability to minimize
radiative heat losses. We show that a realistic device with all major losses

studied the stellar populations to learn about the properties of the

and uneven amount of extinction across the field. Its slope reveals anomalous
extinction properties, with Av/E(B-V)=4.3, indicating the presence of an
additional grey component in the optical contributing about 30% of the total
extinction in the field and requiring big grains to be about twice as abundant
as in the diffuse ISM. This appears to be consistent with the amount of big
grains injected into the surrounding ISM by the about 70 SNII explosions
estimated to have occurred during the lifetime of the ~120 Myr old NGC 1938.
Although this cluster appears today relatively small and would be hard to
detect beyond the distance of M 31, with an estimated initial mass of ~4800

quantum many-body physics and computational complexity theory, with deep
implications to both fields. The main object of study is the LocalHamiltonian
problem, which is concerned with estimating the ground-state energy of a local
Hamiltonian and is complete for the class QMA, a quantum generalization of the
class NP. A major challenge in the field is to understand the complexity of the
LocalHamiltonian problem in more physically natural parameter regimes. One
crucial parameter in understanding the ground space of any Hamiltonian in
many-body physics is the spectral gap, which is the difference between the
smallest two eigenvalues. Despite its importance in quantum many-body physics,
the role played by the spectral gap in the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian
is less well-understood. In this work, we make progress on this question by
considering the precise regime, in which one estimates the ground-state energy
to within inverse exponential precision. Computing ground-state energies
precisely is a task that is important for quantum chemistry and quantum
many-body physics.
  In the setting of inverse-exponential precision, there is a surprising result
that the complexity of LocalHamiltonian is magnified from QMA to PSPACE, the
class of problems solvable in polynomial space. We clarify the reason behind
this boost in complexity. Specifically, we show that the full complexity of the
high precision case only comes about when the spectral gap is exponentially
small. As a consequence of the proof techniques developed to show our results,
we uncover important implications for the representability and circuit
complexity of ground states of local Hamiltonians, the theory of uniqueness of
quantum witnesses, and techniques for the amplification of quantum witnesses in
the presence of postselection.

spins down rotating black holes (BHs), dynamically endowing them with
equilibrium bosonic clouds, here dubbed synchronised gravitational atoms
(SGAs). The self-gravity of these same fields, on the other hand, can lump them
into (scalar or vector) horizonless solitons known as bosonic stars (BSs). We
show that the dynamics of BSs yields a new channel forming SGAs. We study BS
binaries that merge to form spinning BHs. After horizon formation, the BH spins
up by accreting the bosonic field, but a remnant lingers around the horizon. If
just enough angular momentum is present, the BH spin up stalls precisely as the
remnant becomes a SGA. Different initial data lead to SGAs with different
quantum numbers. Thus, SGAs may form both from superradiance-driven BH spin
down and accretion-driven BH spin up. The latter process, moreover, can result
in heavier SGAs than those obtained from the former: in one example herein,
$\sim 18\%$ of the final system's energy and $\sim 50\%$ of its angular
momentum remain in the SGA. We suggest that even higher values may occur in
systems wherein both accretion and superradiance contribute to the SGA
formation.

nature of states in topological crystalline systems may change depending on the

one-dimensional (1D) chain with inversion and chiral symmetries, where every
disorder configuration is inversion-symmetric. By using a basis-independent
formulation for the inversion topological invariant, chiral winding number, and
bulk polarization, we are able to construct phase diagrams for these quantities
when disorder is present. We show that unlike the chiral winding number and
bulk polarization, the inversion topological invariant can fluctuate when the
bulk spectral gap closes at strong disorder. Using the position-space
renormalization group, we are able to compare how the inversion topological
invariant, chiral winding number and bulk polarization behave at low energies
in the strong disorder limit. We show that with inversion symmetry-preserving
disorder, the value of the inversion topological invariant is determined by the
inversion eigenvalues of the states at the inversion centers, while quantities
such as the chiral winding number and the bulk polarization still have
contributions from every state throughout the chain. We also show that it is
possible to alter the value of the inversion topological invariant in a clean
system by occupying additional states at the inversion centers while keeping
the bulk polarization fixed. We discuss the implications of our results for
topological crystalline phases in higher-dimensional electronic systems, and in
ultra-cold atomic systems.

only on product states, and thus quantify both classical and quantum

linear combinations of bulk surfaces. The geometry of the surfaces can
preserve, partially break, or fully break the symmetry of the correlation

profile in the lens galaxy is the singular power-law model $\rho(r)\propto
r^{-\gamma}$. This model may be insufficiently flexible for very accurate work,
for example measuring the Hubble constant based on time delays between multiple
images. Here we derive the lensing properties - deflection angle, shear, and
magnification - of a more adaptable model where the projected mass surface
density is parameterised as a continuous two-dimensional broken power-law
(2DBPL). This elliptical 2DBPL model is characterised by power-law slopes
$t_1$, $t_2$ either side of the break radius $\theta_\mathrm{B}$. The key to
the 2DBPL model is the derivation of the lensing properties of the truncated
power law (TPL) model, where the surface density is a power law out to the
truncation radius $\theta_\mathrm{T}$ and zero beyond. This TPL model is also
useful by itself. We create mock observations of lensing by a TPL profile where
the images form outside the truncation radius, so there is no mass in the
annulus covered by the images. We then show that the slope of the profile
interior to the images may be accurately recovered for lenses of moderate
ellipticity. This demonstrates that the widely-held notion that lensing
measures the slope of the mass profile in the annulus of the images, and is
insensitive to the mass distribution at radii interior to the images, is
incorrect.

(unmagnetized) jets, finding that mixing of jet-cocoon material gives rise to
an interface layer, termed jet-cocoon interface (JCI), which contains a
significant fraction of the system energy. We find that the angular structure
of the jet + JCI, when they reach the homologous phase, can be approximated by
a flat core (the jet) + a power-law function (the JCI) with indices that depend
on the degree of mixing. In this paper we examine the effect of subdominant
toroidal magnetic fields on the jet evolution and morphology. We find that weak
fields can stabilize the jet against local instabilities. The suppression of
the mixing diminishes the JCI and thus reshapes the jet's post-breakout
structure. Nevertheless, the overall shape of the outflow can still be
approximated by a flat core + a power-law function, although the JCI power-law
decay is steeper. The effect of weak fields is more prominent in long GRB jets,
where the mixing in hydrodynamic jets is stronger. In short GRB jets there is
small mixing in both weakly magnetized and unmagnetized jets. This result
influences the expected jet emission which is governed by the jet's morphology.
Therefore, prompt and afterglow observations in long GRBs may be used as probes
for the magnetic nature at the base of the jets.

a combination of two components: the non-thermal emission arising from the
aurora on the A0p star and the hot thermal plasma filling the extended shell

a hybrid model involving the stellar magnetosphere along with a hot shell

  Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.EP astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Circumbinary discs are generally thought to take up angular momentum and
energy from the binary orbit over time through gravitational torques mediated
by orbital resonances. This process leads to the shrinkage of the binary orbit
over time, and is important in a variety of astrophysical contexts including
the orbital evolution of stellar binaries, the migration of planets in
protoplanetary discs, and the evolution of black hole binaries (stellar and
supermassive). The merger of compact object binaries provides a source of
gravitational waves in the Universe. Recently, several groups have reported
numerical simulations of circumbinary discs that yield the opposite result,
finding that the binary expands with time. Here we argue that this result is
primarily due to the choice of simulation parameters, made for numerical
reasons, which differ from realistic disc parameters in many cases. We provide
physical arguments, and then demonstrate with 3D hydrodynamical simulations,
that thick (high pressure, high viscosity) discs drive sufficient accretion of
high angular momentum material to force binary expansion, while in the more
realistic case of thin (low pressure, low viscosity) discs there is less
accretion and the binary shrinks. In the latter case, tides, which generally
transfer angular momentum and energy from the more rapidly rotating object (the
binary) to the less rapidly rotating object (the disc), are the dominant driver
of disc-binary evolution. This causes the binary to shrink. We therefore
conclude that for common circumbinary disc parameters, binaries with
non-extreme mass ratios are expected to shrink over time. Expansion of the
binary can occur if the disc viscosity is unusually high, which may occur in
the very thick discs encountered in e.g. circumplanetary discs, super-Eddington
AGN, or the outer regions of passive protostellar discs that are heated by the

increasing overionization from east to west. The latter result is consistent
with previous studies, and we attribute the overionization in the west to
adiabatic expansion. However, our findings contrast these prior works as we
find evidence of overionization in the east as well. As the SNR is interacting
with molecular material there, we investigate the plausibility of thermal
conduction as the origin of the rapid cooling. We show that based on the

J121218.5+273255.1 ($z=0.35$; hereafter RMJ1212; also known as Abell 1489).
This cluster is amongst the top 0.1\% richest clusters in the redMaPPer
catalog; it is significantly detected in X-ray and through the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in ROSAT and \emph{Planck} data, respectively; and
its optical luminosity distribution implies a very large lens, following
mass-to-light scaling relations. Based on these properties it was chosen for
the Webb Medium Deep Fields (WMDF) JWST/GTO program. In preparation for this
program, RMJ1212 was recently imaged with GMOS on Gemini North and in seven
optical and near-infrared bands with the \emph{Hubble Space Telescope}. We use
these data to map the inner mass distribution of the cluster, uncovering
various sets of multiple images. We also search for high-redshift candidates in
the data, as well as for transient sources. We find over a dozen high-redshift
($z\gtrsim6$) candidates based on both photometric redshift and the dropout
technique. No prominent ($\gtrsim5 \sigma$) transients were found in the data
between the two HST visits. Our lensing analysis reveals a relatively large
lens with an effective Einstein radius of $\theta_{E}\simeq32\pm3''$
($z_{s}=2$), in broad agreement with the scaling-relation expectations. RMJ1212
demonstrates that powerful lensing clusters can be selected in a robust and
automated way following the light-traces-mass assumption.

close stellar encounters perturbing the dynamical evolution of planetary
systems in these clusters. Here, we present the results from direct $N$-body
simulations of multiplanetary systems embedded in star clusters containing $N =
8k, 16k, 32k$, and $64k$ stars. The planetary systems, which consist of the
four Solar system giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are
initialized in different orbital configurations, to study the effect of the
system architecture on the dynamical evolution of the entire planetary system,
and on the escape rate of the individual planets. We find that the current
orbital parameters of the Solar system giants (with initially circular orbits,
as well as with present-day eccentricities) and a slightly more compact
configuration, have a high resilience against stellar perturbations. A
configuration with initial mean-motion resonances of 3:2, 3:2, and 5:4 between
the planets, which is inspired by the Nice model, and for which the two
outermost planets are usually ejected within the first $10^5$ yr, is in many
cases stabilized due to the removal of the resonances by external stellar
perturbation and by the rapid ejection of at least one planet. Assigning all
planets the same mass of 1 Jovian mass almost equalizes the survival fractions.
Our simulations reproduce the broad diversity amongst observed exoplanet
systems. We find not only many very wide and/or eccentric orbits, but also a
significant number of (stable) retrograde orbits.

domain of quantum statistical mechanics, they may realize more readily than
traditional experimental platforms. As a particularly well-suited target, we
identify discrete time crystals (DTCs), novel non-equilibrium states of matter
that break time translation symmetry. These can only be realized in the
intrinsically out-of-equilibrium setting of periodically driven quantum systems
stabilized by disorder induced many-body localization. While precursors of the
DTC have been observed across a variety of experimental platforms - ranging
from trapped ions to nitrogen vacancy centers to NMR crystals - none have
\emph{all} the necessary ingredients for realizing a fully-fledged incarnation
of this phase, and for detecting its signature long-range \emph{spatiotemporal
order}. We show that a new generation of quantum simulators can be programmed
to realize the DTC phase and to experimentally detect its dynamical properties,
a task requiring extensive capabilities for programmability, initialization and
read-out. Specifically, the architecture of Google's Sycamore processor is a
remarkably close match for the task at hand. We also discuss the effects of
environmental decoherence, and how they can be distinguished from `internal'
decoherence coming from closed-system thermalization dynamics. Already with
existing technology and noise levels, we find that DTC spatiotemporal order
would be observable over hundreds of periods, with parametric improvements to
come as the hardware advances.

show how the initial properties of the host cluster set the typical orbital
parameters and formation times of the formed triples. We find that a cluster
typically assembles hundreds of triples with at least one black hole (BH) in
the inner binary, while only clusters with sufficiently small virial radii are
efficient in producing triples with no BHs, as a result of the BH-burning
process. We show that a typical GC is expected to host tens of triples with at
least one luminous component at present day. We discuss how the Lidov-Kozai

eccentricities, whenever it takes place before the triple is dynamically
reprocessed by encountering another cluster member. Some of these systems can
reach sufficiently large eccentricities to form a variety of transients and

bound states, thus offering in principle the opportunity of benchmark
determinations. We critically analyze recent proposals to extract accurately
and precisely the $X(3872)$ mass, which overlook an important physical effect
by regarding their corresponding production lineshapes as a sharp mass
distribution and, thus, neglecting the influence of initial nearby continuum
states in the $1^{++}$ channel. The inclusion of these states implies an
effective cancellation mechanism which operates at the current and finite
experimental resolution of the detectors so that one cannot distinguish between
the $1^{++}$ bound-state and nearby $D \bar D^*$ continuum states with the same
quantum numbers. In particular, we show that the lineshape for resolutions
above 1 MeV becomes rather insensitive to the binding energy unless high
statistics is considered. The very existence of the observed bumps is a mere
consequence of short distance correlated $\bar D D^*$ pairs, bound or unbound.
The cancellation also provides a natural explanation for a recent study
reporting missing but unknown decay channels in an absolute branching ratio

Guarantee Scheme for dry-land arable farming. The scheme purports to assist
dry-land crop farmers who have taken loans with participating banks or lending

due to drought, floods, frost or hailstorm. Nonetheless, to date, the scheme
has focused solely on drought. The scheme has placed an unsustainable financial

This paper argues that the level of Government subsidies should take into

circumvent the challenges of correlated climate risks and recommends a quasi

creating tailor-made surface structures with dedicated functionalities. Varying
the intermolecular interactions allows for tuning the resulting molecular

involved intermolecular interactions is often limited to attractive forces
only. In real systems, the intermolecular interaction can be composed of both,
attractive and repulsive forces. Adjusting the balance between these
interactions provides a promising strategy for extending the structural variety
in molecular self-assembly on surfaces. This strategy, however, relies on a
method to quantify the involved interactions. Here, we investigate a molecular
model system of 3-hydroxybenzoic acid molecules on calcite (10.4) in ultrahigh
vacuum. This system offers both anisotropic short-range attraction and
long-range repulsion between the molecules, resulting in the self-assembly of
molecular stripes. We analyze the stripe-to-stripe distance distribution and
the stripe length distribution and compare these distributions with analytical
expressions from an anisotropic Ising model with additional repulsive
interaction. We show that this approach allows to extract quantitative
information about the strength of the attractive and repulsive interactions.

sensitive data raises concerns about the privacy of individual participants.
For example, summary statistics of a genome-wide association study can be used

considerable privacy risk has led to restrictions in accessing genomic and

every user must adapt to this mapping over repeated interactions. Instead, we
propose a personalized method for learning the human's preferred or

identify an alignment model that transforms the human's inputs so that the

data-efficient by recognizing that human mappings have strong priors: we expect
the input space to be proportional, reversable, and consistent. Incorporating
these priors ensures that the robot learns an intuitive mapping from few

assistive settings, where each user has different personal preferences and
physical capabilities for teleoperating the robot arm. Our simulated and

this work is the dynamic switching between different representations of the
phase distributions, namely truncated Fourier series and normal distributions.
The Fourier-series representation has the advantage of being exact in many
cases, but suffers from increasing complexity with each update of the prior.
This necessitates truncation of the series, which eventually causes the
distribution to become unstable. We derive bounds on the error in representing
normal distributions with a truncated Fourier series, and use these to decide
when to switch to the normal-distribution representation. This representation
is much simpler, and was proposed in conjunction with rejection filtering for
approximate Bayesian updates. We show that, in many cases, the update can be
done exactly using analytic expressions, thereby greatly reducing the time
complexity of the updates. Finally, when dealing with a superposition of
several eigenstates, we need to estimate the relative weights. This can be
formulated as a convex optimization problem, which we solve using a
gradient-projection algorithm. By updating the weights at exponentially scaled
iterations we greatly reduce the computational complexity without affecting the
overall accuracy.

the remnant with very little emission in front of or behind them, we obtained
the nearly uncontaminated spectra of the knots. In the southernmost knot, the
RGS successfully resolved numerous emission lines from Si, Ne, O He$\alpha$ and
Ly$\alpha$, and Fe L-shell. This is the first clear detection of O lines in
Tycho's SNR. Line broadening was measured to be $\sim 3$ eV for the O
He$\alpha$ and $\sim 4.5$ eV for Fe L lines. If we attribute the broadening to
pure thermal Doppler effects, then we obtain kT$_{O}$ and kT$_{Fe}$ to be $\sim
400$ keV and 1.5 MeV, respectively. These temperatures can be explained by
heating in a reverse shock with a shock velocity of $\sim 3500$ km s$^{-1}$.
The abundances obtained from fitting the RGS and MOS data together imply
substantially elevated amounts of these materials, confirming previous studies
that the knots are heated by a reverse shock, and thus contain ejecta material

obtained from 16 diverse contents. In order to understand the combined effects
of compression and frame rate adjustment, we also processed videos at 5
compression levels at each frame rate. To obtain subjective labels on the
videos, we conducted a human study yielding 19,000 human quality ratings

evaluation of existing state-of-the-art Full and No-Reference video quality
algorithms, and statistically benchmarked their performance on the new

Euclidean spanners, proves that the lightness (normalized weight) of the greedy
$(1+\epsilon)$-spanner in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-d})$ for any
$d = O(1)$ and any $\epsilon = \Omega(n^{-\frac{1}{d-1}})$ (where $\tilde{O}$
hides polylogarithmic factors of $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$), and also shows the
existence of point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for which any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner
must have lightness $\Omega(\epsilon^{-d})$. Given this tight bound on the
lightness, a natural arising question is whether a better lightness bound can
be achieved using Steiner points.
  Our first result is a construction of Steiner spanners in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with
lightness $O(\epsilon^{-1} \log \Delta)$, where $\Delta$ is the spread of the
point set. In the regime of $\Delta \ll 2^{1/\epsilon}$, this provides an
improvement over the lightness bound of Le and Solomon [FOCS 2019]; this regime
of parameters is of practical interest, as point sets arising in real-life
applications (e.g., for various random distributions) have polynomially bounded
spread, while in spanner applications $\epsilon$ often controls the precision,
and it sometimes needs to be much smaller than $O(1/\log n)$. Moreover, for
spread polynomially bounded in $1/\epsilon$, this upper bound provides a
quadratic improvement over the non-Steiner bound of Le and Solomon [FOCS 2019],
We then demonstrate that such a light spanner can be constructed in
$O_{\epsilon}(n)$ time for polynomially bounded spread, where $O_{\epsilon}$
hides a factor of $\mathrm{poly}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. Finally, we extend the
construction to higher dimensions, proving a lightness upper bound of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-(d+1)/2} + \epsilon^{-2}\log \Delta)$ for any $3\leq d =
O(1)$ and any $\epsilon = \Omega(n^{-\frac{1}{d-1}})$.

exactly solvable spin-liquid ground state with fractionalized Majorana
excitations and its possible materialization in magnetic Mott insulators with
strong spin-orbit couplings. Recently, the 5d-electron compound
H$_{3}$LiIr$_{2}$O$_{6}$ has shown to be a strong candidate for Kitaev physics
considering the absence of any signs of a long-range ordered magnetic state. In
this work, we demonstrate that a finite density of random vacancies in the
Kitaev model gives rise to a striking pileup of low-energy Majorana eigenmodes
and reproduces the apparent power-law upturn in the specific heat measurements
of H$_{3}$LiIr$_{2}$O$_{6}$. Physically, the vacancies can originate from
various sources such as missing magnetic moments or the presence of
non-magnetic impurities (true vacancies), or from local weak couplings of
magnetic moments due to strong but rare bond randomness (quasivacancies). We
show numerically that the vacancy effect is readily detectable even at low
vacancy concentrations and that it is not very sensitive neither to nature of
vacancies nor to different flux backgrounds. We also study the response of the
site-diluted Kitaev spin liquid to the three-spin interaction term, which
breaks time-reversal symmetry and imitates an external magnetic field. We
propose a field-induced flux-sector transition where the ground state becomes
flux free for larger fields, resulting in a clear suppression of the low
temperature specific heat. Finally, we discuss the effect of dangling Majorana
fermions in the case of true vacancies and show that their coupling to an
applied magnetic field via the Zeeman interaction can also account for the
scaling behavior in the high-field limit observed in H$_{3}$LiIr$_{2}$O$_{6}$.

smaller vocabulary and thus faster training times in comparison to NNLMs based

character and multi-character NNLMs suffer from data sparsity. In such
scenarios, cross-lingual transfer has improved multi-character NNLM performance
by allowing information transfer from a source to the target language. In the
same vein, we propose to use cross-lingual transfer for character NNLMs applied
to low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, applying
cross-lingual transfer to character NNLMs is not as straightforward. We observe
that relatedness of the source language plays an important role in
cross-lingual pretraining of character NNLMs. We evaluate this aspect on ASR
tasks for two target languages: Finnish (with English and Estonian as source)
and Swedish (with Danish, Norwegian, and English as source). Prior work has
observed no difference between using the related or unrelated language for
multi-character NNLMs. We, however, show that for character-based NNLMs, only
pretraining with a related language improves the ASR performance, and using an
unrelated language may deteriorate it. We also observe that the benefits are
larger when there is much lesser target data than source data.

fundamental requirements of all these systems is to spatially partition the
data efficiently across machines. The core challenges of big spatial
partitioning are building high spatial quality partitions while simultaneously
taking advantages of distributed processing models by providing load balanced
partitions. Previous works on big spatial partitioning are to reuse existing
index search trees as-is, e.g., the R-tree family, STR, Kd-tree, and Quad-tree,
by building a temporary tree for a sample of the input and use its leaf nodes
as partition boundaries. However, we show in this paper that none of those
techniques has addressed the mentioned challenges completely. This paper
proposes a novel partitioning method, termed R*-Grove, which can partition very
large spatial datasets into high quality partitions with excellent load balance
and block utilization. This appealing property allows R*-Grove to outperform
existing techniques in spatial query processing. R*-Grove can be easily
integrated into any big data platforms such as Apache Spark or Apache Hadoop.
Our experiments show that R*-Grove outperforms the existing partitioning
techniques for big spatial data systems. With all the proposed work publicly
available as open source, we envision that R*-Grove will be adopted by the
community to better serve big spatial data research.

queueing system with arrivals stemming from $N$ separate information sources,
with the aim of modeling a generic status update system. In this model, a new
information packet arrival from source $m$ is allowed to preempt a packet from
source $n$ in service, with a probability depending on $n$ and $m$. To make the
model even more general than the existing ones, for each of the information
sources, we assume a distinct PH-type service time distribution and a distinct
packet error probability. Subsequently, we obtain the exact distributions of
the AoI and PAoI for each of the information sources using matrix-analytical
algorithms and in particular the theory of Markov fluid queues and sample path
arguments. This is in contrast with existing methods that rely on Stochastic
Hybrid Systems (SHS) which obtain only the average values and in less general

  We present the basic relation between the linear potential theory and random
walks. This fundamental connection, developed by Ito, Doob, Levy and others,
relies on the observation that harmonic functions and martingales share a
common cancellation property, expressed via mean value properties. It turns out
that, with appropriate modifications, a similar observation and approach can be
applied also in the nonlinear case, which is of main interest in our Course
Notes. Thus, the present Chapter serves as a stepping stone towards gaining
familiarity with more complex nonlinear constructions.
  After recalling the equivalent defining properties of harmonic functions, we
introduce the ball walk. This is an infinite horizon discrete process, in which
at each step the particle, initially placed at some point $x_0$ in the open,
bounded domain $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, is randomly advanced to a new
position, uniformly distributed within the following open ball: centered at the
current placement, and with radius equal to the minimum of the parameter
$\epsilon$ and the distance from the boundary $\partial\mathcal{D}$. With
probability one, such process accumulates on $\partial\mathcal{D}$ and
$u^\epsilon(x_0)$ is then defined as the expected value of the given boundary
data $F$ at the process limiting position. Each function $u^\epsilon$ is
harmonic, and if $\partial\mathcal{D}$ is regular, then each $u^\epsilon$
coincides with the unique harmonic extension of $F$ in $\mathcal{D}$. One
sufficient condition for regularity is the exterior cone condition.

recognize new compositions in new video frames, such as ""washing carrot"" or

ejection angle can be controlled by adjustment of the vortex opening angle, a
feature unique to vortex projectiles. Additionally, an inherent uncertainty in

intermetallics and x = 0.57 for the hydrides and deuterides. A sharp first
order ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (FM-AFM) transition is observed upon
heating at TFM-AFM for both hydrides and deuterides. These compounds show two
different types of field induced transitions, which have different physical
origin. At low temperature (T < 50 K), a forced ferri-ferromagnetic
metamagnetic transition with Btrans1 = 8 T, related to the change of the Er
moments orientation from antiparallel to parallel Fe moment, is observed.
Btrans1 is not sensitive to Er concentration, temperature and isotope effect. A
second metamagnetic transition resulting from antiferromagnetic to
ferrimagnetic state is also observed. The transition field Btrans2 increases
linearly versus temperature and relates to the itinerant electron metamagnetic
behavior of the Fe sublattice. An onset temperature TM0 is obtained by
extrapolating TFM-AFM (B) at zero field. TM0 decreases linearly versus the Er
content and is 45(5) K higher for the hydrides compared to the corresponding

in one direction ($z$), to a 2D mean-field equation. We address this problem
for the confining potential with a singular term, viz.,
$V_{z}(z)=2z^{2}+\zeta^{2}/z^{2}$, with constant $\zeta$. A quantum phase
transition is induced by the latter term, between the ground state (GS) of the
harmonic oscillator and the 3D condensate split in two parallel non-interacting
layers, which is a manifestation of the ""superselection"" effect. A realization
of the respective physical setting is proposed, making use of resonant coupling
to an optical field, with the resonance detuning modulated along $z$. The
reduction of the full 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) to the 2D
nonpolynomial Schr\""odinger equation (NPSE) is based on the factorized ansatz,
with the $z$-dependent multiplier represented by an exact GS solution of the
Schr\""odinger equation with potential $V(z)$. For both repulsive and attractive
signs of the nonlinearity, the NPSE produces GS and vortex states, that are
virtually indistinguishable from the respective numerical solutions provided by
full 3D GPE. In the case of the self-attraction, the threshold for the onset of
the collapse, predicted by the 2D NPSE, is also virtually identical to its
counterpart obtained from the 3D equation. In the same case, stability and
instability of vortices with topological charge $S=1$, $2$, and $3$ are
considered in detail. Thus, the procedure of the spatial-dimension reduction,
3D $\rightarrow$ 2D, produces very accurate results, and it may be used in

find that $\alpha$ is almost pressure-independent for $T\gtrsim$60 K up to
$p\sim$2 GPa, but shows a pronounced $p$ dependence for $T\lesssim$60K. Using
this manganin manometer, we demonstrate that $p$ overall decreases with
decreasing temperature in the piston-cylinder cell for the full pressure range

the values of physical parameters, but one can also ask simpler questions, such
as ""is the system in state A or state B?"". In quantum mechanics, the latter
type of measurements can be studied and optimized using the framework of
quantum hypothesis testing. In many cases one can explicitly find the optimal
measurement in the limit where one has simultaneous access to a large number
$n$ of identical copies of the system, and estimate the expected error as $n$

nuclear burning generates waves that propagate toward the stellar surface,
heating the envelope and potentially triggering mass loss. In this work, we
improve on previous one-dimensional models by performing two-dimensional
simulations of the pre-supernova mass ejection phase due wave heat deposition.
Beginning with stellar evolutionary models of a 15 $M_{\odot}$ red supergiant
star during core O-burning, we treat the energy deposition rate and duration as
model parameters and examine the mass-loss dependence and the pre-explosion
morphology accordingly. Unlike one-dimensional models, density inversions due
to wave heating are smoothed by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, and the primary
effect of wave heating is to radially expand the star's hydrogen envelope. For
low heating rates with long durations, the expansion is nearly homologous,
whereas high but short-lived heating can generate a shock that drives envelope
expansion and results in a qualitatively different density profile at the time
of core-collapse. Asymmetries are fairly small, and large amounts of mass loss
are unlikely unless the wave heating exceeds expectations. We discuss
implications for pre-supernova stellar variability and supernovae light curves.

respects information exchange constraints posed by a communication network

apportioning the share of generation that each DER needs to provide towards

(KMD) based algorithm to detect and identify false data attacks in real-time.
The Koopman modes (KMs) are capable of capturing the nonlinear modes of
oscillation in the transient dynamics of the power networks and reveal the
spatial embedding of both natural and anomalous modes of oscillations in the
sensor measurements. The Koopman-based spatio-temporal nonlinear modal analysis
is used to filter out the false data injected by an attacker. The performance
of the algorithm is illustrated on the IEEE 68-bus test system using synthetic

possible scenarios of periodic and disordered pinscapes. This approach allows
to extract the mutual friction between the superfluid and the normal component

In polydisperse hard-disk systems of lognormal distributions, although the

the re-entrant melting of hexatic or solid phase can not be observed in

match the frequency of impactors derived from New Horizons crater counts on
Charon (Singer et al 2019). Using an analytic model and a suite of numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that collisional cascades generate wavy size
distributions; the morphology of the waves depends on the binding energy of
solids $Q_d^\star$ and the collision velocity $v_c$. For an adopted minimum
size of solids, $r_{min}$ = 1 micron, and collision velocity $v_c$ = 1-3
km/sec, the waves are rather insensitive to the gravitational component of
$Q_d^\star$. If the bulk strength component of $Q_d^\star$ is $Q_s r^{e_s}$ for
particles with radius $r$, size distributions with small $Q_s$ are much wavier
than those with large $Q_s$; systems with $e_s \approx -0.4$ have stronger
waves than systems with $e_s \approx 0$. Detailed comparisons with the New
Horizons data suggest that a collisional cascade among solids with a bulk
strength intermediate between weak ice (Leinhardt & Stewart 2012) and normal
ice (Schlichting et al 2013) produces size distributions fairly similar to the
size distribution of impactors on Charon. If the surface density $\Sigma$ of
the protosolar nebula varies with semimajor axis $a$ as $\Sigma \approx 30~{\rm
g~cm^{-2}} (a / {\rm 1~au})^{-3/2}$, the time scale for a cascade to generate
an approximate equilibrium is 100-300 Myr at 45 au and 10-30 Myr at 25 au.
Although it is necessary to perform more complete evolutionary calculations of
the Kuiper belt, collisional cascades are a viable model for producing the size
distribution of solids that impacted Charon throughout its history.

neutrinos in the gravitational background lead to an asymmetric propagation of
lepton and anti-leptons which allows a Ricci scalar and neutrino Dirac-Yukawa
coupling dependent chemical potential and therefore a lepton asymmetry in
equilibrium. At high temperature, lepton number violating scattering processes
try to maintain a dynamically generated lepton asymmetry in equilibrium.
However, when the temperature drops down, the interactions become weaker, and
the asymmetry freezes out. The frozen out asymmetry can act as a pre-existing
asymmetry prior to the standard Fukugita-Yanagida leptogenesis phase ($T_i\sim
M_i$, where $M_i$ is the mass of $i$th RH neutrino). It is then natural to
consider the viability of gravitational leptogenesis for a given RH mass
spectrum which is not consistent with successful leptogenesis from decays.
Primary threat to this gravity-induced lepton asymmetry to be able to
successfully reproduce the observed baryon-to-photon ratio is the lepton number
violating washout processes at $T_i\sim M_i$. In a minimal seesaw set up with
two RH neutrinos, these washout processes are strong enough to erase a
pre-existing asymmetry of significant magnitude. We show that when effects of
flavour on the washout processes are taken into account, the mechanism opens up
the possibility of successful leptogenesis (gravitational) for a mass spectrum
$M_2\gg 10^9 {\rm GeV}\gg M_1$ with $M_1 \gtrsim 6.3 \times 10^6$ GeV. We then
briefly discuss how, in general, the mechanism leaves its imprints on the low

inception-based neural network (SSM-Net) was firstly exploited to predict the
model transform, shape control parameters and a fine-tuning vector, for the
generation of prostate boundary. According to the inferred boundary, a
normalized distance map was calculated. Then, a residual U-net (ResU-Net) was
employed to predict a probability label map from the input images. Finally, the
average of the distance map and the probability map was regarded as the
prostate segmentation. After that, two public dataset PROMISE12 and NCI- ISBI

testing. The validation results demonstrate that the segmentation framework
using a SSM with 9500 nodes achieved the best performance, with a dice of 0.904

(SL-PCTDs) are not sustainable beyond a certain temperature bias, necessitating
reasonably compatible designs. Manipulating the heat transfer in the forward
and reverse directions of the SL-PCTD is of great practical interest to achieve
persistent performance. Herein, a SL-PCTD prototype is investigated under the
supercooling effect of a phase change material (calcium chloride hexahydrate).
In the forward direction, supercooling effect plays a significant role in
sustaining natural convection far below the melting temperature (30 C), which
leads to robust heat transfer within a temperature bias of 10-40 C. While in
the reverse direction, dislodging the supercooling via manual supercooling
release (MSR) within a large temperature range of 30-7 C tends to greatly
inhibit heat transfer. As a consequence, thermal rectification ratio of 2.95 is
achieved, which is competitively sustainable at large temperature bias compared
to the SL-PCTD without supercooling effect. To address the effect of
supercooling on thermal rectification comprehensively, thermal resistance
approach is applied to theoretically model the SL-PCTD, which shows a good
agreement with experimental data. Such a device with supercooling control in
only one direction is further named as the SL-PCTD with gating functionality,
where manipulating supercooling effect of phase change material opens up a
feasible avenue for enabling generalized thermal diode.

is challenging because the fiber aspect ratios can be as large as $10^4$. We
describe a new method for rapidly computing the dynamics of inextensible
slender filaments in periodically-sheared Stokes flow. The dynamics of the
filaments are governed by a nonlocal slender body theory which we partially
reformulate in terms of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa hydrodynamic tensor. To
enforce inextensibility, we parameterize the space of inextensible fiber
motions and strictly confine the dynamics to the manifold of inextensible
configurations. To do this, we introduce a set of Lagrange multipliers for the
tensile force densities on the filaments and impose the constraint of no
virtual work in an $L^2$ weak sense. We augment this approach with a spectral
discretization of the local and nonlocal slender body theory operators which is
linear in the number of unknowns and gives improved spatial accuracy over
approaches based on solving a line tension equation. For dynamics, we develop a
second-order semi-implicit temporal integrator which requires at most a few
evaluations of nonlocal hydrodynamics and a few block diagonal linear solves
per time step. After demonstrating the improved accuracy and robustness of our
approach through numerical examples, we apply our formulation to a permanently
cross-linked actin mesh in a background oscillatory shear flow. We observe a
characteristic frequency at which the network transitions from quasi-static,
primarily elastic behavior to dynamic, primarily viscous behavior. We find that
nonlocal hydrodynamics increases the viscous modulus by as much as 25%, even
for semi-dilute fiber suspensions.

thermodynamics, heat and work, and with them, the concept of entropy, are
relative to a class of envisaged manipulations. This view has been dismissed by
many philosophers of physics, in my opinion too hastily. This paper is a sketch
and defense of a science of manipulations and their effects on physical
systems. This is, I claim, the best way to make sense of thermodynamics as it
is found in textbooks and as it is practiced. I call this science

$\Theta \Delta^{cs}$ is a legitimate science. An upshot of the discussion is a
clarification of the roles of the Gibbs and von Neumann entropies. Given the
definition of statistical thermo-dynamic entropy, it can be proven that, under
the assumption of availability of thermodynamically reversible processes, these
functions are the unique (up to an additive constant) functions that represent
thermo-dynamic entropy. Light is also shed on the use of coarse-grained

have long been desired to enable a superconducting computer. A superconducting
loop that includes a Josephson junction can store a flux quantum state in
picoseconds. However, the requirement for the loop inductance to create a
bi-state hysteresis sets a limit on the minimal area occupied by a single
memory cell. Here, we present a miniaturized superconducting memory cell based
on a Three-Dimensional (3D) Nb nano-Superconducting QUantum Interference Device
(nano-SQUID). The major cell area here fits within an 8*9 {\mu}m^2 rectangle
with a cross-selected function for memory implementation. The cell shows
periodic tunable hysteresis between two neighbouring flux quantum states
produced by bias current sweeping because of the large modulation depth of the
3D nano-SQUID (~66%). Furthermore, the measured Current-Phase Relations (CPRs)
of nano-SQUIDs are shown to be skewed from a sine function, as predicted by
theoretical modelling. The skewness and the critical current of 3D nano-SQUIDs
are linearly correlated. It is also found that the hysteresis loop size is in a
linear scaling relationship with the CPR skewness using the statistics from
characterisation of 26 devices. We show that the CPR skewness range of
{\pi}/4~3{\pi}/4 is equivalent to a large loop inductance in creating a stable
bi-state hysteresis for memory implementation. Therefore, the skewed CPR of 3D
nano-SQUID enables further superconducting memory cell miniaturization by
overcoming the inductance limitation of the loop area.

such as satellites, cellular base stations and wireless access points are
continuously producing tremendous amounts of location data of moving objects.
The ability to discover moving objects that travel together, i.e., traveling
companions, from their trajectories is desired by many applications such as
intelligent transportation systems and location-based services. Existing
algorithms are either based on pattern mining methods that define a particular
pattern of traveling companions or based on representation learning methods
that learn similar representations for similar trajectories. The former methods
suffer from the pairwise point-matching problem and the latter often ignore the
temporal proximity between trajectories. In this work, we propose a generic
deep representation learning model using autoencoders, namely, ATTN-MEAN, for
the discovery of traveling companions. ATTN-MEAN collectively injects spatial
and temporal information into its input embeddings using skip-gram, positional
encoding techniques, respectively. Besides, our model further encourages
trajectories to learn from their neighbours by leveraging the
Sort-Tile-Recursive algorithm, mean operation and global attention mechanism.
After obtaining the representations from the encoders, we run DBSCAN to cluster
the representations to find travelling companion. The corresponding
trajectories in the same cluster are considered as traveling companions.
Experimental results suggest that ATTN-MEAN performs better than the
state-of-the-art algorithms on finding traveling companions.

the observed evolution by a model in which $dN/dX$ decreases linearly with

evolve faster with redshift and appear later in the universe. The cosmological
Technicolor Dawn simulations at $z=3-5$ over-produce the observed abundance of

prediction error and computational requirement (such as the number of
floating-point operations or FLOPs) with the same storage requirement as a
single model. They are useful for reducing maintenance overhead for deploying
models to devices with different memory constraints and are useful for
optimizing the efficiency of a system with many CNNs. However, existing
slimmable network approaches either do not optimize layer-wise widths or
optimize the shared-weights and layer-wise widths independently, thereby
leaving significant room for improvement by joint width and weight
optimization. In this work, we propose a general framework to enable joint
optimization for both width configurations and weights of slimmable networks.
Our framework subsumes conventional and NAS-based slimmable methods as special
cases and provides flexibility to improve over existing methods. From a
practical standpoint, we propose Joslim, an algorithm that jointly optimizes
both the widths and weights for slimmable nets, which outperforms existing
methods for optimizing slimmable networks across various networks, datasets,
and objectives. Quantitatively, improvements up to 1.7% and 8% in top-1
accuracy on the ImageNet dataset can be attained for MobileNetV2 considering
FLOPs and memory footprint, respectively. Our results highlight the potential
of optimizing the channel counts for different layers jointly with the weights

  Simulations",,,"10.3847/2041-8213/aba68d",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the course of the recent decades, $N$-body simulations have become a
standard tool for quantifying the gravitational perturbations that ensue in
planet-forming disks. Within the context of such simulations, massive
non-central bodies are routinely classified into ""big"" and ""small"" particles,
where big objects interact with all other objects self-consistently, while
small bodies interact with big bodies but not with each other. Importantly,
this grouping translates to an approximation scheme where the orbital evolution
of small bodies is dictated entirely by the dynamics of the big bodies,
yielding considerable computational advantages with little added cost in terms
of astrophysical accuracy. Here we point out, however, that this scheme can
also yield spurious dynamical behaviour, where even in absence of big bodies
within a simulation, indirect coupling among small bodies can lead to
excitation of the constituent ""non-interacting"" orbits. We demonstrate this
self-stirring by carrying out a sequence of numerical experiments, and confirm
that this effect is largely independent of the time-step or the employed
integration algorithm. Furthermore, adopting the growth of angular momentum
deficit as a proxy for dynamical excitation, we explore its dependence on time,
the cumulative mass of the system, as well as the total number of particles
present in the simulation. Finally, we examine the degree of such indirect
excitation within the context of conventional terrestrial planet formation
calculations, and conclude that although some level of caution may be
warranted, this effect plays a negligible role in driving the simulated
dynamical evolution.

its direct solution intractable, we optimally solve this problem via
equivalently solving a sequence of convex second-order cone program feasibility
problems together with a bisection search. Next, we consider distributed power
control in the other scenario without a centralized controller, for which an
alternative IT-based method is proposed to characterize the same MSE Pareto

AP only needs to individually control the power of its associated devices, but
subject to a set of IT constraints on their interference to neighboring cells,
while different APs can cooperate in iteratively updating the IT levels by
pairwise information exchange, to achieve a Pareto-optimal MSE tuple. Last,
simulation results demonstrate that cooperative power control using the

Amoebas recently emerged from the study of forced patterns in $2$-colorings of
the edges of the complete graph in the context of Ramsey-Turan theory and
played an important role in extremal zero-sum problems. Amoebas are graphs with
a unique behavior with regards to the following operation: Let $G$ be a graph
and let $e\in E(G)$ and $e'\in E(\overline{G})$. If the graph $G'=G-e+e'$ is
isomorphic to $G$, we say $G'$ is obtained from $G$ by performing a
\emph{feasible edge-replacement}. We call $G$ a \emph{local amoeba} if, for any
two copies $G_1$, $G_2$ of $G$ on the same vertex set, $G_1$ can be transformed
into $G_2$ by a chain of feasible edge-replacements. On the other hand, $G$ is
called \emph{global amoeba} if there is an integer $t_0 \ge 0$ such that $G
\cup tK_1$ is a local amoeba for all $t \ge t_0$. To model the dynamics of the
feasible edge-replacements of $G$, we define a group ${\rm Fer}(G)$ that

richness of these graph families showing, among other things, that any
connected graph can be a connected component of a global amoeba, that global
amoebas can be very dense and that they can have, in proportion to their order,
large clique and chromatic numbers. Also, a family of global amoeba trees with

spectral composite optimization problems. More specifically, the objective
function for these problems is of the form $f_1 + f_2 + h$ where $f_1$ and
$f_2$ are differentiable nonconvex matrix functions with Lipschitz continuous
gradients, $h$ is a proper closed convex matrix function, and both $f_2$ and
$h$ can be expressed as functions that operate on the singular values of their
inputs. The methods essentially use an accelerated composite gradient method to
solve a sequence of proximal subproblems involving the linear approximation of
$f_1$ and the singular value functions underlying $f_2$ and $h$. Unlike other
composite gradient-based methods, the proposed methods take advantage of both
the composite and spectral structure underlying the objective function in order
to efficiently generate their solutions. Numerical experiments are presented to
demonstrate the practicality of these methods on a set of real-world and
randomly generated spectral optimization problems.

defined as follows: given a set $L \subseteq \mathcal{X}$ of facility locations
and a set $C \subseteq \mathcal{X}$ of clients, open a set $F \subseteq L$ of
$k$ facilities such that the total service cost, defined as $\Phi(F, C) \equiv
\sum_{x \in C} \min_{f \in F} d(x, f)$, is minimised. The metric $k$-means
problem is defined similarly using squared distances. In many applications
there are additional constraints that any solution needs to satisfy. This gives
rise to different constrained versions of the problem such as $r$-gather,
fault-tolerant, outlier $k$-means/$k$-median problem. Surprisingly, for many of
these constrained problems, no constant-approximation algorithm is known. We
give FPT algorithms with constant approximation guarantee for a range of
constrained $k$-median/means problems. For some of the constrained problems,
ours is the first constant factor approximation algorithm whereas for others,
we improve or match the approximation guarantee of previous works. We work
within the unified framework of Ding and Xu that allows us to simultaneously
obtain algorithms for a range of constrained problems. In particular, we obtain
a $(3+\varepsilon)$-approximation and $(9+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the
constrained versions of the $k$-median and $k$-means problem respectively in
FPT time. In many practical settings of the $k$-median/means problem, one is
allowed to open a facility at any client location, i.e., $C \subseteq L$. For
this special case, our algorithm gives a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation and
$(4+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the constrained versions of $k$-median and
$k$-means problem respectively in FPT time. Since our algorithm is based on
simple sampling technique, it can also be converted to a constant-pass
log-space streaming algorithm.

cannot be attained if $S^3_{p/q}(K)$ is a small Seifert fibered L-space. If the
monodromy of $K$ is neither right-veering nor left-veering, then $|q|\le3$.
  As a corollary, for any given positive torus knot $T$, if $p/q\ge4g(T)+4$,
then $p/q$ is a characterizing slope. This improves earlier bounds of Ni--Zhang

More precisely, $14$ is characterizing for $T_{4,3}$, $17$ is characterizing
for $T_{5,3}$, and $4n+1$ is characterizing for $T_{2n+1,2}$ except when $n=5$.
By a recent theorem of Tange, this shows that $T_{2n+1,2}$ is the only knot in

form $t^n-t^{n-1}+t^{n-2}+\text{lower order terms}$.
  In the appendix, we prove that if the rank of the second term of the knot
Floer homology of a fibered knot is $1$, then the monodromy is either
right-veering or left-veering.

due to intrinsic epidemiological and administrative clustering. Here, we use
this clustering to classify the official national SARS-CoV-2 daily infection
counts and check for infection counts that are unusually anti-clustered. We
adopt a one-parameter model of $\phi'_i$ infections per cluster, dividing any
daily count $n_i$ into $n_i/\phi'_i$ 'clusters', for 'country' $i$. We assume
that $n_i/\phi'_i$ on a given day $j$ is drawn from a Poisson distribution
whose mean is robustly estimated from the four neighbouring days, and calculate
the inferred Poisson probability $P'_{ij}$ of the observation. The $P'_{ij}$
values should be uniformly distributed. We find the value $\phi_i$ that
minimises the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance from a uniform distribution. We
investigate the $(\phi_i, N_i)$ distribution, for total infection count $N_i$.
We find that most of the daily infection count sequences are inconsistent with
a Poissonian model. Most are found to be consistent with the $\phi_i$ model.
The 28-, 14- and 7-day least noisy sequences for several countries are best
modelled as sub-Poissonian, suggesting a distinct epidemiological family. The
28-day least noisy sequence of Algeria has a preferred model that is strongly
sub-Poissonian, with $\phi_i^{28} < 0.1$. TJ, TR, RU, BY, AL, AE, and NI have
preferred models that are also sub-Poissonian, with $\phi_i^{28} < 0.5$. A
statistically significant ($P^{\tau} < 0.05$) correlation was found between the
lack of media freedom in a country, as represented by a high Reporters sans
frontieres Press Freedom Index (PFI$^{2020}$), and the lack of statistical
noise in the country's daily counts. The $\phi_i$ model appears to be an
effective detector of suspiciously low statistical noise in the national

problem. However, many realistic models suffer from tuning problems in the
Higgs potential. There are often large contributions from the UV dynamics of
the composite resonances to the Higgs potential, and tuning between the
quadratic term and the quartic term is required to separate the electroweak
breaking scale and the compositeness scale. We consider a composite Higgs model
based on the $SU(6)/Sp(6)$ coset, where an enhanced symmetry on the fermion
resonances can minimize the Higgs quadratic term. Moreover, a Higgs quartic
term from the collective symmetry breaking of the little Higgs mechanism can be
realized by the partial compositeness couplings between elementary Standard
Model fermions and the composite operators, without introducing new elementary
fields beyond the Standard Model and the composite sector. The model contains
two Higgs doublets, as well as several additional pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone
bosons. To avoid tuning, the extra Higgs bosons are expected to be relatively
light and may be probed in the future LHC runs. The deviations of the Higgs
couplings and the weak gauge boson couplings also provide important tests as
they are expected to be close to the current limits in this model.

performance criteria of relative wealth level when the market return is

risky asset. The investors can be heterogeneous in both the mean and variance
of the prior. By a separation result and a martingale argument, we show that
the optimal investment strategy under a stochastic return rate model can be
characterized by a fully-coupled linear FBSDE. Two sets of deep neural networks
are used for the numerical computation to first find each investor's estimate
of the mean return rate and then solve the FBSDEs. We establish the existence

solve the utility game under partial information using deep neural network
function approximators. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy by a
base-case comparison with the solution from the finite difference scheme in the
linear case and apply the algorithm to the general case of nonlinear hidden
variable process. Simulations of investment strategies show a herd effect that
investors trade more aggressively under relativeness concerns. Statistical
properties of the investment strategies and the portfolio performance,

observe that the agent with the most accurate prior estimate is likely to lead
the herd, and the effect of competition on heterogeneous agents varies more

RGB-D saliency detection shows impressive ability on some challenge scenarios.
However, there are still two limitations. One hand is that the pooling and
upsampling operations in FCNs might cause blur object boundaries. On the other
hand, using an additional depth-network to extract depth features might lead to
high computation and storage cost. The reliance on depth inputs during testing
also limits the practical applications of current RGB-D models. In this paper,
we propose a novel collaborative learning framework where edge, depth and
saliency are leveraged in a more efficient way, which solves those problems
tactfully. The explicitly extracted edge information goes together with
saliency to give more emphasis to the salient regions and object boundaries.
Depth and saliency learning is innovatively integrated into the high-level
feature learning process in a mutual-benefit manner. This strategy enables the
network to be free of using extra depth networks and depth inputs to make
inference. To this end, it makes our model more lightweight, faster and more
versatile. Experiment results on seven benchmark datasets show its superior
performance.

by a Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation with a harvesting term and
space-dependent coefficients while the control consists of transporting
individuals from a natural reserve. The nonlinear optimal control problem is
approximated by means of a Galerkin scheme. Convergence result about the
optimal controlled solutions and error estimates between the corresponding
optimal controls, are derived. For certain parameter regimes, nearly optimal
solutions are calculated from a simple logistic ordinary differential equation
(ODE) with a harvesting term, obtained as a Galerkin approximation of the
original partial differential equation (PDE) model. A critical allowable
fraction $\underline{\alpha}$ of the reserve's population is inferred from the
reduced logistic ODE with a harvesting term. This estimate obtained from the
reduced model allows us to distinguish sharply between survival and extinction
for the full PDE itself, and thus to declare whether a control strategy leads
to success or failure for the corresponding rescue operation while ensuring
survival in the reserve's population. In dynamical terms, this result
illustrates that although continuous dependence on the forcing may hold on
finite-time intervals, a high sensitivity in the system's response may occur in
the asymptotic time. We believe that this work, by its generality, establishes
bridges interesting to explore between optimal control problems of ODEs with a
harvesting term and their PDE counterpart.

During the transition between diffuse and dense medium, the reservoirs of
elements, initially atomic in the gas, are gradually depleted on dust grains
(with a phase of neutralisation for those which are ions). This process becomes
efficient when the density is larger than 100~cm$^{-3}$. If the dense material
goes back into diffuse conditions, these elements are brought back in the
gas-phase because of photo-dissociations of the molecules on the ices followed
by thermal desorption from the grains. Nothing remains on the grains for
densities below 10~cm$^{-3}$ or in the gas-phase in a molecular form. One
exception is chlorine, which is efficiently converted at low density. Our
current gas-grain chemical model is not able to reproduce the depletion of
atoms observed in the diffuse medium except for Cl which gas abundance follows
the observed one in medium with densities smaller than 10~cm$^{-3}$. This is an
indication that crucial processes (involving maybe chemisorption and/or ice
irradiation profoundly modifying the nature of the ices) are missing.

connectedness and estimate that nursing homes have, on average, connections

home's staff-network connections and its centrality within the greater network
strongly predict COVID-19 cases. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of
nursing home quality are unimportant in predicting outbreaks, consistent with

by the anisotropic $XXZ$-type Hamiltonian, in which the exchange interaction
for the out-of-plane component is smaller than that for the in-plane one by a
ratio $\alpha=J_z/J_x=0.6$. Moreover, the absence of spin-orbit exciton around

the solutions to these equations has been mostly achieved in the case where the
relaxation function, measuring the intensity of the relaxation towards equally
distributed velocity densities, is constant. The goal of the presented work is
to provide a general method to tackle the question of convergence to
equilibrium when the relaxation function is not constant, and to do so as
quantitatively as possible. In contrast to the usual modal decomposition of the
equations, which is natural when the relaxation function is constant, we define
a new Lyapunov functional of pseudodifferential nature, one that is motivated
by the modal analysis in the constant case, that is able to deal with full
spatial dependency of the relaxation function. The approach we develop is
robust enough that one can apply it to multi-velocity Goldstein-Taylor models,
and achieve explicit rates of convergence. The convergence rate we find,
however, is not optimal, as we show by comparing our result to the that found

Conventional sound field translation techniques take a recording and expand it
into an equivalent environment of virtual sources. However, the finite sampling
of a commercial higher order microphone produces an acoustic sweet-spot in the
virtual reproduction. As a result, the technique remains to restrict the
listener's navigable region. In this paper, we propose a method for listener
translation in an acoustic reproduction that incorporates a mixture of
near-field and far-field sources in a sparsely expanded virtual environment. We
perceptually validate the method through a Multiple Stimulus with Hidden

the proposed method offers both improved source localizability and robustness
to spectral distortions at translated positions. A cross-examination with
numerical simulations demonstrated that the sparse expansion relaxes the
inherent sweet-spot constraint, leading to the improved localizability for
sparse environments. Additionally, the proposed method is seen to better
reproduce the intensity and binaural room impulse response spectra of
near-field environments, further supporting the strong perceptual results.

of the system. However, the Rabi oscillation of nonlinear states has yet to be
discussed. We report Rabi oscillations of azimuthons---spatially modulated

lends itself easily to variants of the standard link prediction problem for a
sequence of time dependent networks. Focusing on this dynamic network link
prediction/recommendation task, we propose a novel problem that exploits
additional information via a much larger sequence of auxiliary networks and has
important real-world relevance. To allow discovery of links that do not exist
in the available data, our model estimation framework introduces a
regularization term that presents a trade-off between the conventional link
prediction and this discovery task. In contrast to existing work our stochastic
gradient based estimation approach is highly efficient and can scale to
networks with millions of nodes. We show extensive empirical results on both

Every one of its water bodies displays a unique hydrodynamic behavior with
enormous effects on the biogeochemical characteristics of the ecosystems. In
this context, algal blooms are ecological phenomena of major relevance.
Numerical simulation has proved to be a promising tool to understand their
impacts. It has not been used for studying algal blooms in this zone. This
article focuses on proposing a novel numerical model for simulating brief algal
blooms occurring in water bodies of western Patagonia. The proposed model
presents a trade-off between complexity and applicability since field-data
sparsity in the zone discourages using more sophisticated approaches. The model
is based on a two-layer description of the water column. The first layer
represents the euphotic zone where an embedded biogeochemical model of
NPZD-type is used to model a mass-conserving trophic web. High intensity wind
drives the water column mixing, introducing an upward flux of nutrients that
boosts high rates of primary production. A time-dependent Gaussian pulse is
used to describe this process. Mass losses due to detritus sinking are also
included. Then, the ecosystem's dynamics is represented by means of an
externally forced, non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations
which is characterized by strictly positive trajectories but that it is not
longer mass-conserving. A structure-preserving time integrator based on a
splitting-composition technique is designed for solving the system's equations.
It is cast as a three-steps algorithm and provides an exact estimations of
biomass fluxes. Additionally, a genetic algorithm-based tool is used to
calibrate the model's parameters in realistic scenarios. The proposed model is
applied im a detailed study of a winter bloom in an austral fjord.

Spectre) present a significant challenge for processor design. The highly
publicized vulnerability uses speculative execution to learn victim secrets by
changing cache state. As a result, recent computer architecture research has
focused on invisible speculation mechanisms that attempt to block changes in
cache state due to speculative execution. Prior work has shown significant
success in preventing Spectre and other vulnerabilities at modest performance
costs. In this paper, we introduce speculative interference attacks, which show
that prior invisible speculation mechanisms do not fully block these
speculation-based attacks. We make two key observations. First, misspeculated
younger instructions can change the timing of older, bound-to-retire
instructions, including memory operations. Second, changing the timing of a
memory operation can change the order of that memory operation relative to
other memory operations, resulting in persistent changes to the cache state.
Using these observations, we demonstrate (among other attack variants) that
secret information accessed by mis-speculated instructions can change the order
of bound-to-retire loads. Load timing changes can therefore leave
secret-dependent changes in the cache, even in the presence of invisible
speculation mechanisms. We show that this problem is not easy to fix:
Speculative interference converts timing changes to persistent cache-state
changes, and timing is typically ignored by many cache-based defenses. We
develop a framework to understand the attack and demonstrate concrete
proof-of-concept attacks against invisible speculation mechanisms. We provide
security definitions sufficient to block speculative interference attacks;
describe a simple defense mechanism with a high performance cost; and discuss
how future research can improve its performance.

be tuned from stiff to nonstiff. In these examples we find the JR fulfilled in
the presence of stiffness, and violated in its absence, which indicates a very
close connection between stiffness and the JR. Remarkably, in the limit of
large systems, we find the JR fulfilled, even for pure initial energy
eigenstates. As this has no analogue in classical systems, we consider it a
genuine quantum phenomenon.

convergence. In thestrategies, the workers with different computational

high-performance workers wasting computation.Consequently, the utilization of
the cluster is relatively low. To alleviate thisissue, we propose the Dynamic

the performance of each worker is evaluatedfirst based on the fact in the
previous epoch, and then the batch size and datasetpartition are dynamically
adjusted in consideration of the current performanceof the worker, thereby
improving the utilization of the cluster. To verify theeffectiveness of the

the methodology constructs separate subspaces for the different

from different modes convey a comprehensive description about objects. A major
challenge in this context is how to efficiently interpret multi-modal
information in complex environments. This has motivated numerous studies on
learning unsupervised representations from multi-modal data streams. These
studies aim to understand higher-level contextual information (e.g., a Twitter
message) by jointly learning embeddings for the lower-level semantic units in
different modalities (e.g., text, user, and location of a Twitter message).
However, these methods directly associate each low-level semantic unit with a
continuous embedding vector, which results in high memory requirements. Hence,
deploying and continuously learning such models in low-memory devices (e.g.,
mobile devices) becomes a problem. To address this problem, we present METEOR,
a novel MEmory and Time Efficient Online Representation learning technique,
which: (1) learns compact representations for multi-modal data by sharing
parameters within semantically meaningful groups and preserves the
domain-agnostic semantics; (2) can be accelerated using parallel processes to
accommodate different stream rates while capturing the temporal changes of the
units; and (3) can be easily extended to capture implicit/explicit external
knowledge related to multi-modal data streams. We evaluate METEOR using two
types of multi-modal data streams (i.e., social media streams and shopping
transaction streams) to demonstrate its ability to adapt to different domains.
Our results show that METEOR preserves the quality of the representations while
reducing memory usage by around 80% compared to the conventional
memory-intensive embeddings.

clusters. We adopt a hierarchical clustering algorithm that uses the celestial
coordinates and the proper motions of the stars in the field of view of the
cluster to estimate a proxy of the pairwise binding energy of the stars and
arrange them in a binary tree. The cluster substructures and their members are
identified by trimming the tree at two thresholds, according to the
$\sigma$-plateau method. Testing the algorithm on 100 mock catalogs shows that,
on average, the membership of the identified clusters is $(91.5\pm 3.5)$\%
complete and the fraction of unrelated stars is $(10.4\pm 2.0)$\%. We apply the
algorithm to the stars in the field of view of the Perseus double cluster from
the Data Release 2 of Gaia. This approach identifies a single structure, Sub1,
that separates into two substructures, Sub1-1 and Sub1-2. These substructures
coincide with $h$ Per and $\chi$ Per: the distributions of the proper motions
and the color-magnitude diagrams of the members of Sub1-1 and Sub1-2 are fully
consistent with those of $h$ Per and $\chi$ Per reported in the literature.
These results suggest that our hierarchical clustering algorithm can be a
powerful tool to unveil the complex kinematic information of star clusters.

effectively described by two Chern insulators, including a Dirac, as well as a
momentum-dependent mass term. Each of those Chern insulators is directly
related to the parity anomaly of planar quantum electrodynamics. In this work,
we analyze the finite temperature Hall conductivity of a single Chern insulator
in 2+1 space-time dimensions under the influence of a chemical potential and an
out-of-plane magnetic field. At zero magnetic field, this non-dissipative
transport coefficient originates from the parity anomaly of planar quantum
electrodynamics. We show that the parity anomaly itself is not renormalized by
finite temperature effects. However, it induces two terms of different physical
origin in the effective action of a Chern insulator, which is proportional to
the Hall conductivity. The first term is temperature and chemical potential
independent, and solely encodes the intrinsic topological response. The second
term specifies the non-topological thermal response of conduction and valence
band states. In particular, we show that the relativistic mass of a Chern
insulator counteracts finite temperature effects, whereas its non-relativistic
mass enhances these corrections. Moreover, we extend our analysis to finite
magnetic fields and relate the thermal response of a Chern insulator therein to
the spectral asymmetry, which is a measure of the parity anomaly in orbital
fields.

ZoomNet is able to significantly outperform existing methods on the proposed
COCO-WholeBody dataset. Extensive experiments show that COCO-WholeBody not only
can be used to train deep models from scratch for whole-body pose estimation

parity constraint on its degree, either even or odd, we say that $G$ is

topological graph $H$ on the same set of vertices, such that $G$ and $H$ are
edge-disjoint and their union is a plane topological graph that meets all

  In this paper, we prove that the problem of deciding if a plane topological
graph is topologically augmentable to meet parity constraints is
$\mathcal{NP}$-complete, even if the set of vertices that must change their
parities is $V$ or the set of vertices with odd degree. In particular, deciding
if a plane topological graph can be augmented to a Eulerian plane topological

when the augmentation must be done by a plane topological perfect matching
between the vertices not meeting their parities.
  We extend these hardness results to planar graphs, when the augmented graph
must be planar, and to plane geometric graphs (plane topological graphs whose
edges are straight-line segments). In addition, when it is required that the
augmentation is made by a plane geometric perfect matching between the vertices
not meeting their parities, we also prove that this augmentation problem is

keypoints directly and then cluster/group them for different persons, which are
generally more efficient than top-down methods. However, in existing bottom-up
methods, the keypoint grouping is usually solved independently from keypoint
detection, making them not end-to-end trainable and have sub-optimal
performance. In this paper, we investigate a new perspective of human part

a novel differentiable Hierarchical Graph Grouping (HGG) method to learn the

easily embedded into main-stream bottom-up methods. It takes human keypoint
candidates as graph nodes and clusters keypoints in a multi-layer graph neural

that selfishness is different from rationality; agents will attempt to
strategize whenever they perceive it to be convenient according to their
imperfect rationality. Recent work has focused on a particular notion of
imperfect rationality, namely absence of contingent reasoning skills, and
defined obvious strategyproofness (OSP) as a way to deal with the selfishness
of these agents. Essentially, this definition states that to care for the
incentives of these agents, we need not only pay attention about the
relationship between input and output, but also about the way the algorithm is
run. However, it is not clear what algorithmic approaches must be used for OSP.
In this paper, we show that, for binary allocation problems, OSP is fully

reverse greedy. We call two-way greedy this algorithmic design paradigm. Our
main technical contribution establishes the connection between OSP and two-way
greedy. We build upon the recently introduced cycle monotonicity technique for
OSP. By means of novel structural properties of cycles and queries of OSP
mechanisms, we fully characterize these mechanisms in terms of extremal
implementations. These are protocols that ask each agent to consistently
separate one extreme of their domain at the current history from the rest.
Through the connection with the greedy paradigm, we are able to import a host
of approximation bounds to OSP and strengthen the strategic properties of this
family of algorithms. Finally, we begin exploring the power of two-way greedy
for set systems.

infrastructure to enhance terrestrial networks in case of traffic spikes or
disaster scenarios. However, to be able to do so, they need to be based on
high-bandwidth wireless technologies for both radio access and backhaul. With
this respect, the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum represents an enticing
solution, since it provides large chunks of untapped spectrum that can enable
ultra-high data-rates for aerial platforms. Aerial mmWave channels, however,
experience characteristics that are significantly different from terrestrial
deployments in the same frequency bands. As of today, mmWave aerial channels
have not been extensively studied and modeled. Specifically, the combination of
UAV micro-mobility (because of imprecisions in the control loop, and external
factors including wind) and the highly directional mmWave transmissions require
ad hoc models to accurately capture the performance of UAV deployments. To fill
this gap, we propose an empirical propagation loss model for UAV-to-UAV
communications at 60 GHz, based on an extensive aerial measurement campaign
conducted with the Facebook Terragraph channel sounders. We compare it with
3GPP channel models and make the measurement dataset publicly available.

rate history (CSFRH). In order to reveal the CSFRH using GRBs, it is important
to understand whether they are biased tracers or not. For this purpose, it is
crucial to understand properties of GRB host galaxies, in comparison to field
galaxies. In this work, we report ALMA far-infrared (FIR) observations of six
$z\sim2$ IR-bright GRB host galaxies, which are selected for the brightness in
IR. Among them, four host galaxies are detected for the first time in the
rest-frame FIR. In addition to the ALMA data, we collected multi-wavelength
data from previous studies for the six GRB host galaxies. Spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting analyses were performed with \texttt{CIGALE} to
investigate physical properties of the host galaxies, and to test whether
active galactic nucleus (AGN) and radio components are required or not. Our
results indicate that the best-fit templates of five GRB host galaxies do not
require an AGN component, suggesting the absence of AGNs. One GRB host galaxy,
080207, shows a very small AGN contribution. While derived stellar masses of
the three host galaxies are mostly consistent with those in previous studies,
interestingly the value of star-formation rates (SFRs) of all six GRB hosts are
inconsistent with previous studies. Our results indicate the importance of
rest-frame FIR observations to correctly estimate SFRs by covering thermal
emission from cold dust heated by star formation.

dissociate as an H$_2$ molecule. We observe multiple features related to the

entities and concepts in the real world, reasoning on KGs often correspond to
the reachability queries with label and substructure constraints (LSCR).
Specially, for a search path p, LSCR queries not only require that the labels
of the edges passed by p are in a certain label set, but also claim that a
vertex in p could satisfy a certain substructure constraint. LSCR queries is
much more complex than the label-constraint reachability (LCR) queries, and
there is no efficient solution for LSCR queries on KGs, to the best of our
knowledge. Motivated by this, we introduce two solutions for such queries on
KGs, UIS and INS. The former can also be utilized for general edge-labeled

efficient local-index-based informed search strategy. An extensive experimental

bottleneck lies in the reconstruction algorithms, resulting in rather limited
reconstruction quality. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel
learning-based framework for the reconstruction of high-quality LFs from
acquisitions via learned coded apertures. The proposed method incorporates the
measurement observation into the deep learning framework elegantly to avoid
relying entirely on data-driven priors for LF reconstruction. Specifically, we
first formulate the compressive LF reconstruction as an inverse problem with an
implicit regularization term. Then, we construct the regularization term with
an efficient deep spatial-angular convolutional sub-network to comprehensively
explore the signal distribution free from the limited representation ability
and inefficiency of deterministic mathematical modeling. Experimental results
show that the reconstructed LFs not only achieve much higher PSNR/SSIM but also
preserve the LF parallax structure better, compared with state-of-the-art
methods on both real and synthetic LF benchmarks. In addition, experiments show
that our method is efficient and robust to noise, which is an essential
advantage for a real camera system. The code is publicly available at

captioning is a multimodal learning problem, and the video features have much
redundancy between different time steps. Based on these concerns, we propose a
novel method called sparse boundary-aware transformer (SBAT) to reduce the
redundancy in video representation. SBAT employs boundary-aware pooling
operation for scores from multihead attention and selects diverse features from
different scenarios. Also, SBAT includes a local correlation scheme to
compensate for the local information loss brought by sparse operation. Based on

charged gravitinos in the radiation dominated era, whose formation is supported
by the universally attractive combination of gravitational and electric forces
between the gravitinos and anti-gravitinos (reflecting their `almost BPS-like'
nature). When lumps of such bound states coalesce and undergo gravitational
collapse, the resulting mini-black holes can escape Hawking evaporation if the
radiation temperature exceeds the Hawking temperature. Subsequently the black
holes evolve according to an exact solution of Einstein's equations, to emerge
as macroscopic black holes in the transition to the matter dominated era, with
masses on the order of the solar mass or larger. The presence of these seeds at
such an early time provides ample time for further accretion of matter and
radiation, and would imply the existence of black holes of almost any size in
the universe, up to the observed maximum.

brains for inference and learning via the dynamic, online, event-driven
processing of binary time series. Most existing learning algorithms for SNNs
are based on deterministic neuronal models, such as leaky integrate-and-fire,
and rely on heuristic approximations of backpropagation through time that
enforce constraints such as locality. In contrast, probabilistic SNN models can
be trained directly via principled online, local, update rules that have proven
to be particularly effective for resource-constrained systems. This paper
investigates another advantage of probabilistic SNNs, namely their capacity to
generate independent outputs when queried over the same input. It is shown that
the multiple generated output samples can be used during inference to robustify
decisions and to quantify uncertainty -- a feature that deterministic SNN
models cannot provide. Furthermore, they can be leveraged for training in order
to obtain more accurate statistical estimates of the log-loss training
criterion, as well as of its gradient. Specifically, this paper introduces an
online learning rule based on generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) that
follows a three-factor form with global learning signals and is referred to as
GEM-SNN. Experimental results on structured output memorization and
classification on a standard neuromorphic data set demonstrate significant
improvements in terms of log-likelihood, accuracy, and calibration when
increasing the number of samples used for inference and training.

as natural images, by sliding convolutional filters over different positions in
an image. Here, we suggest a new CNN architecture that combines the idea of
hierarchical abstraction in neural networks with a prior on the spatial
homogeneity of neuroimaging data: Whereas early layers are trained globally
using standard convolutional layers, we introduce for higher, more abstract
layers patch individual filters (PIF). By learning filters in individual image
regions (patches) without sharing weights, PIF layers can learn abstract
features faster and with fewer samples. We thoroughly evaluated PIF layers for
three different tasks and data sets, namely sex classification on UK Biobank
data, Alzheimer's disease detection on ADNI data and multiple sclerosis
detection on private hospital data. We demonstrate that CNNs using PIF layers
result in higher accuracies, especially in low sample size settings, and need
fewer training epochs for convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study which introduces a prior on brain MRI for CNN learning.

two-stage architecture design. Stage-1 learns to generate cylindrical object

are click-annotated on bird's view scenes. Stage-2 learns to refine the
cylindrical proposals to get cuboids and confidence scores, using a few

importantly, with our elaborately designed network architecture, our trained

train 3D object detectors with over 94% of their original performance (under

knowledge of the measurement outcomes. This requires a measurement independence
assumption: that the choice of measurement is uncorrelated with any other
underlying variables that influence the measurement outcomes. Conversely,
relaxing measurement independence allows for a fully `causal' simulation of
Bell nonlocality. We construct the most efficient such simulation, as measured
by the mutual information between the underlying variables and the measurement
settings, for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) scenario, and find that the
maximal quantum violation requires a mutual information of just $\sim 0.080$
bits. Any physical device built to implement this simulation allows an
adversary to have full knowledge of a cryptographic key or `random' numbers
generated by a device independent protocol based on violation of the CHSH
inequality. We also show that a previous model for the CHSH scenario, requiring
only $\sim 0.046$ bits to simulate the maximal quantum violation, corresponds
to the most efficient `retrocausal' simulation, in which future measurement
settings necessarily influence earlier source variables. This may be viewed
either as an unphysical limitation of the prior model, or as an argument for
retrocausality on the grounds of its greater efficiency. Causal and retrocausal
models are also discussed for maximally entangled two-qubit states, as well as
superdeterministic, one-sided and zigzag causal models.

the same theory with non-linear coupling. Thus the phenomenology of the model

specification. Often, when the setting comprises multiple processes, the
specifications are over sets of input and output signals that correspond to
individual processes. Then, many of the properties one wishes to specify are
symmetric with respect to the processes identities. In this work, we consider
the problem of deciding whether the given system exhibits symmetry with respect
to the processes' identities. When the system is symmetric, this gives insight
into the behaviour of the system, as well as allows the designer to use only
representative specifications, instead of iterating over all possible process
identities.
  Specifically, we consider probabilistic systems, and we propose several
variants of symmetry. We start with precise symmetry, in which, given a
permutation $\pi$, the system maintains the exact distribution of permuted
outputs, given a permuted inputs. We proceed to study approximate versions of
symmetry, including symmetry induced by small $L_\infty$ norm, variants of
Parikh-image based symmetry, and qualitative symmetry. For each type of
symmetry, we consider the problem of deciding whether a given system exhibits

temperature are strongly dependent on whether the room-temperature filter is
installed or not. The entire transition is shifted to higher temperature with
loading layers of the room-temperature filters. Once the zero-resistance state
is achieved at B=0, no strong radiation effect is observed even with
low-temperature filters installed. When magnetic field is turned on, the
nonzero-resistance saturation at low temperatures is revealed without
low-temperature filters, which has been considered to be magnetic-field-induced
quantum metallic phase. However, the insertion of the additional
low-temperature filter weakens the saturation of the resistance, the signature
of the metallic behavior. This observation suggests that the previously
reported anomalous metallic state in Ta films is mainly induced by the
unfiltered radiation and, thus, the intrinsic metallic ground state should be

gauge bosons can be identified with the horizontal gauge bosons recently put
forward as an explanation for discrepancies in rare $B$-meson decays. We find
that the mass scale of the $H$ gauge bosons suggested by the DM phenomenology
intriguingly agrees with the one needed to explain the rare $B$-decay
discrepancies.

power demand with the available supply resources, has been gaining widespread
attention. The growing demand for electricity has presented new opportunities
for residential load scheduling systems to improve energy consumption by
shifting or curtailing the demand required with respect to price change or
emergency cases. In this paper, a dynamic residential load scheduling system
(DRLS) is proposed for optimal scheduling of household appliances on the basis
of an adaptive consumption level (CL) pricing scheme (ACLPS). The proposed load
scheduling system encourages customers to manage their energy consumption
within the allowable consumption allowance (CA) of the proposed DR pricing
scheme to achieve lower energy bills. Simulation results show that employing
the proposed DRLS system benefits the customers by reducing their energy bill
and the utility companies by decreasing the peak load of the aggregated load
demand. For a given case study, the proposed residential load scheduling system
based on ACLPS allows customers to reduce their energy bills by up to 53% and
to decrease the peak load by up to 35%.

posed by the Covid-19 pandemic by restricting their export of medical supplies.
Such measures are meant to increase the domestic availability of critical
goods, and are commonly used in times of crisis. Yet, not much is known about
their impact, especially on countries imposing them. Here we show that export
bans are, by and large, counterproductive. Using a model of shock diffusion
through the network of international trade, we simulate the impact of
restrictions under different scenarios. We observe that while they would be
beneficial to a country implementing them in isolation, their generalized use
makes most countries worse off relative to a no-ban scenario. As a corollary,
we estimate that prices increase in many countries imposing the restrictions.
We also find that the cost of restraining from export bans is small, even when
others continue to implement them. Finally, we document a change in countries'
position within the international trade network, suggesting that export bans
have geopolitical implications.

differential equations whose solution gives the trajectories of the system. The
solution is facilitated by the use of first integrals (FIs) that are used to
reduce the order of the system of differential equations and, if there are
enough of them, to determine the solution. Therefore, it is important that
there exists a systematic method to determine the FIs. On the other hand, a
system of second order differential equations defines a kinetic energy, which
provides a symmetric second order tensor called kinetic metric of the system.
This metric via its symmetries brings into the scene the numerous methods of
differential geometry and hence it is apparent that one should manage to relate
the determination of the FIs to the symmetries of the kinetic metric. The
subject of this work is to provide a theorem that realizes this scenario. The
method we follow considers the generic quadratic FI of the form
$I=K_{ab}(t,q^{c})\dot{q}^{a}\dot{q}^{b}+K_{a}(t,q^{c})\dot{q}^{a} +K(t,q^{c})$
where $K_{ab}(t,q^{c}), K_{a}(t,q^{c}), K(t,q^{c})$ are unknown tensor
quantities and requires $dI/dt = 0$. This condition leads to a system of
differential equations involving the coefficients of $I$ whose solution
provides all possible quadratic FIs of this form. We demonstrate the
application of the theorem in the classical cases of the geodesic equations and
the generalized Kepler potential. We also obtain and discuss the time-dependent
FIs.

quantum Bose-Einstein condensation. We report the experimental observation of
the transition to condensation of classical optical waves propagating in a
multimode fiber, i.e., in a conservative Hamiltonian system without thermal
heat bath. In contrast to conventional self-organization processes featured by
the non-equilibrium formation of nonlinear coherent structures (solitons,
vortices...), here the self-organization originates in the equilibrium
Rayleigh-Jeans statistics of classical waves. The experimental results show
that the chemical potential reaches the lowest energy level at the transition
to condensation, which leads to the macroscopic population of the fundamental
mode of the optical fiber. The near-field and far-field measurements of the
condensate fraction across the transition to condensation are in quantitative
agreement with the Rayleigh-Jeans theory. The thermodynamics of classical wave
condensation reveals that, in opposition to quantum Bose-Einstein condensation,
the heat capacity takes a constant value in the condensed state and tends to
vanish above the transition in the normal state. Our experiments provide the
demonstration of a coherent phenomenon of self-organization that is exclusively
driven by the statistical equilibrium properties of classical light waves.

of the lowest-lying glueball states, which are singlet under the global
symmetry group $SU(2)\times SU(2)$. We derive the linearized supergravity
equations for the pseudoscalar fluctuations and analyze their spectrum. The
system of equation is shown to be compatible with six eigenmodes, as expected
from supersymmetry. Our numerical analysis allows to reliably extract four of

Realizing $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry $(r_{ij} \rightarrow -r_{ij})$ we introduce
new variables $\rho_{ij}=r_{ij}^2$, which allows us to make the tensor of
inertia non-singular for binary collisions. In these variables the kinetic
energy is a polynomial function in the $\rho$-phase space. The 3 body positions
form a triangle (of interaction) and the kinetic energy is
$\mathcal{S}_3$-permutationally invariant wrt interchange of body positions and

maintains the clean, high-quality surface properties of hand-modeled CAD

proposed to provide forecasts of atmospheric and astroclimatic parameters at
short time scales (up to a few hours) by achieving much better performances
with respect to the 'standard forecasts' provided early afternoon for the
coming night. The AR method uses the real-time measurements of the parameter of
interest to improve the forecasts performed with atmospherical models. We used
here measurements provided by LHATPRO, a radiometer measuring continuously the
PWV at the VLT. When comparing the AR forecast at 1h to the standard forecast,
we observe a gain factor of $\sim$ 8 (i.e. $\sim$ 800 per cent) in terms of
forecast accuracy. In the PWV $\leq$ 1 mm range, which is extremely critical
for infrared astronomical applications, the RMSE of the predictions is of the
order of just a few hundredth of millimetres (0.04 mm). We proved therefore
that the AR technique provides an important benefit to VLT science operations
for all the instruments sensitive to the PWV. Besides, we show how such an
ability in predicting the PWV can be useful also to predict the sky background
in the infrared range (extremely appealing for METIS). We quantify such an
ability by applying this method to the NEAR project (New Earth in the Alpha Cen

spontaneous activity patterns and of responses to transient and sustained
inputs. While much theoretical attention has been devoted to the spontaneous
activity of neurons, less is known about the dynamic mechanisms shaping their
responses to transient inputs, although these bear significant physiological
relevance. Here, we study responses to transient inputs in a widely used class
of neuron models (nonlinear adaptive hybrid models) well-known to reproduce a
number of biologically realistic behaviors. We focus on responses to transient
inputs that have been previously associated with Type III neurons, arguably the
least studied category in Hodgkin's classification, which are those neurons
that never exhibit continuous firing in response to sustained excitatory
currents. The two phenomena that we study are post-inhibitory facilitation, in
which an otherwise subthreshold excitatory input can induce a spike if it is
applied with proper timing after an inhibitory pulse, and slope detection, in
which a neuron spikes to a transient input only when the input's rate of change
is in a specific, bounded range. We analyze the origin of these phenomena in
nonlinear hybrid models and provide a geometric characterization of dynamical
structures associated with PIF in the system and an analytical study of slope
detection for tent inputs. While the necessary and sufficient conditions for
these behaviors are easily satisfied in neurons with Type III excitability, our
proofs are quite general and valid for neurons that do not exhibit Type III
excitability as well. This study therefore provides a framework for the
mathematical analysis of these responses to transient inputs associated with
Type III neurons in other systems and for advancing our understanding of these
systems' computational properties.

(CIs) and thus to interesting topological properties. However, current
approximations to the AQRM fail to reproduce these CIs correctly. To overcome
these limitations we propose a generalized adiabatic approximation (GAA) to
describe the energy spectrum of the AQRM. This is achieved by combining the
perturbative adiabatic approximation and the exact exceptional solutions to the
AQRM. The GAA provides substantial improvement to the existing approaches and
pushes the limit of the perturbative treatment into non-perturbative regimes.
As a preliminary example of the application of the GAA we calculate the
geometric phases around CIs associated with the AQRM.

provides the best linear unbiased predictor using covariance functions and is

prediction for non-Gaussian and categorical data, the Kriging prediction is no
longer optimal, and the associated variance is often overly optimistic.
Although deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for general classification
and prediction, they have not been studied thoroughly for data with spatial
dependence. In this work, we propose a novel DNN structure for spatial
prediction, where the spatial dependence is captured by adding an embedding
layer of spatial coordinates with basis functions. We show in theory and
simulation studies that the proposed DeepKriging method has a direct link to
Kriging in the Gaussian case, and it has multiple advantages over Kriging for
non-Gaussian and non-stationary data, i.e., it provides non-linear predictions
and thus has smaller approximation errors, it does not require operations on
covariance matrices and thus is scalable for large datasets, and with
sufficiently many hidden neurons, it provides the optimal prediction in terms
of model capacity. We further explore the possibility of quantifying prediction
uncertainties based on density prediction without assuming any data
distribution. Finally, we apply the method to predicting PM2.5 concentrations

well on fairly balanced benchmarks where per-category training sample numbers

open challenges. Specifically, we systematically investigate performance drop
of the state-of-the-art two-stage instance segmentation model Mask R-CNN on the
recent long-tail LVIS dataset, and unveil that a major cause is the inaccurate
classification of object proposals. Based on such an observation, we first
consider various techniques for improving long-tail classification performance
which indeed enhance instance segmentation results. We then propose a simple
calibration framework to more effectively alleviate classification head bias
with a bi-level class balanced sampling approach. Without bells and whistles,
it significantly boosts the performance of instance segmentation for tail
classes on the recent LVIS dataset and our sampled COCO-LT dataset. Our
analysis provides useful insights for solving long-tail instance detection and

as a simple but strong baseline. With the method we have won the 2019 LVIS

of populations of planets in star clusters with an IMBH. We study the dynamical
evolution of single-planet systems and free-floating planets, over a period of
100~Myr, in star clusters without an IMBH, and in clusters with a central IMBH
of mass $100~M_\odot$ or $200~M_\odot$. In the central region ($r\lesssim
0.2$~pc), the IMBH's tidal influence on planetary systems is typically 10~times
stronger than the average neighbour star. For a star cluster with a
$200M_\odot$ IMBH, the region in which the IMBH's influence is stronger within
the virial radius ($\sim 1$~pc). The IMBH quenches mass segregation, and the
stars in the core tend to move towards intermediate regions. The ejection rate
of both stars and planets is higher when an IMBH is present. The rate at which
planets are expelled from their host star rate is higher for clusters with
higher IMBH masses, for $t<0.5 t_{rh}$, while remains mostly constant while the
star cluster fills its Roche lobe, similar to a star cluster without an IMBH.
The disruption rate of planetary systems is higher in initially denser
clusters, and for wider planetary orbits, but this rate is substantially
enhanced by the presence of a central IMBH.

the increasing privacy concern. Despite the recent success of neural
session-based recommenders, they are typically developed in an offline manner
using a static dataset. However, recommendation requires continual adaptation
to take into account new and obsolete items and users, and requires ""continual
learning"" in real-life applications. In this case, the recommender is updated
continually and periodically with new data that arrives in each update cycle,
and the updated model needs to provide recommendations for user activities
before the next model update. A major challenge for continual learning with
neural models is catastrophic forgetting, in which a continually trained model
forgets user preference patterns it has learned before. To deal with this
challenge, we propose a method called Adaptively Distilled Exemplar Replay
(ADER) by periodically replaying previous training samples (i.e., exemplars) to
the current model with an adaptive distillation loss. Experiments are conducted
based on the state-of-the-art SASRec model using two widely used datasets to
benchmark ADER with several well-known continual learning techniques. We
empirically demonstrate that ADER consistently outperforms other baselines, and
it even outperforms the method using all historical data at every update cycle.
This result reveals that ADER is a promising solution to mitigate the
catastrophic forgetting issue towards building more realistic and scalable
session-based recommenders.

scalable method we have developed to address the problem of graph design for
graphs with billions of nodes. Grale operates by fusing together different
measures of(potentially weak) similarity to create a graph which exhibits high
task-specific homophily between its nodes. Grale is designed for running on
large datasets. We have deployed Grale in more than 20 different industrial
settings at Google, including datasets which have tens of billions of nodes,
and hundreds of trillions of potential edges to score. By employing locality
sensitive hashing techniques,we greatly reduce the number of pairs that need to
be scored, allowing us to learn a task specific model and build the associated
nearest neighbor graph for such datasets in hours, rather than the days or even
weeks that might be required otherwise. We illustrate this through a case study
where we examine the application of Grale to an abuse classification problem on

Grale detects a large number of malicious actors on top of hard-coded rules and

ground sensing systems, we propose a Graph Convolutional neural network-based

the ground monitoring station to capture the spatio-temporal correlation of
historical observation data, which helps the aerial-ground sensing system to
achieve accurate AQI inference. Through extensive case studies on a real-world

of key dynamical processes affecting the evolution of the string networks and
thus a precise calibration of the VOS model. Here we further exploit this code
in a detailed study of two important aspects connecting the simulations with
the VOS model. First, we study the sensitivity of the model calibration to the
presence (or absence) of thermal oscillations due to high gradients in the
initial conditions. This is relevant since in some Abelian-Higgs simulations
described in the literature a period of artificial (unphysical)
dissipation---usually known as cooling---is introduced with the goal of
suppressing these oscillations and accelerating the convergence to scaling. We
show that a small amount of cooling has no statistically significant impact on
the VOS model calibration, while a longer dissipation period does have a
noticeable effect. Second, in doing this analysis we also introduce an improved
Markov Chain Monte Carlo based pipeline for calibrating the VOS model,
Comparison to our previous bootstrap based pipeline shows that the latter
accurately determined the best-fit values of the VOS model parameter, but
underestimated the uncertainties in some of the parameters. Overall, our
analysis shows that the calibration pipeline is robust and can be applied to
future much larger field theory simulations.

designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ventilator is intended to be
used both in and out of hospital intensive care units, and for both invasive
and non-invasive ventilation. The hardware can be complemented with an external
turbine for use in regions where compressed air supplies are not reliably
available. The standard modes provided include PC-A/C(Pressure Assist
Control),PC-A/C-PRVC(Pressure Regulated Volume Control), PC-PSV (Pressure
Support Ventilation) and CPAP (Continuous Positive airway pressure). HEV is
designed to support remote training and post market surveillance via a web
interface and data logging to complement the standard touch screen operation,
making it suitable for a wide range of geographical deployment. The HEV design
places emphasis on the quality of the pressure curves and the reactivity of the
trigger, delivering a global performance which will be applicable to ventilator
needs beyond theCOVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the conceptual design
and presents the prototype units together with their performance evaluation.

2, and their relations to the trace anomaly. In fact in 1925 Dirac already had
a preliminarily formulation of these rules \cite{Dirac3}. Using them, he had
independently rediscovered the Born-Jordan quantisation rule
\cite{BornJordan1925} and called it the quantum condition. This is the best
known and undoubtedly most significant of the canonical quantisation rules of
quantum mechanics. We shall discuss several violations of the Poisson-Lie
algebra (assumed by Dirac), starting from antisymmetry, which is the first
criterion for defining a Lie algebra. Similar violations also occur for the
Leibniz's rule and the Jacobi identity, the latter we shall also prove for all
our quantum Poisson brackets. That none of these violations jeopardised Dirac's
ingenious original derivation \cite{Dirac} of his first quantisation Rule 1, is
quite remarkable. This is because the violations are all of higher orders in
$\hbar$. We shall further show that (ii) does not automatically lead to a trace
anomaly for certain bounded integrable operators. Several issues that are both
pedagogical and foundational arising from this study show that quantum
mechanics is still not a finished product. I shall briefly mention some

linked through a lifecycle wherein gas content mediates their star formation

through bursty star formation, then enter into a transition phase of
intermediate gas richness in which star formation and AGNs coexist, before
settling into retirement as gas-poor, quiescent systems with residual levels of

significantly improves the performance of the GEVD. The four parameter kappa

extend the K4D to deal with $r$-largest order statistics as analogy as the GEVD

expensive measurements, and the task of finding an optimal set of measurements
is known as the optimal design problem. Surprisingly, measurement locations in
optimal designs are sometimes extremely clustered, and researchers often avoid
measurement clusterization by modifying the optimal design problem. We consider
a certain flavor of the optimal design problem, based on the Bayesian
D-optimality criterion, and suggest an analytically tractable model for
D-optimal designs in Bayesian linear inverse problems over Hilbert spaces. We
demonstrate that measurement clusterization is a generic property of D-optimal
designs, and prove that correlated noise between measurements mitigates
clusterization. We also give a full characterization of D-optimal designs under
our model: We prove that D-optimal designs uniformly reduce uncertainty in a
select subset of prior covariance eigenvectors. Finally, we show how
measurement clusterization is a consequence of the characterization mentioned
above and the pigeonhole principle.

limit by measuring second-order correlations of light between two reference
planes, arbitrarily chosen, within the tridimensional scene of interest. We
show that for both chaotic light and entangled-photon illumination, the
protocol enables to change the focused planes, in post-processing, and to
achieve an unprecedented combination of image resolution and depth of field. In
particular, the depth of field results larger by a factor 3 with respect to
previous correlation plenoptic imaging protocols, and by an order of magnitude
with respect to standard imaging, while the resolution is kept at the
diffraction limit. The results lead the way towards the development of compact
designs for correlation plenoptic imaging devices based on chaotic light, as
well as high-SNR plenoptic imaging devices based on entangled photon
illumination, thus contributing to make correlation plenoptic imaging
effectively competitive with commercial plenoptic devices.

by their ability to distinguish graphs. For many formalisms, the k-dimensional
Weisfeiler-Leman (k-WL) graph isomorphism test is used as a yardstick. In this
paper we consider the expressive power of kth-order invariant (linear) graph
networks (k-IGNs). It is known that k-IGNs are expressive enough to simulate
k-WL. This means that for any two graphs that can be distinguished by k-WL, one
can find a k-IGN which also distinguishes those graphs. The question remains
whether k-IGNs can distinguish more graphs than k-WL. This was recently shown
to be false for k=2. Here, we generalise this result to arbitrary k. In other
words, we show that k-IGNs are bounded in expressive power by k-WL. This
implies that k-IGNs and k-WL are equally powerful in distinguishing graphs.

extending the habitable zone via N2-H2 and CO2-H2 greenhouse warming, and
providing atmospheric conditions suitable for efficient production of prebiotic
molecules. On Earth and Super-Earth-sized bodies, where H2-rich primordial
envelopes are quickly lost to space, volcanic outgassing can act as a hydrogen
source, provided it balances with the loss rate from the top of the atmosphere.
Here, we show that both Earth-like and Mars-like planets can sustain
atmospheric H2 fractions of several percent across relevant magmatic fO2
ranges. In general this requires hydrogen escape to operate somewhat less
efficiently than the diffusion limit. We use a thermodynamical model of magma
degassing to determine which combinations of magma oxidation, volcanic flux,
and hydrogen escape efficiency can build up appreciable levels of hydrogen in a
planet's secondary atmosphere. On a planet similar to the Archean Earth and
with a similar magmatic fO2, we suggest that the mixing ratio of atmospheric
hydrogen could have been in the range 0.2-3%. A planet erupting magmas around
the Iron-Wustite (IW) buffer (i.e., ~3 log fO2 units lower than Archean
Earth's), but with otherwise similar volcanic fluxes and H2 loss rates to early
Earth, could sustain an atmosphere with approximately 10-20% H2. For an early
Mars-like planet with magmas around IW, but a lower range of surface pressures
and volcanic fluxes compared to Earth, an atmospheric H2 mixing ratio of 2-8%
is possible. On early Mars, this H2 mixing ratio could be sufficient to
deglaciate the planet. However, the sensitivity of these results to primary
magmatic water contents and volcanic fluxes show the need for improved
constraints on the crustal recycling efficiency and mantle water contents of
early Mars.

collisionless astrophysical plasmas, and thus is responsible for shaping their
radiative signatures (luminosity, spectra, and variability). To better
understand the kinetic properties of a collisionless radiative plasma subject
to externally driven turbulence, we investigate particle-in-cell simulations of
relativistic plasma turbulence with external inverse Compton cooling acting on
the electrons. We find that ions continuously heat up while electrons gradually
cool down (due to the net effect of radiation), and hence the ion-to-electron
temperature ratio $T_i/T_e$ grows in time. We show that $T_i/T_e$ is limited
only by the size and duration of the simulations (reaching $T_i/T_e \sim
10^3$), indicating that there are no efficient collisionless mechanisms of
electron-ion thermal coupling. This result has implications for models of
radiatively inefficient accretion flows, such as observed in the Galactic
Center and in M87, for which so-called two-temperature plasmas with $T_i/T_e
\gg 1$ have been invoked to explain their low luminosity. Additionally, we find
that electrons acquire a quasi-thermal distribution (dictated by the
competition of turbulent particle energization and radiative cooling), while
ions undergo efficient nonthermal acceleration (acquiring a harder distribution
than in equivalent non-radiative simulations). There is a modest nonthermal
population of high-energy electrons that are beamed intermittently in space,
time, and direction; these beamed electrons may explain rapid flares in certain
high-energy astrophysical systems (e.g., in the Galactic Center). These
numerical results demonstrate that extreme two-temperature plasmas can be

show up in approximate density functional theory as symmetry-broken
spin-densities or total densities, which are sometimes observable. They can
arise from soft modes of fluctuations (sometimes collective excitations) such

an approximate density functional for exchange and correlation that breaks
symmetry can be more revealing (albeit less accurate) than an exact functional

  pages (with SI); 5 figures; 2 tables",,,,"cs.SI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Understanding the cognitive and emotional perceptions of people who commit
suicide is one of the most sensitive scientific challenges. There are
circumstances where people feel the need to leave something written, an
artifact where they express themselves, registering their last words and
feelings. These suicide notes are of utmost importance for better understanding
the psychology of suicidal ideation. This work gives structure to the
linguistic content of suicide notes, revealing interconnections between
cognitive and emotional states of people who committed suicide. We build upon
cognitive network science, psycholinguistics and semantic frame theory to
introduce a network representation of the mindset expressed in suicide notes.
Our cognitive network representation enables the quantitative analysis of the
language in suicide notes through structural balance theory, semantic
prominence and emotional profiling. Our results indicate that the emotional
syntax connecting positively- and negatively-valenced terms gives rise to a
degree of structural balance that is significantly higher than null models
where the affective structure was randomized. We show that suicide notes are
affectively compartmentalized such that positive concepts tend to cluster
together and dominate the overall network structure. A key positive concept is
""love"", which integrates information relating the self to others in ways that
are semantically prominent across suicide notes. The emotions populating the
semantic frame of ""love"" combine joy and trust with anticipation and sadness,
which connects with psychological theories about meaning-making and narrative
psychology. Our results open new ways for understanding the structure of
genuine suicide notes informing future research for suicide prevention.

transforms, like DCT-II of JPEG image compression, are from Laplace
distribution, there was tested more general EPD (exponential power
distribution) $\rho\sim \exp(-(|x-\mu|/\sigma)^{\kappa})$ family, leading to
maximum likelihood estimated (MLE) $\kappa\approx 0.5$ instead of Laplace
distribution $\kappa=1$ - such replacement gives $\approx 0.1$ bits/value mean
savings (per pixel for grayscale, up to $3\times$ for RGB).
  There is also discussed predicting distributions (as $\mu, \sigma, \kappa$
parameters) for DCT coefficients from already decoded coefficients in the
current and neighboring DCT blocks. Predicting values $(\mu)$ from neighboring
blocks allows to reduce blocking artifacts, also improve compression ratio -
for which prediction of uncertainty/width $\sigma$ alone provides much larger
$\approx 0.5$ bits/value mean savings opportunity (often neglected).
  Especially for such continuous distributions, there is also discussed
quantization approach through optimized continuous \emph{quantization density
function} $q$, which inverse CDF (cumulative distribution function) $Q$ on
regular lattice $\{Q^{-1}((i-1/2)/N):i=1\ldots N\}$ gives quantization nodes -
allowing for flexible inexpensive choice of optimized (non-uniform)
quantization - of varying size $N$, with rate-distortion control. Optimizing
$q$ for distortion alone leads to significant improvement, however, at cost of
increased entropy due to more uniform distribution. Optimizing both turns out
leading to nearly uniform quantization here, with automatized tail handling.

J142238.82-611553.7 is one of 23 highly variable WISE sources discovered in a
search of Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs). It lies within the small IRDC
G313.671-0.309 (d$\approx$2.6 kpc), seen by the Herschel/HiGal survey as a
compact, massive cloud core that may have been measurably warmed by the event.
Pre-outburst data from Spitzer in 2004 suggest that it is a class I YSO, a view
supported by observation of weak 2.12 $\mu$m H$_2$ emission in an otherwise
featureless red continuum spectrum taken in 2019 (6 mag below the peak in
K$_s$). Spitzer, WISE and VVV data indicate that the outburst began by 2006 and
has a duration $>$13 yr, with a fairly flat peak from 2010--2014. The outburst
luminosity of a few $\times 10^2$ Lsun is consistent with an accretion rate
Mdot $\approx 10^{-4}$ Msun/yr, comparable to a classical FU Orionis event. The
4.6 $\mu$m peak in 2010 implies T = 800-1000 K and a disc radial location
R$\approx$4.5 au for the emitting region. The colour evolution suggests
subsequent progression outward. The apparent absence of the hotter matter
expected in thermal instability or MRI models may be due to complete
obscuration of the innermost disc, e.g. by an edge-on disc view. Alternatively,
disc fragmentation/infalling fragment models might more naturally explain a
mid-infrared peak, though this is not yet clear.

test based on voids must necessarily employ methods to identify them in
redshift space. Therefore, redshift-space distortions (RSD) and the
Alcock-Paczynski effect (AP) have an impact on the void identification process
itself generating distortion patterns in observations. Using a spherical void
finder, we developed a statistical and theoretical framework to describe
physically the connection between the identification in real and redshift
space. We found that redshift-space voids above the shot noise level have a
unique real-space counterpart spanning the same region of space, they are
systematically bigger and their centres are preferentially shifted along the
line of sight. The expansion effect is a by-product of RSD induced by tracer
dynamics at scales around the void radius, whereas the off-centring effect
constitutes a different class of RSD induced at larger scales by the global
dynamics of the whole region containing the void. The volume of voids is also
altered by the fiducial cosmology assumed to measure distances, this is the AP
change of volume. These three systematics have an impact on cosmological
statistics. In this work, we focus on the void size function. We developed a
theoretical framework to model these effects and tested it with a numerical
simulation, recovering the statistical properties of the abundance of voids in
real space. This description depends strongly on cosmology. Hence, we lay the
foundations for improvements in current models of the abundance of voids in
order to obtain unbiased cosmological constraints from redshift surveys.

algorithm which takes as input unorganized 3D point clouds (e.g., LiDAR data),
organized point clouds (e.g., range images), or user-provided meshes.
Non-convex polygons represent flat surfaces in an environment with interior
cutouts representing obstacles or holes. The Polylidar3D front-end transforms
input data into a half-edge triangular mesh. This representation provides a
common level of input data abstraction for subsequent back-end processing. The
Polylidar3D back-end is composed of four core algorithms: mesh smoothing,
dominant plane normal estimation, planar segment extraction, and finally
polygon extraction. Polylidar3D is shown to be quite fast, making use of CPU
multi-threading and GPU acceleration when available. We demonstrate
Polylidar3D's versatility and speed with real-world datasets including aerial
LiDAR point clouds for rooftop mapping, autonomous driving LiDAR point clouds

disease. Medical management including nasal steroid sprays is the primary

characterize sinonasal airflow and intranasal drug delivery; however, variation
in simulation methods indicates a need for large scale CFD model validation.
  Methods: Anatomic reconstructions of pre and post-operative CT scans of 3
functional endoscopic sinus surgery patients were created in Mimics(TM). Fluid
analysis and drug particle deposition modeling were conducted using CFD methods
with Fluent(TM) in 18 cases. Models were 3D printed and in vitro studies were
performed using Tc99-labeled Nasacort(TM). Gamma scintigraphy signals and
CFD-modeled spray mass were post-processed in a superimposed grid and compared.
Statistical analysis using overlap coefficients (OCs) evaluated similarities
between computational and experimental distributions and Kendall's tau rank
correlation coefficient was employed to test independence.
  Results: OCs revealed strong agreement in percent deposition and grid
profiles between CFD models and experimental results (mean [range] for
sagittal, axial, and coronal grids were 0.69 [0.57], 0.61 [0.49], and 0.78

  Conclusions: CFD modeling demonstrates statistical agreement with in vitro

the accretion outcome changes significantly. Erosion leads to a strong decrease

transformations designed specifically for object detection. To cope with the
designed search space, a novel search algorithm termed Representation Sharing
(RepShare) is proposed to effectively identify the best combinations of the
defined transformations. In our experiments, FAD obtains prominent improvements
on two types of one-stage detectors with various backbones. In particular, our
FAD detector achieves 46.4 AP on MS-COCO (under single-scale testing),
outperforming the state-of-the-art detectors, including the most recent
NAS-based detectors, Auto-FPN (searched for 16 GPU-days) and NAS-FCOS (28

learning models. However, we find in experiments that the automatic crack
detectors based on deep learning are obviously underestimated by the widely
used mean Average Precision (mAP) standard. This paper presents a study on the
evaluation standard. It is clarified that the random fractal of crack disables
the mAP standard, because the strict box matching in mAP calculation is
unreasonable for the fractal feature. As a solution, a fractal-available
evaluation standard named CovEval is proposed to correct the underestimation in
crack detection. In CovEval, a different matching process based on the idea of
covering box matching is adopted for this issue. In detail, Cover Area rate
(CAr) is designed as a covering overlap, and a multi-match strategy is employed
to release the one-to-one matching restriction in mAP. Extended Recall (XR),
Extended Precision (XP) and Extended F-score (Fext) are defined for scoring the
crack detectors. In experiments using several common frameworks for object
detection, models get much higher scores in crack detection according to
CovEval, which matches better with the visual performance. Moreover, based on
faster R-CNN framework, we present a case study to optimize a crack detector
based on CovEval standard. Recall (XR) of our best model achieves an
industrial-level at 95.8, which implies that with reasonable standard for

difficult to separate the speaker information from the channel information. To
this end, we propose augmentation adversarial training strategy that trains the

characteristics, training the network to be invariant to augmentation also
encourages the network to be invariant to the channel information in general.

improvements over previous works using self-supervision, and the performance of
our self-supervised models far exceed that of humans.

which fluctuations occur can shape microbial communities and their diversity,
but we still lack an intuition on how. Here, we build a mathematical model
describing two microbial species living in an environment where substrate
supplies randomly switch between abundant and scarce. We then vary the rate of
switching as well as different properties of the interacting species, and
measure the probability of the weaker species driving the stronger one extinct.
We find that this probability increases with the strength of demographic noise
under harsh conditions and peaks at either low, high, or intermediate switching
rates depending on both species' ability to withstand the harsh environment.
This complex relationship shows why finding patterns between environmental
fluctuations and diversity has historically been difficult. In parameter ranges
where the fittest species was most likely to be excluded, however, the beta
diversity in larger communities also peaked. In sum, how environmental
fluctuations affect interactions between a few species pairs predicts their
effect on the beta diversity of the whole community.

for accretion signatures from intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in 19
globular star clusters (GCs) in NGC\,3115, an early-type galaxy at a distance
of 9.4 Mpc. The 19 have stellar masses $M_{\star} \sim (1.1 - 2.7) \times
10^6~M_\odot$, with a mean $\overline{M_{\star}} \sim 1.8 \times 10^6~M_\odot$.
None were detected. An IMBH accretion model was applied to the individual GCs
and their radio stack. The radio-stacked GCs have an IMBH mass
$\overline{M_{\rm IMBH}} < 1.7 \times 10^5~M_\odot$ and mass fraction
$\overline{M_{\rm IMBH}} / \overline{M_{\star}} < 9.5\%$, with each limit being
uncertain by a factor of about 2.5. The latter limit contrasts with the
extremes of some stripped nuclei, suggesting that the set of stacked GCs in
NGC\,3115 is not a set of such nuclei. The radio luminosities of the individual
GCs correspond to X-ray luminosities $L_{\rm X} < (3.3 - 10) \times 10^{38}$
erg~s$^{-1}$, with a factor of about 2.5 uncertainty. These limits predicted
for putative IMBHs in the GCs are consistent with extant {\em Chandra}
observations. Finally, a simulated observation with a next-generation VLA
(ngVLA) demonstrates that accretion signatures from IMBHs in GCs can be
detected in a radio-only search, yet elude detection in an X-ray-only search
due to confusion from X-ray binaries in the GCs.

  Applications",,,,,"cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: End-user satisfaction is not only dependent on the correct
functioning of the software systems but is also heavily dependent on how well
those functions are performed. Therefore, performance testing plays a critical
role in making sure that the system responsively performs the indented
functionality. Load test generation is a crucial activity in performance
testing. Existing approaches for load test generation require expertise in
performance modeling, or they are dependent on the system model or the source
code.
  Aim: This thesis aims to propose and evaluate a model-free learning-based
approach for load test generation, which doesn't require access to the system
models or source code.
  Method: In this thesis, we treated the problem of optimal load test
generation as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We proposed two RL-based
approaches using q-learning and deep q-network for load test generation. In
addition, we demonstrated the applicability of our tester agents on a
real-world software system. Finally, we conducted an experiment to compare the
efficiency of our proposed approaches to a random load test generation approach
and a baseline approach.
  Results: Results from the experiment show that the RL-based approaches
learned to generate effective workloads with smaller sizes and in fewer steps.
The proposed approaches led to higher efficiency than the random and baseline
approaches.
  Conclusion: Based on our findings, we conclude that RL-based agents can be
used for load test generation, and they act more efficiently than the random
and baseline approaches.

data analysis, whether for curve or surface-valued data. The case of a
two-dimensional domain poses both statistical and computational challenges,
which are typically alleviated by assuming separability. However, separability
is often questionable, sometimes even demonstrably inadequate. We propose a
framework for the analysis of covariance operators of random surfaces that
generalises separability, while retaining its major advantages. Our approach is
based on the expansion of the covariance into a series of separable terms. The
expansion is valid for any covariance over a two-dimensional domain. Leveraging
the key notion of the partial inner product, we extend the power iteration
method to general Hilbert spaces and show how the aforementioned expansion can
be efficiently constructed in practice. Truncation of the expansion and
retention of the leading terms automatically induces a non-parametric estimator
of the covariance, whose parsimony is dictated by the truncation level. The
resulting estimator can be calculated, stored and manipulated with little
computational overhead relative to separability. Consistency and rates of
convergence are derived under mild regularity assumptions, illustrating the
trade-off between bias and variance regulated by the truncation level. The
merits and practical performance of the proposed methodology are demonstrated
in a comprehensive simulation study and on classification of EEG signals.

invariance and study Clebsch instantons: singular vorticity sheets with

  These singular solutions are involved in enhancing infinitesimal random
forces at remote boundary leading to critical phenomena. In the Euler equation
vorticity is concentrated along the random self-avoiding surface, with tangent
components proportional to the delta function of normal distance.
  Viscosity in Navier-Stokes equation smears this delta function to the
Gaussian with width $h \propto \nu^{\nicefrac{3}{5}}$ at $\nu \ra 0$ with fixed
energy flow.
  These instantons dominate the enstrophy in dissipation as well as the PDF for
velocity circulation $\Gamma_C$ around fixed loop $C$ in space.
  At large loops, the resulting symmetric exponential distribution perfectly
fits the numerical simulations\cite{IBS20} including pre-exponential factor
$1/\sqrt{|\Gamma|}$.
  At small loops, we advocate relation of resulting random self-avoiding
surface theory with multi-fractal scaling laws observed in numerical
simulations. These laws are explained as a result of fluctuating internal
metric (Liouville field). The curve of anomalous dimensions $\zeta(n)$ can be
fitted at small $n$ to the parabola, coming from the Liouville theory with two
parameters $\alpha, Q$. At large $n$ the ratios of the subsequent moments in
our theory grow linearly with the size of the loop, which corresponds to finite

owing to the fact that whether semitransparent window allows the energy to
leave the system by radiation mode of heat transfer. It is assumed that being
low conductivity of semitransparent material, energy does not leave by
conduction mode of heat transfer. This does mean that the semitransparent
window may behave as only conductively adiabatic (qc = 0) or combinedly
conductively and radiatively adiabatic (qc + qr = 0). In the present work, the
above two thermal adiabatic boundary conditions have been investigated in
natural convection problem for the Rayleigh number (Ra) 10^5 and Prandtl
number(Pr) 0.71 in a cavity, whose left vertical wall has been divided into
upper and lower parts in the ratio of 4:6. The upper section is semitransparent
window, while lower section is isothermal wall at a temperature of 296K. A
collimated beam is irradiated with different value (0, 100, 500 and 1000 W/m2)
on the semitransparent window at an angle of 45^0 . The cavity is heated from
the bottom by convective heating with free stream temperature of 305K and heat
transfer coefficient of 50 W/m2K while right wall is also isothermal at same
temperature as of lower left wall and upper wall is adiabatic. All walls are
opaque for radiation except semitransparent window. The results reveal that the
dynamics of both the vortices inside the cavity change drastically with
irradiation value and also with the boundary conditions on the semitransparent
window. The temperature and Nusselt number increase inside the cavity multifold
for combinedly conductively and radiatively adiabatic condition than the only
conductively adiabatic condition on the semitransparent window.

flexible loss function can be a more insightful navigator for neural networks
leading to higher convergence rates and therefore reaching the optimum accuracy
more quickly. The insights to help decide the degree of flexibility can be
derived from the complexity of ANNs, the data distribution, selection of
hyper-parameters and so on. In the wake of this, we introduce a novel flexible
loss function for neural networks. The function is shown to characterize a
range of fundamentally unique properties from which, much of the properties of
other loss functions are only a subset and varying the flexibility parameter in

learning by leveraging methods from unsupervised learning to extract
information not explicitly available in the labels. Through the design of a
system that enables a robot to learn inspection strategies from a human
operator, we present a hybrid semi-supervised system capable of learning
interpretable and verifiable models from demonstrations. The system induces a
controller program by learning from immersive demonstrations using sequential
importance sampling. These visual servo controllers are parametrised by
proportional gains and are visually verifiable through observation of the
position of the robot in the environment. Clustering and effective particle
size filtering allows the system to discover goals in the state space. These
goals are used to label the original demonstration for end-to-end learning of
behavioural models. The behavioural models are used for autonomous model
predictive control and scrutinised for explanations. We implement causal
sensitivity analysis to identify salient objects and generate counterfactual
conditional explanations. These features enable decision making interpretation
and post hoc discovery of the causes of a failure. The proposed system expands
on previous approaches to program synthesis by incorporating repellers in the
attribution prior of the sampling process. We successfully learn the hybrid
system from an inspection scenario where an unmanned ground vehicle has to
inspect, in a specific order, different areas of the environment. The system
induces an interpretable computer program of the demonstration that can be
synthesised to produce novel inspection behaviours. Importantly, the robot
successfully runs the synthesised program on an unseen configuration of the
environment while presenting explanations of its autonomous behaviour.

satisfy a temporal logic specification in a partially observable environment,

the adversary is modeled as a partially observable stochastic game. The goal is
to generate a defender policy to maximize satisfaction of a given temporal
logic specification under any adversary policy. The search for policies is
limited to the space of finite state controllers, which leads to a tractable
approach to determine policies. We relate the satisfaction of the specification
to reaching (a subset of) recurrent states of a Markov chain. We present an
algorithm to determine a set of defender and adversary finite state controllers
of fixed sizes that will satisfy the temporal logic specification, and prove
that it is sound. We then propose a value-iteration algorithm to maximize the
probability of satisfying the temporal logic specification under finite state
controllers of fixed sizes. Lastly, we extend this setting to the scenario
where the size of the finite state controller of the defender can be increased
to improve the satisfaction probability. We illustrate our approach with an

momentum conservation equation of the DBF framework, porosity is put outside of
the time derivation term, which cannot describe the change of porosity well.
Thus, this work changes the expression so that the modified momentum
conservation equation can satisfy Newton's second law. The modified framework
is called improved DBF framework. Furthermore, based on the improved DBF
framework, the thermal DBF framework is given by introducing the energy balance
equation to the improved DBF framework. Both of the frameworks are verified by
the former works through numerical experiments and chemical experiments in

immediate attention. Various epidemiological and deep learning models have been
developed to predict the COVID-19 outbreak, but all have limitations that
affect the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. Our method aims at
addressing these limitations and making earlier and more accurate pandemic
outbreak predictions by (1) using patients' EHR data from different counties
and states that encode local disease status and medical resource utilization
condition; (2) considering demographic similarity and geographical proximity
between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into deep
learning models. Materials and Methods: We proposed a spatio-temporal attention
network (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses an attention-based graph
convolutional network to capture geographical and temporal trends and predict
the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also
designed a physical law-based loss term for enhancing long-term prediction.
STAN was tested using both massive real-world patient data and open source
COVID-19 statistics provided by Johns Hopkins university across all U.S.
counties. Results: STAN outperforms epidemiological modeling methods such as
SIR and SEIR and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term
predictions, achieving up to 87% lower mean squared error compared to the best
baseline prediction model. Conclusions: By using information from real-world
patient data and geographical data, STAN can better capture the disease status
and medical resource utilization information and thus provides more accurate
pandemic modeling. With pandemic transmission law based regularization, STAN
also achieves good long-term prediction performance.
