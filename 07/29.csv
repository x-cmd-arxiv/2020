many authors, including Gilmer and Livingston, Batson, and Ozsv\'{a}th,
Stipsicz, and Szab\'{o}. Given a nonorientable surface $F \subset B^4$ with
$\partial F = K\subset S^3$ a knot, an analysis of the existing methods for
bounding and computing the nonorientable 4-genus reveals relationships between
the first Betti number $\beta_1$ of $F$ and the normal Euler class $e$ of $F$.
This relationship yields a geography problem: given a knot $K$, what is the set
of realizable pairs $(e(F), \beta_1(F))$ where $F\subset B^4$ is a
nonorientable surface bounded by $K$? We explore this problem for families of
torus knots. In addition, we use the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o $d$-invariant of
two-fold branched covers to give finer information on the geography problem. We
present an infinite family of knots where this information provides an
improvement upon the bound given by Ozsv\'ath, Stipsicz, and Szab\'o using the
Upsilon invariant.

by a factor of $\approx1.4$ if one instead considers the combination of BAO and
SNIa. We also investigate the possibility that a neglected modification of
gravity might lead to a false detection of DDR violations, even when screening
mechanisms are active. We find that such a false detection can be extremely
significant, up to $\approx10\sigma$ for very extreme modified gravity
scenarios, while this reduces to $\approx4\sigma$ in a more realistic case.
False detections can also provide a smoking gun for the modified gravity

been clear whether the small-surface tension limit is well-posed -- that is,
whether it is possible for an appropriate travelling gravity-capillary wave to
be continuously deformed to the classic Stokes wave in the limit of vanishing

Our results allow for a classification of the bifurcation structure that
arises, and serve to unify a number of previous numerical studies. Crucially,
we demonstrate that different choices of solution amplitude can lead to subtle
restrictions on the continuation procedure; the use of wave energy as an
amplitude condition allows solution branches to be continuously deformed to the
zero surface tension limit.

that such algorithms prepare certain correlated states of quantum spins with
surprising accuracy, a systematic way of quantifying the efficiency of QAOA in
general classes of models has been lacking. Here, we propose that the success
of QAOA in preparing ordered states is related to the interaction distance of
the target state, which measures how close that state is to the manifold of all
Gaussian states in an arbitrary basis of single-particle modes. We numerically
verify this for several examples of non-integrable quantum models, including
Ising models with two- and three-spin interactions and the cluster model in an
external field. Our results suggest that the structure of the entanglement
spectrum, as witnessed by the interaction distance, correlates with the success
of QAOA state preparation, and that this correlation also contains information
about different phases present in the model. We conclude that QAOA typically
finds a solution that perturbs around the closest free-fermion state.

prominent flash-ionisation spectral features within the first week. The unusual
photospheric temperature rise (rapidly from $\sim 12,000$\,K to above
18,000\,K) within the earliest few days suggests that the ejecta were
continuously heated. Both the significant temperature rise and the flash
spectral features can be explained with the interaction of the SN ejecta with
the massive stellar wind ($0.18^{+0.05}_{-0.10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$), which
accounts for the luminous peak ($L_{\rm max} = [1.36\pm 0.63] \times 10^{43}\,
\rm erg\,s^{-1}$) of SN 2018zd. The luminous peak and low expansion velocity
($v \approx 3300$ km s$^{-1}$) make SN 2018zd to be like a member of the LLEV
(luminous SNe II with low expansion velocities) events originated due to
circumstellar interaction. The relatively fast post-peak decline allows a
classification of SN 2018zd as a transition event morphologically linking
SNe~IIP and SNe~IIL. In the radioactive-decay phase, SN 2018zd experienced a
significant flux drop and behaved more like a low-luminosity SN~IIP both
spectroscopically and photometrically. This contrast indicates that
circumstellar interaction plays a vital role in modifying the observed light
curves of SNe~II. Comparing nebular-phase spectra with model predictions
suggests that SN 2018zd arose from a star of $\sim 12\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Given
the relatively small amount of $^{56}$Ni ($0.013 - 0.035 \rm M_{\odot}$), the
massive stellar wind, and the faint X-ray radiation, the progenitor of SN
2018zd could be a massive asymptotic giant branch star which collapsed owing to

to the maximum $\Phi$=0.64 that occurs in the random-close-packed limit. We
assume that the dipoles can freely rotate and have no local anisotropies. As
well as the usual thermodynamical variables, the physics of such systems
depends on $\Phi$. Concretely, we explore the magnetic ordering of these
systems in order to depict the phase diagram in the temperature-$\Phi$ plane.
For $\Phi \gtrsim0.49$ we find quasi-long-range ferromagnetic order coexisting
with strong long-range spin-glass order. For $\Phi \lesssim0.49$ the
ferromagnetic order disappears giving way to a spin-glass phase similar to the
ones found for Ising dipolar systems with strong frozen disorder.

dataset: The Expo Markers Dataset intended for detection and segmentation
tasks. This dataset contains 5,000 synthetic photorealistic images with their
corresponding pixel-perfect segmentation ground truth. The goal is to achieve
high performance on manually-gathered and annotated real-world data of custom
objects. We do that by creating 3D models of the target objects and other
possible distraction objects and place them within a simulated environment.
Expo Markers were chosen for this task, fitting our requirements of a custom
object due to the exact texture, size and 3D shape. An additional advantage is
the availability of this object in offices around the world for easy testing
and validation of our results. We generate the data using a domain
randomization technique that also simulates other photorealistic objects in the
scene, known as distraction objects. These objects provide visual complexity,
occlusions, and lighting challenges to help our model gain robustness in
training. We are also releasing our manually-gathered datasets used for
comparison and evaluation of our synthetic dataset. This white-paper provides
strong evidence that photorealistic simulated data can be used in practical
real world applications as a more scalable and flexible solution than
manually-captured data. Code is available at the following address:

to be robust to channel induced Doppler shift in high mobility wireless
communication systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the prior
works on OTFS have derived it from first principles. In this paper, using the
ZAK representation of time-domain (TD) signals, we rigorously derive an
orthonormal basis of approximately time and bandwidth limited signals which are
also localized in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. We then consider DD domain
modulation based on this orthonormal basis, and derive OTFS modulation. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to rigorously derive OTFS
modulation from first principles. We show that irrespective of the amount of
Doppler shift, the received DD domain basis signals are localized in a small
interval of size roughly equal to the inverse time duration along the Doppler
domain and of size roughly equal to the inverse bandwidth along the delay
domain (time duration refers to the length of the time-interval where the TD
transmit signal has been limited). With sufficiently large time duration and
bandwidth, there is little interference between information symbols modulated
on different basis signals, which allows for joint DD domain equalization of
all information symbols. This explains the inherent robustness of DD domain
modulation to channel induced Doppler shift when compared with Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The degree of localization of the DD
domain basis signals is inversely related to the time duration of the transmit
signal, which explains the trade-off between robustness to Doppler shift and
latency.

where an estimate of the next payoff vector is given, and the decision maker
tries to achieve better performance based on the accuracy of that estimator. In
order to derive algorithms that achieve predictive Blackwell approachability,
we start by showing a powerful connection between four well-known algorithms.
Follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) and online mirror descent (OMD) are the
most prevalent regret minimizers in online convex optimization. In spite of
this prevalence, the regret matching (RM) and regret matching+ (RM+) algorithms
have been preferred in the practice of solving large-scale games (as the local
regret minimizers within the counterfactual regret minimization framework). We
show that RM and RM+ are the algorithms that result from running FTRL and OMD,
respectively, to select the halfspace to force at all times in the underlying
Blackwell approachability game. By applying the predictive variants of FTRL or
OMD to this connection, we obtain predictive Blackwell approachability
algorithms, as well as predictive variants of RM and RM+. In experiments across
18 common zero-sum extensive-form benchmark games, we show that predictive RM+
coupled with counterfactual regret minimization converges vastly faster than
the fastest prior algorithms (CFR+, DCFR, LCFR) across all games but two of the
poker games, sometimes by two or more orders of magnitude.

now widely assumed that the virus was silently spreading for at least 2 weeks
before the first patient was identified. During this silent phase, and in the
following weeks when the hospital system was overburdened, data collection was
not performed in an accurate enough way to estimate an epidemic curve. With the
aim of assessing both the dynamics of the introduction of the virus and the
effectiveness of containment measures introduced, we try to reconstruct the
epidemic curve using all cause mortality data. Methods: we collected all cause
mortality data stratified by age from the national institute of statistics,
together with COVID-related deaths data released by other government
structures. Using a SEIR model together with estimates of the exposure to death
time distribution, we fitted the reproduction number in different phases of the
spread at regional level. Results: We estimate a reproduction number of
2.6+/-0.1 before case 1 was identified. School closures in Lombardy lowered it
to 1.3. Soft lockdown measures resulted in R<0.8 and no further reductions were
observed when a hard lockdown was introduced (e.g. Emilia-Romagna soft lockdown
0.67 +/-0.07, hard lockdown 0.69+/-0.071). Reproduction number for the >75 age
range during hard lockdown are consistently higher than for the rest of the
population (e.g. 0.98 vs 0.71 in Milan province), suggesting outbreaks in
retirement facilities. Reproduction numbers in Bergamo and Brescia provinces
starting from March 7th are markedly lower than in other areas with the same
strict lockdown measures (Nearby provinces: 0.73, Brescia: 0.52, Bergamo 0.43)

peaking at velocities of 57 and 75 km s$^{-1}$. They are found to be
interconnected in both space and velocity. The position-velocity diagrams show
features that match with the observational signatures of a cloud-cloud

masers known to appear in shocked gas, supporting the cloud-cloud collision
scenario. From the maser emission we provide constraints on the gas kinetic
temperatures ($\sim$30-150 K) and H$_2$ densities (10$^4$-10$^5$ cm$^{-2}$).
These properties are similar to those found for the starburst galaxy NGC253

data sources. Meanwhile, Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving approach to facilitating AI applications. However, it
remains a big challenge to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of FL when
it is integrated with the MEC architecture. Moreover, the unreliable nature
(e.g., stragglers and intermittent drop-out) of end devices significantly slows
down the FL process and affects the global model's quality Xin such
circumstances. In this paper, a multi-layer federated learning protocol called
HybridFL is designed for the MEC architecture. HybridFL adopts two levels (the
edge level and the cloud level) of model aggregation enacting different
aggregation strategies. Moreover, in order to mitigate stragglers and end
device drop-out, we introduce regional slack factors into the stage of client
selection performed at the edge nodes using a probabilistic approach without
identifying or probing the state of end devices (whose reliability is
agnostic). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in modulating the
proportion of clients selected and present the convergence analysis for our
protocol. We have conducted extensive experiments with machine learning tasks
in different scales of MEC system. The results show that HybridFL improves the
FL training process significantly in terms of shortening the federated round
length, speeding up the global model's convergence (by up to 12X) and reducing
end device energy consumption (by up to 58%).

an application to the planning of submarine cable networks. Our solution method
is based on total cost minimization, where the individual cable costs are
assumed to be linear to the length of the corresponding submarine cables

constraints limit the cable length and number of hops between any pair of

there are constraints between pairs of nodes. We note that this problem of MST
with constraints is NP-complete. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that ILP running

systems for which ILP is not able to find the optimal solution within an

writing complex programs by writing sub-programs and then analyzing their

intuition, we present a new synthesis approach that leverages learning to guide
a bottom-up search over programs. In particular, we train a model to prioritize
compositions of intermediate values during search conditioned on a given set of
input-output examples. This is a powerful combination because of several
emergent properties. First, in bottom-up search, intermediate programs can be
executed, providing semantic information to the neural network. Second, given
the concrete values from those executions, we can exploit rich features based
on recent work on property signatures. Finally, bottom-up search allows the
system substantial flexibility in what order to generate the solution, allowing
the synthesizer to build up a program from multiple smaller sub-programs.
Overall, our empirical evaluation finds that the combination of learning and
bottom-up search is remarkably effective, even with simple supervised learning
approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on two datasets,

prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits $n$ if

structures in the Universe because their dynamics can remain near-linear to the
present day. As a result they have the potential to connect large scale
structure at late times to early-Universe physics. Existing ""watershed""-based
algorithms, however, define voids in terms of their morphological properties at
low redshift. The degree to which the resulting regions exhibit linear dynamics
is consequently uncertain, and there is no direct connection to their evolution
from the initial density field. A recent void definition addresses these issues
by considering ""anti-halos"". This approach consists of inverting the initial
conditions of an $N$-body simulation to swap overdensities and underdensities.
After evolving the pair of initial conditions, anti-halos are defined by the
particles within the inverted simulation that are inside halos in the original
(uninverted) simulation. In this work, we quantify the degree of non-linearity
of both anti-halos and watershed voids using the Zel'dovich approximation. We
find that non-linearities are introduced by voids with radii less than
$5\,\mathrm{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, and that both anti-halos and watershed voids can be
made into highly linear sets by removing these voids.

of the Higgs mass is tied to cosmic stability and the possibility of a large

non-zero and below $\mathcal{O}({\rm TeV})$, the CFT also admits a second
metastable vacuum, where the expansion history of the Universe is conventional.
As a result, only Hubble patches with unnaturally small values of the Higgs
mass support inflation and post-inflationary expansion, while all other patches
rapidly crunch. The elementary Higgs VEV driving the dilaton potential is the
essence of our new solution to the hierarchy problem. The main experimental
prediction is a light dilaton field in the 0.1-10 GeV range that mixes with the
Higgs. Part of the viable parameter space has already been probed by
measurements of rare B-meson decays, and the rest will be fully explored by
future colliders and experiments searching for light, weakly-coupled particles.

Along the way, we uncover a previously unappreciated aspect of the ABCD method:
its accuracy hinges on having low signal contamination in control regions not

demonstrate the method with three examples: a simple model consisting of
three-dimensional Gaussians; boosted hadronic top jet tagging; and a recasted

challenge for models of super-massive black hole (SMBH) formation. This work
presents a study of SMBH formation via known physical processes in star-burst
clusters formed at the onset of the formation of their hosting galaxy. While at
the early stages hyper-massive star-burst clusters reach the luminosities of
quasars, once their massive stars die, the ensuing gas accretion from the still
forming host galaxy compresses its stellar black hole (BH) component to a
compact state overcoming heating from the BH--BH binaries such that the cluster
collapses, forming a massive SMBH-seed within about a hundred Myr. Within this
scenario the SMBH--spheroid correlation emerges near-to-exactly. The
highest-redshift quasars may thus be hyper-massive star-burst clusters or young
ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs), being the precursors of the SMBHs that
form therein within about 200 Myr of the first stars. For spheroid masses
<10^9.6 Msun a SMBH cannot form and instead only the accumulated nuclear
cluster remains. The number evolution of the quasar phases with redshift is
calculated and the possible problem of missing quasars at very high redshift is
raised. SMBH-bearing UCDs and the formation of spheroids are discussed
critically in view of the high redshift observations. A possible tension is
found between the high star-formation rates (SFRs) implied by downsizing and
the observed SFRs, which may be alleviated within the IGIMF theory and if the
downsizing times are somewhat longer.

still remain poorly understood, resulting into large uncertainties in the
predicted cosmic rate of these sources, spanning at least three orders of
magnitude. As LISA can individually resolve mostly EMRIs up to $z\gtrsim1$, the
ensemble of signals below its detection threshold will add up incoherently
forming an unresolved confusion noise, which can be formally described as a
stochastic background. We perform an extensive study of this background by
considering a collection of astrophysically motivated EMRI formation scenarios,
spanning current uncertainties. We find that, for most astrophysical models,
this signal is easily detectable by LISA, with signal to noise ratios of
several hundreds. In fiducial EMRI models -- predicting hundreds of EMRI
detections during mission operations -- the background level is comparable to
the LISA noise, affecting the performance of the instrument around 3 mHz. In
extreme cases, this background can even ""erase"" the whole LISA sensitivity
bucket in the 2-10 mHz frequency range. This points to the need of a better
understanding of EMRIs' astrophysics for a full assessment of the LISA mission
potential.

versus lensed spectra; while this shift does not inform our ability to measure
cosmological parameters, it does provide a three-way consistency check among
the lensing inferred from the best-fit parameters, the lensing in the CMB power
spectrum, and the reconstructed lensing map. This shift is predicted to be zero
when fitting with the correct model since both lensed and delensed spectra
originate from the same region of sky. Fitting with a LCDM model and
marginalizing over foregrounds, we find that the shift in cosmological

galaxies. Finally, there are noticeable differences in the kinematics: the gas
velocity dispersion is correlated with the galaxy inclination in the NBCS,
whereas this relation does not hold for the DPS. Furthermore, the DP galaxies
show larger stellar velocity dispersions and they deviate from the Tully-Fisher
relation for both late-type and S0 galaxies. These discrepancies can be
reconciled if one considers the two peaks as two different components.
Considering the morphological biases in favour, bulge-dominated galaxies and
star-formation central enhancement, we suggest a scenario of multiple
sequential minor mergers driving the increase of the bulge size, leading to
larger fractions of S0 galaxies and a deficit of pure disc galaxies.

We define scenarios as series of transitions and processes which connect

MiniBooNE detector. The key elements of the scenarios are production and decay
of new light $\mathcal{O}(\text{keV}-100\,\text{MeV})$ particles (fermions

new particles and interaction points. In practice, they are all reduced to few
generic scenarios and in this way we develop the effective theory of the
MiniBooNE excess. We consider tests of the scenarios with near or close
detectors in neutrino experiments T2K ND280, NO$\nu$A, MINER$\nu$A as well as
in NOMAD and PS191. The scenarios immediately connect the MiniBooNE excess and
expected numbers of new physics events in these detectors. We compute the
expected numbers of events as functions of lifetimes and masses of new
particles and confront them with the corresponding experimental bounds. We
indicate scenarios that are excluded or strongly disfavored by one or several

statistics of the distribution of matter are currently being developed. Among
these, we investigated the angular redshift fluctuations (ARF), which probe the
information contained in the projected redshift distribution of galaxies.
Relying on the Fisher formalism, we show how ARF will provide complementary
cosmological information compared to traditional angular galaxy clustering. We
tested both the standard $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ model and the $\mathrm{wCDM}$
extension. We find that the cosmological and galaxy bias parameters express
different degeneracies when inferred from ARF or from angular galaxy
clustering. As such, combining both observables breaks these degeneracies and
greatly decreases the marginalised uncertainties by a factor of at least two on
most parameters for the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ and $\mathrm{wCDM}$ models. We
find that the ARF combined with angular galaxy clustering provide a great way
to probe dark energy by increasing the figure of merit of the $w_0$-$w_{\rm a}$
parameter set by a factor of more than ten compared to angular galaxy
clustering alone. Finally, we compared ARF to the CMB lensing constraints on
the galaxy bias parameters. We show that a joint analysis of ARF and angular
galaxy clustering improves constraints by $\sim 40\%$ on galaxy bias compared
to a joint analysis of angular galaxy clustering and CMB lensing.

the metallicity of the clumps and its volume fraction relative to the whole

near-to-solar region is recovered, while the metallicity of the clumps is
systematically underestimated, by up to 2 orders of magnitude. This is mainly
because most of the H$\beta$ emission is coming from the ""normal"" region, and
only the small contribution emitted by the metal-rich clumps should be used. We
find that a given ADF(O$^{++}$) can be reproduced by a small amount of rich
clumps, or a bigger amount of less rich clumps. Finally, comparing with the
observations of NGC 6153 we find 2 models that reproduce its ADF(O$^{++}$) and

cloud as a whole is brought into a superposition of two different spatial
locations, by mapping entanglement from a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic
system onto the condensate using off-resonant laser dressing [R. Mukherjee et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115 040401 (2015)]. A variational many-body Ansatz akin
to recently developed multi-configurational methods allows us to model this

mean-field physics for the description of each branch of the superposition. In
the second part of the article, we model the decoherence process due to atom
losses in detail. Altogether we confirm earlier estimates, that tightly
localized clouds of 400 atoms can be brought into a quantum superposition of
two locations about 3 {\mu}m apart and remain coherent for about 1 ms.

combining multiwavelength observations with a coronal field reconstruction
using a non-force-free field method. In the first stage, a filament forms via
magnetic reconnection between two mildly twisted sheared arcades, which are
embedded under the fan dome associated with a null point. This reconnection
seems to be driven by photospheric shearing and converging flows around the
inner two arcade footpoints, consistent with the flare-related changes of
transverse field. The southern portion of the filament rises upward due to
torus instability and pushes against the null point. The induced null point
reconnection then generates the circular ribbon and the initial remote
brightening in the west, as accelerated electrons precipitate along the fan and
propagate outward along quasi-separatix surfaces with high values of the
squashing factor (Q) in the envelope fields, which have a curtain-like shape
here. In the second stage, the southern end of the flux rope breaks away from
the surface, sequentially disrupts the dome and overlying fields, and erupts in
a whipping-like fashion to become a partial halo coronal mass ejection. This
leads to an enhanced flare emission and fast-moving remote brightenings at the
footpoints of the magnetic curtain, which span a remarkably broad region and
are also associated with coronal dimmings. This is a rare example of eruptive
circular-ribbon flares, in which the evolution of a flux rope from its
formation to successful eruption out of the dome and the resulting unusually
extended remote brightenings are completely observed.

quality of life of affected individuals. However, diagnosis is often delayed
even in wealthier countries including the US, largely due to the fact that gold
standard diagnostic tools such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
(ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) are time consuming
and require expertise to administer. This trend is even more pronounced lower
resources settings due to a lack of trained experts. As a result, alternative,
less technical methods that leverage the unique ways in which children with ASD
react to visual stimulation in a controlled environment have been developed to
help facilitate early diagnosis. Previous studies have shown that, when exposed
to a video that presents both social and abstract scenes side by side, a child
with ASD will focus their attention towards the abstract images on the screen
to a greater extent than a child without ASD. Such differential responses make
it possible to implement an algorithm for the rapid diagnosis of ASD based on
eye tracking against different visual stimuli. Here we propose a convolutional
neural network (CNN) algorithm for gaze prediction using images extracted from
a one-minute stimulus video. Our model achieved a high accuracy rate and
robustness for prediction of gaze direction with independent persons and
employing a different camera than the one used during testing. In addition to
this, the proposed algorithm achieves a fast response time, providing a near
real-time evaluation of ASD. Thereby, by applying the proposed method, we could
significantly reduce the diagnosis time and facilitate the diagnosis of ASD in
low resource regions.

discrete Str$\ddot{\mathrm{o}}$mgren spheres and considers the total volume of
ionized hydrogen in a galaxy of a given star-formation rate. We estimate the
relative volume of doubly-ionized oxygen and ionized hydrogen and its
dependence on the spectrum of ionizing photons. We then calculate the level
populations of OIII ions in different fine-structure states for HII regions of
specified parameters. In this simple model, a galaxy's OIII 88 micron
luminosity is determined by: the typical number density of free electrons in
HII regions ($n_e$), the average metallicity of these regions ($Z$), the rate
of hydrogen ionizing photons emitted ($Q_{\mathrm{HI}}$), and the shape of the
ionizing spectrum. We cross-check our model by comparing it with detailed
CLOUDY calculations, and find that it works to better than 15$\%$ accuracy
across a broad range of parameter space. Applying our model to existing ALMA
data at $z \sim 6-9$, we derive lower bounds on the gas metallicity and upper
bounds on the gas density in the HII regions of these galaxies. These limits
vary considerably from galaxy to galaxy, with the tightest bounds indicating $Z

model, which predicts the phenomenon of optical bistability, where the system
may relax to two different steady-states for the same driving condition. These
states, however, are inherently out-of-equilibrium and are thus characterized
by the continuous production of irreversible entropy, a key quantifier in
thermodynamics. In this paper we study the dynamics of the entropy production
rate in a quench scenario of the Kerr model, where the external pump is
abruptly changed. This is accomplished using a recently developed formalism,
based on the Husimi $Q$-function, which is particularly tailored for
driven-dissipative and non-Gaussian bosonic systems [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 013136
(2020)]. Within this framework the entropy production can be split into two
contributions, one being extensive with the drive and describing classical
irreversibility, and the other being intensive and directly related to quantum

concept, we can see that after 2000, the participation of different modes to
the network has increased and tends to the market mode of the system. Although
no important change in the total market share of trading occurs, through the

has increased. The technique proposed in the paper can be useful for analyzing

of semantic segmentation models suffer from challenges of predicting and
selecting reasonable good quality pseudo labels. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach of exploiting scale-invariance property of the semantic
segmentation model for self-supervised domain adaptation. Our algorithm is
based on a reasonable assumption that, in general, regardless of the size of
the object and stuff (given context) the semantic labeling should be unchanged.
We show that this constraint is violated over the images of the target domain,
and hence could be used to transfer labels in-between differently scaled
patches. Specifically, we show that semantic segmentation model produces output
with high entropy when presented with scaled-up patches of target domain, in
comparison to when presented original size images. These scale-invariant
examples are extracted from the most confident images of the target domain.
Dynamic class specific entropy thresholding mechanism is presented to filter
out unreliable pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we also incorporate the focal loss
to tackle the problem of class imbalance in self-supervised learning. Extensive
experiments have been performed, and results indicate that exploiting the
scale-invariant labeling, we outperform existing self-supervised based
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods. Specifically, we achieve 1.3% and
3.8% of lead for GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes with VGG16-FCN8

through forward modelling (SysSim) that the observed multiplicity distribution
can be well reproduced by two populations consisting of a low and a high mutual
inclination component. Here, we show that a broad distribution of mutual
inclinations arising from systems at the AMD-stability limit can also match the
observed Kepler population. We show that distributing a planetary system's
maximum AMD amongst its planets results in a multiplicity-dependent
distribution of eccentricities and mutual inclinations. Systems with
intrinsically more planets have lower median eccentricities and mutual
inclinations, and this trend is well described by power-law functions of the
intrinsic planet multiplicity ($n$): $\tilde{\mu}_{e,n} \propto
n^{-1.74_{-0.07}^{+0.11}}$ and $\tilde{\mu}_{i,n} \propto
n^{-1.73_{-0.08}^{+0.09}}$, where $\tilde{\mu}_{e,n}$ and $\tilde{\mu}_{i,n}$
are the medians of the eccentricity and inclination distributions. We also find
that intrinsic single planets have higher eccentricities ($\sigma_{e,1} \sim
0.25$) than multi-planet systems, and that the trends with multiplicity appear
in the observed distributions of period-normalized transit duration ratios. We
show that the observed preferences for planet size orderings and uniform
spacings are more extreme than what can be produced by the detection biases of
the Kepler mission alone. Finally, we find that for systems with detected
transiting planets between 5 and 10 days, there is another planet with a
greater radial velocity signal $\simeq~53\%$ of the time.

(HuBMAP) aims to create a comprehensive high-resolution atlas of all the cells
in the healthy human body. Multiple laboratories across the United States are
collecting tissue specimens from different organs of donors who vary in sex,
age, and body size. Integrating and harmonizing the data derived from these
samples and 'mapping' them into a common three-dimensional (3D) space is a
major challenge. The key to making this possible is a 'Common Coordinate
Framework' (CCF), which provides a semantically annotated, 3D reference system
for the entire body. The CCF enables contributors to HuBMAP to 'register'
specimens and datasets within a common spatial reference system, and it
supports a standardized way to query and 'explore' data in a spatially and
semantically explicit manner. [...] This paper describes the construction and
usage of a CCF for the human body and its reference implementation in HuBMAP.
The CCF consists of (1) a CCF Clinical Ontology, which provides metadata about
the specimen and donor (the 'who'); (2) a CCF Semantic Ontology, which
describes 'what' part of the body a sample came from and details anatomical
structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B); and (3) a CCF Spatial
Ontology, which indicates 'where' a tissue sample is located in a 3D coordinate
system. An initial version of all three CCF ontologies has been implemented for

different parts of a sensor network with time is studied. Each network sensor
is characterized by a non-anomalous and anomalous distribution, governing the
generation of sensor data. Initially, the observations of each sensor are
generated according to the corresponding non-anomalous distribution. After some
unknown but deterministic time instant, a moving anomaly emerges, affecting
different sets of sensors as time progresses. As a result, the observations of
the affected sensors are generated according to the corresponding anomalous
distribution. Our goal is to design a stopping procedure to detect the
emergence of the anomaly as quickly as possible, subject to constraints on the
frequency of false alarms. The problem is studied in a quickest change
detection framework where it is assumed that the evolution of the anomaly is
unknown but deterministic. To this end, we propose a modification of Lorden's
worst average detection delay metric to account for the trajectory of the
anomaly that maximizes the detection delay of a candidate detection procedure.
We establish that a Cumulative Sum-type test solves the resulting sequential
detection problem exactly when the sensors are homogeneous. For the case of
heterogeneous sensors, the proposed detection scheme can be modified to provide
a first-order asymptotically optimal algorithm. We conclude by presenting
numerical simulations to validate our theoretical analysis.

placement and decisions about the data collection strategy for engineered or

battery design, numerical weather prediction, geosciences, and environmental
and urban studies. State-of-the-art computational methods for experimental
design, however, do not accommodate correlation structure in observational
errors produced by many expensive-to-operate devices such as X-ray machines or
radar and satellite retrievals. Discarding evident data correlations leads to
biased results, poor data collection decisions, and waste of valuable
resources. We present a general formulation of the OED formalism for
model-constrained large-scale Bayesian linear inverse problems, where
measurement errors are generally correlated. The proposed approach utilizes the
Hadamard product of matrices to formulate the weighted likelihood and is valid
for both finite- and infinite- dimensional Bayesian inverse problems. We also
discuss widely used approaches for relaxation of the binary OED problem, in
light of the proposed pointwise weighting approach, and present a clear
interpretation of the relaxed design and its effect on the observational error
covariance. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out for empirical
verification of the proposed approach by using an advection-diffusion model,
where the objective is to optimally place a small set of sensors, under a
limited budget, to predict the concentration of a contaminant in a bounded
domain.

address this shortcoming, but existing approaches require vast amounts of
navigation experience for training, during which the robot must operate in
close proximity to obstacles and risk collision. In this paper, we propose to
side-step this requirement by introducing a new machine learning paradigm for
autonomous navigation called learning from hallucination (LfH), which can use
training data collected in completely safe environments to compute navigation
controllers that result in fast, smooth, and safe navigation in highly
constrained environments. Our experimental results show that the proposed LfH

generalizes well to unseen environments, including those based on both

entropy does not remain invariant under Lorentz boosts, and neither do the

Lorentz invariant. Peres et al., in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 230402 (2002)],
realized that even though it is possible to formally define spin in any Lorentz
frame, there is no relationship between the observable expectation values in
different Lorentz frames. Analogously, even though it is possible to formally
define complementarity in any Lorentz frame, in principle, there's no
relationship between the complementarity relations of different Lorentz frames.
However, our result shows that it's possible to connect complete
complementarity relations in different Lorentz frames. In addition, we explore
relativistic scenarios for single and two particle states, which helps in
understanding the exchange of different aspects of a quantum system under

best used to yield a simple selection boundary that will be best suited to meet

Recently, the development of deep learning based methods has inspired new
approaches to tackle the PIV problem. These supervised learning based methods
are driven by large volumes of data with ground truth training information.
However, it is difficult to collect reliable ground truth data in large-scale,
real-world scenarios. Although synthetic datasets can be used as alternatives,
the gap between the training set-ups and real-world scenarios limits
applicability. We present here what we believe to be the first work which takes
an unsupervised learning based approach to tackle PIV problems. The proposed
approach is inspired by classic optical flow methods. Instead of using ground
truth data, we make use of photometric loss between two consecutive image
frames, consistency loss in bidirectional flow estimates and spatial smoothness
loss to construct the total unsupervised loss function. The approach shows
significant potential and advantages for fluid flow estimation. Results
presented here demonstrate that our method outputs competitive results compared
with classical PIV methods as well as supervised learning based methods for a
broad PIV dataset, and even outperforms these existing approaches in some
difficult flow cases. Codes and trained models are available at

deep inelastic scattering (DIS) to the energy and intensity frontier of
particle physics. Exploiting energy recovery technology, it collides a novel,
intense electron beam with a proton or ion beam from the High Luminosity--Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). The accelerator and interaction region are designed
for concurrent electron-proton and proton-proton operation. This report
represents an update of the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) of the LHeC,
published in 2012. It comprises new results on parton structure of the proton
and heavier nuclei, QCD dynamics, electroweak and top-quark physics. It is
shown how the LHeC will open a new chapter of nuclear particle physics in
extending the accessible kinematic range in lepton-nucleus scattering by
several orders of magnitude. Due to enhanced luminosity, large energy and the
cleanliness of the hadronic final states, the LHeC has a strong Higgs physics
programme and its own discovery potential for new physics. Building on the 2012
CDR, the report represents a detailed updated design of the energy recovery
electron linac (ERL) including new lattice, magnet, superconducting radio
frequency technology and further components. Challenges of energy recovery are
described and the lower energy, high current, 3-turn ERL facility, PERLE at
Orsay, is presented which uses the LHeC characteristics serving as a
development facility for the design and operation of the LHeC. An updated
detector design is presented corresponding to the acceptance, resolution and
calibration goals which arise from the Higgs and parton density function
physics programmes. The paper also presents novel results on the Future
Circular Collider in electron-hadron mode, FCC-eh, which utilises the same ERL
technology to further extend the reach of DIS to even higher centre-of-mass
energies.

3844b, a 1.3 Earth radius planet in a 0.46 day orbit around an M4.5-5 dwarf
star. Follow-up observations indicate that the planet is largely devoid of
substantial atmosphere. This lack of significant atmosphere places
astrophysical and geophysical constraints on LHS 3844b, primarily the degree of
volatile outgassing and the rate of atmosphere erosion. We estimate the age of
the host star as $7.8\pm1.6$ Gyrs and find evidence of an active past
comparable to Proxima Centauri. We use geodynamical models of volcanic
outgassing and atmospheric erosion to show that the apparent lack of atmosphere
is consistent with a volatile-poor mantle for LHS 3844b. We show the core is
unlikely to host enough C to produce a sufficiently volatile-poor mantle,
unless the bulk planet is volatile-poor relative to Earth. While we cannot rule
out a giant impact stripping LHS 3844b's atmosphere, we show this mechanism
would require significant mantle stripping, potentially leaving LHS 3844b as an
Fe-rich ""super-Mercury"". Atmospheric erosion by smaller impacts is possible,
but only if the planet has already begun degassing and is bombarded by $10^3$
impactors of radius 500-1000 km traveling at escape velocity. We discuss
formation and migration scenarios that could account for a volatile poor
origin, including the potential for an unobserved massive companion planet. A
relatively volatile-poor composition of LHS 3844b suggests that the planet
formed interior to the system snow-line.

several existing methods for removing such systematics from galaxy clustering
measurements. We show how all the methods, including the popular
pseudo-$C_\ell$ Mode Projection and Template Subtraction methods, can be
interpreted under a common regression framework and use this to suggest
improved estimators. We show how methods designed to mitigate systematics in
the power spectrum can be used to produce clean maps, which are necessary for
cosmological analyses beyond the power spectrum, and we extend current methods
to treat the next-order multiplicative contamination in observed maps and power
spectra. Two new mitigation methods are proposed, which incorporate desirable
features of current state-of-the-art methods while being simpler to implement.
Investigating the performance of all the methods on a common set of simulated
measurements from Year 5 of the Dark Energy Survey, we test their robustness to
various analysis cases. Our proposed methods produce improved maps and power
spectra when compared to current methods, while requiring almost no user
tuning. We end with recommendations for systematics mitigation in future

aims to develop natural communication between the partners to bring speed,
flexibility, and ergonomics to the execution of complex manufacturing tasks.
One challenge in pHRI is to design an optimal interaction controller to balance
the limitations introduced by the contradicting nature of transparency and
stability requirements. In this paper, a general methodology to design an
admittance controller for a pHRI system is developed by considering the
stability and transparency objectives. In our approach, collaborative robot
constrains the movement of human operator to help with a pHRI task while an
augmented reality (AR) interface informs the operator about its phases. To this
end, dynamical characterization of the collaborative robot (LBR IIWA 7 R800,
KUKA Inc.) is presented first. Then, the stability and transparency analyses
for our pHRI task involving collaborative drilling with this robot are
reported. A range of allowable parameters for the admittance controller is
determined by superimposing the stability and transparency graphs. Finally,
three different sets of parameters are selected from the allowable range and
the effect of admittance controllers utilizing these parameter sets on the task
performance is investigated.

Measuring lunar distances, using the projected positions on the sky of the Moon

of Longitude's endorsement in 1765 of the establishment of a Nautical Almanac.
Numerous 'projectors' jumped onto the bandwagon, leading to a proliferation of

  Supplementary Information Document",,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Solitons are shape preserving waveforms that are ubiquitous across nonlinear
dynamical systems and fall into two separate classes, that of bright solitons,
formed in the anomalous group velocity dispersion regime, and `dark solitons'
in the normal dispersion regime. Both types of soliton have been observed in
BEC, hydrodynamics, polaritons, and mode locked lasers, but have been
particularly relevant to the generation of chipscale microresonator-based
frequency combs (microcombs), used in numerous system level applications in
timing, spectroscopy, and communications. For microcombs, both bright solitons,
and alternatively dark pulses based on interlocking switching waves, have been
studied. Yet, the existence of localized dissipative structures that fit
between this dichotomy has been theoretically predicted, but proven
experimentally elusive. Here we report the discovery of dissipative structures
that embody a hybrid between switching waves and dissipative solitons, existing
in the regime of (nearly) vanishing group velocity dispersion where third-order
dispersion is dominant, hence termed as `zero-dispersion solitons'. These
dissipative structures are formed via collapsing switching wave fronts, forming
clusters of quantized solitonic sub-structures. The switching waves are formed
directly via synchronous pulse-driving of a photonic chip-based Si3N4
microresonator. The resulting frequency comb spectrum is extremely broad in
both the switching wave and zero-dispersion soliton regime, reaching 136 THz or
97% of an octave. Fourth-order dispersion engineering results in
dual-dispersive wave formation, and a novel quasi-phase matched wave related to
Faraday instability. This exotic unanticipated dissipative structure expands
the domain of Kerr cavity physics to the regime near zero-dispersion and could
present a superior alternative to conventional solitons for broadband comb
generation.

using still-images have consistently improved performances and attracted new
researchers. Now, systems reach performance levels unforeseeable a decade ago,
closing in on performances acceptable to deploy in practice. Like other
biometric tasks, we expect systems can receive help from other modalities. We
hypothesize that adding modalities to FIW, which has only still-images, will
improve performance. Thus, to narrow the gap between research and reality and
enhance the power of kinship recognition systems, we extend FIW with multimedia
(MM) data (i.e., video, audio, and text captions). Specifically, we introduce
the first publicly available multi-task MM kinship dataset. To build FIW MM, we
developed machinery to automatically collect, annotate, and prepare the data,
requiring minimal human input and no financial cost. The proposed MM corpus
allows the problem statements to be more realistic template-based protocols. We
show significant improvements in all benchmarks with the added modalities. The
results highlight edge cases to inspire future research with different areas of
improvement. FIW MM supplies the data needed to increase the potential of
automated systems to detect kinship in MM. It also allows experts from diverse
fields to collaborate in novel ways.

images are obscured and become unclear. In this paper, we tackle this problem
and propose a novel task to virtually decompose the soft tissue and bone by
image processing algorithms. This task is fundamentally different from
segmentation because the decomposed images share the same imaging domain. Our
decomposition task is also fundamentally different from the conventional image
enhancement. We propose a new mathematical model for such decomposition. Our
model is ill-posed and thus it requires some priors. With proper assumptions,
our model can be solved by solving a standard Laplace equation. The resulting
bone image is theoretically guaranteed to have better contrast than the
original input image. Therefore, the details of bones get enhanced and become
clearer. Several numerical experiments confirm the effective and efficiency of
our method. Our approach is important for clinical diagnosis, surgery planning,

adequately exploit these additive benefits. We present $S^3$Net, a

federated learning (FL) may place undue burden on the compute capability of
edge nodes, even though there is a strong practical need for FL due to its
privacy and confidentiality properties. To address the resource-constrained
reality of edge devices, we reformulate FL as a group knowledge transfer
training algorithm, called FedGKT. FedGKT designs a variant of the alternating
minimization approach to train small CNNs on edge nodes and periodically
transfer their knowledge by knowledge distillation to a large server-side CNN.
FedGKT consolidates several advantages into a single framework: reduced demand
for edge computation, lower communication bandwidth for large CNNs, and
asynchronous training, all while maintaining model accuracy comparable to
FedAvg. We train CNNs designed based on ResNet-56 and ResNet-110 using three
distinct datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10) and their non-I.I.D.
variants. Our results show that FedGKT can obtain comparable or even slightly
higher accuracy than FedAvg. More importantly, FedGKT makes edge training
affordable. Compared to the edge training using FedAvg, FedGKT demands 9 to 17
times less computational power (FLOPs) on edge devices and requires 54 to 105
times fewer parameters in the edge CNN. Our source code is released at FedML

that adding means to uncertainty visualizations has small biasing effects on

Uncertainty visualizations which are optimally designed in theory may not be

maintaining disjoint states and processing a subset of transactions in the

a result, tolerates more failures within a shard and lowers communication

thanks to their flexibility in tackling a wide range of forward and inverse
problems involving partial differential equations. However, despite their
noticeable empirical success, little is known about how such constrained neural
networks behave during their training via gradient descent. More importantly,
even less is known about why such models sometimes fail to train at all. In
this work, we aim to investigate these questions through the lens of the Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK); a kernel that captures the behavior of fully-connected
neural networks in the infinite width limit during training via gradient
descent. Specifically, we derive the NTK of PINNs and prove that, under
appropriate conditions, it converges to a deterministic kernel that stays
constant during training in the infinite-width limit. This allows us to analyze
the training dynamics of PINNs through the lens of their limiting NTK and find
a remarkable discrepancy in the convergence rate of the different loss
components contributing to the total training error. To address this
fundamental pathology, we propose a novel gradient descent algorithm that
utilizes the eigenvalues of the NTK to adaptively calibrate the convergence
rate of the total training error. Finally, we perform a series of numerical

binary-type physical properties for models in biomedical applications is
developed and validated. The methodology includes gradient-based multiscale
optimization with multilevel control space reduction by using principal
component analysis (PCA) coupled with dynamical control space upscaling. The
reduced dimensional controls are used interchangeably at fine and coarse scales
to accumulate the optimization progress and mitigate side effects at both
scales. Flexibility is achieved through the proposed procedure for calibrating
certain parameters to enhance the performance of the optimization algorithm.
Reduced size of control spaces supplied with adjoint-based gradients obtained
at both scales facilitate the application of this algorithm to models of higher
complexity and also to a broad range of problems in biomedical sciences. This
technique is shown to outperform regular gradient-based methods applied to fine
scale only in terms of both qualities of binary images and computing time.
Performance of the complete computational framework is tested in applications
to 2D inverse problems of cancer detection by the electrical impedance
tomography (EIT). The results demonstrate the efficient performance of the new
method and its high potential for minimizing possibilities for false positive
screening and improving the overall quality of the EIT-based procedures.

Interferometer (LBTI). It is a near-infrared camera which is used to measure
both tip/tilt and fringe phase variations between the two adaptive optics (AO)
corrected apertures of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Tip/tilt and phase
sensing are currently performed in the $H$ (1.65 $\mu$m) and $K$ (2.2 $\mu$m)
bands at 1 kHz, but only the $K$-band phase telemetry is used to send
corrections to the system in order to maintain fringe coherence and visibility.
However, due to the cyclic nature of the fringe phase, only the phase, modulo
360 deg, can be measured. PHASECam's phase unwrapping algorithm, which attempts
to mitigate this issue, occasionally fails in the case of fast, large phase
variations or low signal-to-noise ratio. This can cause a fringe jump, in which
case the OPD correction will be incorrect by a wavelength. This can currently
be manually corrected by the operator. However, as the LBTI commissions further
modes which require robust, active phase control and for which fringe jumps are
harder to detect, including multi-axial (Fizeau) interferometry and
dual-aperture non-redundant aperture masking interferometry, a more reliable
and automated solution is desired. We present a multi-wavelength method of
fringe jump capture and correction which involves direct comparison between the
$K$-band and $H$-band phase telemetry. We demonstrate the method utilizing
archival PHASECam telemetry, showing it provides a robust, reliable way of
detecting fringe jumps which can potentially recover a significant fraction of

applications of full-duplex to improve network spectral efficiency, and in
recent years advanced to discover full-duplex's potentials for wireless network
security. The research on SI cancellation has resulted in both hardware-based
SI cancellation results and some advanced theoretical architectures which show
promises but are yet to be tested via advanced hardware implementations. The
applications of full-duplex for optimized spectral efficiency in ad hoc,
cognitive and cellular networks have shown how to optimize power allocation
among full-duplex nodes, in their antenna beamspace and over multiple
subcarriers. Full-duplex has also been found to be highly beneficial for
improving secrecy capacity between legitimate users against eavesdropping.
Among the new capabilities that full-duplex provides for network security is an
effective anti-eavesdropping channel estimation scheme which is not possible

of interest and $\eta_i$ is independent noise; except we are only given an

$k$-sparse $n$-dimensional vectors $x^*$ from $m$ truncated samples, which
attains an optimal $\ell_2$ reconstruction error of $O(\sqrt{(k \log n)/m})$.
As a corollary, our guarantees imply a computationally efficient and
information-theoretically optimal algorithm for compressed sensing with
truncation, which may arise from measurement saturation effects. Our result
follows from a statistical and computational analysis of the Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for solving a natural adaptation of the LASSO
optimization problem that accommodates truncation. This generalizes the works
of both: (1) [Daskalakis et al. 2018], where no regularization is needed due to
the low-dimensionality of the data, and (2) [Wainright 2009], where the
objective function is simple due to the absence of truncation. In order to deal
with both truncation and high-dimensionality at the same time, we develop new
techniques that not only generalize the existing ones but we believe are of
independent interest.

an infinite discrete set of topologically different gap functions, $\Delta_n
(\omega_m)$, all with the same spatial symmetry, and (ii) each $\Delta_n$
evolves with temperature and terminates at a particular $T_{p,n}$. In this
paper, we analyze how the system behavior changes between $\gamma <1$ and
$\gamma >1$, both at $T=0$ and a finite $T$. The limit $\gamma \to 1$ is
singular due to infra-red divergence of $\int d \omega_m V(\Omega_m)$, and the
system behavior is highly sensitive to how this limit is taken. We show that
for $N =1$, the divergencies in the gap equation cancel out, and $\Delta_n
(\omega_m)$ gradually evolve through $\gamma=1$ both at $T=0$ and a finite $T$.
For $N \neq 1$, divergent terms do not cancel, and a qualitatively new behavior
emerges for $\gamma >1$. Namely, the form of $\Delta_n (\omega_m)$ changes
qualitatively, and the spectrum of condensation energies, $E_{c,n}$ becomes
continuous at $T=0$. We introduce different extension of the model, which is
free from singularities for $\gamma >1$.

phenotypic dynamics, can be interpreted as a random dynamical system. The
ability to make accurate predictions about patient state from clinical
measurements has eluded the biomedical community, primarily due to the paucity
of relevant and high-resolution data. We have utilized two distinct neural
network architectures, Long Short-Term Memory and Multi-Layer Perceptron, to
take a time sequence of five measurements of eleven simulated serum cytokine
concentrations as input and to return both the future cytokine trajectories as
well as an aggregate metric representing the patient's state of health. The
neural networks converged within 50 epochs for cytokine trajectory predictions
and health-metric regressions, with the expected amount of error (due to
stochasticity in the simulation). The mapping from a specific cytokine profile
to a state-of-health is not unique, and increased levels of inflammation result
in less accurate predictions. Due to the propagation of machine learning error
combined with computational model stochasticity over time, the network should
be re-grounded in reality daily as predictions can diverge from the true model
trajectory as the system evolves towards a probabilistic basin of attraction.
This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the use of artificial neural
networks to predict disease progression in sepsis. This work is not intended to
replace a trained clinician, rather the goal is to augment intuition with
quantifiable statistical information to help them make the best decisions. We

a fixed form, which limits their ability to adapt practical non-convex
optimization problems due to the significant diversification of training
dynamics. Meanwhile, it always needs to search proper LR schedules from scratch
for new tasks, which, however, are often largely different with task
variations, like data modalities, network architectures, or training data
capacities. To address this learning-rate-schedule setting issues, we propose
to parameterize LR schedules with an explicit mapping formulation, called
\textit{MLR-SNet}. The learnable parameterized structure brings more
flexibility for MLR-SNet to learn a proper LR schedule to comply with the
training dynamics of DNN. Image and text classification benchmark experiments
substantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper LR schedules.
Moreover, the explicit parameterized structure makes the meta-learned LR
schedules capable of being transferable and plug-and-play, which can be easily
generalized to new heterogeneous tasks. We transfer our meta-learned MLR-SNet
to query tasks like different training epochs, network architectures, data
modalities, dataset sizes from the training ones, and achieve comparable or
even better performance compared with hand-designed LR schedules specifically
designed for the query tasks. The robustness of MLR-SNet is also substantiated
when the training data are biased with corrupted noise. We further prove the

MLR-Net, with the convergence rate comparable to the best-known ones of the

accuracy without renormalization scale ambiguities. The NNLO total
cross-section for $e^{+}+e^{-}\to\gamma+\eta_{c}$ using the conventional
scale-setting approach has large renormalization scale ambiguities, usually
estimated by choosing the renormalization scale to be the $e^+ e^-$
center-of-mass collision energy $\sqrt{s}$. The Principle of Maximum
Conformality (PMC) provides a systematic way to eliminate such renormalization
scale ambiguities by summing the nonconformal $\beta$ contributions into the
QCD coupling $\alpha_s(Q^2)$. The renormalization group equation then sets the
value of $\alpha_s$ for the process. The PMC renormalization scale reflects the
virtuality of the underlying process, and the resulting predictions satisfy all
of the requirements of renormalization group invariance, including
renormalization scheme invariance. After applying the PMC, we obtain a
scale-and-scheme independent prediction, $\sigma|_{\rm NNLO, PMC}\simeq 41.18$
fb for $\sqrt{s}$=10.6 GeV. The resulting pQCD series matches the series for
conformal theory and thus has no divergent renormalon contributions. The large
$K$ factor which contributes to this process reinforces the importance of
uncalculated NNNLO and higher-order terms. Using the PMC scale-and-scheme
independent conformal series and the $\rm Pad\acute{e}$ approximation approach,
we predict $\sigma|_{\rm NNNLO, PMC+Pade} \simeq 21.36$ fb, which is consistent
with the recent BELLE measurement $\sigma^{\rm obs}$=$16.58^{+10.51}_{-9.93}$
fb at $\sqrt{s} \simeq 10.6$ GeV. This procedure also provides a first estimate
of the NNNLO contribution.

the distribution parameters are unknown in practice and need to be estimated.
Due to the increased computational complexity in the quantization noise model,
previous works either use an approximated noise model or manually tune the

objective of the control design is to attenuate or eliminate their adverse
effects on the system performance. This paper presents a disturbance rejection
approach with two main improvements over existing results: 1) it relaxes the
requirement of calculating or measuring the state derivatives, which are not
available for measurement, and their calculation is corrupted by noise, and 2)
it achieves finite-time disturbance rejection and control. To this end, the
disturbance is first modeled by an unknown dynamics, and an adaptive
disturbance observer is proposed to estimate it. A filtered regressor form is
leveraged to model the nonlinear system and the unknown disturbance. It is
shown that using this filtered regressor form, the disturbance is estimated
using only measured state of the regressor. That is, contrary to the existing
results on disturbance rejection, the presented approach does not require the
state derivative measurements. To improve the convergence speed of the
disturbance estimation, an adaptive law, equipped with experience replay, is
presented. The disturbance observer is then augmented with an adaptive integral
terminal sliding mode control to assure the finite-time convergence of tracking
error to zero. A verifiable rank condition on the history of the past
experience used by the experience-replay technique provides a sufficient
condition for convergence. Compared to the existing results, neither the
knowledge of the disturbance dynamics nor the state derivatives are required,
and finite-time stability is guaranteed. A simulation example illustrates the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

the more difficult problem of hypothesis testing with quantum channels, i.e.,
channel discrimination, is less understood. This is mainly due to the
complications coming from the use of input entanglement and the possibility of
employing adaptive strategies. In this paper, we establish a lower limit for
the ultimate error probability affecting the discrimination of an arbitrary
number of quantum channels. We also show that this lower bound is achievable
when the channels have certain symmetries. As an example, we apply our results
to the problem of channel position finding, where the goal is to identify the

$\mathcal{A}_n$ or $\mathcal{S}_n$ with high probability.
  Finally, when $\mu$ is the uniform measure on a finite arithmetic progression
of at least two elements, we prove a random polynomial $f(x)$ as above is
irreducible with probability $\ge\delta$ for some constant
$\delta=\delta(\mu)>0$. In fact, if the arithmetic progression has step 1, we
prove the stronger result that the Galois group of $f(x)$ is $\mathcal{A}_n$ or

networking, system, and database applications. In this problem, two large sets
A and B of objects (bitcoins, files, records, etc.) are stored respectively at
two different network-connected hosts, which we name Alice and Bob

the difference between A and B, and as a result the reconciled set $A\bigcup
B$.
  Current set reconciliation schemes are based on either Invertible Bloom
Filters (IBF) or Error-Correction Codes (ECC). The former has a low
computational complexity of O(d), where d is the cardinality of $A\Delta B$,
but has a high communication overhead that is several times larger than the
theoretical minimum. The latter has a low communication overhead close to the
theoretical minimum, but has a much higher computational complexity of
$O(d^2)$. In this work, we propose Parity Bitmap Sketch (PBS), an ECC- based
set reconciliation scheme that gets the better of both worlds: PBS has both a
low computational complexity of O(d) just like IBF-based solutions and a low
communication overhead of roughly twice the theoretical minimum. A separate
contribution of this work is a novel rigorous analytical framework that can be
used for the precise calculation of various performance metrics and for the

VA services raises privacy concerns such as the leakage of private
conversations and sensitive information. Privacy policies play an important
role in addressing users' privacy concerns and informing them about the data
collection, storage, and sharing practices. VA platforms (both Amazon Alexa and
Google Assistant) allow third-party developers to build new voice-apps and
publish them to the app store. Voice-app developers are required to provide
privacy policies to disclose their apps' data practices. However, little is
known whether these privacy policies are informative and trustworthy or not on
emerging VA platforms. On the other hand, many users invoke voice-apps through
voice and thus there exists a usability challenge for users to access these
privacy policies. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale data
analytics to systematically measure the effectiveness of privacy policies
provided by voice-app developers on two mainstream VA platforms. We seek to
understand the quality and usability issues of privacy policies provided by
developers in the current app stores. We analyzed 64,720 Amazon Alexa skills

understand users' perspectives on VA's privacy policies. Our findings reveal a
worrisome reality of privacy policies in two mainstream voice-app stores, where
there exists a substantial number of problematic privacy policies.
Surprisingly, Google and Amazon even have official voice-apps violating their

$13.3^{+4.8}_{-3.7}$ net counts are observed. From a basic spectral analysis,
the X-ray spectrum of the quasar is soft (hardness ratio of $\mathcal{HR} =

columns and thus are promising to enhance various learning tasks on ubiquitous
tabular data. To automate the generation of interactive features, existing
works either explicitly traverse the feature space or implicitly express the
interactions via intermediate activations of some designed models. These two
kinds of methods show that there is essentially a trade-off between feature
interpretability and search efficiency. To possess both of their merits, we
propose a novel method named Feature Interaction Via Edge Search (FIVES), which
formulates the task of interactive feature generation as searching for edges on
the defined feature graph. Specifically, we first present our theoretical
evidence that motivates us to search for useful interactive features with
increasing order. Then we instantiate this search strategy by optimizing both a
dedicated graph neural network (GNN) and the adjacency tensor associated with
the defined feature graph. In this way, the proposed FIVES method simplifies
the time-consuming traversal as a typical training course of GNN and enables
explicit feature generation according to the learned adjacency tensor.
Experimental results on both benchmark and real-world datasets show the
advantages of FIVES over several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the
interactive features identified by FIVES are deployed on the recommender system
of Taobao, a worldwide leading e-commerce platform. Results of an online A/B
testing further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method FIVES, and we
further provide FIVES as AI utilities for the customers of Alibaba Cloud.

with content provider (CP) competition. We consider competing CPs who pay
prioritization fees to a monopolistic ISP so as to offset the ISP's cost for
investing in infrastructure to support fast lanes. Unlike prior works, our
proposed model of users' content consumption accounts for multi-purchasing
(i.e., users simultaneously subscribing to more than one CP). This model allows
us to account for the ""attention"" received by each CP, and consequently to draw
a contrast between how subscription-revenues and ad-revenues are impacted by
paid prioritization. We show that there exist incentives for the ISP to build
additional fast lanes subsidized by CPs with sufficiently high revenue (from
either subscription fees or advertisements). We show that non-prioritized
content providers need not lose users, yet may lose revenue from advertisements
due to decreased attention from users. We further show that users will consume
a wider variety of content in a prioritized regime, and that they can attain
higher welfare provided that non-prioritized traffic is not throttled. We

the Universe. They are ubiquitous in large galaxies and are believed to trace
intense star formation events and the hierarchical build-up of structure.
Observations of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and a wide variety of other
galaxies, have found evidence for a `metallicity floor', whereby no globular
clusters are found with chemical (`metal') abundances below approximately 0.3
to 0.4 per cent of that of the Sun. The existence of this metallicity floor may
reflect a minimum mass and a maximum redshift for surviving globular clusters
to form, both critical components for understanding the build-up of mass in the
universe. Here we report measurements from the Southern Stellar Streams
Spectroscopic Survey of the spatially thin, dynamically cold Phoenix stellar
stream in the halo of the Milky Way. The properties of the Phoenix stream are
consistent with it being the tidally disrupted remains of a globular cluster.
However, its metal abundance ([Fe/H] = -2.7) is substantially below that of the
empirical metallicity floor. The Phoenix stream thus represents the debris of
the most metal-poor globular cluster discovered so far, and its progenitor is
distinct from the present-day globular cluster population in the local
Universe. Its existence implies that globular clusters below the metallicity
floor have probably existed, but were destroyed during Galactic evolution.

alignment at the feature level on each sheet music line, and then performs a
second alignment at the segment level. By operating at the segment level, it is
able to encode domain knowledge about how likely a particular jump is. Through
carefully controlled experiments on unprocessed sheet music PDFs from IMSLP, we
show that Hierarachical DTW significantly outperforms Jump DTW in handling

(2) we propose an approach that can be trained on unlabeled data. Our approach
first converts the sheet music image into a sequence of musical ""words"" based

performance by first training a language model on a set of unlabeled data,

Specifically, we design novel regularized pooling layers that highlight salient

identify a certain disease based on the node pooling scores calculated by the
pooling layers. Our proposed framework, Pooling Regularized-GNN (PR-GNN),
encourages reasonable ROI-selection and provides flexibility to preserve either

existence of novel physical phenomena with no analog in the equilibrium case.
The Keldysh path-integral theory is a powerful tool to investigate these
systems. However, it has still been challenge to study strong nonlinear effects
implemented by recent experiments, since in this case the photon number is few
and quantum fluctuations play a crucial role in dynamics of system. Here we
develop a new approach for deriving exact steady states of driven-dissipative
systems by introducing the Keldysh partition function in the Fock-state basis
and then mapping the standard saddle-point equations into KeldyshHeisenberg
equations. We take the strong Kerr nonlinear resonators with/without the
nonlinear driving as two examples to illustrate our method. It is found that in
the absence of the nonlinear driving, the exact steady state obtained does not
exhibit bistability and agree well with the complex P-representation solution.
While in the presence of the nonlinear driving, the multiphoton resonance
effects are revealed and are consistent with the qualitative analysis. Our
method provides an intuitive way to explore a variety of driven-dissipative
systems especially with strong correlations.

allowing for the efficient and robust solution to the block linear systems
arising from the three-field displacement-velocity-pressure formulation of
coupled poromechanics. For its application, however, it is necessary to invert
blocks with the algebraic form $\hat{C} = ( C + \beta F F^T)$, where $C$ is a
symmetric positive definite matrix, $FF^T$ a rank-deficient term, and $\beta$ a
real non-negative coefficient. The inversion of $\hat{C}$, performed in an
inexact way, can become unstable for large values of $\beta$, as it usually
occurs at some stages of a full poromechanical simulation. In this work, we
propose a family of algebraic techniques to stabilize the inexact solve with
$\hat{C}$. This strategy can prove useful in other problems as well where such
an issue might arise, such as augmented Lagrangian preconditioning techniques
for Navier-Stokes or incompressible elasticity. First, we introduce an
iterative scheme obtained by a natural splitting of matrix $\hat{C}$. Second,
we develop a technique based on the use of a proper projection operator
annihilating the near-kernel modes of $\hat{C}$. Both approaches give rise to a
novel class of preconditioners denoted as Enhanced RPF (ERPF). Effectiveness

shown to be accurate and robust, and have real-time performance capabilities on

dealing with aerial frames captured by a camera mounted on an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) because the flight height of the UAV can be difficult to control
and is easily affected by the environment.To cope with the case of lost
tracking, many visual SLAM systems employ a relocalization strategy. This
involves the tracking thread continuing the online working by inspecting the
connections between the subsequent new frames and the generated map before the
tracking was lost. To solve the missing map problem, which is an issue in many
applications , after the tracking is lost, based on monocular visual SLAM, we
present a method of reconstructing a complete global map of UAV datasets by
sequentially merging the submaps via the corresponding undirected connected
graph. Specifically, submaps are repeatedly generated, from the initialization
process to the place where the tracking is lost, and a corresponding undirected
connected graph is built by considering these submaps as nodes and the common
map points within two submaps as edges. The common map points are then
determined by the bag-of-words (BoW) method, and the submaps are merged if they
are found to be connected with the online map in the undirect connected graph.
To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we first investigated
the performance on a UAV dataset, and the experimental results showed that, in
the case of several tracking failures, the integrity of the mapping was
significantly better than that of the current mainstream SLAM method.

we benchmark whether it is better to explore a large quantity of hyperparameter

Halving, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization algorithms, the latter two

give quantitative formulae for this. The Keplerian velocity is considerably
lower for hotter stars, which may set a de-facto maximum rotation rate for
non-recycled NSs well below 1 kHz. Magnetic fields stronger than around

The Bloch equation takes into account non spin-flip and spin-flip effects due
to synchrotron radiation including the spin-diffusion effects and the
Sokolov-Ternov effect with its Baier-Katkov generalization as well as the
kinetic-polarization effect. This mathematical model is an alternative to the

numerical and analytical studies of the Bloch equation we develop an
approximation to the latter to obtain an effective Bloch equation. This is
accomplished by finding a third mathematical model based on a system of
stochastic differential equations underlying the Bloch equation and by
approximating that system via the method of averaging from perturbative ODE
theory. We also give an overview of our algorithm for numerically integrating
the effective Bloch equation. This discretizes the phase space using spectral
methods and discretizes time via the additive Runge-Kutta method which is a
high-order semi-implicit method. We also discuss the relevance of the third
mathematical model for spin tracking.

Conventional methods solve this problem via iterative (alternating)
minimization by leveraging some prior knowledge about the structure of the

measurements make this problem especially difficult; and most of the existing
methods use several random restarts with different permutations. In this paper,
we assume that a known (learned) reference is added to the signal before
capturing the Fourier amplitude measurements. Our method is inspired by the
principle of adding a reference signal in holography. To recover the signal, we
implement an iterative phase retrieval method as an unrolled network. Then we
use back propagation to learn the reference that provides us the best
reconstruction for a fixed number of phase retrieval iterations. We performed a
number of simulations on a variety of datasets under different conditions and
found that our proposed method for phase retrieval via unrolled network and

semi-analytic reionisation models still require very large N-body simulations
in order to resolve the atomic cooling limit across the whole reionisation
history within box sizes $\gtrsim 100 \, h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$. To facilitate this,
we extend the mass resolution of N-body simulations using a Monte Carlo
algorithm. We also propose a method to evolve positions of Monte Carlo halos,
which can be an input for semi-analytic reionisation models. To illustrate, we
present an extended halo catalogue that reaches a mass resolution of
$M_\text{halo} = 3.2 \times 10^7 \, h^{-1} \text{M}_\odot$ in a $105 \, h^{-1}
{\rm Mpc}$ box, equivalent to an N-body simulation with $\sim 6800^3$
particles. The resulting halo mass function agrees with smaller volume N-body
simulations with higher resolution. Our results also produce consistent
two-point correlation functions with analytic halo bias predictions. The
extended halo catalogues are applied to the \textsc{meraxes} semi-analytic
reionisation model, which improves the predictions on stellar mass functions,
star formation rate densities and volume-weighted neutral fractions. Comparison
of high resolution large volume simulations with both small volume or low
resolution simulations confirms that both low resolution and small volume
simulations lead to reionisation ending too rapidly. Lingering discrepancies
between the star formation rate functions predicted with and without our
extensions can be traced to the uncertain contribution of satellite galaxies.

We used multi-scale feature embedding to improve the inter-class separability

relatively general natural-language instructions into robot agent actions, on
the basis of the visible environment. This requires to extract value from two
very different types of natural-language information. The first is object
description (e.g., 'table', 'door'), each presenting as a tip for the agent to
determine the next action by finding the item visible in the environment, and
the second is action specification (e.g., 'go straight', 'turn left') which
allows the robot to directly predict the next movements without relying on
visual perceptions. However, most existing methods pay few attention to
distinguish these information from each other during instruction encoding and
mix together the matching between textual object/action encoding and visual
perception/orientation features of candidate viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose an Object-and-Action Aware Model (OAAM) that processes these two
different forms of natural language based instruction separately. This enables
each process to match object-centered/action-centered instruction to their own
counterpart visual perception/action orientation flexibly. However, one
side-issue caused by above solution is that an object mentioned in instructions
may be observed in the direction of two or more candidate viewpoints, thus the
OAAM may not predict the viewpoint on the shortest path as the next action. To
handle this problem, we design a simple but effective path loss to penalize
trajectories deviating from the ground truth path. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and path loss, and the
superiority of their combination with a 50% SPL score on the R2R dataset and a
40% CLS score on the R4R dataset in unseen environments, outperforming the
previous state-of-the-art.

which may frequently exceed robot's control constraints. Learning-based
controllers are suitable for disturbance rejection control, but the excessive
disturbances heavily affect the state transition in Markov Decision Process
(MDP) or Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Also, pure
learning procedures on targeted system may encounter damaging exploratory
actions or unpredictable system variations, and training exclusively on a prior
model usually cannot address model mismatch from the targeted system. In this
paper, we propose a transfer learning framework that adapts a control policy
for excessive disturbance rejection of an underwater robot under dynamics model
mismatch. A modular network of learning policies is applied, composed of a
Generalized Control Policy (GCP) and an Online Disturbance Identification Model
(ODI). GCP is first trained over a wide array of disturbance waveforms. ODI
then learns to use past states and actions of the system to predict the
disturbance waveforms which are provided as input to GCP (along with the system
state). A transfer reinforcement learning algorithm using Transition Mismatch
Compensation (TMC) is developed based on the modular architecture, that learns
an additional compensatory policy through minimizing mismatch of transitions
predicted by the two dynamics models of the source and target tasks. We
demonstrated on a pose regulation task in simulation that TMC is able to
successfully reject the disturbances and stabilize the robot under an empirical
model of the robot system, meanwhile improve sample efficiency.

which appear in the dynamic spectra as two parallel drifting bright stripes
separated in time. Recent imaging spectroscopy observations allowed for the
quantitative characterization of the drifting pairs in terms of source size,
position, and evolution. Here, the drift-pair parameters are qualitatively
analyzed and compared with the newly-developed Monte Carlo ray-tracing
technique simulating radio-wave propagation in the inhomogeneous anisotropic
turbulent solar corona. The results suggest that the drift-pair bursts can be
formed due to a combination of the refraction and scattering processes, with
the trailing component being the result of turbulent reflection (turbulent
radio echo). The formation of drift-pair bursts requires an anisotropic
scattering with the level of plasma density fluctuations comparable to that in
type III bursts, but with a stronger anisotropy at the inner turbulence scale.
The anisotropic radio-wave scattering model can quantitatively reproduce the
key properties of drift-pair bursts: the apparent source size and its increase
with time at a given frequency, the parallel motion of the source centroid
positions, and the delay between the burst components. The trailing component
is found to be virtually co-spatial and following the main component. The
simulations suggest that the drift-pair bursts are likely to be observed closer
to the disk center and below 100 MHz due to the effects of free-free absorption
and scattering. The exciter of drift-pairs is consistent with propagating
packets of whistlers, allowing for a fascinating way to diagnose the plasma
turbulence and the radio emission mechanism.

We find that this system exhibits exceptional device stability, mainly due to

transient absorption spectroscopy we attribute this remarkable stability to two
separate mechanisms: 1) DRCN5T exhibits high intrinsic resistance towards
external factors, showing no signs of deterioration. 2) The highly sensitive
PC70BM is stabilised against degradation by the presence of DRCN5T through
ultrafast long-range energy transfer to the donor, rapidly quenching the
fullerene excited states which are otherwise precursors for chemical oxidation.

processes contributing to wave energy attenuation in ice-covered seas. Although
recent observations suggest that the contribution of that process to the total
energy dissipation is significant, its parameterizations used in spectral wave
models are based on fairly crude, heuristic approximations. In this paper, an
improved source term for the under-ice turbulent dissipation is proposed,
taking into account the spectral nature of that process (as opposed to
parameterizations based on the so-called representative wave), as well as
effects related to sea ice concentration and floe-size distribution, formulated
on the basis of the earlier results of discrete-element modeling. The core of
the new source term is based on an analogous model for dissipation due to
bottom friction derived by Weber in 1991
(https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112091003634). The shape of the wave energy
attenuation curves and frequency-dependence of the attenuation coefficients are
analyzed in detail for compact sea ice. The role of floe size in modifying the
attenuation intensity and spectral distribution is illustrated by calibrating
the model to observational data from a sudden sea ice break-up event in the
marginal ice zone.

opportunities for deeper understanding to harness their fascinating properties.
We studied hydrogen-bonded one-dimensional quinonediimine molecular networks
which may adopt two isomeric electronic configurations via proton transfer.
Herein, we demonstrate that concerted proton transfer promotes a delocalization
of {\pi}-electrons along the molecular chain, which enhances the cohesive
energy between molecular units, increasing the mechanical stability of the
chain and giving rise to new electronic in-gap states localized at the ends.
These findings demonstrate the identification of a new class of isomeric

role in establishing their chemical and physical properties. We anticipate that
this work will open new research directions towards the control of mechanical

approximation, the backreaction of matter to curvature is taken into account by
equating the Einstein tensor to the expectation values of the stress-energy
tensor in a suitable state. We impose initial conditions for the scale factor
at finite time and we show that a regular state for the quantum matter
compatible with these initial conditions can be chosen. Contributions with
derivative of the coefficient of the metric higher than the second are present
in the expectation values of the stress-energy tensor and the term with the
highest derivative appears in a non-local form. This fact forbids a direct
analysis of the semiclassical equation, and in particular, standard recursive
approaches to approximate the solution fail to converge. In this paper we show
that, after partial integration of the semiclassical Einstein equation in
cosmology, the non-local highest derivative appears in the expectation values
of the stress-energy tensor through the application of a linear unbounded
operator which does not depend on the details of the chosen state. We prove
that an inversion formula for this operator can be found, furthermore, the
inverse happens to be more regular than the direct operator and it has the form
of a retarded product, hence causality is respected. The found inversion
formula applied to the traced Einstein equation has thus the form of a fixed
point equation. The proof of local existence and uniqueness of the solution of
the semiclassical Einstein equation is then obtained applying the Banach fixed

across the interface is critical to modulate correlated functionalities in
epitaxial heterostructures, particularly when the interface composition is

La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSMO) as a prototypical phase transition material and establish
vertical epitaxial interfaces with NiO to explore the strong interplay between
strain accommodation, stoichiometry modification, and localized electron
transport across the interface. It is found that localized stoichiometry
modification overcomes the plaguing dead layer problem in LSMO and leads to
strongly directional conductivity, as manifested by more than three orders of
magnitude difference between out-of-plane to in-plane conductivity.
Comprehensive structural characterization and transport measurements reveal
that this emerging behavior is related to a compositional change produced by
directional cation diffusion that pushes the LSMO phase transition from
insulating into metallic within an ultrathin interface region. This study
explores the nature of unusual electric conductivity at vertical epitaxial
interfaces and establishes an effective route for engineering nanoscale
electron transport for oxide electronics.

popular method for computing self-driving car policies. The standard approach
relies on collecting pairs of inputs (camera images) and outputs (steering
angle, etc.) from an expert policy and fitting a deep neural network to this
data to learn the driving policy. Although this approach had some successful
demonstrations in the past, learning a good policy might require a lot of
samples from the expert driver, which might be resource-consuming. In this
work, we develop a novel framework based on the Safe Dateset Aggregation (safe
DAgger) approach, where the current learned policy is automatically segmented
into different trajectory classes, and the algorithm identifies trajectory
segments or classes with the weak performance at each step. Once the trajectory
segments with weak performance identified, the sampling algorithm focuses on
calling the expert policy only on these segments, which improves the
convergence rate. The presented simulation results show that the proposed
approach can yield significantly better performance compared to the standard

that while 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) ligands result in significant oxidation of

or degradation. Consequently, since the former is ubiquitously used as a hole
extraction layer in QD solar cells, it is predominantly responsible for the
device performance evolution. The oxidation of EDT-PbS QDs results in a
significantly reduced effective QD size, which triggers two competing
processes: improved energetic alignment that enhances electron blocking, but
reduced charge transport through the layer. At early times, the former process
dominates, resulting in the commonly reported, but so far not fully explained
initial increase in performance, while the latter governs the onset of
degradation and deterioration of the photovoltaic performance. Our work
highlights that the stability of PbS quantum dot solar cells can be

  We study models in which the network is {\em sparse}, meaning that it has
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ edges, where $n$ is the number of nodes, and in which edges

algorithm. In our models, when a node is ""born"", it connects to
$d=\mathcal{O}(1)$ random other nodes. An edge remains alive as long as both
its endpoints do.
  If no further edge creation takes place, we show that, although the network
will have $\Omega_d(n)$ isolated nodes, it is possible, with large constant
probability, to inform a $1-exp(-\Omega(d))$ fraction of nodes in
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ time. Furthermore, the graph exhibits, at any given time,

  We also consider models with {\em edge regeneration}, in which if an edge
$(v,w)$ chosen by $v$ at birth goes down because of the death of $w$, the edge
is replaced by a fresh random edge $(v,z)$. In models with edge regeneration,
we prove that the network is, with high probability, a vertex expander at any

system is modelled by the Kane-Mele model with a random spin exchange between
conduction electrons and magnetic dopants. The dynamical mean field theory for
disordered systems is used to investigate the electron dynamics. The magnetic
long-range order and the topological invariant are calculated within the mean
field theory. They reveal a rich phase diagram, where different magnetic
long-range orders such as antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic one can exist in
the metallic or insulating phases, depending on electron and magnetic impurity
fillings. It is found that insulator only occurs at electron half filling,
quarter filling and when electron filling is equal to magnetic impurity
filling. However, non-trivial topology is observed only in half-filling
antiferromagnetic insulator and quarter-filling ferromagnetic insulator. At
electron half filling, the spin Hall conductance is quantized and it is robust
against magnetic doping, while at electron quarter filling, magnetic dopants
drive the ferromagnetic topological insulator to ferromagnetic metal. The
quantum anomalous Hall effect is observed only at electron quarter filling and
dense magnetic doping.

establish kinetic equilibrium we show that for a broad variety of

significantly evolving due to $2\to k$ ($k>2$) processes (the DM carries no
conserved quantum number nor asymmetry). During the active phase of the
process, the DM to Standard Model temperature ratio falls rapidly, with DM
kinetic energy being converted to DM mass, the inverse of the
recently-discussed `cannibal DM mechanism'. Potential observables and

dark acoustic oscillations, the alteration of free-streaming constraints, and
possible easing of $\sigma_8$ and Hubble tensions.

  Action Recognition","accepted by ACMMM2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have attracted increasing interests for
the task of skeleton-based action recognition. The key lies in the design of
the graph structure, which encodes skeleton topology information. In this
paper, we propose Dynamic GCN, in which a novel convolutional neural network
named Contextencoding Network (CeN) is introduced to learn skeleton topology
automatically. In particular, when learning the dependency between two joints,
contextual features from the rest joints are incorporated in a global manner.
CeN is extremely lightweight yet effective, and can be embedded into a graph
convolutional layer. By stacking multiple CeN-enabled graph convolutional
layers, we build Dynamic GCN. Notably, as a merit of CeN, dynamic graph
topologies are constructed for different input samples as well as graph
convolutional layers of various depths. Besides, three alternative context
modeling architectures are well explored, which may serve as a guideline for
future research on graph topology learning. CeN brings only ~7% extra FLOPs for
the baseline model, and Dynamic GCN achieves better performance with
$2\times$~$4\times$ fewer FLOPs than existing methods. By further combining
static physical body connections and motion modalities, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale benchmarks, namely NTU-RGB+D,
NTU-RGB+D 120 and Skeleton-Kinetics.

unified gauge theory of all such models. In the light of this theory, currently
known methods are just a tip of the iceberg, and there exists an infinite
family of yet unexplored trajectory-based approaches. Specifically, we show
that each definition for a semiclassical trajectory corresponds to a specific
hydrodynamic analogy, where a quantum system is mapped to an effective
probability fluid in the phase space. We derive the continuity equation for the
effective fluid representing dynamics of an arbitrary open bosonic many-body
system. We show that unlike in conventional fluid, the flux of the effective
fluid is defined up to Skodje's gauge [R. T. Skodje et. al. Phys. Rev. A 40,

quantum mechanics are particular cases of our generic hydrodynamic analogy, and
all the differences among them reduce to the gauge choice. Infinitely many
gauges are possible, each leading to a distinct quantum hydrodynamic analogy

spectra showed broad peaks with hexagonal $\gamma$-Ta2N as the main phase, with
the cubic $\delta$-TaN phase emerging for higher N contents. Phase composition
remained unchanged before and after the 500C tests. However, after the high
temperature tests, TEM analysis showed the presence of an oxide surface layer,
with a thickness that decreased (from 42 to 15 nm) with N content, due to
residual oxygen diffusion, which replaces nitrogen to form amorphous SiOx.
Beneath the oxide-rich surface layer, coatings exhibited a stable
nanocrystalline columnar microstructure. Hardness and fracture toughness
increased with N content, initially due to the formation of an amorphous Si-N
tissue at grain boundaries, and for even higher N contents, due to the
appearance of the hard cubic $\delta$-TaN phase. Hardness at 500C decreased
only by 15%, while fracture toughness followed the opposite trend, due to
increased plasticity with temperature. The optimum composition turned out to be

produces proton-proton collision data on unprecedented scales at unprecedented

production of a top-quark pair in association with a photon ($t\bar{t}\gamma$)
gives access to the electromagnetic top-photon coupling, one of the fundamental
properties of the top quark. Various extensions of the Standard Model predict
modifications of the coupling strength or structure, and deviations from the
Standard Model prediction of the $t\bar{t}\gamma$ production cross-section
would indicate new physics. With enough statistics available from the Large
Hadron Collider, the electron-muon channel has gained particular interest due
to its high signal purity and precise available theory predictions.
  This thesis presents results with the full Run 2 dataset collected with the
ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider between
2015 and 2018 at 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. In order to compare the results to fixed-order
calculations that include non-doubly-resonant diagrams, a combined measurement
of $t\bar{t}\gamma + tW\gamma$ is performed. The focus is placed on a
measurement of the fiducial inclusive cross-section in the electron-muon
channel. Furthermore, the ATLAS data is unfolded to parton level and
measurements of differential cross-sections as functions of several observables
are presented. Both fiducial inclusive and differential results are compared to
state-of-the-art fixed-order calculations at next-to-leading order in QCD. An
additional focus of the thesis is placed on studies to use machine-learning
techniques, in particular deep neural networks, for the identification of
prompt photons.

embedding the structured objects to be predicted into a feature space of
possibly infinite dimension by means of output kernels, and then, solving a
regression problem in this output space. A prediction in the original space is
computed by solving a pre-image problem. In such an approach, the embedding,
linked to the target loss, is defined prior to the learning phase. In this
work, we propose to jointly learn a finite approximation of the output
embedding and the regression function into the new feature space. For that
purpose, we leverage a priori information on the outputs and also unexploited
unsupervised output data, which are both often available in structured
prediction problems. We prove that the resulting structured predictor is a
consistent estimator, and derive an excess risk bound. Moreover, the novel
structured prediction tool enjoys a significantly smaller computational
complexity than former output kernel methods. The approach empirically tested
on various structured prediction problems reveals to be versatile and able to
handle large datasets.

spectra. These components include an inner disc component (diskbb), two warm
corona components (CompTT-1 and CompTT-2), and a hot corona component
(nthComp). We find that diskbb, CompTT-2 (the hotter but less luminous
component) and nthComp all contain the QPO signal, while CompTT-1 only exhibits
stochastic variability. By fitting the lag spectrum, we find that the QPO in
diskbb leads CompTT-2 by 679 s, and CompTT-2 leads nthComp by 180 s. By only
varying the normalizations, these components can also produce good fits to the
time-averaged and variability spectra obtained from previous observations when
QPOs were present and absent. Our multi-wavelength study shows that the
detectability of the QPO does not depend on the contemporaneous mass accretion
rate. We do not detect a significant Iron K{\alpha} emission line, or any
significant reflection hump. Finally, we show that the rms and lag spectra in
the latest observation are very similar to the 67 Hz QPO observed in the
micro-quasar GRS 1915+105. These new results support the physical analogy
between these two sources. We speculate that the QPO in both sources is due to
the expansion/contraction of the vertical structure in the inner disc.

However, kernel machines are still considered black-box models as the feature

work is to show that it is indeed possible to interpret the functions learned
by various kernel methods is intuitive despite their complexity. Specifically,
we show that derivatives of these functions have a simple mathematical

proportional to the kernel function derivative. We provide the explicit
analytic form of the first and second derivatives of the most common kernel

higher order derivatives. We use them to analyze the most used supervised and
unsupervised kernel learning methods: Gaussian Processes for regression,
Support Vector Machines for classification, Kernel Entropy Component Analysis
for density estimation, and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion for
estimating the dependency between random variables. For all cases we expressed
the derivative of the learned function as a linear combination of the kernel
function derivative. Moreover we provide intuitive explanations through
illustrative toy examples and show how to improve the interpretation of real
applications in the context of spatiotemporal Earth system data cubes. This

observe a strong decrease of the respective valley lifetimes which is

are strongly correlated in this material. This observation indicates that the
photogating effect plays an imporant role for thin InSe flakes, and it is the
dominant mechanism in the ultra-high photoresponsivity of pristine InSe
devices. In addition, when exposing the pristine InSe photodetectors to the
ambient environment we observe a fast and irreversible change in the
photoresponse, with a decrease in the photoresponsivity accompanied by an
increase of the operating speed. We attribute this photodetector performance
change (upon atmospheric exposure) to the decrease in the density of the traps
present in InSe, due to the passivation of selenium vacancies by atmospheric
oxygen species. This passivation is accompanied by a downward shift of the InSe
Fermi level and by a decrease of the Fermi level pinning, which leads to an
increase of the Schottky barrier between Au and InSe. Our study reveals the
important role of traps induced by defects in tailoring the properties of
devices based on 2D materials and offers a controllable route to design and
functionalize thin InSe photodetectors to realize devices with either ultrahigh
photoresposivity or fast operation speed.

different imaging experts and it is labor-intensive and prone to errors and
inconsistency. Previous automated segmentation methods largely focused on
fusing information that is extracted separately from the PET and CT modalities,
with the underlying assumption that each modality contains complementary

aggregation from massive WDs. We present a two-phase amplify-and-forward (AF)
relaying protocol. In the first phase, the WDs simultaneously send their data
to the relays, while in the second phase, the relays amplify the respectively
received signals and concurrently forward them to the fusion center (FC) for
aggregation. Our objective is to minimize the computational mean squared error
(MSE) at the FC, by jointly optimizing the WD transmit coefficients, the relay
AF coefficients, and the FC de-noising factor, subject to their individual
transmit power constraints. First, we consider the centralized design with
global channel state information (CSI), in which the inter-relay signals can be
exploited beneficially for data aggregation. In this case, we develop an
alternating-optimization-based algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution to
the computational MSE minimization problem. Next, to reduce the signaling
overhead caused by the centralized design, we consider an alternative
decentralized design with partial CSI, in which the relays and the FC make
their own decisions by only requiring the channel power gain information across
different relays. In this case, the relays and FC need to treat the inter-relay
signals as harmful interference or noise. Accordingly, we optimize the transmit
coefficients of the WDs associated with each relay, and the relay AF
coefficients (together with the FC de-noising factor) in an iterative manner,
which can be implemented efficiently in a decentralized way.

(1982), is defined as the sum, over all internal nodes $v$ of the tree, of the
absolute value of the difference of the sizes of the clades defined by the
children of $v$. It is one of the most popular phylogenetic balance indices,
because, in addition to measuring the balance of a tree in a very simple and
intuitive way, it turns out to be one of the most powerful and discriminating
phylogenetic shape indices. But it has some drawbacks. On the one hand,
although its minimum value is reached at the so-called maximally balanced
trees, it is almost always reached also at trees that are not maximally
balanced. On the other hand, its definition as a sum of absolute values of
differences makes it difficult to study analytically its distribution under
probabilistic models of bifurcating phylogenetic trees. In this paper we show
that if we replace in its definition the absolute values of the differences of
clade sizes by the squares of these differences, all these drawbacks are
overcome and the resulting index is still more powerful and discriminating than
the original Colless index.

gravity with {\it gauged} scale symmetry: 1) the original Weyl quadratic
gravity and 2) the theory defined by a similar action but in the Palatini

These theories have different vectorial non-metricity induced by the gauge
field ($w_\mu$) of this symmetry. Both theories have a novel spontaneous
breaking of gauged scale symmetry, in the absence of matter, where the
necessary scalar field is not added ad-hoc to this purpose but is of geometric
origin and part of the quadratic action. The Einstein-Proca action (of
$w_\mu$), Planck scale and metricity emerge in the broken phase after $w_\mu$
acquires mass (Stueckelberg mechanism), then decouples. In the presence of
matter ($\phi_1$), non-minimally coupled, the scalar potential is similar in
both theories up to couplings and field rescaling. For small field values the
potential is Higgs-like while for large fields inflation is possible. Due to
their $R^2$ term, both theories have a small tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\sim
10^{-3}$), larger in Palatini case. For a fixed spectral index $n_s$, reducing
the non-minimal coupling ($\xi_1$) increases $r$ which in Weyl theory is
bounded from above by that of Starobinsky inflation. For a small enough
$\xi_1\leq 10^{-3}$, unlike the Palatini version, Weyl theory gives a
dependence $r(n_s)$ similar to that in Starobinsky inflation, while also
protecting $r$ against higher dimensional operators corrections.

the IRS operates as a passive transmitter serving multiple receivers by

to a secondary information receiver (SIR) by embedding its information into the
primary signals at the symbol level. Two typical optimization problems, i.e.,

Out of 15 observed objects, only 4 appear to be genuine post-AGB stars (27\%).
In the SMC, 1 out of 4 is post-AGB, and in the LMC, 3 out 11 are post-AGB

DBM, a bottom-up approach was adopted in this model. The effects of molecular
size and repulsion potential were described by the Enskog collision model; the
attraction potential was obtained through the mean-field approximation method.
The molecular interactions, which result in the non-ideal equation of state and
surface tension, were directly introduced as an external force term. Several
typical benchmark problems, including Couette flow, two-phase coexistence
curve, the Laplace law, phase separation, and the collision of two droplets,
were simulated to verify the model. Especially, for two types of droplet
collisions, the strengths of two non-equilibrium effects, $\bar{D}_2^*$ and
$\bar{D}_3^*$, defined through the second and third order non-conserved kinetic
moments of $(f - f ^{eq})$, are comparatively investigated, where $f$
($f^{eq}$) is the (equilibrium) distribution function. It is interesting to
find that during the collision process, $\bar{D}_2^*$ is always significantly
larger than $\bar{D}_3^*$, $\bar{D}_2^*$ can be used to identify the different
stages of the collision process and to distinguish different types of

model for the case where the non-equilibrium effect is strong, and the linear
constitutive law of viscous stress is no longer valid.

The input parameters like fiber length, diameter and orientation are chosen
with respect to their probability density function. It is shown, that they are
significantly influenced by the fiber length, the fiber orientation and the
fiber volume fraction. The verification of the analytically obtained values is
done on a numerical basis. Therefore, a two-dimensional microstructure is
generated and transferred to a numerical model. The advantage of this procedure
is, that there are several fibers with different geometrical properties placed
in a preset area. The results of the numerical analysis meet the analytically
obtained conclusions. Furthermore, the results of the numerical simulations are
independent of the assumption of a plane strain and plane stress state,
respectively. Finally, the correlation structure of the elasticity tensor is
investigated. Not only the symmetry properties of the elasticity tensor
characterize the correlation structure, but also the overall
transversely-isotropic material behavior is confirmed. In contrast to the

humans, enables a robot to predict the outcome of a physical interaction even
in novel contexts. Given a desired push action, humans are capable to identify
where to place their finger on a new object so to produce a predictable motion
of the object. We achieve the same behaviour by factorising the learning into
two parts. First, we learn a set of local contact models to represent the
geometrical relations between the robot pusher, the object, and the
environment. Then we learn a set of parametric local motion models to predict
how these contacts change throughout a push. The set of contact and motion
models represent our internal model. By adjusting the shapes of the
distributions over the physical parameters, we modify the internal model's
response. Uniform distributions yield to coarse estimates when no information
is available about the novel context (i.e. unbiased predictor). A more accurate
predictor can be learned for a specific environment/object pair (e.g. low
friction/high mass), i.e. biased predictor. The effectiveness of our approach
is shown in a simulated environment in which a Pioneer 3-DX robot needs to
predict a push outcome for a novel object, and we provide a proof of concept on

  Perturbation",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Axis-aligned decision forests have long been the leading class of machine
learning algorithms for modeling tabular data. In many applications of machine
learning such as learning-to-rank, decision forests deliver remarkable
performance. They also possess other coveted characteristics such as
interpretability. Despite their widespread use and rich history, decision
forests to date fail to consume raw structured data such as text, or learn
effective representations for them, a factor behind the success of deep neural
networks in recent years. While there exist methods that construct smoothed
decision forests to achieve representation learning, the resulting models are
decision forests in name only: They are no longer axis-aligned, use stochastic
decisions, or are not interpretable. Furthermore, none of the existing methods
are appropriate for problems that require a Transfer Learning treatment. In
this work, we present a novel but intuitive proposal to achieve representation
learning for decision forests without imposing new restrictions or
necessitating structural changes. Our model is simply a decision forest,
possibly trained using any forest learning algorithm, atop a deep neural
network. By approximating the gradients of the decision forest through input
perturbation, a purely analytical procedure, the decision forest directs the
neural network to learn or fine-tune representations. Our framework has the
advantage that it is applicable to any arbitrary decision forest and that it
allows the use of arbitrary deep neural networks for representation learning.
We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposal through
experiments on synthetic and benchmark classification datasets.

It was shown that if $h$ is K\""ahler and a suitable density condition holds,

  In this paper, we investigate the existence of real-valued weight functions
with real holomorphic gradient fields on K\""ahler and conformally K\""ahler

first identify the metrics having holomorphic torsion leading to several
interesting examples such as the Hopf manifold $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1} \times

these metrics, we further determine weight functions $\psi$ with real
holomorphic gradient fields. They provide a wealth of triples $(M,h,e^{-\psi})$
of Hermitian non-K\""ahler manifolds with weights for which the
$\partial$-complex exhibits the aforementioned holomorphicity/duality property.

predictors of future performance and utility. We consider a situation in which
some groups of candidates experience historical and present disadvantage that
makes their chances of being accepted much lower than other groups. In these
circumstances, we wish to apply an affirmative action policy to reduce
acceptance rate disparities, while avoiding any large decrease in the aptitude

motivated by the frequently observed phenomenon that discrimination
disproportionately affects individuals who simultaneously belong to multiple
disadvantaged groups, defined along intersecting dimensions such as gender,

conclusion is that it is possible to significantly reduce disparities in

wave fronts is the hallmark feature of the Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE).
The engineering implications of wave topology are not well understood nor
quantified, especially with respect to parametric changes in combustor
geometry, propellant chemistry, and injection and mixing schemes. In this
article, a modeling framework that relates the time and spacial scales of the
RDE to engineering performance metrics is developed and presented. The model is
built under assumptions of backpressure-insensitivity and nominally choked
gaseous propellant injection. The Euler equations of inviscid, compressible
fluid flow in one dimension are adapted to model the combustion wave dynamics
along the circumference of an annular-type rotating detonation engine. These
adaptations provide the necessary mass and energy input and output channels to
shape the traveling wave fronts and decaying tails. The associated unit
processes of injection, mixing, combustion, and exhaust are all assigned
representative time scales necessary for successful wave propagation. We find
that the separation, or lack of, these time scales are responsible for the
behavior of the system, including wave co- and counter-propagation and
bifurcations between these regimes and wave counts. Furthermore, as there is no
imposition of wave topology, the model output is used to estimate the net
available mechanical work output and thermodynamic efficiency from the closed
trajectories through pressure-volume and temperature-entropy spaces. These
metrics are investigated with respect to variation in the characteristic scales

TCDW = 76 K, with critically small Fermi surfaces, was found to be fully
suppressed at Pc = 8.7GPa. Around Pc, we observe a superconducting dome with a
maximum superconducting transition temperature Tc = 9.1 K. First-principles
calculations of the electronic structure predict that, under ambient
conditions, the undistorted structure is characterized by a phonon instability
at finite momentum close to the experimental CDW wave vector. Upon compression,
this instability is found to disappear, indicating the suppression of CDW
order. The calculations reveal an electronic topological transition (ETT),
which occurs before the suppression of the phonon instability, suggesting that
the ETT alone is not directly causing the structural change in the system. The
temperature dependence of the first vortex penetration field has been
experimentally obtained by two independent methods and the corresponding lower
critical field H$_{c1}$ was deduced. While a d wave and single-gap BCS
prediction cannot describe our H$_{c1}$ experiments, the temperature dependence
of the H$_{c1}$ can be well described by a single-gap anisotropic s-wave order

dimensionality. The gate controlling timescales leads to a novel, marginally
stable state, where the network functions as a flexible integrator. Unlike
previous approaches, gating permits this important function without parameter
fine-tuning or special symmetries. Gates also provide a flexible,
context-dependent mechanism to reset the memory trace, thus complementing the
memory function. The gate modulating the dimensionality can induce a novel,
discontinuous chaotic transition, where inputs push a stable system to strong
chaotic activity, in contrast to the typically stabilizing effect of inputs. At
this transition, unlike additive RNNs, the proliferation of critical points
(topological complexity) is decoupled from the appearance of chaotic dynamics
(dynamical complexity).
  The rich dynamics are summarized in phase diagrams, thus providing a map for
principled parameter initialization choices to ML practitioners.

maps in a range of heliocentric distances that are a factor of two to three
larger than those analysed in the Gaia Collaboration based on the same data. In
this paper, we use such maps to derive the rotation curve both in the Galactic
plane and in off-plane regions and to analyse the density distribution. By
assuming stationary equilibrium and axisymmetry, we used the Jeans equation to
derive the rotation curve. Then we fit it with density models that include both
dark matter and predictions of the MOND (Modified Newtonian dynamics) theory.
Since the Milky Way exhibits deviations from axisymmetry and equilibrium, we
also considered corrections to the Jeans equation. To compute such corrections,
we ran N-body experiments of mock disk galaxies where the departure from
equilibrium becomes larger as a function of the distance from the centre. The
rotation curve in the outer disk of the Milky Way that is constructed with the
Jeans equation exhibits very low dependence on $R$ and $z$ and it is
well-fitted both by dark matter halo and MOND models. The application of the
Jeans equation for deriving the rotation curve, in the case of the systems that
deviate from equilibrium and axisymmetry, introduces systematic errors that
grow as a function of the amplitude of the average radial velocity. In the case
of the Milky Way, we can observe that the amplitude of the radial velocity
reaches $\sim 10\%$ that of the azimuthal one at $R\approx 20$ kpc. Based on
this condition, using the rotation curve obtained from the Jeans equation to
calculate the mass may overestimate its measurement.

consensus on fundamental ethical and rights-based AI principles proposed by
scholars, governments, civil rights organizations, and technology companies. In
order to move from principles to real-world implementation, we adopt a lens
motivated by regulatory impact assessments and the well-being movement in
public policy. Similar to public policy interventions, outcomes of AI systems
implementation may have far-reaching complex impacts. In public policy,
indicators are only part of a broader toolbox, as metrics inherently lead to
gaming and dissolution of incentives and objectives. Similarly, in the case of
A/IS, there's a need for a larger toolbox that allows for the iterative
assessment of identified impacts, inclusion of new impacts in the analysis, and
identification of emerging trade-offs. In this paper, we propose the practical
application of an enhanced well-being impact assessment framework for A/IS that
could be employed to address ethical and rights-based normative principles in
AI. This process could enable a human-centered algorithmically-supported
approach to the understanding of the impacts of AI systems. Finally, we propose
a new testing infrastructure which would allow for governments, civil rights

replace dyes in some applications because the color is tunable and resists

difficult, especially when the application -- cosmetics or displays, for
example -- requires specific component materials. A general approach to solving
this constrained design problem is modeling and optimization: using a model
that predicts the color of a given system, one optimizes the model parameters
under constraints to achieve a target color. For this approach to work, the
model must make accurate predictions, which is challenging because disordered
nanostructures have multiple scattering. To address this challenge, we develop
a Monte Carlo model that simulates multiple scattering of light in disordered
arrangements of spherical particles or voids. The model produces quantitative
agreement with measurements when we account for roughness on the surface of the
film, particle polydispersity, and wavelength-dependent absorption in the
components. Unlike discrete numerical simulations, our model is parameterized
in terms of experimental variables, simplifying the connection between
simulation and fabrication. To demonstrate this approach, we reproduce the
color of the male mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides) in an experimental
system, using prescribed components and a microstructure that is easy to
fabricate. Finally, we use the model to find the limits of angle-independent
structural colors for a given system. These results enable an engineering

giving rise to the use of complex numbers in describing states of quantum
systems, their dynamics, and interaction. Since the inception of quantum
theory, it has been debated whether complex numbers are actually essential, or
whether an alternative consistent formulation is possible using real numbers
only. Here, we attack this long-standing problem both theoretically and
experimentally, using the powerful tools of quantum resource theories. We show
that - under reasonable assumptions - quantum states are easier to create and
manipulate if they only have real elements. This gives an operational meaning
to the resource theory of imaginarity. We identify and answer several important
questions which include the state-conversion problem for all qubit states and
all pure states of any dimension, and the approximate imaginarity distillation
for all quantum states. As an application, we show that imaginarity plays a
crucial role for state discrimination: there exist real quantum states which
can be perfectly distinguished via local operations and classical
communication, but which cannot be distinguished with any nonzero probability
if one of the parties has no access to imaginarity. We confirm this phenomenon
experimentally with linear optics, performing discrimination of different
two-photon quantum states by local projective measurements. These results prove
that complex numbers are an indispensable part of quantum mechanics.

  Modeling",,"MICCAI 2020",,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Medical images are generally labeled by multiple experts before the final
ground-truth labels are determined. Consensus or disagreement among experts
regarding individual images reflects the gradeability and difficulty levels of
the image. However, when being used for model training, only the final
ground-truth label is utilized, while the critical information contained in the
raw multi-rater gradings regarding the image being an easy/hard case is
discarded. In this paper, we aim to take advantage of the raw multi-rater
gradings to improve the deep learning model performance for the glaucoma
classification task. Specifically, a multi-branch model structure is proposed
to predict the most sensitive, most specifical and a balanced fused result for
the input images. In order to encourage the sensitivity branch and specificity
branch to generate consistent results for consensus labels and opposite results
for disagreement labels, a consensus loss is proposed to constrain the output
of the two branches. Meanwhile, the consistency/inconsistency between the
prediction results of the two branches implies the image being an easy/hard
case, which is further utilized to encourage the balanced fusion branch to
concentrate more on the hard cases. Compared with models trained only with the
final ground-truth labels, the proposed method using multi-rater consensus
information has achieved superior performance, and it is also able to estimate
the difficulty levels of individual input images when making the prediction.

required the detection of pulsations from the putative MSP. To better constrain
the orbital parameters for a directed search for gamma-ray pulsations, we
obtained new optical light curves in 2017 and 2018, which revealed long-term
variability from the companion star. The resulting orbital parameter
constraints were used to perform a targeted gamma-ray pulsation search using
the Einstein@Home distributed volunteer computing system. This search
discovered pulsations with a period of 2.65 ms, confirming the source as a
binary MSP now known as PSR J2039$-$5617. Optical light curve modelling is
complicated, and likely biased, by asymmetric heating on the companion star and
long-term variability, but we find an inclination $i > 60{\deg}$, for a low
pulsar mass between $1.1 M_{\odot} < M_{\rm psr} < 1.6 M_{\odot}$ and a
companion mass of 0.15--0.22 $M_{\odot}$, confirming the redback
classification. Timing the gamma-ray pulsations also revealed significant
variability in the orbital period, which we find to be consistent with
quadrupole moment variations in the companion star, suggestive of convective
activity. We also find that the pulsed flux is modulated at the orbital period,
potentially due to inverse Compton scattering between high-energy leptons in
the pulsar wind and the companion star's optical photon field.

near-core rotation rates and asymptotic period spacings. We find that many
stars are tidally locked if the orbital periods are shorter than 10 days, in
which the near-core rotation periods given by the traditional approximation of
rotation (TAR) are consistent with the orbital period. Compared to the single
stars, $\gamma$ Dor stars in binaries tend to have slower near-core rotation
rates, likely a consequence of tidal spin-down. We also find three stars that
have extremely slow near-core rotation rates. To explain these, we hypothesise
that unstable tidally excited oscillations can transfer angular momentum from

equation, we consider the energy balance equation, where heat generation plays
an important role not only in the temperature distribution but also in the flow
profile. At the microscopic level, a dual slip-link model is employed for
well-entangled polymers. To incorporate the temperature effect into the

beamforming codebook adaptation. Mobile relays are utilized to enable achieving
these goals given their flexible positioning. First at the network level, we
model regularized Laplacian matrices, which are symmetric positive definite
(SPD) ones representing relay-dependent network graphs, as points over
Riemannian manifolds. Inspired by the geometric classification of different
tasks in the brain network, Riemannian metrics, such as Log-Euclidean metric
(LEM), are utilized to choose relay positions that result in maximum LEM.
Simulation results show that the proposed LEM-based relay positioning algorithm
enables parallel routes and achieves maximum network flow rate, as opposed to
other metrics (e.g., algebraic connectivity).
  Second at the link level, we design unique relay-dependent beamforming
codebooks aimed to increase data rate over the spatially-correlated fading
channels between a given relay and its neighboring users. To do so, we propose
a geometric machine learning approach, which utilizes support vector machine
(SVM) model to learn an SPD variant of the user's channel over Riemannian
manifolds. Consequently, LEM-based Riemannian metric is utilized for
classification of different channels, and a matched beamforming codebook is
constructed accordingly. Simulation results show that the proposed
geometric-based learning model achieves the maximum link rate after a short
training period.

knowledge-centric applications. Most large-scale KGs used in practice are
automatically constructed based on an ensemble of extraction techniques applied
over diverse data sources. Therefore, it is important to establish the
provenance of results for a query to determine how these were computed.
Provenance is shown to be useful for assigning confidence scores to the
results, for debugging the KG generation itself, and for providing answer
explanations. In many such applications, certain queries are registered as
standing queries since their answers are needed often. However, KGs keep
continuously changing due to reasons such as changes in the source data,
improvements to the extraction techniques, refinement/enrichment of
information, and so on. This brings us to the issue of efficiently maintaining
the provenance polynomials of complex graph pattern queries for dynamic and
large KGs instead of having to recompute them from scratch each time the KG is
updated. Addressing these issues, we present HUKA which uses provenance
polynomials for tracking the derivation of query results over knowledge graphs
by encoding the edges involved in generating the answer. More importantly, HUKA
also maintains these provenance polynomials in the face of updates---insertions
as well as deletions of facts---to the underlying KG. Experimental results over
large real-world KGs such as YAGO and DBpedia with various benchmark SPARQL

challenging due to the increasing penetration of variable renewable energy
sources. As significant end-use consumers, and through better grid integration,
buildings are expected to play an expanding role in the future smart grid.
Predictive control allows buildings to better harness available energy
flexibility from the building passive thermal mass. However, due to the
heterogeneous nature of the building stock, developing computationally
tractable control-oriented models, which adequately represent the complex and
nonlinear thermal-dynamics of individual buildings, is proving to be a major
hurdle. Data-driven predictive control, coupled with the ""Internet of Things"",
holds the promise for a scalable and transferrable approach,with data-driven
models replacing traditional physics-based models. This review examines recent
work utilising data-driven predictive control for demand side management
application with a special focus on the nexus of model development and control
integration, which to date, previous reviews have not addressed. Further topics
examined include the practical requirements for harnessing passive thermal mass
and the issue of feature selection. Current research gaps are outlined and
future research pathways are suggested to identify the most promising
data-driven predictive control techniques for grid integration of buildings.

shallow wide-field surveys such as Roman Space Telescope and EUCLID, and should
yield by far the largest sample of any current or planned mission of very high
redshift galaxies at z > 10 which are sufficiently bright for detailed
follow-up spectroscopy. Crucially, we propose a wide-field spectroscopic
near-IR + mid-IR capability which will greatly enhance our understanding of the
first galaxies by detecting and identifying a statistical sample of the first
galaxies and the first SMBH, and to chart the metal enrichment history of
galaxies in the early Universe - potentially finding signatures of the very
first stars to form from metal-free primordial gas. The wide-field and

star formation by performing a wide survey of the Milky Way in the near-IR +

Stock traders seeking to make profitable investment decisions have to account
for those trends, where the goal is to accurately predict switches from bullish
towards bearish markets and vice versa. Popular tools for modeling financial
time series are hidden Markov models, where a latent state process is used to
explicitly model switches among different market regimes. In their basic form,
however, hidden Markov models are not capable of capturing both short- and
long-term trends, which can lead to a misinterpretation of short-term price
fluctuations as changes in the long-term trend. In this paper, we demonstrate
how hierarchical hidden Markov models can be used to draw a comprehensive
picture of financial markets, which can contribute to the development of more
sophisticated trading strategies. The feasibility of the suggested approach is
illustrated in two real-data applications, where we model data from two major
stock indices, the Deutscher Aktienindex and the Standard & Poor's 500.

internal particle states leads to a collective motion at high densities and low
noise. We formulate a coarse-grained hydrodynamic theory of the model, compute
the phase diagrams of the APM for $q=4$ and $q=6$ and explore the flocking
dynamics in the region, in which the high-density (polar liquid) phase coexists
with the low-density (gas) phase and forms a fluctuating stripe of coherently
moving particles. As a function of the particle self-propulsion velocity, a
novel reorientation transition of the phase-separated profiles from transversal
band motion to longitudinal lane formation is revealed, which is absent in the
Vicsek model and APM for $q=2$ (active Ising model). The origin of this
reorientation transition is obtained via a stability analysis: for large
velocities, the transverse diffusion constant approaches zero and stabilizes
lanes. Finally, we perform microscopic simulations that corroborate our
analytical predictions about the flocking and reorientation transitions and
validate the phase diagrams of the APM.

kind of service successfully efficient algorithms have to be implemented for
effective fleet management to exploit the benefits associated with this
mobility service. Especially real time computation of finding beneficial
assignments is a problem not solved for large problem sizes until today. In
this study, we show the importance of using advanced algorithms by comparing a
fast, but simple insertion heuristic algorithm with a state-of-the-art
multi-step matching algorithm. We test the algorithms in various scenarios
based on private vehicle trip OD-data for Munich, Germany. Results indicate
that in the tested scenarios by using the multi-step algorithm up to 8$\%$
additional requests could be served while also 10$\%$ additional driven
distance could be saved. However, computational time for finding optimal
assignments in the advanced algorithm exceeds real time rather fast as problem
size increases. Therefore, several aspects to reduce the computational time by
decreasing redundant checks of the advanced multi step algorithm are
introduced. Finally, a refined vehicle selection heuristic based on three rules
is presented to furthermore reduce the computational effort. In the tested
scenarios this heuristic can speed up the most cost intensive algorithm step by
a factor of over 8, while keeping the number of served requests almost constant
and maintaining around 70$\%$ of the driven distance saved in the system.
Considering all algorithm steps, an overall speed up of 2.5 could be achieved.

driving over a wide range of driving frequencies. To this end, we study
numerically a disordered spin-1/2 chain which is periodically driven by a sine
or a square-wave drive, respectively. In both cases, the critical driving
amplitude increases monotonically with the frequency, and at large frequencies,
it is identical for the two drives in the appropriate normalization. However,
at low and intermediate frequencies the critical amplitude of the square-wave
drive depends strongly on the frequency, while the one of the cosine drive is
almost constant in a wide frequency range. By analyzing the density of
drive-induced resonance in a Fourier space perspective, we conclude that this
difference is due to resonances induced by the higher harmonics which are

Furthermore, we suggest a numerically efficient method to estimate the

neglecting the acceleration of the leader, analyzing the system through the

pulsars. Theories with massive fields exist to explain a variety of phenomena
from dark energy to the strong CP problem. Existing pulsar binaries, such as
the white dwarf-pulsar binary J1738+0333, have been used to place stringent
bounds on the scalar dipole emission, and radio telescopes may detect a pulsar
orbiting a black hole in the future. In this paper, we study the ability of
pulsar binaries to probe theories involving massive scalar and vector fields
through the measurement of the orbital decay rate. With a generic framework, we
describe corrections to orbital decay rate due to (a) modification of GR
quadrupolar radiation and (b) dipolar radiation of a massive field. We then
consider three concrete examples: (i) massive Brans-Dicke theory, (ii) general
relativity with axions, and (iii) general relativity with bound dark matter and
a dark force. Finally, we apply direct observations of J1738 and simulations of
a black hole-pulsar binary to bound theory parameters such as field's mass and
coupling constant. We find new constraints on bound dark matter interactions
with PSR J1738, and a black hole-pulsar discovery would likely improve these
further. Such bounds are complementary to future gravitational-wave bounds.
Regarding other theories, we find similar constraints to previous pulsar
measurements for massive Brans-Dicke theory and axions. These results show that
new pulsar binaries will continue to allow for more stringent tests of gravity.

phenomenon found across many branches of science. From an application point of
view, while the multirhythmicity is sometimes desirable as it presents us with
many possible coexisting stable oscillatory states to tap into, it can also be
a nuisance because a random perturbation may make the system settle onto an
unwanted stable state. Consequently, it is not surprising that there are many
natural and artificial mechanisms available that can control the
multirhythmicity. We propose in this paper the idea of incorporating parametric
(periodic) modulation of the nonlinear damping in the limit cycle oscillators
with a view to exciting resonance and antiresonance responses at particular
angular driving frequencies, and controlling the resulting birhythmicity by
changing the amplitude of the modulation. To this end, we employ analytical
(perturbative) and numerical techniques on the van der Pol oscillator---a
paradigmatic limit cycle system---having additional position dependent time
delay term and its modified autonomous birhythmic version. We also bring the
fact to the fore that introduction of delay---a commonly adopted method of
controlling multirhythmicity---in such a system can sometimes bring forth
unwanted birhythmicity; and interestingly, our method of controlling
birhythmicity through periodic modulation can suppress such a delay induced
birhythmic response.

comparative studies to apply different metaheuristic algorithms for solving the
QAP. One of the most popular approaches for categorizing meta-heuristic
algorithms is based on a search strategy, including (1) local search
improvement meta-heuristics and (2) global search-based meta-heuristics. The
matter that distinguishes this paper from the other is the comparative
performance of local and global search (both EA and SI), in which
meta-heuristics that consist of genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm

these algorithms, eight different factors are presented. By taking into account
all these factors, the test is implemented in six test problems of the QAP

HetMS model is implemented in EGSnrc; the code is tested via comparisons with

distinct scenarios for the HetMS model are considered: (1) monoenergetic photon
beams incident on a large cylinder; (2) isotropic point source at the center of
a large sphere with GNPs diffusing from the center. Dose enhancement factors
(DEFs) are compared for different source energies, depths, gold concentrations,
GNP sizes, and modeling assumptions. Simulation efficiencies are investigated.
The HetMS MC simulations account for the competing effects of photon fluence
perturbation coupled with enhanced local energy deposition. DEFs are most
sensitive to these effects for lower source energies, varying with distance
from the source; DEFs below unity can occur at energies relevant for
brachytherapy. Compared to discrete modeling of GNPs throughout the
gold-containing volume, efficiencies are enhanced by up to a factor of 122 with
the HetMS approach. For the spherical phantom, DEFs vary with time for
diffusion, radionuclide, and radius. By combining geometric models of varying
complexity on different length scales within a single simulation, the HetMS
model can effectively account for both macroscopic and microscopic effects.
Efficiency gains with the HetMS approach enable diverse calculations which
would otherwise be prohibitively long. The HetMS model may be extended to
diverse scenarios relevant for GNPT, providing further avenues for research and

Coulomb collisions between thermal electrons and ions. Gyroresonance and
gyrosynchrotron result from the acceleration of low-energy electrons and mildly
relativistic electrons, respectively, in the presence of a magnetic field. In
the non-flaring Sun, free-free is the dominant emission mechanism with the
exception of regions of strong magnetic fields which emit gyroresonance at
microwaves. Due to its ubiquitous presence, free-free emission can be used to
probe the non-flaring solar atmosphere above temperature minimum. Gyroresonance
opacity depends strongly on the magnetic field strength and orientation; hence
it provides a unique tool for the estimation of coronal magnetic fields.
Gyrosynchrotron is the primary emission mechanism in flares at frequencies
higher than 1-2 GHz and depends on the properties of both the magnetic field

a moving wall wave has been studied previously for a rectangular channel, a
circular tube, and a concentric circular annulus. Here we study peristaltic
flow in a non-axisymmetric annular tube, where the flow is three dimensional,
with azimuthal motions. This geometry is motivated by experimental observations
of cerebrospinal fluid flow along perivascular spaces (PVSs) surrounding
arteries in the brain, which is at least partially driven by peristaltic
pumping. These PVSs are well matched, in cross-section, by an adjustable model
consisting of an inner circle (arterial wall) and an outer ellipse (outer edge
of the PVS), not necessarily concentric. We use this model, which may have
other applications, as a basis for numerical simulations of peristaltic flow.
We use a finite-element scheme to compute the flow driven by a propagating
sinusoidal radial displacement of the inner wall. Unlike peristaltic flow in a
concentric circular annulus, the flow is fully three-dimensional, with
streamlines wiggling in both the radial and axial directions. We examine the
dependence of the flow on the elongation of the outer elliptical wall and on
the eccentricity of the configuration. We find that time-averaged volumetric
flow decreases with increasing ellipticity or eccentricity. Azimuthal pressure
variations, caused by the wall wave, drive an oscillatory azimuthal flow in and
out of the narrower gaps. The additional shearing motion in the azimuthal
direction will enhance Taylor dispersion in these flows, an effect that might
have practical applications.

qualitative insight into the role of sea quarks in hadronic structure and

parts; one that involves degrees of freedom in the same connected local and
global color singlet and the remaining interactions that allow the connected
local and global color singlets to interact. The first class of interactions
results in infinite towers of bare ""particles"" with hadronic quantum numbers.
All but a finite number of these remain stable when the second class of
interactions is included. The model interactions are expressed in terms of
sub-hadronic degrees of freedom, which determine the bare hadronic spectrum and
the interactions involving the bare hadrons in terms of a small number of
sub-hadronic model parameters. As a first test, this paper considers the
simplest case of mesons that interact via a string-breaking interaction. One
virtue of this model is that all of the bare meson masses and eigenfunctions
can be computed analytically. In addition, the string breaking interaction
leads to production vertices that can also be computed analytically. The
relativistic wave functions have a light-front kinematic symmetry. The goal is
to find a simple relativistic quantum mechanical model based on sub-hadronic
degrees of freedom that can provide an efficient, qualitatively consistent
description of hadronic masses, lifetimes, cross sections, sea quark effects,

potentially useful tool to study the impact of sea quarks on hadronic structure

  Applications in Distributed Derandomization","To appear in FOCS 2020",,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is a recent exciting line of work in distributed graph algorithms in
the $\mathsf{CONGEST}$ model that exploit expanders. All these algorithms so
far are based on two tools: expander decomposition and expander routing. An
$(\epsilon,\phi)$-expander decomposition removes $\epsilon$-fraction of the
edges so that the remaining connected components have conductance at least
$\phi$, i.e., they are $\phi$-expanders, and expander routing allows each
vertex $v$ in a $\phi$-expander to very quickly exchange $\text{deg}(v)$
messages with any other vertices, not just its local neighbors.
  In this paper, we give the first efficient deterministic distributed
algorithms for both tools. We show that an $(\epsilon,\phi)$-expander
decomposition can be deterministically computed in $\text{poly}(\epsilon^{-1})
n^{o(1)}$ rounds for $\phi = \text{poly}(\epsilon) n^{-o(1)}$, and that
expander routing can be performed deterministically in
$\text{poly}(\phi^{-1})n^{o(1)}$ rounds. Both results match previous bounds of
randomized algorithms by [Chang and Saranurak, PODC 2019] and [Ghaffari, Kuhn,
and Su, PODC 2017] up to subpolynomial factors.
  Consequently, we derandomize existing distributed algorithms that exploit
expanders. We show that a minimum spanning tree on $n^{o(1)}$-expanders can be
constructed deterministically in $n^{o(1)}$ rounds, and triangle detection and
enumeration on general graphs can be solved deterministically in $O(n^{0.58})$
and $n^{2/3 + o(1)}$ rounds, respectively.
  We also give the first polylogarithmic-round randomized algorithm for
constructing an $(\epsilon,\phi)$-expander decomposition in
$\text{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}, \log n)$ rounds for $\phi = 1 /
\text{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}, \log n)$. The previous algorithm by [Chang and
Saranurak, PODC 2019] needs $n^{\Omega(1)}$ rounds for any $\phi\ge
1/\text{poly}\log n$.

the polyelectrolyte layer induced electrostatics to solve the coupled system of

is used to obtain the velocity distribution in the asymptotic limit of
geostrophic plug flow under the framework of variational calculus approach. We
analyze the mixing dynamics from the perspective of both qualitative assessment
and quantitative evaluation. For the qualitative estimation, we focus on the
Poincar\'e map analysis, while the entropy of mixing approach is used for the
mixing quantification. Results show that the grafted polyelectrolyte layer in
contact with the ionic solution leads to the development of an electrical
double layer, which upon interacting with the external electric field,
strengthens the electroosmotic pumping in the fluidic channel. Such
polyelectrolyte layer modulated strong electroosmotic pumping together with its
intrinsic feature of offering a frictional drag to the underlying transport
helps to modulate the primary as well as the secondary flows in the channel
under the influence of rotational forces. With an alteration in the
electroosmotic pumping and frictional drag force, tuneable through the
thickness of the grafted polyelectrolyte layer, we obtain different types of

natal disks. Proto-gas-giant planets, with Hills radius larger than the disk
thickness, open gaps and quench gas flow in the vicinity of their orbits. It is
usually assumed that their type II migration is coupled to the viscous
evolution of the disk. Although this hypothesis provides an explanation for the
origin of close-in planets, it also encounter predicament on the retention of
long-period orbits for most gas giant planets. Moreover, numerical simulations
indicate that planets migrations are not solely determined by the viscous
diffusion of their natal disk. Here we carry out a series of hydrodynamic
simulations combined with analytic studies to examine the transition between
different paradigms of type II migration. We find a range of planetary mass for
which gas continues to flow through a severely depleted gap so that the surface
density distribution in the disk region beyond the gap is maintained in a
quasi-steady state. The associated gap profile modifies the location of
corotation \& Lindblad resonances. In the proximity of the planet's orbit,
high-order Lindblad \& corotation torque are weakened by the gas depletion in
the gap while low-order Lindblad torques near the gap walls preserves their
magnitude. Consequently, the intrinsic surface density distribution of the disk
determines delicately both pace and direction of planets' type II migration. We
show that this effect might stall the inward migration of giant planets and
preserve them in disk regions where the surface density is steep.

Double-electron capture (2EC) was not in focus so far because of its in general
lower transition probability. However, the rate of neutrinoless double-electron
capture ($0\nu2$EC) can experience a resonance enhancement by many orders of
magnitude in case the initial and final states are energetically degenerate. In
the resonant case, the sensitivity of the $0\nu2$EC process can approach the
sensitivity of the $0\nu2\beta^-$ decay in the search for the Majorana mass of
neutrinos, right-handed currents, and other new physics. We present an overview
of the main experimental and theoretical results obtained during the last
decade in this field. The experimental part outlines search results of 2EC
processes and measurements of the decay energies for possible resonant
$0\nu$2EC transitions. An unprecedented precision in the determination of decay
energies with Penning traps has allowed one to refine the values of the
degeneracy parameter for all previously known near-resonant decays and has
reduced the rather large uncertainties in the estimate of the $0\nu2$EC
half-lives. The theoretical part contains an updated analysis of the electron
shell effects and an overview of the nuclear structure models, in which the
nuclear matrix elements of the $0\nu2$EC decays are calculated. One can
conclude that the decay probability of $0\nu$2EC can experience a significant
enhancement in several nuclides.

causes a volume expansion which tends to weaken these interactions, leading to
a net effect of weakly suppressed magnetism, as observed in experiments. The

the volume expansion caused by Ba-substitution. The calculated electric
polarization as a function of biaxial strain in Sr$_{1-x}$Ba$_{x}$MnO$_3$ for

that discovers which weights to combine and then fuses weights of similar
fully-connected, convolutional and attention layers. Layer fusion can
significantly reduce the number of layers of the original network with little
additional computation overhead, while maintaining competitive performance.
From experiments on CIFAR-10, we find that various deep convolution neural
networks can remain within 2\% accuracy points of the original networks up to a
compression ratio of 3.33 when iteratively retrained with layer fusion. For
experiments on the WikiText-2 language modelling dataset where pretrained
transformer models are used, we achieve compression that leads to a network
that is 20\% of its original size while being within 5 perplexity points of the
original network. We also find that other well-established compression
techniques can achieve competitive performance when compared to their original
networks given a sufficient number of retraining steps. Generally, we observe a
clear inflection point in performance as the amount of compression increases,
suggesting a bound on the amount of compression that can be achieved before an
exponential degradation in performance.

  Pooled Testing to Increase Test Reliability","14 pages, 15 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a novel method to increase the reliability of COVID-19 virus or
antibody tests by using specially designed pooled testings. Instead of testing
nasal swab or blood samples from individual persons, we propose to test
mixtures of samples from many individuals. The pooled sample testing method
proposed in this paper also serves a different purpose: for increasing test
reliability and providing accurate diagnoses even if the tests themselves are
not very accurate. Our method uses ideas from compressed sensing and
error-correction coding to correct for a certain number of errors in the test
results. The intuition is that when each individual's sample is part of many
pooled sample mixtures, the test results from all of the sample mixtures
contain redundant information about each individual's diagnosis, which can be
exploited to automatically correct for wrong test results in exactly the same
way that error correction codes correct errors introduced in noisy
communication channels. While such redundancy can also be achieved by simply
testing each individual's sample multiple times, we present simulations and
theoretical arguments that show that our method is significantly more efficient
in increasing diagnostic accuracy. In contrast to group testing and compressed
sensing which aim to reduce the number of required tests, this proposed error
correction code idea purposefully uses pooled testing to increase test
accuracy, and works not only in the ""undersampling"" regime, but also in the
""oversampling"" regime, where the number of tests is bigger than the number of
subjects. The results in this paper run against traditional beliefs that, ""even
though pooled testing increased test capacity, pooled testings were less
reliable than testing individuals separately.""

compact structural representations that can encode single DNA binding sites to

work in the coming decade.
  In the past decade, numerous important advances have been made in solar
system science using ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic techniques. Formerly used
nearly exclusively for studies of giant planet atmospheres, planetary
exospheres and cometary emissions, UV imaging spectroscopy has recently been
more widely applied. The geyser-like plume at Saturn's moon Enceladus was
discovered in part as a result of UV stellar occultation observations, and this
technique was used to characterize the plume and jets during the entire Cassini
mission. Evidence for a similar style of activity has been found at Jupiter's
moon Europa using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV emission and absorption
imaging. At other moons and small bodies throughout the solar system, UV
spectroscopy has been utilized to search for activity, probe surface
composition, and delineate space weathering effects; UV photometric studies
have been used to uncover regolith structure. Insights from UV imaging
spectroscopy of solar system surfaces have been gained largely in the last 1-2
decades, including studies of surface composition, space weathering effects
(e.g. radiolytic products) and volatiles on asteroids (e.g.
[2][39][48][76][84]), the Moon (e.g. [30][46][49]), comet nuclei (e.g. [85])
and icy satellites (e.g. [38][41-44][45][47][65]). The UV is sensitive to some
species, minor contaminants and grain sizes often not detected in other
spectral regimes.
  In the coming decade, HST observations will likely come to an end. New
infrastructure to bolster future UV studies is critically needed. These needs
include both developmental work to help improve future UV observations and
laboratory work to help interpret spacecraft data. UV instrumentation will be a
critical tool on missions to a variety of targets in the coming decade,
especially for the rapidly expanding application of UV reflectance
investigations of atmosphereless bodies.

strength of SL42 was found to be $22.4 \pm 13.9$ $\mu$G. Taking into account
the effects of thermal/turbulent pressure and the plane-of-sky magnetic field

the critical state if the magnetic fields lie near the plane of the sky. Since
there is a very low luminosity object (VeLLO) toward the center of SL42, it is
unlikely this core is in a highly subcritical condition (i.e., magnetic

converges weakly in probability to the zero measure. A key feature in Cook et
al. was to allow some of the entries $\sigma_{ij}$ to vanish, provided that the
standard deviation profiles $A_n$ satisfy a certain quantitative irreducibility
property.
  In the present article, we provide more information on the sequence
$(\mu_n)$, described by a family of Master Equations. We consider these
equations in important special cases such as separable variance profiles
$\sigma^2_{ij}=d_i \widetilde d_j$ and sampled variance profiles $\sigma^2_{ij}
= \sigma^2\left(\frac in, \frac jn \right)$ where $(x,y)\mapsto \sigma^2(x,y)$
is a given function on $[0,1]^2$. Associate examples are provided where
$\mu_n^Y$ converges to a genuine limit.
  We study $\mu_n$'s behavior at zero and provide examples where $\mu_n$'s
density is bounded, blows up, or vanishes while an atom appears. As a
consequence, we identify the profiles that yield the circular law.
  Finally, building upon recent results from Alt et al., we prove that except
maybe in zero, $\mu_n$ admits a positive density on the centered disc of radius
$\sqrt{\rho(V_n)}$, where $V_n=(\frac 1n \sigma_{ij}^2)$ and $\rho(V_n)$ is its
spectral radius.

estimated the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow. We used several ARIMA and EST

The best statistical model for describing the pandemic in Moscow was ETS with

2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and patient outcomes were
investigated using machine learning tools to identify key biomarkers to predict
the mortality of individual patient. A nomogram was developed for predicting
the mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophils
(%), lymphocyte (%), high sensitive C-reactive protein, and age - acquired at
hospital admission were identified as key predictors of death by multi-tree
XGBoost model. The area under curve (AUC) of the nomogram for the derivation
and validation cohort were 0.961 and 0.991, respectively. An integrated score
(LNLCA) was calculated with the corresponding death probability. COVID-19
patients were divided into three subgroups: low-, moderate- and high-risk
groups using LNLCA cut-off values of 10.4 and 12.65 with the death probability
less than 5%, 5% to 50%, and above 50%, respectively. The prognostic model,

because they are usually performed in a low signal-to-noise ratio regime due to
the high sky temperature and because of ionospheric disturbances whose effects
are inversely proportional to the observing frequency. Nonetheless, these
observations are crucial to study the emission from low-energy populations of
cosmic rays. We aim to obtain the first thermal-noise limited (~ 1.5 mJy/beam)
deep continuum radio map using the LOFAR Low Band Antenna (LBA) system. Our
demonstration observation targeted the galaxy cluster RX J0603.3+4214 (the
""Toothbrush"" cluster). We used the resulting ultra-low frequency (58 MHz) image
to study cosmic-ray acceleration and evolution in the post shock region, as
well as their relation with the presence of a radio halo. We describe the data
reduction we have used to calibrate LOFAR LBA observations. The resulting image
is combined with observations at higher frequencies (LOFAR 150 MHz and VLA 1500
MHz) to extract spectral information. We obtained the first thermal-noise
limited image from an observation carried out with the LOFAR LBA system using
all Dutch stations at a central frequency of 58 MHz. With 8 hours of data, we
reached an rms noise of 1.3 mJy/beam at a resolution of 18"" x 11"". The
procedure we have developed is an important step forward towards routine
high-fidelity imaging with the LOFAR LBA. The analysis of the radio spectra
shows that the radio relic extends to distances of 800 kpc downstream from the
shock front, larger than what allowed by electron cooling time. Furthermore,
the shock wave started accelerating electrons already at a projected distance
of <300 kpc from the crossing point of the two clusters. These results can be
explained if electrons are reaccelerated downstream by background turbulence
possibly combined with projection effects.

the layer. This finding is confirmed by theoretical calculations demonstrating
that while both molecules exhibit a similar dipole moment in their isolated

photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that both derivatives exhibit a
high ionisation potential of 7 eV, in agreement with their effective
hole-blocking nature demonstrated by the devices. However, each of the
molecules shows a different electron affinity due to the increased conjugation
of one of the derivatives. While the change in electron transport level between
the two derivatives is as high as 0.3 eV, the difference in the open-circuit
voltage of both types of devices is negligible, suggesting that the electron
transport level plays only a minor role in determining the open-circuit voltage
of the device. Numerical device simulations confirm that the increase in
built-in potential, arising from the high dipole of the electrolyte layer,
compensates for the non-ideal energetic alignment of the charge transport
levels, resulting in high VOC for a range of electron transport levels. Our

powerful tool to enhance the open-circuit voltage of the devices and provides

machine learning (ML) and ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve combinatorial
optimization problems. To illustrate the underlying mechanism of our ML-ACO
algorithm, we start by describing a test problem, the orienteering problem. In
this problem, the objective is to find a route that visits a subset of vertices
in a graph within a time budget to maximize the collected score. In the first
phase of our ML-ACO algorithm, an ML model is trained using a set of small
problem instances where the optimal solution is known. Specifically,
classification models are used to classify an edge as being part of the optimal
route, or not, using problem-specific features and statistical measures. The
trained model is then used to predict the probability that an edge in the graph
of a test problem instance belongs to the corresponding optimal route. In the
second phase, we incorporate the predicted probabilities into the ACO component
of our algorithm, i.e., using the probability values as heuristic weights or to
warm start the pheromone matrix. Here, the probability values bias sampling
towards favoring those predicted high-quality edges when constructing feasible
routes. We have tested multiple classification models including graph neural
networks, logistic regression and support vector machines, and the experimental
results show that our solution prediction approach consistently boosts the
performance of ACO. Further, we empirically show that our ML model trained on
small synthetic instances generalizes well to large synthetic and real-world
instances. Our approach integrating ML with a meta-heuristic is generic and can
be applied to a wide range of optimization problems.

data and first physical principles, including conservation laws of momentum,
mass, and energy, into the neural network to inform the learning processes. To
the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first application of PINN to
three dimensional AM processes modeling. Besides, we propose a hard-type
approach for Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) based on a Heaviside function,
which can not only enforce the BCs but also accelerate the learning process.
The PINN framework is applied to two representative metal manufacturing
problems, including the 2018 NIST AM-Benchmark test series. We carefully assess
the performance of the PINN model by comparing the predictions with available
experimental data and high-fidelity simulation results. The investigations show
that the PINN, owed to the additional physical knowledge, can accurately
predict the temperature and melt pool dynamics during metal AM processes with
only a moderate amount of labeled data-sets. The foray of PINN to metal AM
shows the great potential of physics-informed deep learning for broader
applications to advanced manufacturing.

undergraduate quantum mechanics courses because its discussion usually requires
wavepackets built on the Airy functions -- a difficult computation. Here, on
the contrary, we show that the problem can be nicely simplified both for a
single particle and for general many-body systems by making use of a gauge
transformation that corresponds to a change of reference frame from the
laboratory frame to the one comoving with the falling system. Using this
approach, the quantum mechanics problem of a particle in an external
gravitational potential reduces to a much simpler one where there is no longer
any gravitational potential in the Schr\""{o}dinger equation. It is instructive
to see that the same procedure can be used for many-body systems subjected to
an external gravitational potential and a two-body interparticle potential that
is a function of the distance between the particles. This topic provides a
helpful and pedagogical example of a quantum many-body system whose dynamics
can be analytically described in simple terms.
