number of coins and all coins in the same bag weigh the same amount. Coins in
different bags weigh 1, 2, 3, and so on to $n$ grams exactly. There is a unique
label from the set 1 through $n$ attached to each bag that is supposed to
correspond to the weight of the coins in that bag. The task is to confirm all
the labels by using a balance scale once.
  We study weighings that we call downhill: they use the numbers of coins from
the bags that are in a decreasing order. We show the importance of such
weighings. We find the smallest possible total weight of coins in a downhill
weighing that confirms the labels on the bags. We also find bounds on the
smallest number of coins needed for such a weighing.

Version to appear in PLB",,"10.1016/j.physletb.2020.135881",,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Among many possibilities, solar axion has been proposed to explain the
electronic recoil events excess observed by Xenon1T collaboration, although it
has tension with astrophysical observations. The axion couplings, to photon
$g_{a\gamma}$ and to electron $g_{ae}$ play important roles. These couplings
are related to the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) charges $X_f$ for fermions. In most of the
calculations, $g_{a\gamma}$ is obtained by normalizing to the ratio of
electromagnetic anomaly factor $E = TrX_f Q^2_f N_c$ ($N_c$ is 3 and 1 for
quarks and charged leptons respectively) and QCD anomaly factor $N = TrX_q
T(q)$ ($T(q)$ is quarks' $SU(3)_c$ index). The broken PQ symmetry generator is
used in the calculation which does not seem to extract out the components of
broken generator in the axion which are ""eaten"" by the $Z$ boson. However,
using the physical components of axion or the ratio of anomaly factors should
obtain the same results in the DFSZ for $g_{a\gamma}$. When going beyond the
standard DFSZ models, such as variant DFSZ models, where more Higgs doublets
and fermions have different PQ charges, one may wonder if the results are
different. We show that the two methods obtain the same results as expected,
but the axion couplings to quarks and leptons $g_{af}$ (here f indicates one of
the fermions in the SM) are more conveniently calculated in the physical axion
basis. The result depends on the values of the vacuum expectation values
leading to a wider parameter space for $g_{af}$ in beyond the standard DFSZ
axion. We also show explicitly how flavor conserving $g_{af}$ couplings can be
maintained when there are more than one Higgs doublets couple to the up and
down fermion sectors in variant DFSZ models at tree level, and how flavor
violating couplings can arise.

essential optical-to-electrical signal conversion, and unlike solar cells,
operate at a specific wavelength and at high signal or sensory speeds. Towards
achieving high detector performance, device physics, however, places a
fundamental limit of the achievable detector sensitivity, such as responsivity
and gain, when simultaneously aimed to increasing the detectors temporal
response, speed, known as the gain-bandwidth product (GBP). While detectors GBP
has been increasing in recent years, the average GBP is still relatively modest
(~10^6-10^7 Hz-A/W). Here we discuss photodetector performance limits and
opportunities based on arguments from scaling length theory relating
photocarrier channel length, mobility, electrical resistance with optical
waveguide mode constrains. We show that short-channel detectors are synergistic
with slot-waveguide approaches, and when combined, offer a high-degree of
detector design synergy especially for the class of nanometer-thin materials.
Indeed, we find that two dimensional material-based detectors are not limited
by their low mobility and can, in principle, allow for 100 GHz fast response
rates. However, contact resistance is still a challenge for such thin
materials, a research topic that is still not addressed yet. An interim
solution is to utilize heterojunction approaches for functionality separation.
Nonetheless, atomistically- and nanometer-thin materials used in such
next-generation scaling length theory based detectors also demand high material
quality and monolithic integration strategies into photonic circuits including
foundry-near processes. As it stands, this letter aims to guide the community
if achieving the next generation photodetectors aiming for a performance target

offers no guarantee that the produced sample will even approximately resemble

always maximize their expected utility, in practice, we constantly observe
apparently irrational behavior. One explanation is that people have limited
computational power, so that they are, quite rationally, making the best
decisions they can, given their computational limitations. To test this
hypothesis, we consider the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. We examine a
simple strategy for playing an MAB that can be implemented easily by a
probabilistic finite automaton (PFA). Roughly speaking, the PFA sets certain
expectations, and plays an arm as long as it meets them. If the PFA has
sufficiently many states, it performs near-optimally. Its performance degrades
gracefully as the number of states decreases. Moreover, the PFA acts in a
""human-like"" way, exhibiting a number of standard human biases, like an
optimism bias and a negativity bias.

systems, but until now has focused entirely on the forward-model -- that is,
generating a synthetic model given fixed values of a large number of parameters
describing the system and the observations. The inverse problem, obtaining
orbital and stellar parameters given observational data, is more complicated
and computationally expensive as it requires generating a large set of
forward-models to determine which set of parameters and uncertainties best
represent the available observational data. The process of determining the best
solution and also of obtaining reliable and robust uncertainties on those
parameters often requires the use of multiple algorithms, including both
optimizers and samplers. Furthermore, the forward-model of PHOEBE has been
designed to be as physically robust as possible, but is computationally
expensive compared to other codes. It is useful, therefore, to use whichever
code is most efficient given the reasonable assumptions for a specific system,
but learning the intricacies of multiple codes presents a barrier to doing this
in practice. Here we present the 2.3 release of PHOEBE (publicly available from
http://phoebe-project.org) which introduces a general framework for defining
and handling distributions on parameters, and utilizing multiple different
estimation, optimization, and sampling algorithms. The presented framework
supports multiple forward-models, including the robust model built into PHOEBE
itself.

  Performance Degradation of CVD Grown Monolayer MoS2 Transistors",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report, for CVD-grown monolayer MoS2, the very first results on temporal
degradation of material and device performance under electrical stress. Both
low and high field regimes of operation are explored at different temperatures,
gate bias and stress cycles. During low field operation, current is found to
saturate after hundreds of seconds of operation with the current decay time
constant being a function of temperature and stress cycle. Current saturation
after several seconds during low field operation occurs when a thermal
equilibrium is established. However, high field operation, especially at low
temperature, leads to impact ionization assisted material and device
degradation. It is found that high field operation at low temperature results
in amorphization of the channel and is verified by device and Kelvin Probe
Force Microscopy (KPFM) analyses. In general, a prolonged room temperature
operation of CVD-grown MoS2 transistors lead to degraded gate control, higher
OFF state current and negative shift in threshold voltage (VT). This is further
verified, through micro-Raman and Photoluminescence spectroscopy, which suggest
that a steady state DC electrical stress leads to the formation of localized
low resistance regions in the channel and a subsequent loss of transistor
characteristics. Our findings unveil unique mechanism by which CVD MoS2
undergoes material degradation under electrical stress and subsequent breakdown
of transistor behavior. Such an understanding of material and device
reliability helps in determining the safe operating regime from device as well
as circuit perspective.

performance of systems and to answer what-if questions without measurements for
all alternatives. A difficulty when creating models is that Performance Model
Parameters (PMPs, such as resource demands, loop iteration numbers and branch
probabilities) depend on various influencing factors like input data, used
hardware and the applied workload. To enable a broad range of what-if
questions, Performance Models (PMs) need to have predictive power beyond what
has been measured to calibrate the models. Thus, PMPs need to be parametrized
over the influencing factors that may vary.
  Existing approaches allow for the estimation of parametrized PMPs by
measuring the complete system. Thus, they are too costly to be applied
frequently, up to after each code change. They do not keep also manual changes
to the model when recalibrating.
  In this work, we present the Continuous Integration of Performance Models
(CIPM), which incrementally extracts and calibrates the performance model,
including parametric dependencies. CIPM responds to source code changes by
updating the PM and adaptively instrumenting the changed parts. To allow AbPP,
CIPM estimates the parametrized PMPs using the measurements (generated by
performance tests or executing the system in production) and statistical
analysis, e.g., regression analysis and decision trees.
  Additionally, our approach responds to production changes (e.g., load or
deployment changes) and calibrates the usage and deployment parts of PMs
accordingly.
  For the evaluation, we used two case studies. Evaluation results show that we
were able to calibrate the PM incrementally and accurately.

ab initio method for efficiently calculating electron-phonon mediated transport
properties by dramatically accelerating the computation of the double integrals
with a dual interpolation technique that combines maximally localized Wannier
functions with symmetry-adapted plane waves. The performance gain in relation
to the current state-of-the-art Wannier-Fourier interpolation is approximately
2n_s \times M, where n_s is the number of crystal symmetry operations and M, a
number in the range 5 - 60, governs the expansion in star functions. We
demonstrate with several examples how our method performs some ab initio
calculations involving electron-phonon interactions.

set of assumptions of how humans perceive saliency to create discriminating
features. By fixing the pre-selected assumptions as an integral part of their
models, these methods cannot be easily extended for specific settings and
different image domains. We then propose a superpixel-based ITerative Saliency
Estimation fLexible Framework (ITSELF) that allows any user-defined assumptions

superpixel segmentation algorithms, saliency-maps can be used to improve
superpixel delineation. By combining a saliency-based superpixel algorithm to a
superpixel-based saliency estimator, we propose a novel saliency/superpixel
self-improving loop to iteratively enhance saliency maps. We compare ITSELF to
two state-of-the-art saliency estimators on five metrics and six datasets, four

this goal, by combining the $L_p$ Asplund sum of log-concave functions for all

propose a definition for the first variation of the total mass in the $L_p$

inequality related to the first variation of the total mass and derive a
variational formula which motivates the definition of our $L_p$ surface area

for log-concave functions, which aims to characterize the $L_p$ surface area
measure for log-concave functions, is introduced. The existence of solutions to
the $L_p$ Minkowski problem for log-concave functions is obtained for $p>1$

the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images, reconciling state of the
art performance with strong theoretical guarantees. However, tensor-based
approaches previously proposed assume that the different observed images are
acquired under exactly the same conditions. A recent work proposed to
accommodate inter-image spectral variability in the image fusion problem using
a matrix factorization-based formulation, but did not account for
spatially-localized variations. Moreover, it lacks theoretical guarantees and
has a high associated computational complexity. In this paper, we consider the
image fusion problem while accounting for both spatially and spectrally
localized changes in an additive model. We first study how the general
identifiability of the model is impacted by the presence of such changes. Then,
assuming that the high-resolution image and the variation factors admit a
Tucker decomposition, two new algorithms are proposed -- one purely algebraic,
and another based on an optimization procedure. Theoretical guarantees for the
exact recovery of the high-resolution image are provided for both algorithms.
Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the presence of spectral and spatial variations between the images,
at a smaller computational cost.

to as an inside/outside Ramsey theorem: every infinite graph $G$ contains an
infinite subset $H$ such that every vertex of $G$ is adjacent to precisely
none, one, or infinitely many vertices of $H$. We analyze the Rival-Sands
theorem from the perspective of reverse mathematics and the Weihrauch degrees.
In reverse mathematics, we find that the Rival-Sands theorem is equivalent to
arithmetical comprehension and hence is stronger than Ramsey's theorem for

equivalent to Ramsey's theorem for pairs. We turn to the Weihrauch degrees to
give a finer analysis of the Rival-Sands theorem's computational strength. We
find that the Rival-Sands theorem is Weihrauch equivalent to the double jump of
weak K\""{o}nig's lemma. We believe that the Rival-Sands theorem is the first
natural theorem shown to exhibit exactly this strength. Furthermore, by
combining our result with a result of Brattka and Rakotoniaina, we obtain that
solving one instance of the Rival-Sands theorem exactly corresponds to
simultaneously solving countably many instances of Ramsey's theorem for pairs.
Finally, we show that the uniform computational strength of the weak
Rival-Sands theorem is weaker than that of Ramsey's theorem for pairs by
showing that a number of well-known consequences of Ramsey's theorem for pairs
do not Weihrauch reduce to the weak Rival-Sands theorem. We also address an
apparent gap in the literature concerning the relationship between Weihrauch

kinematic age of only 82 y +- 17 y, placing TXS 0128+554 among the youngest
members of the compact symmetric object (CSO) class. The lack of compact,
inverted spectrum hotspots and an emission gap between the bright inner jet and
outer radio lobe structure indicate that the jets have undergone episodic
activity, and were re-launched a decade ago. The predicted gamma-ray emission
from the lobes, based on an inverse Compton-emitting cocoon model, is three
orders of magnitude below the observed Fermi LAT flux. A comparison to other
Fermi-detected and non-Fermi detected CSOs with redshift z<0.1 indicates that
the gamma-ray emission likely originates in the inner jet/core region, and that
nearby, recently launched AGN jets are primary candidates for detection by the

measure model robustness against common corruptions (like ImageNet-C)
underestimate model robustness in many (but not all) application scenarios. The
key insight is that in many scenarios, multiple unlabeled examples of the
corruptions are available and can be used for unsupervised online adaptation.
Replacing the activation statistics estimated by batch normalization on the
training set with the statistics of the corrupted images consistently improves
the robustness across 25 different popular computer vision models. Using the
corrected statistics, ResNet-50 reaches 62.2% mCE on ImageNet-C compared to
76.7% without adaptation. With the more robust DeepAugment+AugMix model, we
improve the state of the art achieved by a ResNet50 model up to date from 53.6%
mCE to 45.4% mCE. Even adapting to a single sample improves robustness for the
ResNet-50 and AugMix models, and 32 samples are sufficient to improve the
current state of the art for a ResNet-50 architecture. We argue that results

be captured by stars, start to swallow their material, and eventually turn them
into BH, hence originating a peculiar new type of stellar catastrophic event.
Here we revisit this process in the most favorable case of PBH capture by
neutron stars. We detail a number of novel features in the capture phase,
during the settling within the star and mass growth of the PBH, and illustrate
some phenomenological consequences. In particular, we point out that in the
subsonic regime the PBH drag takes the form of a Bondi accretion. As a result,
the onset of the final transmutation of the NS into a stellar sized BH is
expected with the PBH seed in slight off-center position. We also compute the
gravitational wave energy-loss and signals associated to different phases of
the PBH-stellar interaction. In particular, the emission associated to the
accretion phase is periodic with a few kHz frequency; in the rare case of a
nearby Galactic event and for light PBH, it could constitute a warning of the
forthcoming transmutation.

consist of beliefs and expectations based on past experience and short-term
memory, such as how the phrase `peanut butter and~...' will be completed. The
optimal combination of bottom-up and top-down information remains an open

bidirectional architecture, mechanisms are needed to restrict information flow.
We explore deep recurrent neural net architectures in which bottom-up and
top-down signals are dynamically combined using attention. Modularity of the
architecture further restricts the sharing and communication of information.
Together, attention and modularity direct information flow, which leads to
reliable performance improvements in perceptual and language tasks, and in
particular improves robustness to distractions and noisy data. We demonstrate
on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, sequential image
classification, video prediction and reinforcement learning that the

an exotic pest is: At what location and date was it first introduced? With this
information, future introductions can be anticipated and perhaps avoided. Point
process models are commonly used for mapping species distribution and disease
occurrence. If the time and location of introductions were known, then point
process models could be used to map and understand the factors that influence
introductions; however, rarely is the process of introduction directly
observed. We propose embedding a point process within hierarchical Bayesian
models commonly used to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of invasion.
Including a point process within a hierarchical Bayesian model enables
inference regarding the location and date of introduction from indirect
observation of the process such as species or disease occurrence records. We
illustrate our approach using disease surveillance data collected to monitor
white-nose syndrome, which is a fungal disease that threatens many North
American species of bats. We use our model and surveillance data to estimate
the location and date that the pathogen was introduced into the United States.
Finally, we compare forecasts from our model to forecasts obtained from
state-of-the-art regression-based statistical and machine learning methods. Our
results show that the pathogen causing white-nose syndrome was most likely
introduced into the United States 4 years prior to the first detection, but
there is a moderate level of uncertainty in this estimate. The location of
introduction could be up to 510 km east of the location of first discovery, but
our results indicate that there is a relatively high probability the location
of first detection could be the location of introduction.

is to rewrite the linear systems as optimization problems and apply momentum

define the coarse-level solvers for multigrid (MG) methods. The resulting MG
cycles, which we call them H-cycle (uses heavy ball method) and N-cycle (uses

similar to the K-cycle, our H- and N-cycle do not require the estimation of
extreme eigenvalues while the computational cost is the same as AMLI-cycle.
Theoretical analysis shows that the momentum accelerated cycles are essentially
special AMLI-cycle methods and, thus, they are uniformly convergent under
standard assumptions. Finally, we present numerical experiments to verify the
theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of H- and N-cycle.

where the learned distribution misses some certain regions of the real data
distribution. To address these two issues, we propose a novel prior that
captures the whole real data distribution for GANs, which are called PriorGANs.
To be specific, we adopt a simple yet elegant Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to
build an explicit probability distribution on the feature level for the whole
real data. By maximizing the probability of generated data, we can push the low
quality samples to high quality. Meanwhile, equipped with the prior, we can
estimate the missing modes in the learned distribution and design a sampling
strategy on the real data to solve the problem. The proposed real data prior

detection (or ``anomaly detection'') methods in machine learning. The data
representation of network traffic often determines the effectiveness of these
models as much as the model itself. The wide range of novel events that network
operators need to detect (e.g., attacks, malware, new applications, changes in
traffic demands) introduces the possibility for a broad range of possible
models and data representations. In each scenario, practitioners must spend
significant effort extracting and engineering features that are most predictive
for that situation or application. While anomaly detection is well-studied in
computer networking, much existing work develops specific models that presume a
particular representation -- often IPFIX/NetFlow. Yet, other representations
may result in higher model accuracy, and the rise of programmable networks now
makes it more practical to explore a broader range of representations. To
facilitate such exploration, we develop a systematic framework, open-source
toolkit, and public Python library that makes it both possible and easy to
extract and generate features from network traffic and perform and end-to-end
evaluation of these representations across most prevalent modern novelty
detection models. We first develop and publicly release an open-source tool, an

Floquet-nonequlibrium Green functions (NEGFs) of irradiated graphene nanoribbon
to compute longitudinal two-terminal conductance, as well as spatial profiles
of local current density as electrons propagate from NM leads into the Floquet
TI. In the case of Floquet TI both bulk and edge local current densities
contribute equally to total current, which leads to longitudinal conductance
below the expected quantized plateau that is slightly reduced by edge
vacancies. We propose two experimental schemes to detect coexistence of bulk
and edge current densities within Floquet TI: (i) drilling a nanopore in the
interior of irradiated region of graphene will induce backscattering of bulk
current density, thereby reducing longitudinal conductance by $\sim 28$%; (ii)
imaging of magnetic field produced by local current density using diamond NV
centers.

We
argue that the inclusion of bra-ket wormholes in the gravity path integral is
not a free choice, but is dictated by the specification of a global state in
the multi-universe Hilbert space. Specifically, the Hartle-Hawking (HH) state
does not contain bra-ket wormholes. It has recently been pointed out that
bra-ket wormholes are needed to avoid potential bags-of-gold and strong
subadditivity paradoxes, suggesting a problem with the HH state. Nevertheless,
in regimes with a single large connected universe, approximate bra-ket
wormholes can emerge by tracing over the unobserved universes. More drastic
possibilities are that the HH state is non-perturbatively gauge equivalent to a
state with bra-ket wormholes, or that the third-quantized Hilbert space is
one-dimensional. Along the way we draw some helpful lessons from the well-known
relation between worldline gravity and Klein-Gordon theory. In particular, the
commutativity of boundary-creating operators, which is necessary for
constructing the alpha states and having a dual ensemble interpretation, is
subtle. For instance, in the worldline gravity example, the Klein-Gordon field
operators do not commute at timelike separation.

luminous, hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_V
\approx -20$ mag that is in between normal core-collapse SNe and superluminous
SNe. These SNe show no prominent spectroscopic signatures of ejecta interacting
with circumstellar material (CSM), and their powering mechanism is debated.
ASASSN-18am declines extremely rapidly for a Type II SN, with a
photospheric-phase decline rate of $\sim6.0~\rm mag~(100 d)^{-1}$. Owing to the
weakening of HI and the appearance of HeI in its later phases, ASASSN-18am is
spectroscopically a Type IIb SN with a partially stripped envelope. However,
its photometric and spectroscopic evolution show significant differences from
typical SNe IIb. Using a radiative diffusion model, we find that the light
curve requires a high synthesised $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass $M_{\rm Ni}
\sim0.4~M_\odot$ and ejecta with high kinetic energy $E_{\rm kin} = (7-10)
\times10^{51} $ erg. Introducing a magnetar central engine still requires
$M_{\rm Ni} \sim0.3~M_\odot$ and $E_{\rm kin}= 3\times10^{51} $ erg. The high
$\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass is consistent with strong iron-group nebular lines in its
spectra, which are also similar to several SNe Ic-BL with high $\rm ^{56}Ni$
yields. The earliest spectrum shows ""flash ionisation"" features, from which we
estimate a mass-loss rate of $ \dot{M}\approx 2\times10^{-4}~\rm
M_\odot~yr^{-1} $. This wind density is too low to power the luminous light
curve by ejecta-CSM interaction. We measure expansion velocities as high as $
17,000 $ km/s for $H_\alpha$, which is remarkably high compared to other SNe
II. We estimate an oxygen core mass of $1.8-3.4$ $M_\odot$ using the [OI]
luminosity measured from a nebular-phase spectrum, implying a progenitor with a
zero-age main sequence mass of $19-26$ $M_\odot$.

temperature decreases with radius. Due to the weakly collisional nature of the
plasma, these regions are susceptible to the magneto-thermal instability (MTI),
which can sustain turbulence and provide turbulent pressure support in the ICM.
This instability arises due to heat conduction directed along the magnetic
field, with a heat conductivity which is normally assumed to be given by the
Spitzer value. Recent numerical studies of the ion mirror and the electron
whistler instability using particle-in-cell codes have shown that microscale
instabilities can lead to a reduced value for the heat conductivity in the ICM.
This could in turn influence the efficiency with which the MTI drives
turbulence. In this paper we investigate the influence of reduced heat
transport on the nonlinear evolution of the MTI. We study plane-parallel,
initially static atmospheres and employ a subgrid model that mimics the
influence of the mirror instability on the heat conductivity. We use this
subgrid model to assess the effect of microscales on the large scale dynamics
of the ICM. We find that the nonlinear saturation of the MTI is surprisingly
robust in our simulations. Over a factor of $\sim 10^3$ in the
thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio and collisionality we find at most modest
changes to the saturation of the MTI with respect to reference simulations
where heat transport is unsuppressed.

to very low-mass companions. In hydrodynamical CE simulations with the
moving-mesh code AREPO, we test whether low-mass objects can successfully
unbind the envelope. The success of envelope removal in our simulations
critically depends on whether or not the ionization energy released by
recombination processes in the expanding material is taken into account. If
this energy is thermalized locally, envelope ejection eventually leading to the
formation of an sdB star is possible with companion masses down to the brown
dwarf range. For even lower companion masses approaching the regime of giant
planets, however, envelope removal becomes increasingly difficult or impossible
to achieve. Our results are consistent with current observational constraints
on companion masses of sdB stars. Based on a semianalytic model, we suggest a
new criterion for the lowest companion mass that is capable of triggering a
dynamical response of the primary star thus potentially facilitating the
ejection of a common envelope. This gives an estimate consistent with the
findings of our hydrodynamical simulations.

may even constitute a significant fraction of cosmological dark matter. Their
existence has yet to be established. However, black holes with masses below
$\sim1~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ cannot form as an endpoint of stellar evolution, so
the detection of even one such object would be a smoking gun for new physics,
and would constitute evidence that at least a fraction of the dark matter
consists of primordial black holes. Gravitational wave detectors are capable of
making a definitive discovery of this kind by detecting mergers of light black
holes. But since the merger rate depends strongly on the shape of the black
hole mass function, it is difficult to determine the potential for discovery or
constraint as a function of the overall abundance of black holes. Here, we
directly maximize and minimize the merger rate to connect observational results
to the actual abundance of observable objects. We show that LIGO can discover
mergers of light primordial black holes within the next decade even if such
black holes constitute only a very small fraction of dark matter. A single
merger event involving such an object would (i) provide conclusive evidence of
new physics, (ii) establish the nature of some fraction of dark matter, and
(iii) probe cosmological history at scales far beyond those observable today.

minimal value. These remnants as all dark matter can satisfy the corresponding
observational constraints provided that both the formation and remnant masses
are relatively small. The parameter space for the remnant mass is probed
through possible remnant mergers that would produce strong fluxes of
high-energy astrophysical particles; the high-energy photon and neutrino data
appear to favor towards the Planck-mass remnants, pointing to the
strong-coupling scenario for the quantum theory of quadratic gravity. The
formation mass, on the other hand, is constrained by the early-universe
cosmology, which turns out to require 2-2-holes to evolve into the remnant
state before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

An extra assumption added and discussed",,"10.1007/JHEP12(2020)198",,"hep-th astro-ph.CO gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Poincar\'e invariance is a well-tested symmetry of nature and sits at the
core of our description of relativistic particles and gravity. At the same
time, in most systems Poincar\'e invariance is not a symmetry of the ground
state and is hence broken spontaneously. This phenomenon is ubiquitous in
cosmology where Lorentz boosts are spontaneously broken by the existence of a
preferred reference frame in which the universe is homogeneous and isotropic.
This motivates us to study scattering amplitudes without requiring invariance
of the interactions under Lorentz boosts. In particular, using on-shell methods
and assuming massless, relativistic and luminal particles of any spin, we show
that the allowed interactions around Minkowski spacetime are severely
constrained by unitarity and locality in the form of consistent factorization.
The existence of an interacting massless spin-2 particle enforces (analytically
continued) three-particle amplitudes to be Lorentz invariant, even those that
do not involve a graviton, such as cubic scalar couplings. We conjecture this
to be true for all n-particle amplitudes. Also, particles of spin S > 2 cannot
self-interact nor can be minimally coupled to gravity, while particles of spin
S > 1 cannot have electric charge. Given the growing evidence that free
gravitons are well described by massless, luminal relativistic particles, our
results imply that cubic graviton interactions in Minkowski must be those of
general relativity up to a unique Lorentz-invariant higher-derivative
correction of mass dimension 9. Finally, we point out that consistent
factorization for massless particles is highly IR sensitive and therefore our
powerful at-space results do not straightforwardly apply to curved spacetime.

known in the mathematics community. In both scenarios, one seeks an optimal
spacetime fill-in of a given closed, connected, spacelike, codimension-two
boundary. We show that for an outer-minimizing mean-convex surface, the
Bartnik-Bray inner mass matches exactly with the irreducible mass corresponding
to the outer entropy. The equivalence implies that the area laws derived from
the outer entropy are mathematically equivalent as the monotonicity property of
the quasilocal mass. It also gives rise to new bounds between entropy and the
gravitational energy, which naturally gives the gravitational counterpart to
Wall's ant conjecture. We also observe that the equality can be achieved in a
conformal flow of metrics, which is structurally similar to the Ceyhan-Faulkner
proof of the ant conjecture. We compute the small sphere limit of the outer
entropy and it is proportional to the bulk stress tensor as one would expect
for a quasilocal mass. Lastly, we discuss some implications of taking quantum

signatures put forward by Bellare-Micciancio-Warinschi (Eurocrypt 2003). As a
proof of concept, we provide a modular construction of TPBS, based on a
signature scheme, an encryption scheme and a zero-knowledge proof system.
Furthermore, to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving TPBS from concrete,
quantum-resistant assumptions, we give an instantiation based on lattices.

Pleiades-like star cluster, due to expulsion of primordial gas in a realistic
gravitational field of the Galaxy. The tidal tails (as well as clusters) are
integrated from their embedded phase for 300 Myr. We vary star formation
efficiencies (SFEs) from 33% to 100% and the timescales of gas expulsion as
free parameters, and provide predictions for the morphology and kinematics of
the evolved tail for each of the models. The resulting tail properties are
intended for comparison with anticipated Gaia observations in order to
constrain the poorly understood early conditions during the gas phase and gas
expulsion. The simulations are performed with the code Nbody6 including a
realistic external gravitational potential of the Galaxy, and an analytical
approximation for the natal gaseous potential. Assuming that the Pleiades
formed with rapid gas expulsion and an SFE of $\approx 30$%, the current
Pleiades are surrounded by a rich tail extending from $\approx 150$ to $\approx
350$ pc from the cluster and containing 0.7 to 2.7 times the number of stars in
the present-day cluster. If the Pleiades formed with an SFE close to 100%, then
the tail is shorter ($\lesssim 90$ pc) and substantially poorer, containing
only $\approx 2$% of the number of present-day cluster stars. If the Pleiades
formed with an SFE of $\approx 30$%, but the gas expulsion was adiabatic, the
tail signatures are indistinguishable from the case of the model with 100% SFE.
The model takes into account the estimated contamination due to the field stars
and the Hyades-Pleiades stream, which constitutes a more limiting factor than
the accuracy of the Gaia measurements.

knowledge of galaxy formation physics. Here we propose an unsupervised deep
learning approach to perform a stringent test of the fine morphological
structure of galaxies coming from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG (TNG100 and
TNG50) simulations against observations from a subsample of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. Our framework is based on PixelCNN, an autoregressive model for
image generation with an explicit likelihood. We adopt a strategy that combines
the output of two PixelCNN networks in a metric that isolates the fine
morphological details of galaxies from the sky background. We are able to
\emph{quantitatively} identify the improvements of IllustrisTNG, particularly
in the high-resolution TNG50 run, over the original Illustris. However, we find
that the fine details of galaxy structure are still different between observed
and simulated galaxies. This difference is driven by small, more spheroidal,
and quenched galaxies which are globally less accurate regardless of resolution
and which have experienced little improvement between the three simulations
explored. We speculate that this disagreement, that is less severe for quenched
disky galaxies, may stem from a still too coarse numerical resolution, which
struggles to properly capture the inner, dense regions of quenched spheroidal
galaxies.

A more detailed look at this rotation-activity relation reveals that, rather
than being a simple power law relation, the activity scaling has a shallower

the chromospheric CaII H&K activity, this scaling relation is well modelled by
a broken two-piece power law. Furthermore, the knee-point of the relation
coincides with the axisymmetry to non-axisymmetry transition seen in both the
spot activity and surface magnetic field configuration of active stars. We
interpret this knee-point as a dynamo transition between dominating axi- and
non-axisymmetric dynamo regimes with a different dependence on rotation and
discuss this hypothesis in the light of current numerical dynamo models.

a binary neutron star (BNS) merger candidate of moderate significance detected
at a distance of 227$\pm$92 Mpc and localized within an area of 31 (1166)
square degrees at 50\% (90\%) confidence. While this event was later classified
as likely non-astrophysical in nature within 30 hours of the event, our short
latency search and discovery pipeline identified 11 counterpart candidates, all
of which appear consistent with supernovae following offline analysis and
spectroscopy by other instruments. Later reprocessing of the images enabled the
recovery of 6 more candidates. Additionally, we implement our candidate
selection procedure on simulated kilonovae and supernovae under DECam observing
conditions (e.g., seeing, exposure time) with the intent of quantifying our
search efficiency and making informed decisions on observing strategy for
future similar events. This is the first BNS counterpart search to employ a
comprehensive simulation-based efficiency study. We find that using the current
follow-up strategy, there would need to be 19 events similar to S190510g for us
to have a 99\% chance of detecting an optical counterpart, assuming a
GW170817-like kilonova. We further conclude that optimization of observing
plans, which should include preference for deeper images over multiple color
information, could result in up to a factor of 1.5 reduction in the total
number of followups needed for discovery.

We use the momentum integrated Boltzmann equation and study their evolution
over the bulk hadronic matter, a condition being similar to the one created at
top RHIC and LHC energies. The cross-sections, which are input to the
equations, are taken either from phenomenological models or parameterized by
comparing against experimental data. From this microscopic calculation we find
that these strange particles freeze-out near transition temperature $\approx
T_c$ due to large relaxation time. The continuous cease of the inelastic
processes due to gradual fall in the temperature and decrease in the number
density, thus lead to early freeze out of strange hadrons $K, \Lambda$ and
$\Sigma$ which happens sequentially near $T_c$. However, freeze-out of these
strange species near Tc appears as a sudden and simultaneous process, which is
mostly predicted by thermal model while explaining the yield of identified
particles at RHIC and LHC energies.

item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However,
they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such
sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive
and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the
United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into
consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel
pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and
emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people
about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51
states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic
characteristics of the people, built environment data, and the number of
COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to
perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors
that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from
the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education
levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher
house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast,
households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to
reopen the economy. The model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments.
The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high
goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers
where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to
improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of
pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.

dichroism. Polarization dependent absorption is shown to occur due to the
combined effect of Rashba splitting, in-plane symmetry breaking, and the effect
of the exciton momentum on its fine structure, which takes the form of Zeeman
splitting in an effective magnetic field. We calculate significant CD with an

advanced rapidly; yet, only a small amount of research has focused on
generative models for irregular structures, particularly meshes. Nonetheless,
mesh generation and synthesis remains a fundamental topic in computer graphics.
In this work, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing geometric textures.
It learns geometric texture statistics from local neighborhoods (i.e., local
triangular patches) of a single reference 3D model. It learns deep features on
the faces of the input triangulation, which is used to subdivide and generate
offsets across multiple scales, without parameterization of the reference or
target mesh. Our network displaces mesh vertices in any direction (i.e., in the
normal and tangential direction), enabling synthesis of geometric textures,
which cannot be expressed by a simple 2D displacement map. Learning and
synthesizing on local geometric patches enables a genus-oblivious framework,
facilitating texture transfer between shapes of different genus.

form based on first principles of continuum mechanics by recasting well-known
relations formulated in local coordinates to a formulation independent of a
parametrization. The field approximation is constructed by restricting shape
functions defined on a structured background grid on the shell surface. As
shape functions we use on a background grid the tensor product of cubic
splines. This yields $C^1$-continuous approximation spaces, which are required
by the governing equations of fourth order. The parametrization-free
formulation allows a natural implementation of the proposed method and
manufactured solutions on arbitrary geometries for code verification. Thus, the
implementation is verified by a convergence analysis where the error is
computed with an exact manufactured solution. Furthermore, benchmark tests are
investigated.

  Games for Detecting Advanced Persistent Threats","15",,,,"math.OC cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy attacks that threaten the
security and privacy of sensitive information. Interactions of APTs with victim
system introduce information flows that are recorded in the system logs.
Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) is a promising detection mechanism for
detecting APTs. DIFT taints information flows originating at system entities
that are susceptible to an attack, tracks the propagation of the tainted flows,
and authenticates the tainted flows at certain system components according to a
pre-defined security policy. Deployment of DIFT to defend against APTs in cyber
systems is limited by the heavy resource and performance overhead associated
with DIFT. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient model for DIFT by
incorporating the security costs, false-positives, and false-negatives
associated with DIFT. Specifically, we develop a game-theoretic framework and
provide an analytical model of DIFT that enables the study of trade-off between
resource efficiency and the effectiveness of detection. Our game model is a
nonzero-sum, infinite-horizon, average reward stochastic game. Our model
incorporates the information asymmetry between players that arises from DIFT's
inability to distinguish malicious flows from benign flows and APT's inability
to know the locations where DIFT performs a security analysis. Additionally,
the game has incomplete information as the transition probabilities
(false-positive and false-negative rates) are unknown. We propose a
multiple-time scale stochastic approximation algorithm to learn an equilibrium
solution of the game. We prove that our algorithm converges to an average
reward Nash equilibrium. We evaluate our proposed model and algorithm on a
real-world ransomware dataset and validate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

problem of inter-region synchronization in networks of Wilson-Cowan/Neural
field equations with homeostatic plasticity, each of which acts as a model for
an isolated brain region. We considered arbitrary connection profiles with only
one constraint: the rows of the connection matrices are all identically
normalized. We found that these systems often synchronize to the solution
obtained from a single, self-coupled neural region. We analyze the stability of
this solution through a straightforward modification of the Master Stability
Function (MSF) approach and found that synchronized solutions lose stability
for connectivity matrices when the second largest positive eigenvalue is
sufficiently large, for values of the global coupling parameter that are not
too large. This result was numerically confirmed for ring systems and lattices
and was also robust to small amounts of heterogeneity in the homeostatic set
points in each node. Finally, we tested this result on connectomes obtained
from 196 subjects over a broad age range (4-85 years) from the Human Connectome

age, indicating an increase in synchronizability that may be related to the
increased prevalence of epilepsy with old age.

present a new innovative theoretical discovery stipulating that if multiple
antenna BS are deployed and moved to higher frequencies, then monotonically
increasing the coverage probability by means of ultra-densification is
possible, and this without lowering the antenna height. Such findings are
completely different from the conclusions in existing works, who suggest to
lower the BS height as to leverage the potential of network densification.
Simulation results substantiate performance trends leveraging network

the transit spectral modeling code METIS, along with Mie theory and several
flexible treatments of aerosol size and spatial distributions to perform
parameter sensitivity studies, calculate transit contribution functions,
compute Jacobians, and retrieve parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The
broader wavelength coverage of JWST will likely encompass enough non-gray
aerosol behavior to recover information about the species and size-distribution
of particles, especially if distinct resonance features arising from the
aerosols are present. Within the JWST wavelength range, the optical and
mid-infrared typically provide information about 0.1-1 $\mu$m sized aerosols,
while the near-infrared to mid-infrared wavelengths usually provide information
about gaseous absorption, even if aerosols are present. Strong gaseous
absorption features in the infrared often remain visible, even when clouds and
hazes are flattening the optical and NIR portion of the spectrum that is
currently observable. For some combinations of aerosol properties, temperature,
and surface gravity, one can make a precise measure of metallicity despite the
presence of aerosols, but more often the retrieved metallicity of a cloudy or
hazy atmosphere has significantly lower precision than for a clear atmosphere
with otherwise similar properties. Future efforts to securely link aerosol
properties to atmospheric metallicity and temperature in a physically motivated

such robustness is that DCNNs develop invariant neural representations that

in the training set could lead to properties different from invariance, e.g.
parts of the network could be specialized to recognize either transformed or

invariance emerges. To do so, we leverage that invariant representations
facilitate robustness to transformations for object categories that are not
seen transformed during training. Our results with state-of-the-art DCNNs
indicate that invariant representations strengthen as the number of transformed
categories in the training set is increased. This is much more prominent with
local transformations such as blurring and high-pass filtering, compared to
geometric transformations such as rotation and thinning, that entail changes in
the spatial arrangement of the object. Our results contribute to a better
understanding of invariant representations in deep learning, and the conditions

MoS$_2$. ZrS$_x$Se$_{2-x}$ alloys oxidize rapidly, and the oxidation rate
increases with Se content. Oxidation of basal surfaces is initiated by
favorable O$_2$ adsorption and proceeds by a mechanism of Zr-O bond switching,
that collapses the van der Waals gaps, and is facilitated by progressive redox
transitions of the chalcogen. The rate-limiting process is the formation and
out-diffusion of SO$_2$. In contrast, MoS$_2$ basal surfaces are stable due to
unfavorable oxygen adsorption. Our results provide insight and quantitative

that enable graph structure and feature representation learning, and have
applications across many domains. For applications critically requiring
interpretation, attention-based GNNs have been leveraged. However, these
approaches either rely on specific model architectures or lack a joint
consideration of graph structure and node features in their interpretation.
Here we present a model-agnostic framework for interpreting important graph
structure and node features, Graph neural networks Including SparSe
inTerpretability (GISST). With any GNN model, GISST combines an attention
mechanism and sparsity regularization to yield an important subgraph and node
feature subset related to any graph-based task. Through a single self-attention
layer, a GISST model learns an importance probability for each node feature and
edge in the input graph. By including these importance probabilities in the
model loss function, the probabilities are optimized end-to-end and tied to the
task-specific performance. Furthermore, GISST sparsifies these importance
probabilities with entropy and L1 regularization to reduce noise in the input
graph topology and node features. Our GISST models achieve superior node
feature and edge explanation precision in synthetic datasets, as compared to
alternative interpretation approaches. Moreover, our GISST models are able to
identify important graph structure in real-world datasets. We demonstrate in
theory that edge feature importance and multiple edge types can be considered
by incorporating them into the GISST edge probability computation. By jointly
accounting for topology, node features, and edge features, GISST inherently
provides simple and relevant interpretations for any GNN models and tasks.

diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) by reducing the number of acquired averages
and denoising the resulting image using a proposed guided denoising
convolutional neural network (DnCNN). Materials and Methods: Raw data from the
prostate DWI scans were retrospectively gathered (between July 2018 and July
2019) from six single-vendor MRI scanners. 118 data sets were used for training
and validation (age: 64.3 +- 8 years) and 37 - for testing (age: 65.1 +- 7.3
years). High b-value diffusion-weighted (hb-DW) data were reconstructed into
noisy images using two averages and reference images using all sixteen
averages. A conventional DnCNN was modified into a guided DnCNN, which uses the
low b-value DWI image as a guidance input. Quantitative and qualitative reader
evaluations were performed on the denoised hb-DW images. A cumulative link
mixed regression model was used to compare the readers scores. The agreement
between the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (denoised vs reference)
was analyzed using Bland Altman analysis. Results: Compared to the DnCNN, the
guided DnCNN produced denoised hb-DW images with higher peak signal-to-noise
ratio and structural similarity index and lower normalized mean square error (p
< 0.001). Compared to the reference images, the denoised images received higher
image quality scores (p < 0.0001). The ADC values based on the denoised hb-DW
images were in good agreement with the reference ADC values. Conclusion:
Accelerating prostate DWI by reducing the number of acquired averages and
denoising the resulting image using the proposed guided DnCNN is technically
feasible.

medicine, which searches for data-driven approaches to improve individual

analyse the usage of functional MRI on both the elucidation of psychiatric
disease biotypes and the interpretation of subtypes obtained via unsupervised
learning applied to symptom or biomarker data. We searched the existing
literature for functional MRI applications to the obtention or interpretation
of psychiatric disease subtypes. The PRISMA guidelines were applied to filter
the retrieved studies, and the active learning framework ASReviews was applied
for article prioritization. From the 20 studies that met the inclusion
criteria, 5 used functional MRI data to interpret symptom-derived disease
clusters, 4 used it for the interpretation of clusters derived from biomarker
data other than fMRI itself, and 11 applied clustering to fMRI directly. Major
depression disorder and schizophrenia were the two most studied pathologies,
followed by ADHD, psychosis, autism disorder, and early violence. No
trans-diagnostic studies were retrieved. While interest in personalised
medicine and data-driven disease subtyping is on the rise and psychiatry is not
the exception, unsupervised analyses of functional MRI data are inconsistent to
date, and much remains to be done in terms of gathering and centralising data,
standardising pipelines and model validation, and method refinement. The usage

application data from the source machine to the destination machine inside
segments, without foreseeing nor allowing for any type of control on the
transmission or success metrics. These protocols are very convenient for e.g.
real time data transmission. But when the reliability of the transmitted data
is critical, other protocols termed as connection-oriented, allow for full
control of the data transmission process, assuring that the received data is an
exact copy of the transmitted data, e.g. the case of the Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP). To sustain the increased functionality and features of the
connection-oriented protocol, a set of mechanisms is implemented based on some
specific fields of the segment header. These mechanisms result in a significant
overhead in terms of the increased number of transmitted packets. This may
further translate into significant delays, because of the additional number of
switching and routing tasks, and eventually, because of more complex
communications procedures, such as e.g. transmission window resizing, and of
course, acknowledgement and sequence numbers updating. The two extremes of
these communication modalities, one that has no control at all, and the other
one that allows for full control, have resulted in the creation of an
intermediate protocol that allows for a limited degree of knowledge on how
successful a transmission was, and even for an eventual reordering of the
segments that arrive out of sequence. This paper presents simulation results
that confirm the efficiency of the new almost-reliable UDP protocol, termed
Keyed User Datagram Protocol (or KUDP) for transmission of data that includes
the ability to identify which packets were lost and to reorder packets that
were received out-of-sequence, and points future tasks to be pursued in this

Chern-Simons term arises from a slow time variation in a pseudoscalar field
with an axion-like electromagnetic coupling, the total energy of the theory is
bounded below. We examine the behavior of such a theory, finding that in a
systematic power series expansion of the magnetic and pseudoscalar fields,
singularities appear in the field profiles. Some of the questionable behavior
can be cured by taking a fully nonperturbative approach, but other problematic
terms remain. This may be an indication that Cerenkov-like radiation will
automatically carry away energy from a moving charge, preventing a charge from
moving with uniform velocity over extended distances.

computer vision, computer security, etc. However, deep learning models are
vulnerable to Adversarial Examples (AEs),carefully crafted samples to deceive
those models. Recent studies have introduced new adversarial attack methods,
but, to the best of our knowledge, none provided guaranteed quality for the
crafted examples as part of their creation, beyond simple quality measures such
as Misclassification Rate (MR). In this paper, we incorporateImage Quality
Assessment (IQA) metrics into the design and generation process of AEs. We
propose an evolutionary-based single- and multi-objective optimization
approaches that generate AEs with high misclassification rate and explicitly
improve the quality, thus indistinguishability, of the samples, while
perturbing only a limited number of pixels. In particular, several IQA metrics,
including edge analysis, Fourier analysis, and feature descriptors, are
leveraged into the process of generating AEs. Unique characteristics of the
evolutionary-based algorithm enable us to simultaneously optimize the
misclassification rate and the IQA metrics of the AEs. In order to evaluate the
performance of the proposed method, we conduct intensive experiments on
different well-known benchmark datasets(MNIST, CIFAR, GTSRB, and Open Image
Dataset V5), while considering various objective optimization configurations.
The results obtained from our experiments, when compared with the exist-ing
attack methods, validate our initial hypothesis that the use ofIQA metrics
within generation process of AEs can substantially improve their quality, while
maintaining high misclassification rate.Finally, transferability and human
perception studies are provided, demonstrating acceptable performance.

how specific intervals of fuel injection quantities can be targeted to maximize
robustness for certain ranges, allowing us to train a virtual sensor for fuel

accounts for the non-stationarity of environments. The dynamic regret attained
by the proposed algorithms interpolates between different regimes of
non-stationarity, and moreover satisfies a notion of adaptive

the presence of noisy annotations. When trained on noisy labels, deep neural
networks have been observed to first fit the training data with clean labels
during an ""early learning"" phase, before eventually memorizing the examples
with false labels. We prove that early learning and memorization are
fundamental phenomena in high-dimensional classification tasks, even in simple
linear models, and give a theoretical explanation in this setting. Motivated by
these findings, we develop a new technique for noisy classification tasks,
which exploits the progress of the early learning phase. In contrast with
existing approaches, which use the model output during early learning to detect
the examples with clean labels, and either ignore or attempt to correct the
false labels, we take a different route and instead capitalize on early
learning via regularization. There are two key elements to our approach. First,
we leverage semi-supervised learning techniques to produce target probabilities
based on the model outputs. Second, we design a regularization term that steers
the model towards these targets, implicitly preventing memorization of the
false labels. The resulting framework is shown to provide robustness to noisy
annotations on several standard benchmarks and real-world datasets, where it
achieves results comparable to the state of the art.

learning and optimization communities recently. These simple methods can
guarantee the generation of sparse solutions. In addition, without the
computation of full gradients, they can handle huge-scale problems sometimes
even with an exponentially increasing number of decision variables. This paper
aims to significantly expand the application areas of these methods by
presenting new conditional gradient methods for solving convex optimization
problems with general affine and nonlinear constraints. More specifically, we
first present a new constraint extrapolated condition gradient (CoexCG) method
that can achieve an ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity for both
smooth and structured nonsmooth function constrained convex optimization. We
further develop novel variants of CoexCG, namely constraint extrapolated and
dual regularized conditional gradient (CoexDurCG) methods, that can achieve
similar iteration complexity to CoexCG but allow adaptive selection for
algorithmic parameters. We illustrate the effectiveness of these methods for
solving an important class of radiation therapy treatment planning problems
arising from healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, all the
algorithmic schemes and their complexity results are new in the area of
projection-free methods.

(ShG) is the $b \rightarrow 1/b$ self-duality of its $S$-matrix, of which there
is no trace in its Lagrangian formulation. Here $b$ is the coupling appearing
in the model's eponymous hyperbolic cosine present in its Lagrangian,
$\cosh(b\phi)$. In this paper we develop truncated spectrum methods (TSMs) for
studying the sinh-Gordon model at a finite volume as we vary the coupling
constant. We obtain the expected results for $b \ll 1$ and intermediate values
of $b$, but as the self-dual point $b=1$ is approached, the basic application
of the TSM to the ShG breaks down. We find that the TSM gives results with a
strong cutoff $E_c$ dependence, which disappears according only to a very slow
power law in $E_c$. Standard renormalization group strategies -- whether they
be numerical or analytic -- also fail to improve upon matters here. We thus
explore three strategies to address the basic limitations of the TSM in the
vicinity of $b=1$. In the first, we focus on the small-volume spectrum. We
attempt to understand how much of the physics of the ShG is encoded in the zero
mode part of its Hamiltonian, in essence how `quantum mechanical' vs `quantum
field theoretic' the problem is. In the second, we identify the divergencies
present in perturbation theory and perform their resummation using a
supra-Borel approximate. In the third approach, we use the exact form factors
of the model to treat the ShG at one value of $b$ as a perturbation of a ShG at
a different coupling. In the light of this work, we argue that the strong
coupling phase $b > 1$ of the Lagrangian formulation of model may be different
from what is na\""ively inferred from its $S$-matrix. In particular, we present
an argument that the theory is massless for $b>1$.

in layered/van der Waals materials when going from 3D to 2D, or vice versa, by
gradually pulling apart the atomic layers in graphite to form graphene. Focus
is placed on identifying the features impacting thermal conductivity that are
likely shared with other layered materials. The thermal conductivity $\kappa$
of graphite is found to be lower than that of graphene mainly due to changes in
the phonon dispersion driven by van der Waals coupling. Specifically, as the
atomic layers are brought closer together, the acoustic flexural phonons in
graphene form low-energy optical flexural phonons in graphite that possess
lower in-plane velocities, density-of-states and phonon occupation, thus
reducing $\kappa$. Similar dispersion changes, and impact on thermal
conductivity, can be expected in other van der Waals materials when
transitioning from 2D to 3D. Our findings also indicate that the selection
rules in graphene, which reduce phonon-phonon scattering and contribute to its
large $\kappa$, effectively hold as the atomic layers are brought together to
form graphite. While the selection rules do not strictly apply to graphite, in
practice similar scattering behavior is displayed due in part to the weak
inter-layer coupling. This suggests that van der Waals materials, in bulk 3D
form, may have lower phonon-phonon scattering rates than other non-layered bulk
materials.

local epidemics in the United States; a broad selection of demographic,
population density, and climate factors; and local mobility data, tracking
social distancing interventions, to determine the key factors driving the
spread and containment of the virus. Assuming first a linear model for the rate
of exponential growth (or decay) in cases/mortality, we find that
population-weighted density, humidity, and median age dominate the dynamics of
growth and decline, once interventions are accounted for. A focus on distinct
metropolitan areas suggests that some locales benefited from the timing of a
nearly simultaneous nationwide shutdown, and/or the regional climate conditions
in mid-March; while others suffered significant outbreaks prior to
intervention. Using a first-principles model of the infection spread, we then
develop predictions for the impact of the relaxation of social distancing and
local climate conditions. A few regions, where a significant fraction of the
population was infected, show evidence that the epidemic has partially resolved
via depletion of the susceptible population (i.e., ""herd immunity""), while most
regions in the United States remain overwhelmingly susceptible. These results
will be important for optimal management of intervention strategies, which can

Boolean networks (\texttt{BNs}). Only by the network structure, the concept of
structural controllability for \texttt{BNs} is formalized. A necessary and
sufficient criterion is derived for the structural controllability of
\texttt{BNs}; it can be verified with $\Theta(n^2)$ time, where $n$ is the
number of network nodes. An interesting conclusion is shown as that a
\texttt{BN} is structurally controllable if and only if it is structurally
fixed-time controllable. Afterwards, the minimum node control problem with
respect to structural controllability is proved to be NP-hard for structural
\texttt{BNs}. In virtue of the structurally controllable criterion, three
difficult control issues can be efficiently addressed and accompanied with some
advantages. In terms of the design of pinning controllers to generate a
controllable \texttt{BN}, by utilizing the structurally controllable criterion,
the selection procedure for the pinning node set is developed for the first
time instead of just checking the controllability under the given pinning
control form; the pinning controller is of distributed form, and the time
complexity is $\Theta(n2^{3d^{\ast}}+2(n+m)^2)$, where $m$ and $d^\ast$ are
respectively the number of generators and the maximum vertex in-degree. With
regard to the control design for stabilization in probability of probabilistic
\texttt{BNs} (\texttt{PBNs}), an important theorem is proved to reveal the
equivalence between several types of stability. The existing difficulties on
the stabilization in probability are then solved to some extent via the
structurally controllable criterion.

the BISTRO data with low- and high- resolution data derived from Planck and
interferometers to study the multiscale magnetic field structure in this
region. The magnetic field morphology drastically changes below a scale of ~1
pc and remains continuous from the scales of filaments (~0.1 pc) to that of
protostellar envelopes (~0.005 pc or ~1000 au). Finally, we construct simple
models in which we assume that the magnetic field is always perpendicular to
the long axis of the filaments. We demonstrate that the observed variation of
the relative orientation between the filament axes and the magnetic field
angles are well reproduced by this model, taking into account the projection
effects of the magnetic field and filaments relative to the plane of the sky.
These projection effects may explain the apparent complexity of the magnetic
field structure observed at the resolution of BISTRO data toward the filament
network.

fully explore the environment. However, reinforcement learning (RL) and
imitation learning (IL), two widely-used policy learning methods, cannot model
rapid phase transitions and are not scalable to fully cover all the states. To
address driving in near-accident scenarios, we propose a hierarchical
reinforcement and imitation learning (H-ReIL) approach that consists of
low-level policies learned by IL for discrete driving modes, and a high-level
policy learned by RL that switches between different driving modes. Our
approach exploits the advantages of both IL and RL by integrating them into a

Analyses of the policies demonstrate our high-level policy appropriately

high-dimensional spaces. To eventually compute the rare event probability, an
original post-sampling step is devised using an inverse importance sampling
procedure based on the already obtained samples. The statistical properties of

extensible about a non-zero natural length with tunable harmonic stiffness, is
one such model which has previously been shown to reproduce bead-rod behaviour
in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions. The force law for the
FENE-Fraenkel spring reduces to the Hookean or FENE spring force law for
appropriately chosen values of the spring parameters. It is consequently
possible to explore the crossover region between the limits of bead-spring and
bead-rod behaviour by varying the parameters suitably. In this study, using a
semi-implicit predictor-corrector Brownian dynamics algorithm, the
FENE-Fraenkel spring is shown to imitate a rod with hydrodynamic interactions
when spring stiffness, extensibility and simulation timestep are chosen
carefully. By relaxing the spring stiffness and extensibility, the
FENE-Fraenkel spring can also reproduce spring-like behaviour, such as a
crossover from $-1/3$ to $-2/3$ power-law scaling in the viscosity with shear
rate, and a change from positive to negative second normal stress difference.

highly dependent on the primary node. All participant nodes in the network are
blocked until they receive a proposal from the primary node to begin the
consensus process.Therefore, an honest but slack node (with limited bandwidth)
can adversely affect the performance when selected as primary. Hermes decreases
protocol dependency on the primary node and minimizes transmission delay
induced by the slack primary while keeping low message complexity and latency.
Hermes achieves these performance improvements by relaxing strong BFT agreement
(safety) guarantees only for a specific type of Byzantine faults (also called
equivocated faults). Interestingly, we show that in Hermes equivocating by a
Byzantine primary is unlikely, expensive and ineffective. Therefore, the safety
of Hermes is comparable to the general BFT consensus. We deployed and tested
Hermes on 190 Amazon EC2 instances. In these tests, Hermes's performance was
comparable to the state-of-the-art BFT protocol for blockchains (when the
network size is large) in the absence of slack nodes. Whereas, in the presence
of slack nodes Hermes out performed the state-of-the-art BFT protocol by more

which has a long tradition in machine learning. The algorithm has a Bayesian
spirit in the sense that it selects arms based on posterior samples of reward
probabilities of each arm. By forging a connection between combinatorial binary
bandits and spike-and-slab variable selection, we propose a stochastic
optimization approach to subset selection called Thompson Variable Selection
(TVS). TVS is a framework for interpretable machine learning which does not
rely on the underlying model to be linear. TVS brings together Bayesian
reinforcement and machine learning in order to extend the reach of Bayesian
subset selection to non-parametric models and large datasets with very many
predictors and/or very many observations. Depending on the choice of a reward,
TVS can be deployed in offline as well as online setups with streaming data
batches. Tailoring multiplay bandits to variable selection, we provide regret
bounds without necessarily assuming that the arm mean rewards be unrelated. We
show a very strong empirical performance on both simulated and real data.
Unlike deterministic optimization methods for spike-and-slab variable
selection, the stochastic nature makes TVS less prone to local convergence and
thereby more robust.

evolving spherically symmetric effective metric, with a transition from trapped
surfaces in the black hole to anti-trapped surfaces in the white hole at a
spacelike hypersurface on which the circumferential radius has a minimum
Planck-scale value. Rather than focusing on a specific model for the effective

general properties of such a transition and the end of the black hole following
from the assumption of a smooth geometry. Alternative scenarios for the
evolution of the white hole, which avoid the prolonged emission of negative

transition, suggested by Loop Quantum Gravity, can be firmly established, the
conventional holographic interpretation of the fine-grained entropy of a black
hole must be abandoned. It would also be a counter-example to the generalized

past interaction history, thus suffering from the limitations of obtaining
fine-grained and dynamic user preference. Conversational recommendation system
(CRS) brings revolutions to those limitations by enabling the system to
directly ask users about their preferred attributes on items. However, existing
CRS methods do not make full use of such advantage -- they only use the
attribute feedback in rather implicit ways such as updating the latent user
representation. In this paper, we propose Conversational Path Reasoning (CPR),
a generic framework that models conversational recommendation as an interactive
path reasoning problem on a graph. It walks through the attribute vertices by
following user feedback, utilizing the user preferred attributes in an explicit
way. By leveraging on the graph structure, CPR is able to prune off many
irrelevant candidate attributes, leading to better chance of hitting user
preferred attributes. To demonstrate how CPR works, we propose a simple yet
effective instantiation named SCPR (Simple CPR). We perform empirical studies
on the multi-round conversational recommendation scenario, the most realistic
CRS setting so far that considers multiple rounds of asking attributes and
recommending items. Through extensive experiments on two datasets Yelp and
LastFM, we validate the effectiveness of our SCPR, which significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art CRS methods EAR (arXiv:2002.09102) and CRM

understanding of galaxy formation and evolution models. However, such
measurements are extremely challenging for quiescent galaxies at high
redshifts, which have faint stellar continua and compact sizes, making it
difficult to detect absorption lines and nearly impossible to spatially resolve
them. Gravitational lensing offers the opportunity to study these galaxies with
detailed spectroscopy that can be spatially resolved. In this work, we analyze
deep spectra of MRG-M0138, a lensed quiescent galaxy at z = 1.98 which is the
brightest of its kind, with an H-band magnitude of 17.1. Taking advantage of
full spectral fitting, we measure $[{\rm Mg/Fe}]=0.51\pm0.05$,
$[\rm{Fe/H}]=0.26\pm0.04$, and, for the first time, the stellar abundances of 6
other elements in this galaxy. We further constrained, also for the first time
in a $z\sim2$ galaxy, radial gradients in stellar age, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe]. We
detect no gradient in age or [Mg/Fe] and a slightly negative gradient in
[Fe/H], which has a slope comparable to that seen in local early-type galaxies.
Our measurements show that not only is MRG-M0138 very Mg-enhanced compared to
the centers of local massive early-type galaxies, it is also very iron rich.

solving large linear inverse problems due to their inherent regularizing
properties as well as the added flexibility to select regularization parameters
adaptively. In this work, we develop Golub-Kahan-based hybrid projection
methods that can exploit compression and recycling techniques in order to solve
a broad class of inverse problems where memory requirements or high
computational cost may otherwise be prohibitive. For problems that have many
unknown parameters and require many iterations, hybrid projection methods with
recycling can be used to compress and recycle the solution basis vectors to
reduce the number of solution basis vectors that must be stored, while
obtaining a solution accuracy that is comparable to that of standard methods.
If reorthogonalization is required, this may also reduce computational cost
substantially. In other scenarios, such as streaming data problems or inverse
problems with multiple datasets, hybrid projection methods with recycling can
be used to efficiently integrate previously computed information for faster and
better reconstruction. Additional benefits of the proposed methods are that
various subspace selection and compression techniques can be incorporated,
standard techniques for automatic regularization parameter selection can be
used, and the methods can be applied multiple times in an iterative fashion.
Theoretical results show that, under reasonable conditions, regularized
solutions for our proposed recycling hybrid method remain close to regularized
solutions for standard hybrid methods and reveal important connections among
the resulting projection matrices. Numerical examples from image processing
show the potential benefits of combining recycling with hybrid projection
methods.

recommender systems in recent years since HIN is capable of characterizing
complex graphs and contains rich semantics. Although the existing approaches
have achieved performance improvement, while practical, they still face the
following problems. On one hand, most existing HIN-based methods rely on
explicit path reachability to leverage path-based semantic relatedness between
users and items, e.g., metapath-based similarities. These methods are hard to
use and integrate since path connections are sparse or noisy, and are often of
different lengths. On the other hand, other graph-based methods aim to learn
effective heterogeneous network representations by compressing node together
with its neighborhood information into single embedding before prediction. This
weakly coupled manner in modeling overlooks the rich interactions among nodes,
which introduces an early summarization issue. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end Neighborhood-based Interaction Model for Recommendation (NIRec) to
address the above problems. Specifically, we first analyze the significance of
learning interactions in HINs and then propose a novel formulation to capture
the interactive patterns between each pair of nodes through their
metapath-guided neighborhoods. Then, to explore complex interactions between
metapaths and deal with the learning complexity on large-scale networks, we
formulate interaction in a convolutional way and learn efficiently with fast
Fourier transform. The extensive experiments on four different types of
heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the performance gains of NIRec comparing with
state-of-the-arts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
providing an efficient neighborhood-based interaction model in the HIN-based

a score function on a space of labels, where graphs are a natural
representation to decompose the total score into a sum of unary (nodes) and
pairwise (edges) scores. Given a generative model with an undirected connected
graph $G$ and true vector of binary labels, it has been previously shown that
when $G$ has good expansion properties, such as complete graphs or $d$-regular
expanders, one can exactly recover the true labels (with high probability and
in polynomial time) from a single noisy observation of each edge and node. We
analyze the previously studied generative model by Globerson et al. (2015)
under a notion of statistical parity. That is, given a fair binary node
labeling, we ask the question whether it is possible to recover the fair
assignment, with high probability and in polynomial time, from single edge and
node observations. We find that, in contrast to the known trade-offs between
fairness and model performance, the addition of the fairness constraint
improves the probability of exact recovery. We effectively explain this
phenomenon and empirically show how graphs with poor expansion properties, such
as grids, are now capable to achieve exact recovery with high probability.
Finally, as a byproduct of our analysis, we provide a tighter
minimum-eigenvalue bound than that of Weyl's inequality.

choose social media as our main data resource and create by far the largest

accumulated discounted dividends paid until ruin. To enhance the practical

reinsurance is considered and transaction costs and taxes are imposed on
dividends, which converts our optimization problem into a mixed
classical-impulse control problem. For the purpose of better mathematical
tractability and neat, explicit solutions of our control problem, instead of
the Cram\'er-Lundberg framework we study its approximated diffusion model with
two thinly dependent classes of insurance businesses. Using a method of
quasi-variational inequalities, we show that the optimal reinsurance follows a
two-dimensional excess-of-loss reinsurance strategy, and, the optimal dividend
strategy turns out to be an impulse dividend strategy with an upper and a lower
barrier, i.e., every thing above the lower barrier is paid as dividends each
time the surplus is above the upper barrier, otherwise no dividends are paid.
Closed-form expression for the value function associated with the optimal
dividend and reinsurance strategy is also given. In addition, some numerical
examples are presented to illustrate the optimality results.

with a small subset of relevant labels from an extremely large set of possible
labels. In addition to the computational burden arising from large number of
training instances, features and labels, problems in XMC are faced with two
statistical challenges, (i) large number of 'tail-labels' -- those which occur
very infrequently, and (ii) missing labels as it is virtually impossible to
manually assign every relevant label to an instance. In this work, we derive an
unbiased estimator for general formulation of loss functions which decompose
over labels, and then infer the forms for commonly used loss functions such as
hinge- and squared-hinge-loss and binary cross-entropy loss. We show that the
derived unbiased estimators, in the form of appropriate weighting factors, can
be easily incorporated in state-of-the-art algorithms for extreme
classification, thereby scaling to datasets with hundreds of thousand labels.
However, empirically, we find a slightly altered version that gives more
relative weight to tail labels to perform even better. We suspect is due to the
label imbalance in the dataset, which is not explicitly addressed by our
theoretically derived estimator. Minimizing the proposed loss functions leads
to significant improvement over existing methods (up to 20% in some cases) on
benchmark datasets in XMC.

uncertainty, used among other things for practical induction in the empirical
sciences. Yet, Popper was emphatic in his rejection of inductive probability
and of the logical probability of hypotheses; furthermore, for him, the degree
of corroboration cannot be a probability. Instead he proposed a deductive
method of testing. In many ways this dialectic tension has many parallels in
statistics, with the Bayesians on logico-inductive side vs the non-Bayesians or
the frequentists on the other side. Simplistically Popper seems to be on the
frequentist side, but recent synthesis on the non-Bayesian side might direct
the Popperian views to a more nuanced destination. Logical probability seems
perfectly suited to measure partial evidence or support, so what can we use if
we are to reject it? For the past 100 years, statisticians have also developed
a related concept called likelihood, which has played a central role in
statistical modelling and inference. Remarkably, this Fisherian concept of
uncertainty is largely unknown or at least severely under-appreciated in
non-statistical literature. As a measure of corroboration, the likelihood
satisfies the Popperian requirement that it is not a probability. Our aim is to
introduce the likelihood and its recent extension via a discussion of two
well-known logical fallacies in order to highlight that its lack of recognition
may have led to unnecessary confusion in our discourse about falsification and
corroboration of hypotheses. We highlight the 100 years of development of
likelihood concepts. The year 2021 will mark the 100-year anniversary of the
likelihood, so with this paper we wish it a long life and increased
appreciation in non-statistical literature.

warming, uncertainties remain large regarding its future position, with most
past work focusing on the zonal-mean ITCZ shifts. Here we use projections from
27 state-of-the-art climate models (CMIP6) to investigate future changes in
ITCZ location as a function of longitude and season, in response to climate
warming. We document a robust zonally opposing response of the ITCZ, with a
northward shift over eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean, and a southward shift
in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean by 2100, for the SSP3-7.0 scenario.
Using a two-dimensional energetics framework, we find that the revealed ITCZ
response is consistent with future changes in the divergent atmospheric energy
transport over the tropics, and sector-mean shifts of the energy flux equator
(EFE). The changes in the EFE appear to be the result of zonally opposing
imbalances in the hemispheric atmospheric heating over the two sectors,
consisting of increases in atmospheric heating over Eurasia and cooling over
the Southern Ocean, which contrast with atmospheric cooling over the North
Atlantic Ocean due to a model-projected weakening of the Atlantic meridional

Despite the ubiquity of rod bundle flows and the decades of experimental and

distribution drift leading to failures during policy execution. One approach to
mitigate this issue is to allow an expert to correct the agent's actions during
task execution, based on the expert's determination that the agent has reached
a `point of no return.' The agent's policy is then retrained using this new
corrective data. This approach alone can enable high-performance agents to be
learned, but at a substantial cost: the expert must vigilantly observe
execution until the policy reaches a specified level of success, and even at
that point, there is no guarantee that the policy will always succeed. To
address these limitations, we present FIRE (Failure Identification to Reduce
Expert Burden in intervention-based learning), a system that can predict when a
running policy will fail, halt its execution, and request a correction from the
expert. Unlike existing approaches that learn only from expert data, our
approach learns from both expert and non-expert data, akin to adversarial
learning. We demonstrate experimentally for a series of challenging
manipulation tasks that our method is able to recognize state-action pairs that
lead to failures. This permits seamless integration into an intervention-based
learning system, where we show an order-of-magnitude gain in sample efficiency
compared with a state-of-the-art inverse reinforcement learning method and
dramatically improved performance over an equivalent amount of data learned
with behavioral cloning.

that unifies the treatment of three different types of endogenous uncertainty,
where decisions, respectively, (i) alter the uncertainty set, (ii) affect the
materialization of uncertain parameters, and (iii) determine the time when the
true values of uncertain parameters are observed. We provide a systematic
analysis of the different types of endogenous uncertainty and highlight the
connection between optimization under endogenous uncertainty and active
learning. We consider decision-dependent polyhedral uncertainty sets and
propose a decision rule approach that incorporates both continuous and binary
recourse, including recourse decisions that affect the uncertainty set. The
proposed method enables the modeling of decision-dependent nonanticipativity
and results in a tractable reformulation of the problem. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approach in computational experiments that cover a range
of applications, including plant redesign, maintenance planning with
inspections, optimizing revision points in capacity planning, and production
scheduling with active parameter estimation. The results show significant
benefits from the proper modeling of endogenous uncertainty and active

disciplines, ranging from the environmental sciences to the health sciences.
Often, the central object of interest in a point process is the underlying
intensity function. Here, we present a general model for the intensity function
of a non-homogeneous Poisson process using measure transport. The model is
built from a flexible bijective mapping that maps from the underlying intensity
function of interest to a simpler reference intensity function. We enforce
bijectivity by modeling the map as a composition of multiple simple bijective
maps, and show that the model exhibits an important approximation property.
Estimation of the flexible mapping is accomplished within an optimization
framework, wherein computations are efficiently done using recent technological
advances in deep learning and a graphics processing unit. Although we find that
intensity function estimates obtained with our method are not necessarily
superior to those obtained using conventional methods, the modeling
representation brings with it other advantages such as facilitated point
process simulation and uncertainty quantification. Modeling point processes in
higher dimensions is also facilitated using our approach. We illustrate the use
of our model on both simulated data, and a real data set containing the
locations of seismic events near Fiji since 1964.

  local Koopman spectrum and properties",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Local Koopman spectral problem is studied to resolve all dynamics for a
nonlinear system. The proposed spectral problem is compatible with the linear
spectral theory for various linear systems, and several properties of local
Koopman spectrums are discovered. Firstly, proliferation rule is discovered for
nonlinear observables and it applies to nonlinear systems recursively.
Secondly, the hierarchy structure of Koopman eigenspace of nonlinear dynamics
is revealed since dynamics can be decomposed into the base and perturbation
parts, where the former can be analyzed analytically or numerically and the
latter is further divided into linear and nonlinear parts. The linear part can
be analyzed by the linear spectrums theory. They are then recursively
proliferated to infinite numbers for the nonlinear part. Thirdly, local Koopman
spectrums and eigenfunctions change continuously and analytically in the whole
manifold under suitable conditions, derived from operator perturbation theory.
Two cases of fluid dynamics are numerically studied. One is the two-dimensional
flow past cylinder at the Hopf-bifurcation near the critical Reynolds number.
Two asymptotic stages, flow systems around an unstable fixed point and a stable
limit cycle were studied separately by the DMD algorithm. The triad-chain and
the lattice distribution of Koopman spectrums confirmed the proliferation rule
and hierarchy structure of Koopman eigenspace. Another example is the
three-dimensional secondary instability of flow past a fixed cylinder, where
the Fourier modes, Floquet modes, and high-order Koopman modes characterizing
the main structure of the flow are discovered.

intermittent excitation and propagation of geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) that
are observed in tokamaks. While many numerical simulations have observed the
phenomena, it is the first theory that reveals the physical mechanism behind
GAM intermittent excitation and propagation. The preceding work is based on the
micro-turbulence associated with toroidal ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode,
and slab-based phenomenological model of zonal flow. When full toroidal effect
are introduced into the system, two branches of zonal flow emerge: the
torus-modified low frequency zonal flow (TLFZF), and GAM, necessitating a
unified exploration of GAM and TLFZF. Indeed, we observe that the transition
(decay) from the caviton to instanton is triggered by a rapid zero-crossing of
radial group velocity of drift wave and is found to be strongly correlated with
the GAM onset. Many features peculiar to intermittent GAMs, observed in real
machines, are thus identified in the numerical experiment. The results will be
displayed in figures and in a movie; first for single central rational surface,
and then with coupled multiple central rational surfaces. The periodic bursting
first shown disappears as being replaced by irregular one, more similar to the
intermittent characteristics observed in GAM experiments.

applications, explainability has emerged as a crucial desideratum for these
models. In many real-world tasks, one of the principal reasons for requiring
explainability is to in turn assess prediction robustness, where predictions
(i.e., class labels) that do not conform to their respective explanations
(e.g., presence or absence of a concept in the input) are deemed to be
unreliable. However, most, if not all, prior methods for checking
explanation-conformity (e.g., LIME, TCAV, saliency maps) require significant
manual intervention, which hinders their large-scale deployability. In this
paper, we propose a robustness-assessment framework, at the core of which is
the idea of using machine-checkable concepts. Our framework defines a large
number of concepts that the DNN explanations could be based on and performs the
explanation-conformity check at test time to assess prediction robustness. Both
steps are executed in an automated manner without requiring any human
intervention and are easily scaled to datasets with a very large number of
classes. Experiments on real-world datasets and human surveys show that our
framework is able to enhance prediction robustness significantly: the
predictions marked to be robust by our framework have significantly higher
accuracy and are more robust to adversarial perturbations.

presence of zonal flow. A long-lived standing wave phase, which we call the
Caviton, and a short-lived traveling wave phase (in radial direction) we call
the Instanton. For drift wave turbulence driven by ion temperature gradient
mode (ITG), these two stages of dynamics were displayed in [Zhang Y Z, Liu Z Y,
Xie T, Mahajan S M and Liu J 2017 Physics of Plasmas 24 122304]. In this paper
we show that the dynamical attributes of ITG turbulence are readily replicated
when the turbulence rotates in the electron direction; our model calculation
deals specifically with the toroidal electron drift waves (EDW) in the
well-known \delta_e model. While the basic calculations are presented in
parallel to the ITG counterpart, more emphasis is laid here on the motion of
Instanton; several abrupt phenomena observed in tokamaks, such as intermittent
excitation of geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) shown in this paper, could be
attributed to the sudden and fast radial motion of Instanton. The calculation
brings out the defining characteristics of the Instanton: it begins as a linear
traveling wave right after the transition. Then, it evolves to a nonlinear
stage with increasing frequency all the way to 20 kHz. The modulation to
Reynolds stress in zonal flow equation will cause resonant excitation to GAM.
The intermittency is shown due to the random phase mixing between multiple
central rational surfaces in the reaction region.

While there are clear advantages to automated human speech classification,

unprotected audio signal processing. In this paper we propose the first
privacy-preserving solution for deep learning-based audio classification that
is provably secure. Our approach, which is based on Secure Multiparty
Computation, allows to classify a speech signal of one party (Alice) with a

passive security, i.e. with semi-honest parties who follow the instructions of
the cryptographic protocols, as well as active security, i.e. with malicious
parties who deviate from the protocols. We evaluate the
efficiency-security-accuracy trade-off of the proposed solution in a use case
for privacy-preserving emotion detection from speech with a convolutional
neural network. In the semi-honest case we can classify a speech signal in
under 0.3 sec; in the malicious case it takes $\sim$1.6 sec. In both cases
there is no leakage of information, and we achieve classification accuracies

transmits quantized and encoded control codewords to a remote actuator through
a wireless channel, and adopt a detailed model of the wireless communication
system, which jointly considers the inter-related communication parameters. We
derive the stability region of the WNCS. If and only if the tuple of the
communication parameters lies in the region, the average cost function, i.e., a
performance metric of the WNCS, is bounded. We further obtain a necessary and
sufficient condition under which the stability region is $n$-bounded, where $n$
is the control codeword blocklength. We also analyze the average cost function
of the WNCS. Such analysis is non-trivial because the finite-bit control-signal
quantizer introduces a non-linear and discontinuous quantization function which
makes the performance analysis very difficult. We derive tight upper and lower
bounds on the average cost function in terms of latency, data rate and
reliability. Our analytical results provide important insights into the design
of the optimal parameters to minimize the average cost within the stability
region.

tracking-by-detection paradigm. It first localizes the objects of interest,
then extracting their individual appearance features to make data association.
The individual features, however, are susceptible to the negative effects as
occlusions, illumination variations and inaccurate detections, thus resulting
in the mismatch in the association inference. In this work, we propose to
handle this problem via making full use of the neighboring information. Our
motivations derive from the observations that people tend to move in a group.
As such, when an individual target's appearance is seriously changed, we can
still identify it with the help of its neighbors. To this end, we first utilize
the spatio-temporal relations produced by the tracking self to efficiently
select suitable neighbors for the targets. Subsequently, we construct neighbor
graph of the target and neighbors then employ the graph convolution networks
(GCN) to learn the graph features. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first time to exploit neighbor cues via GCN in MOT. Finally, we test our
approach on the MOT benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance in

problem across science and engineering whenever experimental interventions are
infeasible or unethical. Increasing data availability over the past decades has
spurred the development of a plethora of causal discovery methods, each
addressing particular challenges of this difficult task. In this paper we focus
on an important challenge that is at the core of time series causal discovery:
regime-dependent causal relations. Often dynamical systems feature transitions
depending on some, often persistent, unobserved background regime, and
different regimes may exhibit different causal relations. Here, we assume a
persistent and discrete regime variable leading to a finite number of regimes
within which we may assume stationary causal relations. To detect
regime-dependent causal relations, we combine the conditional
independence-based PCMCI method with a regime learning optimisation approach.
PCMCI allows for linear and nonlinear, high-dimensional time series causal
discovery. Our method, Regime-PCMCI, is evaluated on a number of numerical
experiments demonstrating that it can distinguish regimes with different causal
directions, time lags, effects and sign of causal links, as well as changes in
the variables' autocorrelation. Further, Regime-PCMCI is employed to
observations of El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation and Indian rainfall,
demonstrating skill also in real-world datasets.

However, it has been observed that the DANs achieve limited improvement on the

algorithm for blind source separation (BSS) in the determined situation (the
number of microphones is greater than or equal to that of source signals).
ILRMA achieves a great separation performance by modeling the power
spectrograms of the source signals via the nonnegative matrix factorization
(NMF). Such a highly developed source model can solve the permutation problem
of the frequency-domain BSS to a large extent, which is the reason for the
excellence of ILRMA. In this paper, we further improve the separation
performance of ILRMA by additionally considering the general structure of
spectrograms, which is called consistency, and hence we call the proposed
method Consistent ILRMA. Since a spectrogram is calculated by an overlapping
window (and a window function induces spectral smearing called main- and
side-lobes), the time-frequency bins depend on each other. In other words, the
time-frequency components are related to each other via the uncertainty
principle. Such co-occurrence among the spectral components can function as an
assistant for solving the permutation problem, which has been demonstrated by a
recent study. On the basis of these facts, we propose an algorithm for
realizing Consistent ILRMA by slightly modifying the original algorithm. Its
performance was extensively evaluated through experiments performed with
various window lengths and shift lengths. The results indicated several
tendencies of the original and proposed ILRMA that include some topics not
fully discussed in the literature. For example, the proposed Consistent ILRMA
tends to outperform the original ILRMA when the window length is sufficiently
long compared to the reverberation time of the mixing system.

The quantum algorithm is composed of two parts: the first is the efficient
creation of the quantum state corresponding to the projected Laplacian matrix,
and the second consists of applying the existing quantum analogue of the

as well as precision and data parameters arising from quantum procedures, and
polylogarithmically on the dimension of the input vectors. Our numerical

is to model them as stochastic processes in which multiple couplings are in
play at the same time. Molecular motors, chemical reaction networks, catalytic
enzymes, and particles exchanging heat with different baths, constitute some
interesting examples of such a modelization. Moreover, they usually operate out
of equilibrium, being characterized by a net production of entropy, which
entails a constrained efficiency. Hitherto, in order to investigate multiple
processes simultaneously driving a system, all theoretical approaches deal with
them independently, at a coarse-grained level, or employing a separation of
time-scales. Here, we explicitly take in consideration the interplay among
time-scales of different processes, and whether or not their own evolution
eventually relaxes toward an equilibrium state in a given sub-space. We propose
a general framework for multiple coupling, from which the well-known formulas
for the entropy production can be derived, depending on the available
information about each single process. Furthermore, when one of the processes
does not equilibrate in its sub-space, even if much faster than all the others,
it introduces a finite correction to the entropy production. We employ our
framework in various simple and pedagogical examples, for which such a
corrective term can be related to a typical scaling of physical quantities in
play.

that run on a blockchain. They cannot be modified once deployed and hence they
bring unique maintenance challenges compared to conventional software.
According to the definition of ISO/IEC 14764, there are four kinds of software
maintenance, i.e., corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive
maintenance. This study aims to answer (i) What kinds of issues will smart
contract developers encounter for corrective, adaptive, perfective, and
preventive maintenance after they are deployed to the Ethereum? (ii) What are
the current maintenance-related methods used for smart contracts? To obtain the
answers to these research questions, we first conducted a systematic literature
review to analyze 131 smart contract related research papers published from
2014 to 2020. Since the Ethereum ecosystem is fast-growing, some results from
previous publications might be out-of-date and there may be a gap between
academia and industry. To address this, we performed an online survey of smart
contract developers on Github to validate our findings and received 165 useful
responses. Based on the survey feedback and literature review, we present the
first empirical study on smart contract maintenance-related concerns. Our study
can help smart contract developers better maintain their smart contract-based

are commonly adopted in the literature. Combining the Robbins' theorem and the
probability generating functional of a Poisson point process, we obtain the
exact moments of a typical $k$-th tier Voronoi area, $k \in \{1,...,K\}$ under
the GA rule. We apply this result in several special cases. For example, we
prove that in multi-tier networks with the GA rule, the mean of $k$-th tier
Voronoi area can exactly be expressed in a closed-form. We also obtain
simplified expressions of its higher-order moments for both average and
instantaneous received power based user association. In single-tier networks
with exponential fading, the later association rule provides closed-form
expression of the second-order moment of a typical Voronoi area. We numerically
evaluate this exact expression and compare it with an approximated result.

weather conditions, but if the weather turns bad, they have problems to achieve
this performance in these conditions. One possibility to obtain more robust and
reliable results in adverse weather conditions is to use video-segmentation
approaches instead of commonly used single-image segmentation methods.
Video-segmentation approaches capture temporal information of the previous
video-frames in addition to current image information, and hence, they are more
robust against disturbances, especially if they occur in only a few frames of
the video-sequence. However, video-segmentation approaches, which are often
based on recurrent neural networks, cannot be applied in real-time applications
anymore, since their recurrent structures in the network are computational
expensive. For instance, the inference time of the LSTM-ICNet, in which
recurrent units are placed at proper positions in the single-segmentation
approach ICNet, increases up to 61 percent compared to the basic ICNet. Hence,
in this work, the LSTM-ICNet is sped up by modifying the recurrent units of the
network so that it becomes real-time capable again. Experiments on different
datasets and various weather conditions show that the inference time can be
decreased by about 23 percent by these modifications, while they achieve
similar performance than the LSTM-ICNet and outperform the single-segmentation
approach enormously in adverse weather conditions.

imperfections in a crystal may result in a sudden breakdown of conductivity
revolutionized our understanding of disordered media. After stimulating decades
of lively studies, Anderson localization has found intriguing applications in
various areas of physics, such mesoscopic physics, strongly-correlated systems,
light localization, cavity quantum electrodynamics, random lasers, and
topological phases of matter. However, a fundamental assumption in Andersons
treatment is that no energy is exchanged with the environment, in contrast to
the common knowledge that every real system is subject to dissipation.
Recently, a growing number of theoretical studies has addressed disordered
media with dissipation. In particular it has been predicted that in such
systems all eigenstates exponentially localize, similar to the original case
without dissipation that Anderson considered. However, in dissipative systems
an eigenstate analysis is insufficient for characterizing the transport
dynamics of wave, in stark contrast to Hermitian systems, where the
localization of all eigenstates necessarily suppresses transport. In our work,
we show in theory and experiment that systems with dissipative disorder allow
for a new type of spatial transport, despite the fact that all eigenstates are
exponentially localized. This Anderson transport is characterized by
super-diffusive spreading and ultra-far spatial jumps between localized states.
We anticipate our findings to mark the starting point towards novel phenomena
in dissipative media, which are subject to general non-Hermitian disorder.

the breakthroughs of deep learning. However, scaling autonomous driving to
low-power systems deployed on dynamic environments poses several challenges
that prevent their adoption. To address them, we propose a closed-loop learning
flow for autonomous driving mini-vehicles that includes the target environment
in-the-loop. We leverage a family of compact and high-throughput tinyCNNs to
control the mini-vehicle, which learn in the target environment by imitating a
computer vision algorithm, i.e., the expert. Thus, the tinyCNNs, having only
access to an on-board fast-rate linear camera, gain robustness to lighting
conditions and improve over time. Further, we leverage GAP8, a parallel
ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, to meet the inference requirements. When running
the family of CNNs, our GAP8's solution outperforms any other implementation on
the STM32L4 and NXP k64f (Cortex-M4), reducing the latency by over 13x and the
energy consummation by 92%.

There is a discontinuous microcanonical spontaneous symmetry breaking

it is accelerated by the restart strategy of microcanonical random walk. We
also propose an unsupervised learning problem on microcanonically sampled

bottlenecks to realize URLLC. In this paper, we focus on predicting the signal
to interference plus noise ratio at the user to enhance the LA. Motivated by
the fact that most of the URLLC use cases with most extreme latency and
reliability requirements are characterized by semi-deterministic traffic, we
propose to exploit the time correlation of the interference to compute useful
statistics needed to predict the interference power in the next transmission.
This prediction is exploited in the LA context to maximize the spectral
efficiency while guaranteeing reliability at an arbitrary level. Numerical
results are compared with state of the art interference prediction techniques

outside a stroked path. Our work fills this gap with a principled theory of

  Guided by our theory, we develop a novel polar stroking method to render
stroked paths robustly with an intuitive way to bound the tessellation error
without needing recursion. Because polar stroking guarantees small uniform
steps in tangent angle, it provides an efficient way to accumulate arc length
along a path for texturing or dashing. While this paper focuses on developing

Using a small electric bias field, we study the subsequent collisional dynamics

stemming from the dense degenerate host gas and the large ion-atom scattering
cross section, allows us to study a regime of frequent collisions of the
impurity within only tens of microseconds. Comparison of our measurements with
stochastic trajectory simulations based on sequential Langevin collisions
indicate diffusive transport properties of the impurity and allows us to
measure its mobility. Furthermore, working with a free and untrapped ion

reduces the throughput of the network. If there are two single band networks,

Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 t LS sample was produced in a
pilot plant at Daya Bay. The optical properties of the new LS in various
compositions were studied by replacing the gadolinium-loaded LS in one
antineutrino detector. The concentrations of the fluor, PPO, and the wavelength
shifter, bis-MSB, were increased in 12 steps from 0.5 g/L and <0.01 mg/L to 4
g/L and 13 mg/L, respectively. The numbers of total detected photoelectrons
suggest that, with the optically purified solvent, the bis-MSB concentration
does not need to be more than 4 mg/L. To bridge the one order of magnitude in
the detector size difference between Daya Bay and JUNO, the Daya Bay data were
used to tune the parameters of a newly developed optical model. Then, the model
and tuned parameters were used in the JUNO simulation. This enabled to
determine the optimal composition for the JUNO LS: purified solvent LAB with
2.5 g/L PPO, and 1 to 4 mg/L bis-MSB.

Energy Model and its relation to quantum computing, for system sizes of $n\leq

multiple approximate solutions to a combinatorial optimization problem when a
known approximate solution is provided as part of the input. We study the
delocalization process induced by the population transfer protocol by observing
the saturation of the Shannon entropy of the time-evolved wavefunction as a
measure of its spread over the system. The scaling of the value of this entropy
at saturation with the volume of the system identifies the three known
dynamical phases of the model. In the non-ergodic extended phase, we observe
that the time necessary for the population transfer to complete follows a
long-tailed distribution. We devise two statistics to quantify how effectively
and uniformly the protocol populates the target energy shell. We find that
population transfer is most effective if the transverse-field parameter
$\Gamma$ is chosen close to the critical point of the Anderson transition of
the model. In order to assess the use of population transfer as a quantum
algorithm we perform a comparison with random search. We detect a ""black box""
advantage in favour of PT, but when the running times of population transfer

radiation treatment (RT) and is increasingly applied in hospital. However, the
synergistic effect of simultaneous thermoradiotherapy is not well understood

better understand this synergy, we propose a theoretical model in which the
thermal enhancement ratio (TER) is explained by the fraction of cells being
radiosensitised by the infliction of sublethal damage through mild HT. Further
damage finally kills the cell or inhibits its proliferation in a non-reversible
process. We suggest the TER to be proportional to the energy invested in the
sensitisation, which is modelled as a simple rate process. Assuming protein
denaturation as the main driver of HT-induced sublethal damage and considering
the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of cellular proteins, the
sensitisation rates were found to depend exponentially on temperature; in
agreement with previous empirical observations. Our predictions well reproduce
experimental data from in-vitro and in-vivo studies, explaining the thermal
modulation of cellular radioresponse for simultaneous thermoradiotherapy.

of the ferromagnetic layer. For thick layers, irreversible switching of the
macroscopic minor loop is observed. The underlying microscopic origin of this
reversal process was studied in detail by high-resolution magnetic force
microscopy, showing that the reversal is triggered by in-plane domain walls
propagating through the ferromagnetic layer. In contrast, thin ferromagnetic
layers show a hysteresis-free reversal, which is nucleation-dominated due to
grain-to-grain variations in magnetic anisotropy of the Co/Ni/Pt multilayer and
an inhomogeneous exchange coupling with the magnetically hard TbFeCo layer, as
confirmed by micromagnetic simulations.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional predictive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) commonly employ
deterministic weight matrices; therefore, their prediction is a point estimate.
Such a deterministic nature in ANNs causes the limitations of using ANNs for
medical diagnosis, law problems, and portfolio management, in which discovering
not only the prediction but also the uncertainty of the prediction is
essentially required. To address such a problem, we propose a predictive
probabilistic neural network model, which corresponds to a different manner of
using the generator in conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that
has been routinely used for conditional sample generation. By reversing the
input and output of ordinary cGAN, the model can be successfully used as a
predictive model; besides, the model is robust against noises since adversarial
training is employed. In addition, to measure the uncertainty of predictions,
we introduce the entropy and relative entropy for regression problems and
classification problems, respectively. The proposed framework is applied to
stock market data and an image classification task. As a result, the proposed
framework shows superior estimation performance, especially on noisy data;
moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework can properly estimate
the uncertainty of predictions.

Li$_{x}$Mn$_2$O$_4$ ($0\leq x\leq2$). Depending on the Li content different
ratios of Mn$^\text{III}$ to Mn$^\text{IV}$ ions are present. In combination
with electron hopping the Jahn-Teller distortions of the Mn$^\text{III}$O$_6$
octahedra can give rise to complex phenomena like structural transitions and
conductance. While for small model systems oxidation and spin states can be
determined using density functional theory (DFT), the investigation of
dynamical phenomena by DFT is too demanding. Previously, we have shown that a
high-dimensional neural network potential can extend molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations of Li$_{x}$Mn$_2$O$_4$ to nanosecond time scales, but these
simulations did not provide information about the electronic structure. Here we
extend the use of neural networks to the prediction of atomic oxidation and
spin states. The resulting high-dimensional neural network is able to predict
the spins of the Mn ions with an error of only 0.03 $\hbar$. We find that the
Mn e$_\text{g}$ electrons are correctly conserved and that the number of
Jahn-Teller distorted Mn$^\text{III}$O$_6$ octahedra is predicted precisely for
different Li loadings. A charge ordering transition is observed between 280 and
300 K, which matches resistivity measurements. Moreover, the activation energy
of the electron hopping conduction above the phase transition is predicted to
be 0.18 eV deviating only 0.02 eV from experiment. This work demonstrates that
machine learning is able to provide an accurate representation of both, the
geometric and the electronic structure dynamics of Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$, on time
and length scales that are not accessible by ab initio MD.

Coarse-graining methods have been extensively used in the past decades in order
to extend the length and time scales accessible by simulation methodologies.
The quantification, though, of induced errors due to the limited availability
of fine-grained data is not yet established. Here, we employ rigorous
statistical methods to deduce guarantees for the optimal coarse models obtained
via approximations of the multi-body potential of mean force, with the relative
entropy, the relative entropy rate minimization, and the force matching
methods. Specifically, we present and apply statistical approaches, such as
bootstrap and jackknife, to infer confidence sets for a limited number of
samples, i.e., molecular configurations. Moreover, we estimate asymptotic
confidence intervals assuming adequate sampling of the phase space. We
demonstrate the need for non-asymptotic methods and quantify confidence sets
through two applications. The first is a two-scale fast/slow diffusion process
projected on the slow process. With this benchmark example, we establish the
methodology for both independent and time-series data. Second, we apply these
uncertainty quantification approaches on a polymeric bulk system. We consider
an atomistic polyethylene melt as the prototype system for developing
coarse-graining tools for macromolecular systems. For this system, we estimate
the coarse-grained force field and present confidence levels with respect to
the number of available microscopic data.

allow the computation of maps of artificial night sky brightness in any
direction of the sky, involving a large number of details from satellite data.
Cinzano et al. (2001a) introduced a method of mapping naked eye star visibility
at the zenith from large areas based on satellite radiance measurements and
Garstang models of the propagation of light pollution. It takes into account
the altitude of each land area from digital elevation data, natural sky
brightness in the chosen sky direction based on the Garstang approach, eye
capability after Garstang and Schaefer, and atmospheric extinction in the
visual photometric band. Here we discuss how to use these methods to obtain
maps of the average number of visible stars when looking at the night sky
hemisphere, finally answering, site by site, the question of how many stars are
visible in the sky. This is not trivial, as the number of stars visible depends
on the limiting magnitude in each direction in the sky, and this depends on sky
brightness in that direction, atmospheric extinction at that zenith distance
and the observer's visual acuity and experience. We present, as an example, a
map of the number of visible stars in Italy to an average observer on clear
nights with a resolution of approximately 1 km.

the spin-orbit coupling, our model has only two kinds of linearly dispersing
modes, which we take to be right-moving spin-up and left-moving spin-down. Both
lattice and continuum models are studied. In the lattice model, we find that a
single Majorana zero energy mode appears at each end of a finite system
provided that the $s$-wave pairing has an extended form, with the
nearest-neighbor pairing being larger than the on-site pairing. We confirm this
both numerically and analytically by calculating the winding number. Next we
study a lattice version of a model with both Schr\""odinger and Dirac-like terms
and find that the model hosts a topological transition between topologically
trivial and non-trivial phases depending on the relative strength of the
Schr\""odinger and Dirac terms. We then study a continuum system consisting of
two $s$-wave superconductors with different phases of the pairing. Remarkably,
we find that the system has a {\it single} Andreev bound state which is
localized at the junction. When the pairing phase difference crosses a multiple
of $2 \pi$, an Andreev bound state touches the top of the superconducting gap
and disappears, and a different state appears from the bottom of the gap. We
also study the AC Josephson effect in such a junction with a voltage bias that
has both a constant $V_0$ and a term which oscillates with a frequency
$\omega$. We find that, in contrast to standard Josephson junctions, Shapiro

However, the observed objects are not many and, in particular, not so many at

interstellar 18O/17O, through observations of C18O and C17O multi-transition
lines toward a large sample of 286 sources (at least one order of magnitude
larger than previous ones), from the Galactic center region to the far outer
Galaxy (~22 kpc). Here we present our observations of J=1-0 lines of C18O and
C17O, with the ARO12m and the IRAM 30m telescope. We detected successfully both
C18O and C17O 1-0 lines for 34 sources among our IRAM30m sample of 50 targets

be a problem either, which was supported by the fact of no systematic variation
between the isotopic ratio and the heliocentric distance, and consistent
measured ratios from two telescopes for most of those detected sources. Our
results, though there are still very few detections made for sources in the

implementations bridging ever longer distances and creating ever higher secure
key rates. Readily deployed glass fiber connections are a natural choice for
distributing the single photons necessary for QKD both in intra- and intercity
links. Any fiber-based implementation however experiences chromatic dispersion
which deteriorates temporal detection precision. This ultimately limits maximum
distance and achievable key rate of such QKD systems. In this work, we address
this limitation to both maximum distance and key rate and present an effective
and easy-to-implement method to overcome chromatic dispersion effects. By
exploiting the entangled photons' frequency correlations, we make use of
nonlocal dispersion compensation to improve the photons' temporal correlations.
Our experiment is the first implementation utilizing the inherently
quantum-mechanical effect of nonlocal dispersion compensation for QKD in this
way. We experimentally show an increase in key rate from 6.1 to 228.3 bits/s
over 6.46 km of telecom fiber. Our approach is extendable to arbitrary fiber
lengths and dispersion values, resulting in substantially increased key rates
and even enabling QKD in the first place where strong dispersion would
otherwise frustrate key extraction at all.

series. An attractive feature of the periodogram is that the expectation of the
periodogram is approximately equal to the underlying spectral density of the
time series. However, this is only an approximation, and it is well known that
the periodogram has a finite sample bias, which can be severe in small samples.
In this paper, we show that the bias arises because of the finite boundary of
observation in one of the discrete Fourier transforms which is used in the
construction of the periodogram. Moreover, we show that by using the best
linear predictors of the time series over the boundary of observation we can
obtain a ""complete periodogram"" that is an unbiased estimator of the spectral
density. In practice, the ""complete periodogram"" cannot be evaluated as the
best linear predictors are unknown. We propose a method for estimating the best

can be represented in terms of the integrated spectral density. We prove that

them, a majority of techniques leverage code coverage information to guide the
prioritization process, with code units being considered individually, and in
isolation. In this paper, we propose a new coverage criterion, code
combinations coverage, that combines the concepts of code coverage and
combination coverage. We apply this coverage criterion to RTCP, as a new
prioritization technique, code combinations coverage based prioritization
(CCCP). We report on empirical studies conducted to compare the testing
effectiveness and efficiency of CCCP with four popular RTCP techniques: total,
additional, adaptive random, and search-based test prioritization. The
experimental results show that even when the lowest combination strength is
assigned, overall, the CCCP fault detection rates are greater than those of the
other four prioritization techniques. The CCCP prioritization costs are also
found to be comparable to the additional test prioritization technique.
Moreover, our results also show that when the combination strength is
increased, CCCP provides higher fault detection rates than the

with finite lifetime appear with avoided crossings because radiating waves from
different modes cannot be completely eliminated. We also show that
unidirectional-BICs are accompanied by avoided crossings due to guided-mode
resonances with different transverse parities in asymmetric photonic lattices.
The Q factor of a unidirectional-BIC is finite, but its radiation power in the
upward or downward direction is significantly smaller than that in the opposite
direction. Our results may be helpful in engineering BICs and avoided crossings
in diverse photonic systems that support leaky modes.

indicators of cancer, diabetes, ischemic stroke, neurodegenerative disorders

traditionally been restricted to millimeter scale depths accessible with
optical microscopy. Optoacoustic imaging has enabled breaking through the
barrier imposed by light diffusion to map functional hemodynamic parameters in
deep-seated vessels, but diffraction and dispersion of ultrasound waves in
heterogeneous living tissues prevents reaching capillary resolution. Herein, we
demonstrate three-dimensional microangiography of deep mouse brain beyond the
acoustic diffraction limit (<20$\mu$m resolution) through the intact scalp and
skull via optoacoustic localization of sparsely-distributed highly absorbing
microparticles. This was enabled by devising 5$\mu$m sized extremely absorbing
dichloromethane microdroplets exhibiting four orders of magnitude higher
optical absorption than red blood cells at near-infrared wavelengths, thus
facilitating in vivo compatibility and single particle sensitivity in the
presence of highly absorbing blood background. Accurate mapping of the blood
flow velocity within microvascular structures was also facilitated by the high
3D frame rate of the optoacoustic tomography system. We further show that the
detected optoacoustic signal intensities from the localized particles may serve
for estimating the light fluence distribution within optically heterogeneous
tissues, a long-standing quantification challenge in biomedical optics. Given
the intrinsic sensitivity of optoacoustics to various functional, metabolic and
molecular events in living tissues, this new approach paves the way for
non-invasive deep-tissue microscopic observations with unrivaled resolution,

psychometric parameters. Most applications used myopic one-step ahead strategy
which only optimizes the immediate utility. The widely held expectation is that
global optimization strategies that explicitly optimize over some horizon can
largely improve the performance of the myopic strategy. With limited studies
that compared myopic and global strategies, the expectation was not challenged
and researchers are still investing heavily to achieve global optimization. Is
that really worthwhile? This paper provides a discouraging answer based on
experimental simulations comparing the performance improvement and computation
burden between global and myopic strategies in parameter estimation of multiple
models. The finding is that the added horizon in global strategies has
negligible contributions to the improvement of optimal global utility other
than the most immediate next steps (of myopic strategy). Mathematical recursion
is derived to prove that the contribution of utility improvement of each added
horizon step diminishes fast as that step moves further into the future.

Reconstruction (PairRec), which is a discrete variational autoencoder based

document and a semantically similar document) into two hash codes, and then
learns to reconstruct the same query document from both of these hash codes
(i.e., pairwise reconstruction). This pairwise reconstruction enables our model
to encode local neighbourhood structures within the hash code directly through

labeled samples to a domain with scarce labeled samples. Prior research has
introduced various open set domain adaptation settings in the literature to
extend the applications of domain adaptation methods in real-world scenarios.
This paper focuses on the type of open set domain adaptation setting where the
target domain has both private ('unknown classes') label space and the shared
('known classes') label space. However, the source domain only has the 'known
classes' label space. Prevalent distribution-matching domain adaptation methods
are inadequate in such a setting that demands adaptation from a smaller source
domain to a larger and diverse target domain with more classes. For addressing
this specific open set domain adaptation setting, prior research introduces a
domain adversarial model that uses a fixed threshold for distinguishing known
from unknown target samples and lacks at handling negative transfers. We extend
their adversarial model and propose a novel adversarial domain adaptation model
with multiple auxiliary classifiers. The proposed multi-classifier structure
introduces a weighting module that evaluates distinctive domain characteristics
for assigning the target samples with weights which are more representative to
whether they are likely to belong to the known and unknown classes to encourage
positive transfers during adversarial training and simultaneously reduces the
domain gap between the shared classes of the source and target domains. A
thorough experimental investigation shows that our proposed method outperforms
existing domain adaptation methods on a number of domain adaptation datasets.

to walk in the presence of disturbances. Until recently this has been achieved
by only optimizing the placement of the footstep, keeping the duration of the
step constant. In this paper we introduce a footstep planner capable of
optimizing footstep placement and timing in real-time by asynchronously
combining two optimizers, which we refer to as asynchronous real-time
optimization (ARTO). The first optimizer which runs at approximately 25 Hz,
utilizes a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to accurately approximate the
dynamics of the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model for bipedal walking, then
uses non-linear optimization to find optimal footsteps and duration at a lower
frequency. The second optimizer that runs at approximately 250 Hz, uses
analytical gradients derived from the full dynamics of the LIP model and
constraint penalty terms to perform gradient descent, which finds approximately
optimal footstep placement and timing at a higher frequency. By combining the
two optimizers asynchronously, ARTO has the benefits of fast reactions to
disturbances from the gradient descent optimizer, accurate solutions that avoid
local optima from the RK4 optimizer, and increases the probability that a
feasible solution will be found from the two optimizers. Experimentally, we
show that ARTO is able to recover from considerably larger pushes and produces
feasible solutions to larger reference velocity changes than a standard
footstep location optimizer, and outperforms using just the RK4 optimizer
alone.

First, we used simulations with galaxies on a grid to determine a revised
signal-to-noise-dependent correction for multiplicative shear measurement bias,
and to quantify the sensitivity of our bias calibration to mismatches of galaxy
or PSF properties between the real data and the simulations. We studied the
impact of increased blending and light contamination from cluster and
foreground galaxies, finding it negligible for $z>0.7$ clusters, whereas there
is an effect at the $\sim 1\%$ level for lower redshift clusters. Finally, we
studied the impact of fainter neighbours and selection bias mimicking the
positions and magnitudes of galaxies in CANDELS data. The initial SExtractor
object detection causes a selection bias of $-0.028 \pm 0.002$, reduced to
$-0.016 \pm 0.002$ by further cuts. We compared our CANDELS-based estimate to a
grid-based analysis, with added clustered galaxies reaching even fainter
magnitudes, yielding a refined estimate of $\sim -0.013$. Our pipeline is
calibrated to an accuracy of $\sim 0.015$, which is fully sufficient for
current and near-future weak lensing studies of high-redshift clusters. As an
application, we used it for a refined analysis of three highly relaxed clusters
from the SPT-SZ survey, including measurements down to $r>200$ kpc. Compared to

composition of low-toxicity elements, stability in air and long charge-carrier
lifetimes. However, most double perovskites, including Cs2AgBiBr6, have wide
bandgaps, which limit photo conversion efficiencies. The bandgap can be reduced
through hallowing with Sb3+, but Sb-rich alloys are difficult to synthesise due
to the high formation energy of Cs2AgSbBr6, which itself has a wide bandgap. We
develop a solution-based route to synthesis phase-pure Cs2Ag(SbxBi1-x)Br6 thin
films, with the mixing parameter x continuous varying over the entire
composition range. We reveal that the mixed alloys (x between 0.5 and 0.9)
demonstrate smaller bandgaps (as low as 2.08 eV) than the pure Sb- (2.18 eV)
and Bi-based (2.25 eV) compounds, with strong deviation from Vegard's law.
Through in-depth computations, we propose that bandgap lowering arises from the
Type II band alignment between Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgSbBr6. The energy mismatch
between the Bi and Sb s and p atomic orbitals, coupled with their non-linear
mixing, results in the alloys adopting a smaller bandgap than the pure
compounds. Our work demonstrates an approach to achieve bandgap reduction and
highlights that bandgap bowing may be found in other double perovskite alloys
by pairing together materials forming a Type II band alignment.

neutrino mixing with the Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrino

considered the measurement of electron antineutrino induced events employing a
single detector which can be placed either at a single position or moved
between near and far positions from the given reactor core. Results extracted
in the later case are independent of the theoretical prediction of the reactor
anti-neutrino spectrum and detector related systematic uncertainties. Our
analysis shows that the results obtained from the measurement carried out at a
combination of the near and far detector positions are improved significantly
at higher $\Delta m^{2}_{41}$ compared to the ones obtained with the
measurement at a single detector position only. It is found that the best
possible combination of near and far detector positions from a 100 MW$_{th}$
power DHRUVA research reactor core are 7 m and 9 m, respectively, for which
ISMRAN set-up can exclude in the range 1.4 $eV^{2} \leq \Delta m^{2}_{41} \leq$
4.0 $eV^{2}$ of reactor antineutrino anomaly region along with the present
best-fit point of active-sterile neutrino oscillation parameters. At those
combinations of detector positions, the ISMRAN set-up can observe the active
sterile neutrino oscillation with a 95$\%$ confidence level provided that
$\sin^{2}2\theta_{14}\geq 0.09$ at $\Delta m^{2}_{41}$ = 1 eV$^{2}$ for an
exposure of 1 ton-yr. The active-sterile neutrino mixing sensitivity can be
improved by about 22\% at the same exposure by placing the detector at near and
far distances of 15 m and 17 m, respectively, from the compact proto-type fast

Methods. We derived abundances of the iron-peak elements cobalt and copper in

obtained using FLAMES-UVES at the ESO Very Large Telescope by our group in
2000-2002, which appears to be the highest quality sample of high-resolution

have derived the abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Mg; the iron-group elements Mn
and Zn; and neutron-capture elements. In the present work we derive abundances
of the iron-peak elements cobalt and copper. We also compute chemodynamical
evolution models to interpret the observed behaviour of these elements as a
function of iron. The sample stars show mean values of [Co/Fe]~0.0 at all
metallicities, and [Cu/Fe]~0.0 for [Fe/H]>-0.8 and decreasing towards lower
metallicities with a behaviour of a secondary element. We conclude that [Co/Fe]
varies in lockstep with [Fe/H], which indicates that it should be produced in
the alpha-rich freezeout mechanism in massive stars. Instead [Cu/Fe] follows
the behaviour of a secondary element towards lower metallicities, indicating
its production in the weak s-process nucleosynthesis in He-burning and later
stages. The chemodynamical models presented here confirm the behaviour of these
two elements (i.e. [Co/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]~constant and [Cu/Fe] decreasing with
decreasing metallicities).

component in model-driven decision support systems for groundwater management.
This paper presents a novel algorithmic approach which fuses Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) and Machine Learning methods to accelerate uncertainty
quantification for groundwater flow models. We formulate the governing
mathematical model as a Bayesian inverse problem, considering model parameters
as a random process with an underlying probability distribution. MCMC allows us
to sample from this distribution, but it comes with some limitations: it can be
prohibitively expensive when dealing with costly likelihood functions,
subsequent samples are often highly correlated, and the standard
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm suffers from the curse of dimensionality. This
paper designs a Metropolis-Hastings proposal which exploits a deep neural
network (DNN) approximation of a groundwater flow model, to significantly
accelerate MCMC sampling. We modify a delayed acceptance (DA) model hierarchy,
whereby proposals are generated by running short subchains using an inexpensive
DNN approximation, resulting in a decorrelation of subsequent fine model
proposals. Using a simple adaptive error model, we estimate and correct the
bias of the DNN approximation with respect to the posterior distribution
on-the-fly. The approach is tested on two synthetic examples; a isotropic
two-dimensional problem, and an anisotropic three-dimensional problem. The
results show that the cost of uncertainty quantification can be reduced by up
to 50% compared to single-level MCMC, depending on the precomputation cost and
accuracy of the employed DNN.

probability of a critical event taking place, described by $P(g(\textbf{X})

real-valued function $g$. In many applications the function $g$ is practically
unknown, as function evaluation involves time consuming numerical simulation or
some other form of experiment that is expensive to perform. The problem we
address in this paper is how to optimally design experiments, in a Bayesian
decision theoretic fashion, when the goal is to estimate the probability
$P(g(\textbf{X}) \leq 0)$ using a minimal amount of resources. As opposed to
existing methods that have been proposed for this purpose, we consider a
general structural reliability model given in hierarchical form. We therefore
introduce a general formulation of the experimental design problem, where we
distinguish between the uncertainty related to the random variable $\textbf{X}$
and any additional epistemic uncertainty that we want to reduce through
experimentation. The effectiveness of a design strategy is evaluated through a
measure of residual uncertainty, and efficient approximation of this quantity
is crucial if we want to apply algorithms that search for an optimal strategy.
The method we propose is based on importance sampling combined with the
unscented transform for epistemic uncertainty propagation. We implement this
for the myopic (one-step look ahead) alternative, and demonstrate the
effectiveness through a series of numerical experiments.

on the isomeric transition between the ground state and the first excited state

of possible temporal variation of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$. The
sensitivity to such a variation can be determined from measurements of the
mean-square charge radius and quadrupole moment of the different isomers.
However, current measurements of the quadrupole moment are yet to achieve an
accuracy high enough to resolve non-zero sensitivity. Here we determine this
sensitivity using existing measurements of the change in the mean-square charge
radius, coupled with the ansatz of constant nuclear density. The enhancement
factor for $\alpha$ variation is $K = -(0.82 \pm 0.25) \times 10^4$. For the
current experimental limit, $\delta\alpha/\alpha \lesssim 10^{-17}$ per year,
the corresponding frequency shift is $\sim\!200$ Hz per year. This shift is six
orders of magnitude larger than the projected accuracy of the nuclear clock,
paving the way for increased accuracy of the determination of $\delta \alpha$
and interaction strength with low-mass scalar dark matter. We verify that the
constant-nuclear-density ansatz is supported by nuclear theory and propose how
to verify it experimentally. We also consider a possible effect of the octupole
deformation on the sensitivity to $\alpha$ variation, and calculate the effects

data from multiple sensors resulting in multi-sensor time series. Existing
neural networks based approaches for such multi-sensor or multivariate time
series modeling assume fixed input dimension or number of sensors. Such
approaches can struggle in the practical setting where different instances of
the same device or equipment such as mobiles, wearables, engines, etc. come
with different combinations of installed sensors. We consider training neural
network models from such multi-sensor time series, where the time series have
varying input dimensionality owing to availability or installation of a
different subset of sensors at each source of time series. We propose a novel
neural network architecture suitable for zero-shot transfer learning allowing
robust inference for multivariate time series with previously unseen
combination of available dimensions or sensors at test time. Such a
combinatorial generalization is achieved by conditioning the layers of a core
neural network-based time series model with a ""conditioning vector"" that
carries information of the available combination of sensors for each time
series. This conditioning vector is obtained by summarizing the set of learned
""sensor embedding vectors"" corresponding to the available sensors in a time
series via a graph neural network. We evaluate the proposed approach on
publicly available activity recognition and equipment prognostics datasets, and
show that the proposed approach allows for better generalization in comparison
to a deep gated recurrent neural network baseline.

because their frequency fluctuations vanish in the linear order of external
field noise (such as Overhauser fields from nuclear spin baths). Therefore, CTs
are useful for quantum technologies. Also, the quadratic dependence of
frequencies on noises makes the CT decoherence an interesting physics problem.
Thus we are motivated to study the decoherence of CTs. We consider noise from
spin baths, which is one of the most relevant mechanisms of qubit decoherence.
Various quantum many-body methods have been developed to study the decoherence
of a central spin in spin baths. In particular, the cluster-correlation
expansion (CCE) systematically accounts for the many-body correlations that
cause the central spin decoherence. However, the CCE can not be
straightforwardly applied to CTs in spin baths, for the expansion may fail to
converge due to the effective long-range interactions resulting from the
quadratic term of the noise (e.g., the second-order interaction mediated by
hyperfine interactions for a nuclear spin bath). In this work, we develop a
modified CCE method to tackle this class of decoherence problems. By
diagonalizing the central spin Hamiltonian for each bath eigenstate of the
hyperfine interaction, we find that the effects of long-range interactions are
absorbed as fluctuations of central spin eigenenergies in the form of
single-spin correlations. We apply the method to two specific systems, namely,
nitrogen vacancy center electron spins in near zero magnetic field and
singlet-triplet transition of two electrons in a double quantum dot. The
numerical simulation shows that the modified CCE converges rapidly for the CTs.

randomized routing policies for reaching a target node t from a source note s
on a weighted directed graph G and (2) defining distance measures between nodes
interpolating between the least cost (based on optimal movements) and the
commute-cost (based on a random walk on G), depending on a temperature
parameter T. To this end, the randomized shortest path formalism (RSP,
[2,99,124]) is rephrased in terms of Tsallis divergence regularization, instead
of Kullback-Leibler divergence. The main consequence of this change is that the
resulting routing policy (local transition probabilities) becomes sparser when
T decreases, therefore inducing a sparse random walk on G converging to the
least-cost directed acyclic graph when T tends to 0. Experimental comparisons
on node clustering and semi-supervised classification tasks show that the
derived dissimilarity measures based on expected routing costs provide
state-of-the-art results. The sparse RSP is therefore a promising model of
movements on a graph, balancing sparse exploitation and exploration in an
optimal way.

been reported without imbalance on the national level. However, the national
SRB could mask the disparity within the country. Given the demographic and
cultural heterogeneities in Nepal, it is crucial to model Nepal SRB on the
subnational level. Prior studies on subnational SRB in Nepal are mostly based
on reporting observed values from surveys and census, and no study has provided
probabilistic projections. We aim to estimate and project SRB for the seven
provinces of Nepal from 1980 to 2050 using a Bayesian modeling approach. We
compiled an extensive database on provincial SRB of Nepal, consisting 2001,
2006, 2011, and 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys and 2011 Census. We
adopted a Bayesian hierarchical time series model to estimate and project the
provincial SRB, with a focus on modelling the potential SRB imbalance. In 2016,
the highest SRB is estimated in Province 5 at 1.102 with a 95% credible
interval (1.044, 1.127) and the lowest SRB is in Province 2 at 1.053 (1.035,
1.109). The SRB imbalance probabilities in all provinces are generally low and
vary from 16% in Province 2 to 81% in Province 5. SRB imbalances are estimated
to have begun at the earliest in 2001 in Province 5 with a 95% credible
interval (1992, 2022) and the latest in 2017 (1998, 2040) in Province 2. We
project SRB in all provinces to begin converging back to the national baseline
in the mid-2030s. Our findings imply that the majority of provinces in Nepal
have low risks of SRB imbalance for the period 1980-2016. However, we identify
a few provinces with higher probabilities of having SRB inflation. The
projected SRB is an important illustration of potential future prenatal sex
discrimination and shows the need to monitor SRB in provinces with higher
possibilities of SRB imbalance.

conjecture that among homogeneous $\mathbb R^k$ actions ($k\ge 2$) on

obtain a partial result towards this conjecture: we show non-existence of
globally hypoelliptic $\mathbb R^2$ actions on homogeneous spaces $G/\Gamma$,

methods of characterizing their joint spectral properties. Measuring the joint
spectral intensity between a photon pair ignores any correlations in spectral
phase which may be responsible for degrading the quality of quantum
interference. A fully phase-sensitive characterization tends to require
significantly more experimental complexity. Here, we investigate the
sensitivity of the frequency-resolved double-pair emission to spectral phase
correlations, in particular to the presence of a simple form of correlated
phase which can be generated by a chirped pump laser pulse. We observe
interference fringes in the four photon coincidences which depend on the
frequencies of all four photons, with a period which depends on the strength of
their correlation. We also show that phase correlations in the JSA induce
spectral intensity correlations between two signal photons, even when the
corresponding idler photons are not detected, and link this correlation pattern
to the purity of a single signal photon. These effects will be useful in
assessing new photon-pair sources for quantum technologies, especially since we
require little additional complexity compared to a joint spectral intensity
measurement - essentially just the ability to detect at least two photons in
each output port.

problem considered in this paper is novel in two ways. First, unlike the
traditional 3D bin packing problem, we assume that the entire set of objects to
be packed is not known a priori. Instead, a fixed number of upcoming objects is
visible to the loading system, and they must be loaded in the order of arrival.
Second, the goal is not to move objects from one point to another via a
feasible path, but to find a location and orientation for each object that
maximises the overall packing efficiency of the bin(s). Finally, the learnt
model is designed to work with problem instances of arbitrary size without

thermal logic and energy conversion devices. In the present work, we
theoretically propose a radiative thermal switch (RTS) composed of a pair of
asymmetric black phosphorus (BP) gratings, with BP nanoribbons periodically
patterned in different directions. The simply mechanical rotation between the
gratings enables substantial modulation of near-field radiative heat transfer,
especially when combined with the use of non-identical parameters, i.e.,
filling factors and electron densities of BP. Among all the cases including
asymmetric BP gratings, symmetric BP gratings, and BP films, we find that the
asymmetric BP gratings possess the most excellent switching performance. The
optimized switching factors can be as high as 90% with the vacuum separation
d=50 nm and higher than 70% even in the far-field regime. The high-performance
switching is basically attributed to the rotatable-tunable matching degree
between the surface characteristics of the two asymmetric gratings. Moreover,
due to the twisting principle, the RTS can work at any temperature, which has
great advantage over the phase change materials-based RTS. The proposed
switching scheme has great significance for the applications in thermal
management and thermal circuits.

(200~ppm) nitrogen concentration. We observed transitions that involve magnetic
sublevels that are split by the hyperfine interaction. Microwaves in the
frequency ranges from 1.3 GHz to 1.6 GHz ($m_S=0\longrightarrow m_S=-1$ NV
transitions) and from 4.1 to 4.6 GHz ($m_S=0\longrightarrow m_S=+1$ NV
transitions) were used.
  To understand the cross-relaxation process in more detail and, as a result,
reproduce measured signals more accurately, a model was developed that
describes the microwave-initiated transitions between hyperfine levels of the
NV center that are undergoing anti-crossing and are strongly mixed in the
applied magnetic field. Additionally, we simulated the extent to which the
microwave radiation used to induce ODMR in the NV center also induced
transitions in the substitutional nitrogen via cross-relaxation.
  The improved understanding of the NV processes in the presence of a magnetic
field will be useful for designing NV-diamond-based devices for a wide range of
applications from implementation of q-bits to hyperpolarization of large
molecules to various quantum technological applications such as field sensors.

with the system mass of $2.5\, M_\odot$, and subsequent nucleosynthesis by
performing general-relativistic, neutrino-radiation viscous-hydrodynamics
simulations in axial symmetry. We find that the merger remnants are long-lived
massive NSs surviving more than several seconds, irrespective of the nuclear
equations of state (EOSs) adopted. The ejecta masses of our fiducial models are
$\sim 0.06$-$0.1\, M_\odot$ (depending on the EOS), being $\sim 30\%$ of the
initial disk masses ($\sim 0.15$-$0.3\, M_\odot$). Post-processing
nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that the ejecta is composed mainly of
light $r$-process nuclei with small amounts of lanthanides (mass fraction $\sim
0.002$-$0.004$) and heavier species due to the modest average electron fraction
($\sim 0.32$-$0.34$) for a reasonable value of the viscous coefficient. Such
abundance distributions are incompatible with the solar $r$-process-like
abundance patterns found in all measured $r$-process-enhanced metal-poor stars.
Therefore, low-mass binary NS mergers should be rare. If such low-mass NS
mergers occur, their electromagnetic counterparts, kilonovae, will be
characterized by an early bright blue emission because of the large ejecta mass
as well as the small lanthanide fraction. We also show, however, that if the
effective turbulent viscosity is very high, or there is an efficient mass
ejection working in the early post-merger phase, the electron fraction of the
ejecta could be low enough that the solar $r$-process-like abundance pattern is
reproduced and the lanthanide fraction becomes so high that the kilonova would
be characterized by early bright blue and late bright red emissions.

studies seem to indicate an anomalous chemical pattern of the youngest stellar
population in the solar vicinity with a sub-solar metal content. This can
influence various observational relations linking the properties of exoplanets
to the characteristics of the host stars, for example the giant
planet-metallicity relation. In this framework, we aim to expand our knowledge
of the chemical composition of intermediate-age stars and understand whether
these peculiarities are real or related to spectroscopic analysis techniques.
We analysed high-resolution optical and near-infrared GIARPS spectra of
intermediate-age stars (< 700Myr). To overcome issues related to the young ages
of the stars, we applied a new spectroscopic method that uses titanium lines to
derive the atmospheric parameters, in particular surface gravities and
microturbulence velocity parameter. We also derived abundances of 14 different
atomic species. The lack of systematic trends between elemental abundances and
effective temperatures validates our method. However, we observed that the
coolest (<5400 K) stars in the sample, display higher abundances for the Cr II,
and for high-excitation potential C I lines. We found a positive correlation
between the higher abundances measured of C I and Cr II and the activity index
logR$_{HK}$. Instead, we found no correlations between the C abundances
obtained from CH molecular band at 4300\AA, and both effective temperatures and
activity. Thus, we suggest that these are better estimates for C abundances in
young and cool stars. Finally, we found an indication of an increasing
abundance ratio [X/H] with the condensation temperature for HD167389,
indicating possible episodes of planet engulfment.

observation by examining three illustrative regimes: the bare ionic, density
tight-binding, and density nearly-free electron models. For the bare ionic

explain this phenomenon as a natural consequence of Poisson's law. In the

electrons stabilizes all major crystal structures at harmonic order and we
construct a phase diagram of preferred structures with respect to core and
valence electron radii. In the density nearly-free electron model, we verify
that the inclusion of delocalized electrons, in the form of a background

desirable properties uncommon in optical forces, such as the ability to produce
it via wide-area illumination of vast numbers of particles without the need for
focusing, or being dynamically switchable via the polarization of light.
Unfortunately, these recoil forces are usually very weak and have not been
experimentally observed in small dipolar particles. Some works theoretically
demonstrate orders-of-magnitude enhancement of these forces via complex

the fabrication and experimental demonstration. In this work, we theoretically
and numerically show enhancement of the lateral recoil force by simply using
thin metallic films, which support ultra-high-momentum plasmonic modes. The
high-momentum carried by these modes impart a correspondingly large recoil

of learning experiences and remember the essential concepts without forgetting
what they have learned previously. Artificial neural networks struggle to learn
similarly. They often rely on data rigorously preprocessed to learn solutions
to specific problems such as classification or regression. In particular, they
forget their past learning experiences if trained on new ones. Therefore,
artificial neural networks are often inept to deal with real-life settings such
as an autonomous-robot that has to learn on-line to adapt to new situations and
overcome new problems without forgetting its past learning-experiences.
Continual learning (CL) is a branch of machine learning addressing this type of
problem. Continual algorithms are designed to accumulate and improve knowledge
in a curriculum of learning-experiences without forgetting. In this thesis, we
propose to explore continual algorithms with replay processes. Replay processes
gather together rehearsal methods and generative replay methods. Generative
Replay consists of regenerating past learning experiences with a generative
model to remember them. Rehearsal consists of saving a core-set of samples from
past learning experiences to rehearse them later. The replay processes make
possible a compromise between optimizing the current learning objective and the
past ones enabling learning without forgetting in sequences of tasks settings.
We show that they are very promising methods for continual learning. Notably,
they enable the re-evaluation of past data with new knowledge and the
confrontation of data from different learning-experiences. We demonstrate their
ability to learn continually through unsupervised learning, supervised learning
and reinforcement learning tasks.

during radiotherapy. To this extent, we introduce low-rank MR-MOTUS, a
framework to retrospectively reconstruct time-resolved non-rigid 3D+t
motion-fields from a single low-resolution reference image and prospectively
undersampled k-space data acquired during motion. Low-rank MR-MOTUS exploits
spatio-temporal correlations in internal body motion with a low-rank motion

reference image and k-space data. The low-rank model reduces the
degrees-of-freedom, memory consumption and reconstruction times by assuming a
factorization of space-time motion-fields in spatial and temporal components.
Low-rank MR-MOTUS was employed to estimate motion in 2D/3D abdominothoracic
scans and 3D head scans. Data were acquired using golden-ratio radial readouts.
Reconstructed 2D and 3D respiratory motion-fields were respectively validated
against time-resolved and respiratory-resolved image reconstructions, and the
head motion against static image reconstructions from fully-sampled data
acquired right before and right after the motion. Results show that 2D+t
respiratory motion can be estimated retrospectively at 40.8
motion-fields-per-second, 3D+t respiratory motion at 7.6
motion-fields-per-second and 3D+t head-neck motion at 9.3

attachment in an email, or in a text message. Phishing is often launched via
email messages or text messages over social networks. Previous research has

Identifying the techniques which are used by phishers to mimic a phishing URL
is rather a challenging issue. At present, we have limited knowledge and
understanding of how cybercriminals attempt to mimic URLs with the same look
and feel of the legitimate ones, to entice people into clicking links.
Therefore, this paper investigates the feature selection of phishing URLs

phishers to mimic URLs that can obviously trick people into clicking links. We
employed an Information Gain (IG) and Chi-Squared feature selection methods in

results revealed that there were 10 techniques that phishers used to mimic URLs
to manipulate humans into clicking links. Identifying these phishing URL
manipulation techniques would certainly help to educate individuals and
organisations and keep them safe from phishing attacks. In addition, the
findings of this research will also help develop anti-phishing tools, framework

6,400 image pair comparisons to derive the proposed solution. We use the user
study results to predict this lower bound reliably with a 1.6% mean squared

velocity-selective optical pumping and one EIT resonance. The Zeeman splitting
of the EIT line in magnetic fields up to 12 Gauss is investigated. One Zeeman
component is free of the first-order shift and its second-order shift agrees
well with theory. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of this
magnetic-field-insensitive EIT resonance is reduced due to Doppler narrowing,
scales linearly in Rabi frequency over the range studied, and reaches about
100~kHz at the lowest powers. These observations agree with an analytic model
for a Doppler-broadened medium developed in Ref.
\cite{PhysRevA.66.013805,7653385}. Numerical simulation using the Lindblad
equation reveals that the transverse laser intensity distribution and two
$\Lambda$-EIT systems must be included to fully account for the measured line
width and line shape of the signals. Ground-state decoherence, caused by
effects that include residual optical frequency fluctuations, atom-wall and
trace-gas collisions, is discussed.

to extensive ground-based observations, providing a large number of radial
velocity (RV) measurements. In this work we use the new TESS photometric
observations to characterize the star $\lambda^2$ Fornacis, and following this
to update the parameters of the orbiting planet $\lambda^2$ For b. We measure
the p-mode oscillation frequencies in $\lambda^2$ For, and in combination with
non-seismic parameters estimate the stellar fundamental properties using
stellar models. Using the revised stellar properties and a time series of
archival RV data from the UCLES, HIRES and HARPS instruments spanning almost 20
years, we refit the orbit of $\lambda^2$ For b and search the RV residuals for
remaining variability. We find that $\lambda^2$ For has a mass of
$1.16\pm0.03$M$_\odot$ and a radius of $1.63\pm0.04$R$_\odot$, with an age of
$6.3\pm0.9$Gyr. This and the updated RV measurements suggest a mass of
$\lambda^2$ For b of $16.8^{+1.2}_{-1.3}$M$_\oplus$, which is $\sim5$M$_\oplus$
less than literature estimates. We also detect a periodicity at 33 days in the
RV measurements, which is likely due to the rotation of the host star. While
previous literature estimates of the properties of $\lambda^2$ are ambiguous,
the asteroseismic measurements place the star firmly at the early stage of its
subgiant evolutionary phase. Typically only short time series of photometric
data are available from TESS, but by using asteroseismology it is still
possible to provide tight constraints on the properties of bright stars that
until now have only been observed from the ground. This prompts a reexamination
of archival RV data from the past few decades to update the characteristics of
the planet hosting systems observed by TESS for which asteroseismology is
possible.

MMT, the lattice parameters show distinct anomalies; however, without any

in magnetic and thermal measurements, which suggest a strong coupling between
the electronic, magnetic and structural degrees of freedom in these nickelates.
Analysis of thermal expansion yields hydrostatic pressure dependence of MMT in
close agreement with experiments. We show that the 9-fold coordinated Pr ions
in the rocksalt (RS) layers have a crystal field (CF) split doublet ground
state with possible antiferromagnetic ordering at 5 K. The Pr ions located in
the perovskite block (PB) layers with 12-fold coordination, however, exhibit a
non-magnetic singlet ground state. The CF ground state of Nd in both RS and PB
layers is a Kramers doublet. Heat capacity of R = Nd shows a Schottky-like
anomaly near35 K, and an upturn below T = 10 K suggesting the presence of
short-range correlations between the Nd moments. However, no signs of
long-range ordering could be found down to 2 K despite a sizeable theta_p ~ -40
K. The strongly suppressed magnetic long-range ordering in both R = Pr and Nd
suggests the presence of strong magnetic frustration in these compounds. The
low-temperature resistivity shows a T^0.5 dependence. No evidence for the heavy

available during the system design and development phase, is a critical goal
for intelligent systems. A typical way to achieve good generalization is to
learn a model from vast data. In the context of heuristic search, such a
paradigm could be implemented as configuring the parameters of a parallel
algorithm portfolio (PAP) based on a set of training problem instances, which
is often referred to as PAP construction. However, compared to traditional
machine learning, PAP construction often suffers from the lack of training
instances, and the obtained PAPs may fail to generalize well. This paper
proposes a novel competitive co-evolution scheme, named Co-Evolution of
Parameterized Search (CEPS), as a remedy to this challenge. By co-evolving a
configuration population and an instance population, CEPS is capable of
obtaining generalizable PAPs with few training instances. The advantage of CEPS
in improving generalization is analytically shown in this paper. Two concrete
algorithms, namely CEPS-TSP and CEPS-VRPSPDTW, are presented for the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous
Pickup-Delivery and Time Windows (VRPSPDTW), respectively. Experimental results
show that CEPS has led to better generalization, and even managed to find new
best-known solutions for some instances.

given formulae $\phi, \psi_1, \ldots, \psi_n$, is every model of $\phi$ a model
of some $\psi_i$? is 2EXPTIME-complete. The formulae in this class are
existentially quantified separating conjunctions involving predicate atoms,
interpreted by the least sets of store-heap structures that satisfy a set of
inductive rules, which is also part of the input to the entailment problem.
Previous work consider established sets of rules, meaning that every
existentially quantified variable in a rule must eventually be bound to an
allocated location, i.e. from the domain of the heap. In particular, this
guarantees that each structure has treewidth bounded by the size of the largest
rule in the set. In contrast, here we show that establishment, although
sufficient for decidability (alongside two other natural conditions), is not
necessary, by providing a condition, called equational restrictedness, which
applies syntactically to (dis-)equalities. The entailment problem is more
general in this case, because equationally restricted rules define richer
classes of structures, of unbounded treewidth. In this paper we show that (1)
every established set of rules can be converted into an equationally restricted
one and (2) the entailment problem is 2EXPTIME-complete in the latter case,
thus matching the complexity of entailments for established sets of rules.

building can become slow or even dangerous without a working evacuation plan.
The use of rescue guides that lead the crowd out of the building can improve
the evacuation efficiency. An important issue is how to choose the number,
positions, and exit assignments of these guides to minimize the evacuation time
of the crowd. Here, we model the evacuating crowd as a multi-agent system with
the social force model and simple interaction rules for guides and their
followers. We formulate the problem of minimizing the evacuation time using
rescue guides as a stochastic control problem. Then, we solve it with a
procedure combining numerical simulation and a genetic algorithm (GA). The GA
iteratively searches for the optimal evacuation plan, while numerical
simulations evaluate the evacuation time of the plans. We apply the procedure
on a test case and on an evacuation of a fictional conference building. The
procedure is able to solve the number of guides, their initial positions and
exit assignments in a single although complicated optimization. The attained
results show that the procedure converges to an optimal evacuation plan, which
minimizes the evacuation time and mitigates congestion and the effect of random
deviations in agents' motion.

utilization of different threshold-based labeling strategies (e.g., if ten or
more scanners deem an app malicious, it is considered malicious). While some of
the utilized thresholds may be able to accurately approximate the ground truths
of apps, the fact that VirusTotal changes the set and versions of the scanners

Maat, that tackles these issues of standardization and sustainability by
automatically generating a Machine Learning (ML)-based labeling scheme, which
outperforms threshold-based labeling strategies. Using the VirusTotal scan
reports of 53K Android apps that span one year, we evaluated the applicability
of Maat's ML-based labeling strategies by comparing their performance against

the unified framework for the scale-dependent dynamics of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)

dependence of RTI evolution on the acceleration parameters and the initial
conditions. For the late-time nonlinear dynamics, we find a continuous family
of asymptotic solutions, directly link the interface velocity to the interface
morphology and the interfacial shear, derive solutions for the regular bubbles
and for the singular spikes, and study stability of these solutions. The
properties of special nonlinear solutions in the RT family are scrupulously
described, including the critical, the Taylor, the Layzer-drag, and the Atwood
solutions. It is shown that the fastest Atwood bubble is regular and stable,
and the fastest Atwood spike is singular and unstable. The essentially
multi-scale and interfacial character of RT dynamics is demonstrated. The
former can be understood by viewing RT coherent structure of bubbles and spikes
as a standing wave with the growing amplitude. The latter implies that RT flow
has effectively no motion of the fluids away from the interface and has intense
motion of the fluids near the interface, with shear-driven vortical structures
appearing at the interface. Our theory agrees with available observations, and

$f(X):=\tilde{f}(X)\bmod p$ factorizes into $n$ distinct linear factors over
$\mathbb{F}_p$. We study the problem of deterministically factoring $f(X)$ over
$\mathbb{F}_p$ given $\tilde{f}(X)$. Under the generalized Riemann hypothesis
(GRH), we give an improved deterministic algorithm that computes the complete
factorization of $f(X)$ in the case that the Galois group of $\tilde{f}(X)$ is
(permutation isomorphic to) a linear group $G\leq \mathrm{GL}(V)$ on the set
$S$ of roots of $\tilde{f}(X)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space
over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ and $S$ is identified with a subset of $V$. In
particular, when $|S|=|V|^{\Omega(1)}$, the algorithm runs in time polynomial
in $n^{\log n/(\log\log\log\log n)^{1/3}}$ and the size of the input, improving
Evdokimov's algorithm. Our result also applies to a general Galois group $G$
when combined with a recent algorithm of the author.
  To prove our main result, we introduce a family of objects called linear
$m$-schemes and reduce the problem of factoring $f(X)$ to a combinatorial
problem about these objects. We then apply techniques from additive
combinatorics to obtain an improved bound. Our techniques may be of independent
interest.

understanding at the fundamental level is still an open question in physics.
For instance, time in quantum mechanics and general relativity are two distinct
and incompatible entities. While relativity deals with events (points in
spacetime), with time being observer-dependent and dynamical, quantum mechanics
describes physical systems by treating time as an independent parameter. To
resolve this conflict, in this work, we extend the classical concept of an
event to the quantum domain by defining an event as a transfer of information
between physical systems. Then, by describing the universe from the perspective
of a certain observer, we introduce quantum states of events with
space-time-symmetric wave functions that predict the joint probability
distribution of a measurement (observation) at $ (t, {\vec x}) $. Under these
circumstances, we propose that a well-defined instant of time, like any other
observable, arises from a single event, thus being an observer-dependent
property. As a result, a counterfactual asymmetry along a particular sequence
of events within a stationary quantum state gives rise to the flow of time as
being successive ""snapshots"" from the observer's perspective. In this proposal,
it is the many distinguishable states in which the observer stores information
that makes the existence of time possible.

operations research. In this paper, we introduce the \emph{regularized online
allocation problem}, a variant that includes a non-linear regularizer acting on
the total resource consumption. In this problem, requests repeatedly arrive
over time and, for each request, a decision maker needs to take an action that
generates a reward and consumes resources. The objective is to simultaneously
maximize additively separable rewards and the value of a non-separable
regularizer subject to the resource constraints. Our primary motivation is
allowing decision makers to trade off separable objectives such as the economic
efficiency of an allocation with ancillary, non-separable objectives such as
the fairness or equity of an allocation. We design an algorithm that is simple,
fast, and attains good performance with both stochastic i.i.d.~and adversarial
inputs. In particular, our algorithm is asymptotically optimal under stochastic
i.i.d. input models and attains a fixed competitive ratio that depends on the
regularizer when the input is adversarial. Furthermore, the algorithm and
analysis do not require convexity or concavity of the reward function and the
consumption function, which allows more model flexibility. Numerical
experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and of
regularization in an internet advertising application.

images, is an essential issue in computer vision. However, in practical
scenarios, new categories that are different from the categories in training
usually appear. Since it is impractical to collect labeled data for all
categories, how to conduct zero-shot learning in semantic segmentation
establishes an important problem. Although the attribute embedding of
categories can promote effective knowledge transfer across different
categories, the prediction of segmentation network reveals obvious bias to seen
categories. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-implement transductive
approach to alleviate the prediction bias in zero-shot semantic segmentation.
Our method assumes that both the source images with full pixel-level labels and
unlabeled target images are available during training. To be specific, the
source images are used to learn the relationship between visual images and
semantic embeddings, while the target images are used to alleviate the
prediction bias towards seen categories. We conduct comprehensive experiments
on diverse split s of the PASCAL dataset. The experimental results clearly
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

gas-liquid phase transitions, except that the steady state exhibits microphase
separation into polar clusters. While these features have been observed in
theoretical models and experiments, little is known about the underlying
mesoscopic processes at the cluster level. Here we show that emergence and
maintenance of polar order are governed by the interplay between the assembly
and disassembly dynamics of clusters with varying size and degree of polar
order. Using agent-based simulations of propelled filaments in a parameter
regime relevant for actomyosin motility assays, we monitor the temporal
evolution of cluster statistics and the transport processes of filaments
between clusters. We find that, over a broad parameter range, the emergence of
order is determined by nucleation and growth of polar clusters, where the
nucleation threshold depends not only on the cluster size but also on its polar
moment. Growth involves cluster self-replication, and polar order is
established by cluster growth and fragmentation. Maintenance of the
microphase-separated, polar-ordered state results from a cyclic dynamics in
cluster size and order, driven by an interplay between cluster nucleation,
coagulation, fragmentation and evaporation of single filaments. These findings
are corroborated by a kinetic model for the cluster dynamics that includes
these elementary cluster-level processes. It consistently reproduces the
cluster statistics as well as the cyclic turnover from disordered to ordered
clusters and back. Such cyclic kinetic processes could represent a general
mechanism for the maintenance of order in active matter systems.

state-of-the-art scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to discover
unusual electronic coupling to flat-band phonons in a layered kagome

resolution and observe the striking bosonic mode interacting with dispersive
kagome electrons near the Fermi surface. At this mode energy, the fermionic
quasi-particle dispersion exhibits a pronounced renormalization, signaling a
giant coupling to bosons. Through a combination of self-energy analysis,
first-principles calculation, and a lattice vibration model, we present
evidence that this mode arises from the geometrically frustrated phonon

typically formed by a combination of indicators that are thought to relate to

conceptualizations of the relation between the indicators and what is sometimes
conceived of as a univariate latent variable supposed to correspond in some way
to the construct. It is argued that the empirical implications of reflective
and formative models will often be violated by data since the causally relevant
constituents will generally be multivariate, not univariate. These empirical
implications can be formally tested but factor analysis is not adequate to do
so. It is argued that formative models misconstrue the relationship between the
constructed measures and the underlying reality by which causal processes
operate, but that reflective models misconstrue the nature of the underlying
reality itself by typically presuming that the constituents of it that are
causally efficacious are unidimensional. The ensuing problems arising from
these misconstruals are discussed. A causal interpretation is proposed of
associations between constructed measures and various outcomes that is
applicable to both reflective and formative models and is applicable even if
the usual assumptions of these models are violated. An outline for a new model

considered to be a pure surface process. It has been recently proposed that ion
pair production could explain the higher-than-expected beam currents extracted
from these ion sources, therefore opening the door for laser-assisted
enhancement of the negative ion yield. We have tested this hypothesis by
measuring the effect of various pulsed diode lasers on the O$^-$ beam current
produced from Al$_2$O$_3$ cathode of a cesium sputter ion source. It is
expected that the ion pair production of O$^-$ requires populating the 5d
electronic states of neutral cesium, thus implying that the process should be
provoked only with specific wavelengths. Our experimental results provide
evidence for the existence of a wavelength-dependent photo-assisted effect but
cast doubt on its alleged resonant nature as the prompt enhancement of beam
current can be observed with laser wavelengths exceeding a threshold photon
energy. The beam current transients observed during the laser pulses suggest
that the magnitude and longevity of the beam current enhancement depends on the
cesium balance on the cathode surface. We conclude that the photo-assisted
negative ion production could be of practical importance as it can more than
double the extracted beam current under certain operational settings of the ion
source.

other eigenspace-based PSD estimation approaches, we rely on recursive

The instantaneous generalized eigenvalues are defined from the generalized

be understood as a recursive average of the instantaneous generalized
eigenvalues. Simulation results comparing the multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF)
with smooth and instantaneous PSD estimates indicate better speech enhancement
performance for the latter. A MATLAB implementation is available online.

a semi-analytical model of the non-thermal emission of the colliding-wind
structure including the dynamical effects of orbital motion. We apply the model
to a general case and to LS 5039. The model consists of a one-dimensional
emitter the geometry of which is affected by Coriolis forces owing to orbital
motion. Two particle accelerators are considered: one at the two-wind standoff
location, and the other one at the turnover produced by the Coriolis force.
Synchrotron and inverse Compton emission is studied, accounting for Doppler
boosting and absorption processes associated to the massive star. If both
accelerators are provided with the same energy budget, most of the radiation
comes from the region of the Coriolis turnover and beyond, up to a few orbital
separations from the binary system. The model allows us to reproduce some of
the LS 5039 emission features, but not all of them. In particular, the MeV
radiation is probably too high to be explained by our model alone, the GeV flux
is recovered but not its modulation, and the radio emission beyond the Coriolis
turnover is too low. The predicted system inclination is consistent with the
presence of a pulsar in the binary. The model is quite successful in
reproducing the overall non-thermal behavior of LS 5039. Some improvements are
suggested to better explain the phenomenology observed in this source, like
accounting for particle reacceleration beyond the Coriolis turnover, unshocked
pulsar wind emission, and the three-dimensional extension of the emitter.

for self-assessment, which are based on classical probability theory. However,
these classical approaches lack the ability to measure the explicit statistical
uncertainty within the self-assessment, which is an important quality measure,
particularly, if only a small number of samples is available for the
self-assessment. In this work, we propose a novel online self-assessment method
using subjective logic, which is a modern extension of probabilistic logic that
explicitly models the statistical uncertainty. Thus, by embedding classical
Kalman filtering into subjective logic, our method additionally features an
explicit measure for statistical uncertainty in the self-assessment.

the repulsive Coulomb interaction. However, under special circumstances the
Coulomb interaction can be effectively attractive, giving rise to electron
pairing in unconventional superconductors and specifically designed mesoscopic
setups. In quantum Hall systems electron interactions can play a particularly
important role due to the huge degeneracy of Landau levels, leading for
instance to the emergence of quasi-particles with fractional charge and anyonic
statistics. Quantum Hall Fabry-P\'erot (FPI) interferometers have attracted
increasing attention due to their ability to probe such exotic physics. In
addition, such interferometers are affected by electron interactions themselves
in interesting ways. Recently, experimental evidence for electron pairing in a
quantum Hall FPI was found (H.K. Choi et al., Nat. Comm 6, 7435 (2015)) .
Theoretically describing an FPI in the limit of strong backscattering and under
the influence of a screened Coulomb interaction, we compute electron shot noise
and indeed find a two-fold enhanced Fano factor for some parameters, indicative
of electron pairing. This result is explained in terms of an electron
interaction due to exchange of neutral inter-edge plasmons, so-called
neutralons.

vanishing external tension. Within a phenomenological theory, the system is
described as a stack of two continuum crystalline membranes, characterized by
finite elastic moduli and a nonzero bending rigidity. A nonlinear
rotationally-invariant model guided by elasticity theory is developed to
describe interlayer interactions. After neglection of in-plane phonon
nonlinearities and anharmonic interactions involving interlayer shear and
compression modes, an effective theory for soft flexural fluctuations of the
bilayer is constructed. The resulting model, neglecting anisotropic
interactions, has the same form of a well-known effective theory for
out-of-plane fluctuations in a single-layer membrane, but with a strongly
wave-vector dependent bare bending rigidity. Focusing on AB-stacked bilayer
graphene, parameters governing interlayer interactions in the theory are
derived by first-principles calculations. Statistical-mechanical properties of
interacting flexural fluctuations are then calculated by a numerical iterative
solution of field-theory integral equations within the self-consistent
screening approximation (SCSA). The bare bending rigidity in the considered
model exhibits a crossover between a long-wavelength regime governed by
in-plane elastic stress and a short wavelength region controlled by monolayer
curvature stiffness. Interactions between flexural fluctuations drive a further
crossover between a harmonic and a strong-coupling regime, characterized by
anomalous scale invariance. The overlap and interplay between these two
crossover behaviors is analyzed at varying temperatures.

growth can be described by a Green's function: $\delta(\vec x,t) = \delta(\vec

of these phenomena is the directed flow of light hadrons and heavy mesons
produced in symmetric and asymmetric heavy-ion collisions as well as in
proton-induced reactions. In particular, the splitting of the directed flow
between particles with the same mass but opposite electric charge as a function
of rapidity and transverse momentum gives access to the electromagnetic
response of medium in all collision stages and in the different colliding

lattices hint that entanglement could provide the key to understanding open
questions of the doped Hubbard model, including the remarkable properties of
the pseudogap phase. These experimental findings call for a theoretical

local entropy and the total mutual information across the doping-driven Mott
transition within plaquette cellular dynamical mean-field theory. We find that
upon varying doping these two entanglement-related properties detect the Mott
insulating phase, the strongly correlated pseudogap phase, and the metallic
phase. Imprinted in the entanglement-related properties we also find the
pseudogap to correlated metal first-order transition, its finite temperature
critical endpoint, and its supercritical crossovers. Through this footprint we
reveal an unexpected interplay of quantum and classical correlations. Our work
shows that sharp variation in the entanglement-related properties and not

ratio while fixing the sparsity level always lead to better model selection?
For high-dimensional sparse regression problems, surprisingly, in this paper we
answer this question in the negative in the regime of linear sparsity for the
Lasso method, relying on a new concept we term effect size heterogeneity.
Roughly speaking, a regression coefficient vector has high effect size
heterogeneity if its nonzero entries have significantly different magnitudes.
From the viewpoint of this new measure, we prove that the false and true
positive rates achieve the optimal trade-off uniformly along the Lasso path
when this measure is maximal in a certain sense, and the worst trade-off is
achieved when it is minimal in the sense that all nonzero effect sizes are
roughly equal. Moreover, we demonstrate that the first false selection occurs
much earlier when effect size heterogeneity is minimal than when it is maximal.
The underlying cause of these two phenomena is, metaphorically speaking, the
``competition'' among variables with effect sizes of the same magnitude in
entering the model. Taken together, our findings suggest that effect size
heterogeneity shall serve as an important complementary measure to the sparsity
of regression coefficients in the analysis of high-dimensional regression
problems. Our proofs use techniques from approximate message passing theory as
well as a novel technique for estimating the rank of the first false variable.

signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20-30. The surface gravity is more
challenging and only indices in the H and J windows are best suited for this.
The metallicity range of the stars with available spectra is too narrow to

defined indices are valuable tools in tracing the properties of the stars in
the IR-dominant stellar populations.

large sample of oxygen-rich AGB envelopes covering a wide range of mass loss
rates to investigate the potential role that these molecules could play in the
formation of dust in these environments.
  Methods:We surveyed a sample of 30 oxygen-rich AGB stars in the $\lambda$ 2
mm band using the IRAM 30m telescope. We performed excitation and radiative
transfer calculations based on the LVG method to model the observed lines of
the molecules and to derive their fractional abundances in the observed
envelopes.
  Results:We detected SiO in all 30 targeted envelopes, as well as CS, SiS, SO,
and SO$_2$ in 18, 13, 26, and 19 sources, respectively. Remarkably, SiS is not
detected in any envelope with a mass loss rate below $10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$, whereas it is detected in all envelopes with mass loss rates above
that threshold. From a comparison with a previous, similar study on C-rich
sources, it becomes evident that the fractional abundances of CS and SiS show a
marked differentiation between C-rich and O-rich sources, being two orders of
magnitude and one order of magnitude more abundant in C-rich sources,
respectively, while the fractional abundance of SiO turns out to be insensitive
to the C/O ratio. The abundance of SiO in O-rich envelopes behaves similarly to
C-rich sources, that is, the denser the envelope the lower its abundance. A
similar trend, albeit less clear than for SiO, is observed for SO in O-rich
sources.
  Conclusions: The marked dependence of CS and SiS abundances on the C/O ratio
indicates that these two molecules form more efficiently in C- than O-rich
envelopes. The decline in the abundance of SiO with increasing envelope density
and the tentative one for SO indicate that SiO and possibly SO act as gas-phase
precursors of dust in circumstellar envelopes around O-rich AGB stars.

parameters of an exoplanet. The chromatic effect they have on transmission
spectroscopy could affect the analysis of data from future space missions such
as JWST and Ariel.
  To quantify and mitigate the effects of those surface phenomena, we developed
a modelling approach to derive the surface distribution and properties of
active regions by modelling simultaneous multi-wavelength time-series
observables. By using the StarSim code, now featuring the capability to solve
the inverse problem, we analysed $\sim$ 600 days of BVRI multiband photometry
from TJO and STELLA telescopes exoplanet host star WASP-52. From the results,
we simulated the chromatic contribution of surface phenomena on the observables
of its transits.
  We are able to determine the relevant activity parameters of WASP-52 and
reconstruct the time-evolving longitudinal map of active regions. The star
shows a heterogeneous surface composed of dark spots with a mean temperature
contrast of $575\pm150$ K with filling factors ranging from 3 to 14 %. We
studied the chromatic effects on the depths of transits obtained at different
epochs with different stellar spot distributions. For WASP-52, with
peak-to-peak photometric variations of $\sim$7 % in the visible, the residual
effects of dark spots on the measured transit depth, after applying the
calculated corrections, are about $10^{-4}$ at 550 nm and $3\times10^{-5}$ at
6$\mu$m.
  We demonstrate that by using contemporaneous ground-based multiband
photometry of an active star, it is possible to reconstruct the parameters and
distribution of active regions over time, and thus, quantify the chromatic
effects on the planetary radii measured with transit spectroscopy and mitigate
them by about an order of magnitude.

examination the algebraic properties of the true table vector of a given

have big differences between the constants in $\Theta$-notation. The

$\epsilon$-constraint method. To do so, we first transform the binary

calculation of the acoustic field---enables passive source localization and
modeling forward propagation in homogeneous media with high computational
efficiency. Here we show that, if the medium is continuously stratified, a
first-order analytical solution may be obtained for the field at arbitrary
depth. Our simulations show that the stratified ASA solution enables accurate
source localization as compared to the uncorrected ASA (error from 1.2$\pm$0.3
to 0.49$\pm$0.3 wavelengths) at scalings relevant to biomedical ($kL \sim$ 500,
where $L$ is the length of the measurement aperture), underwater ($kL \sim$
800), and atmospheric ($kL \sim$ 10) acoustic applications. Overall the total
computation was on the order milliseconds on standard hardware (225$\pm$84 ms,
compared with $78\pm63$ ms for the homogeneous ASA formulation over all cases).
Collectively, the results suggest the proposed ASA phase correction enables
efficient and accurate method for source localization in continuously
stratified environments.

existing ones, a meta-analytical approach to year-by-year data is typically
employed with ORs as effect sizes. However, if the estimated ORs exhibit

understanding bottlenecks in different executions. They often collect
hierarchical performance profiles represented as call graphs, which combine
performance metrics with their execution contexts. The crucial task of
exploring multiple call graphs together is tedious and challenging because of
the many structural differences in the execution contexts and significant
variability in the collected performance metrics (e.g., execution runtime). In
this paper, we present an enhanced version of CallFlow to support the
exploration of ensembles of call graphs using new types of visualizations,
analysis, graph operations, and features. We introduce ensemble-Sankey, a new

box-plot visualization techniques. Whereas the resource-flow visualization can
easily and intuitively describe the graphical nature of the call graph, the box
plots overlaid on the nodes of Sankey convey the performance variability within
the ensemble. Our interactive visual interface provides linked views to help
explore ensembles of call graphs, e.g., by facilitating the analysis of
structural differences, and identifying similar or distinct call graphs. We

binding energy $(BE)_g$ and the nuclear binding energy $(BE)_n$, the last being
related to the microphysics of the interactions. While the first is positive
(binding) both for hadronic stars and for strange quark stars, the second is
large and negative for hadronic stars (anti-binding) and either small and
negative (anti-binding) or positive (binding) for strange quark stars. A
hadronic star can convert into a strange quark star with a larger radius
because the consequent reduction of $(BE)_g$ is over-compensated by the large
increase in $(BE)_n$. Thus, the total binding energy increases due to the
conversion and the process is exothermic. Depending on the equations of state
of hadronic matter and quark matter and on the baryonic mass of the star, the
contrary is obviously also possible, namely the conversion of hadronic stars
into strange quark stars having smaller radii, a situation more often discussed
in the literature. We provide a condition that is sufficient and in most of the
phenomenologically relevant cases also necessary in order to form strange quark
stars with larger radii while satisfying the exothermicity request. Finally, we
compare the two schemes in which quark stars are produced (one having large

the third-family scenario and we discuss how present and future data can

approach based on contrastive learning to model biosignals with a reduced

labels and subjects, intersubject variability negatively impacts model
performance. Thus, we introduce subject-aware learning through (1) a
subject-specific contrastive loss, and (2) an adversarial training to promote
subject-invariance during the self-supervised learning. We also develop a
number of time-series data augmentation techniques to be used with the
contrastive loss for biosignals. Our method is evaluated on publicly available
datasets of two different biosignals with different tasks: EEG decoding and ECG

competitive classification results compared to entirely supervised methods. We

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has become commonplace in design and analysis.
However, determining stress distributions in heterogeneous media using FEA can

To address this, we utilize Deep Learning for developing a set of novel
Difference-based Neural Network (DiNN) frameworks based on engineering and
statistics knowledge to determine stress distribution in heterogeneous media,
for the first time, with special focus on discontinuous domains that manifest
high stress concentrations. The novelty of our approach is that instead of
directly using several FEA model geometries and stresses as inputs for training
a Neural Network, as typically done previously, we focus on highlighting the
differences in stress distribution between different input samples for
improving the accuracy of prediction in heterogeneous media. We evaluate the
performance of DiNN frameworks by considering different types of geometric
models that are commonly used in the analysis of composite materials, including
volume fraction and spatial randomness. Results show that the DiNN structures
significantly enhance the accuracy of stress prediction compared to existing
structures, especially for composite models with random volume fraction when
localized high stress concentrations are present.

discussed, followed by the non-IID theoretical framework in order to build a
deep and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic nature of recommendation
problems, from the perspective of both couplings and heterogeneity. This
non-IID recommendation research triggers the paradigm shift from IID to non-IID
recommendation research and can hopefully deliver informed, relevant,
personalized, and actionable recommendations. It creates exciting new
directions and fundamental solutions to address various complexities including
cold-start, sparse data-based, cross-domain, group-based, and shilling
attack-related issues.

oscillators is studied in a mathematically rigorous manner. Each wave function
in the domain of the number operator of a single oscillator generates a
Frechet-differentiable field of wave functions. Starting from a coherent wave
function one obtains a two-dimensional differentiable manifold of coherent
vector states. As an illustration it is shown that the gauge transformation can
be chosen in such a way that the resulting fields describe a freely-propagating
wave.

designed to highlight the versatility of the Dirac $\delta$-function. Namely,
we compute the expectation value of the Hamiltonian of a free-particle in a
state described by a triangular wave function $\psi(x)$. Since the first
derivative of $\psi(x)$ is piecewise constant, and because this Hamiltonian is
proportional to the second order spatial derivative, students often end up
finding the expectation value to be zero --an unphysical answer. This problem
provides a pedagogical application of the Dirac $\delta$-function. By arriving
at the same result via alternate pathways, this exercise reinforces students'
confidence in the Dirac $\delta$-function and highlights its efficiency and
elegance.

associated weather dependency require flexible protection. They include devices
capable of adapting their protective settings as a reaction to (potential)

system since the reactions of the adaptive devices shall be coordinated. This
coordination imposes strict requirements: communications must be available and
ultra-reliable with bounded latency in the order of milliseconds. This paper
reviews the state-of-the-art in the field and provides a thorough analysis of
the main related communication technologies and optimization techniques. We
also present our perspective on the future of communication deployments in
microgrids, indicating the viability of 5G wireless systems and
multi-connectivity to enable adaptive protection.

coupling relationships that reflect interactions between factors related to
technical, business (domain-specific) and environmental (including
socio-cultural and economic) aspects. There are diverse forms of couplings
embedded in poor-structured and ill-structured data. Such couplings are
ubiquitous, implicit and/or explicit, objective and/or subjective,
heterogeneous and/or homogeneous, presenting complexities to existing learning
systems in statistics, mathematics and computer sciences, such as typical
dependency, association and correlation relationships. Modeling and learning
such couplings thus is fundamental but challenging. This paper discusses the
concept of coupling learning, focusing on the involvement of coupling
relationships in learning systems. Coupling learning has great potential for
building a deep understanding of the essence of business problems and handling
challenges that have not been addressed well by existing learning theories and
tools. This argument is verified by several case studies on coupling learning,
including handling coupling in recommender systems, incorporating couplings
into coupled clustering, coupling document clustering, coupled recommender
algorithms and coupled behavior analysis for groups.

  Holographic Tools","16 pages, 3 figures, Accepted in AHEP",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate numerically $f(R)$ gravity effects on certain AdS/CFT tools
including holographic entanglement entropy and two-point correlation functions
for a charged single accelerated Anti-de Sitter black hole in four dimensions.
We find that both holographic entanglement entropy and two-point correlation
functions decrease by increasing acceleration parameter $A$, matching perfectly
with literature. Taking into account the $f(R)$ gravity parameter $\eta$, the
decreasing scheme of the holographic quantities persist. However, we observe a
transition-like point where the behavior of the holographic tools change. Two
regions meeting at such a transit-like point are shown up. In such a
nomination, the first one is associated with slow accelerating black holes
while the second one corresponds to a fast accelerating solution. In the first
region, the holographic entanglement entropy and two-point correlation
functions decrease by increasing the $\eta$ parameter. However, the behavioral
situation is reversed in the second one. Moreover, a cross-comparison between
the entropy and the holographic entanglement entropy is presented providing
another counter-example showing that such two quantities do not exhibit similar
behaviors.
