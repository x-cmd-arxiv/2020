transport can be partially or even completely ballistic, with the response
primarily limited by the group velocity of lattice waves. By contrast, at
longer length scales and higher temperatures, the response functions correspond
more closely to diffusive transport characteristic of Fourier's law. It is also
shown how the effective thermal conductivity can be determined in a
partially-ballistic regime. The results demonstrate the known reduction in the
effective thermal conductivity observed when system dimensions are smaller than
the mean-free path for lattice waves. Finally, we show how determination of the
relevant response functions can be used to model heating of a crystal without
requiring additional atomic-scale simulations. Differences between computed

the last few years. Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the
adversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all
these approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for
improving adversarial robustness is unexplored, i.e., the complex topology of
the neural network architecture. In this work, we address the following
question: Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial
robustness without any form of adversarial training?. We answer this
empirically by experimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS-based
architectures. Our findings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based
architectures are more robust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than
hand-crafted architectures. However, as the size of the dataset or the
complexity of task increases, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than
NAS-based architectures. Our work is the first large-scale study to understand
adversarial robustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our study
shows that random sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method)
with simple ensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly~12\%.
We show that NAS, which is popular for achieving SoTA accuracy, can provide
adversarial accuracy as a free add-on without any form of adversarial training.
Our results show that leveraging the search space of NAS methods with methods
like ensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness
without any form of adversarial training. We also introduce a metric that can
be used to calculate the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial
robustness. Code and pre-trained models will be made available at

impact on both an individual as well as a societal level. despite their
discovery several decades ago, classical antidepressants have been shown to
provide limited benefits against this condition. However, substances such as
ketamine and psychedelics have recently shown promising results and even
received the grade of Breakthrough therapy for this indication. The accurate
mechanisms of action underlying the efficacy of these substances are still to
be defined, but some similarities appear to be shared on different levels
across these substances. These include their structural, functional and
behavioral plasticity promoting abilities, as well as their capacity to promote
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor overexpression, which seems to constitute a
key element underlying their immediate and long-lasting action. From this
observation, the present review aims to examine and connect the pharmacological
pathways involved in these therapies to the neurobiological, cognitive and
psychological responses that could be shared by both 5-HT2AR agonists and NMDA
antagonists. It is suggested that BDNF overexpression resulting from mTOR
activation mediates both structural and functional plasticity, resulting in
connectivity changes among high-level cognitive networks such as the Default
Mode Network, finally leading to an increased and long-lasting psychological
flexibility. Connecting these pieces of evidence could provide insights about
their precise mechanisms of action and help researchers to develop biomarkers
for antidepressant response. If the hypotheses suggested in this review are
verified by further trials, they could also constitute a starting point to
developing safer and more efficient antidepressants, as well as provide
information about the interactions that exist between different

an objective, such as Q-learning or policy gradient, that defines its

that discovers its own objective, flexibly parameterised by a deep neural
network, solely from interactive experience with its environment. Over time,
this allows the agent to learn how to learn increasingly effectively.
Furthermore, because the objective is discovered online, it can adapt to
changes over time. We demonstrate that the algorithm discovers how to address
several important issues in RL, such as bootstrapping, non-stationarity, and
off-policy learning. On the Atari Learning Environment, the meta-gradient
algorithm adapts over time to learn with greater efficiency, eventually
outperforming the median score of a strong actor-critic baseline.

when using a spin-unrestricted HF (UHF) reference. Previous studies have shown
improved treatment of open-shell systems when a non-HF set of molecular
orbitals, like Brueckner or Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) orbitals,
is used as a reference. Inspired by the success of regularized
orbital-optimized second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory
($\kappa$-OOMP2) orbitals as reference orbitals for MP3, we investigate the use

frequencies of a set of 36 closed-shell (29 neutrals, 6 cations, 1 anion) and
59 open-shell diatomic species (38 neutrals, 15 cations, 6 anions). The use of
$\kappa$-OOMP2 orbitals in this context alleviates difficult cases observed for
both UHF orbitals and OOMP2 orbitals. Removing 2 multireference systems and 12
systems with ambiguous experimental data leaves a pruned data set. Overall
performance on the pruned data set highlights CCSD(T) with a B97 orbital
reference (CCSD(T):B97), CCSD(T) with a $\kappa$-OOMP2 orbital reference

Moreover, the performance on the closed- and open-shell subsets show these
methods are able to treat open-shell and closed-shell systems with comparable
accuracy and robustness. The use of $\kappa$-OOMP2 orbitals has also proven
useful in diagnosing multireference character that can hinder the reliability

instability for the five-dimensional Schwarzschild black string is presented.
Under a choice of ansatz for the perturbation and a gauge choice, the
linearised vacuum Einstein equation reduces to an ODE problem for a single
function. In this work, a suitable rescaling and change of variables is applied
which casts the ODE into a Schr\""odinger eigenvalue equation to which an energy
functional is assigned. It is then shown by direct variational methods that the
lowest eigenfunction gives rise to an exponentially growing mode solution which

higher-order data such as images and videos. Use of attention operators on
high-order data requires flattening of the spatial or spatial-temporal
dimensions into a vector, which is assumed to follow a multivariate normal
distribution. This not only incurs excessive requirements on computational
resources, but also fails to preserve structures in data. In this work, we
propose to avoid flattening by assuming the data follow matrix-variate normal
distributions. Based on this new view, we develop Kronecker attention operators
(KAOs) that operate on high-order tensor data directly. More importantly, the
proposed KAOs lead to dramatic reductions in computational resources.
Experimental results show that our methods reduce the amount of required
computational resources by a factor of hundreds, with larger factors for
higher-dimensional and higher-order data. Results also show that networks with
KAOs outperform models without attention, while achieving competitive
performance as those with original attention operators.

Furthermore, we design a Sentiment-based Rethinking mechanism (SR) by refining
the HIN with sentiment label information to learn a more sentiment-aware

significant gap in robustness remains between real-world perturbations and more

Specifically, we use a conditional generator that defines the perturbation set

theoretically prove that a conditional variational autoencoder naturally
satisfies these criteria. Using this framework, our approach can generate a

train models which are empirically and certifiably robust to adversarial image

cold deep ocean water cools the hurricane track to weaken it. Analyses are

an exceptional coefficient of performance, O(10^4). The destructive power of a

to adequately explore the environment. In contrast, while model-based

(the policy cover). PC-PG enjoys polynomial sample complexity and run time for
both tabular MDPs and, more generally, linear MDPs in an infinite dimensional

misspecification that go beyond the standard worst case $\ell_{\infty}$

us to conduct the theoretical modeling of SNe Ia for a wide parameter range. In
particular, the origin of Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) has been obscure.
Following our earlier work on the parameter dependence of SN Ia models, we
focus on SNe Iax in the present study. For a model of SNe Iax, we adopt the
currently leading model of pure turbulent deflagration (PTD) of
near-Chandrasekhar mass C+O white dwarfs (WDs). We carry out 2-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of the propagation of deflagration wave, which
leaves a small WD remnant behind and eject nucleosynthesis materials. We show
how the explosion properties, such as nucleosynthesis and explosion energy,
depend on the model parameters such as central densities and compositions of
the WDs (including the hybrid WDs), and turbulent flame prescription and
initial flame geometry. We extract the associated observables in our models,
and compare with the recently discovered low-mass WDs with unusual surface
abundance patterns and the abundance patterns of some SN remnants. We provide
the nucleosynthesis yield tables for applications to stellar archaeology and
galactic chemical evolution. Our results are compared with the representative
models in the literature.

Bussgang decomposition and Ungerboeck factorization, which avoids the use of a
complex whitening filter. A reduced state sequence estimator with bidirectional
decision feedback is also derived, achieving remarkable complexity reduction
compared to the existing receivers for quantized SC-MIMO in the literature,
without any requirement on the sparsity of the transmission channel. Moreover,
the linear minimum mean-square-error (LMMSE) channel estimator for SC-MIMO
under frequency-selective channel, which do not require any cyclic-prefix
overhead, is also derived. We observe that the proposed receiver has
significant performance gains with respect to the existing receivers in the
literature under imperfect channel state information.

an edge with another node with less or no security vulnerability because the
two nodes use different software packages or have low vulnerabilities

described. Spontaneous symmetry breaking and breakdown of thermodynamics at low
positive temperatures are rigorously proven for non-rotating clusters. Rotation
is introduced through a second temperature-like parameter. Both axially
symmetric and lopsided rotational equilibria are found; the lopsided equilibria
precess with the angular velocity that is given by the ratio of the two

an example of a lopsided thermodynamic equilibrium of a rotating black hole
star cluster. Stellar-mass black holes occupy highly eccentric orbits in
broken-symmetry star clusters, and form flattened disc-like configurations in
rotating star clusters. They are attracted to orbits that are stationary in the
frame of reference rotating with the angular velocity of the cluster. In
spherical clusters, stellar-mass black holes' orbits are significantly more
eccentric than those of the lighter stars if the temperature is negative, and
more circular if the temperature is positive. Finally we note that planets,
comets, dark matter particles and other light bodies tend to form a spherically

learning about cosmology because of their well-understood relationship to

the statistical precision that can be achieved when constraining model
parameters using these modes as measured in galaxy surveys, and moreover, these
modes are sometimes inaccessible due to observational systematics or
foregrounds. For some applications, both limitations can be circumvented by
reconstructing large-scale modes using the correlations they induce between
smaller-scale modes of an observed tracer (such as galaxy positions). In this
paper, we further develop a formalism for this reconstruction, using a
quadratic estimator similar to the one used for lensing of the cosmic microwave
background. We incorporate nonlinearities from gravity, nonlinear biasing, and
local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, and verify that the estimator gives the
expected results when applied to N-body simulations. We then carry out
forecasts for several upcoming surveys, demonstrating that, when reconstructed
modes are included alongside directly-observed tracer density modes,
constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity are generically tightened by
tens of percents compared to standard single-tracer analyses. In certain cases,
these improvements arise from cosmic variance cancellation, with reconstructed
modes taking the place of modes of a separate tracer, thus enabling an
effective ""multitracer"" approach with single-tracer observations.

of the model with either (anti-)periodic or open boundary conditions, we
conclude that the correlated spin-density state realizes a gapless

Microscopically the two-fold degeneracy is found to be protected by the
conservation of the magnetization parity. Open boundaries induce localized

S$ of a sufficiently smooth set $S\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ when the available
information is only a finite subset $\X\subset S$. We propose two estimators.
The first makes use of the Devroye--Wise support estimator and is based on
Crofton's formula, which, roughly speaking, states that the $(d-1)$-dimensional
surface area of a smooth enough set is the mean number of intersections of
randomly chosen lines. For that purpose, we propose an estimator of the number
of intersections of such lines with support based on the Devroye--Wise support
estimators. The second surface area estimator makes use of the $\alpha$-convex
hull of $\X$, which is denoted by $C_{\alpha}(\X)$. More precisely, it is the
$(d-1)$-dimensional surface area of $C_\alpha(\X)$, as denoted by
$|C_\alpha(\X)|_{d-1}$, which is proven to converge to the $(d-1)$-dimensional
surface area of $\partial S$. Moreover, $|C_\alpha(\X)|_{d-1}$ can be computed
using Crofton's formula.
  Our results depend on the Hausdorff distance between $S$ and $\X$ for the
Devroye--Wise estimator, and the Hausdorff distance between $\partial S$ and
$\partial C_{\alpha}(\X)$ for the second estimator.

the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarized anisotropy power spectra,
providing a simple framework to easily compute their observed modifications. In
so doing, we re-interpret previously known results, namely the $in$ $vacuo$
rotation of the linear polarization plane of CMB photons (or cosmic
birefringence) but also point out that GFE could lead to the partial conversion
of linear into circular polarization. We notice that GFE can be seen as an
effect of light propagating in an anisotropic and/or chiral medium (a ""dark

susceptibility tensor"". For a wave number-independent susceptibility tensor,
this allows us to set an observational bound on a GFE-induced CMB circularly
polarized power spectrum, or $VV$, at $C_{\ell}^{VV} < 2 \times 10^{-5} \mu
K^2$ (95 \% C.L.), at its peak $\ell\simeq 370$, which is some 3 orders of
magnitude better than presently available direct $VV$ measurements. We argue

measurements, cosmic variance-limited linear polarization surveys expected
within this decade should provide, as a byproduct, superior bounds on
GFE-induced circular polarization of the CMB.

that state-of-the-art relativistic mean field models can generate massive stars
reaching $\gtrsim 2.05\,\Msun$, while being in good agreement with
gravitational-wave events and x-ray pulsar observations, when quark vector
interactions and non-standard self-vector interactions are introduced. In
particular, we present a new version of the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model in
which a different quark-deconfinement potential allows for stable stars with a
pure quark core. When rapid rotation is considered, our models generate stellar
masses that approach, and in some cases surpass $2.5\,\Msun$. We find that in
such cases fast rotation does not necessarily suppress exotic degrees of
freedom due to changes in stellar central density, but require a larger amount
of baryons than what is allowed in the non-rotating stars. This is not the case
for pure quark stars, which can easily reach $2.5\,\Msun$ and still possess
approximately the same amount of baryons as stable non-rotating stars. We also
briefly discuss possible origins for fast rotating stars with a large amount of
baryons and their stability, showing how the event GW190814 can be associated

exploitation of useful information from multi-source data for better vehicle
detection is challenging. To solve the above issues, a multi-source active
fine-tuning vehicle detection (Ms-AFt) framework is proposed, which integrates
transfer learning, segmentation, and active classification into a unified
framework for auto-labeling and detection. The proposed Ms-AFt employs a
fine-tuning network to firstly generate a vehicle training set from an
unlabeled dataset. To cope with the diversity of vehicle categories, a
multi-source based segmentation branch is then designed to construct additional
candidate object sets. The separation of high quality vehicles is realized by a
designed attentive classifications network. Finally, all three branches are
combined to achieve vehicle detection. Extensive experimental results conducted
on two open ISPRS benchmark datasets, namely the Vaihingen village and Potsdam
city datasets, demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed
Ms-AFt for vehicle detection. In addition, the generalization ability of Ms-AFt
in dense remote sensing scenes is further verified on stereo aerial imagery of

address these challenges by introducing PyTorch3D, a library of modular,

transitions in topological nodal-line semimetals. In this work we analyze how
uniaxial pressure affects the topological character of BaSn2 , a Dirac
nodal-line semimetal in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Using calculations
based on the density functional theory and a model tight-binding Hamiltonian,
we find the emergence of a second nodal line for pressures higher than 4 GPa.
We examine the topological features of both phases demonstrating that a
nontrivial character is present in both of them. Thus, providing evidence of a
topological-to-topological phase transition in which the number of topological
nodal lines increases. The orbital overlap increase between Ba dxz and dyz
orbitals and Sn pz orbitals and the preservation of crystal symmetries are
found to be responsible for the advent of this transition. Furthermore, we pave
the way to experimentally test this kind of transition by obtaining a
topological relation between the zero-energy modes that arise in each phase

mission designed to observe faint emission from the circumgalactic medium of
moderate redshift (z~0.7) galaxies for the first time. FIREBall observes a
component of galaxies that plays a key role in how galaxies form and evolve,
likely contains a significant amount of baryons, and has only recently been
observed at higher redshifts in the visible. Here we report on the 2018 flight
of the FIREBall-2 Balloon telescope, which occurred on September 22nd, 2018
from Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The flight was the culmination of a complete
redesign of the spectrograph from the original FIREBall fiber-fed IFU to a
wide-field multi-object spectrograph. The flight was terminated early due to a
hole in the balloon, and our original science objectives were not achieved. The
overall sensitivity of the instrument and telescope was 90,000 LU, due
primarily to increased noise from stray light. We discuss the design of the
FIREBall-2 spectrograph, modifications from the original FIREBall payload, and
provide an overview of the performance of all systems. We were able to
successfully flight test a new pointing control system, a UV-optimized,
delta-doped and coated EMCCD, and an aspheric grating. The FIREBall-2 team is
rebuilding the payload for another flight attempt in the Fall of 2021, delayed
from 2020 due to COVID-19.

This is typically subsumed into an object called the weak form factor of the
nucleus. Here, we provide results for this form factor calculated using the
large-scale nuclear shell model for a wide range of nuclei of relevance for
current CE$\nu$NS experiments, including cesium, iodine, argon, fluorine,
sodium, germanium, and xenon. In addition, we provide the responses needed to
capture the axial-vector part of the cross section, which does not scale
coherently with the number of neutrons, but may become relevant for the SM
prediction of CE$\nu$NS on target nuclei with nonzero spin. We then generalize
the formalism allowing for contributions beyond the SM. In particular, we
stress that in this case, even for vector and axial-vector operators, the
standard weak form factor does not apply anymore, but needs to be replaced by
the appropriate combination of the underlying nuclear structure factors. We
provide the corresponding expressions for vector, axial-vector, but also
(pseudo-)scalar, tensor, and dipole effective operators, including
two-body-current effects as predicted from chiral effective field theory.
Finally, we update the spin-dependent structure factors for dark matter
scattering off nuclei according to our improved treatment of the axial-vector
responses.

processes that lead to their formation and subsequent evolution. While it is
well established that turbulence imprints a self-similar structure to the
clouds, other processes, such as gravity and stellar feedback, can break their
scale-free nature. The break of self-similarity can manifest itself in the
existence of characteristic scales that stand out from the underlying structure
generated by turbulent motions. We investigate the structure of the Cygnus-X
North and the Polaris MCs which represent two extremes in terms of their star
formation activity. We characterize the structure of the clouds using the
delta-variance ($\Delta$-variance) spectrum. In Polaris, the structure of the
cloud is self-similar over more than one order of magnitude in spatial scales.
In contrast, the $\Delta$-variance spectrum of Cygnus-X exhibits an excess and
a plateau on physical scales of ~0.5-1.2 pc. In order to explain the
observations for Cygnus-X, we use synthetic maps in which we overlay
populations of discrete structures on top of a fractal Brownian motion (fBm)
image. The properties of these structures such as their major axis sizes,
aspect ratios, and column density contrasts are randomly drawn from
parameterized distribution functions. We show that it is possible to reproduce
a $\Delta$-variance spectrum that resembles the one of the Cygnus-X cloud. We
also use a ""reverse engineering"" approach in which we extract the compact
structures in the Cygnus-X cloud and re-inject them on an fBm map. The
calculated $\Delta$-variance using this approach deviates from the observations
and is an indication that the range of characteristic scales observed in
Cygnus-X is not only due to the existence of compact sources, but is a
signature of the whole population of structures, including more extended and
elongated structures

events, as detected by the Einstein Telescope, and actively star-forming
galaxies. The galaxies distribution is computed through their UV and IR
luminosity functions and the gravitational waves events, assumed to be of
stellar origin, are self-consistently computed from the aforementioned galaxies

discriminating a metallicity dependence on the compact objects merger
efficiency against a reference case with no metallicity dependence. When
considering galaxies with a Star Formation Rate $\psi > 10 \: M_{\odot}

are present in the Galaxy. In the standard paradigm of DM as weakly interacting
massive particle, subhalos are expected to shine in gamma rays and to provide a
signal detectable with current instruments, notably with the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi~satellite. This is the main motivation behind
searches for DM signals towards dwarf spheroidal galaxies and unidentified
Fermi-LAT sources. A significant angular extension detected from unassociated
sources located at relatively high latitudes is considered a ""smoking gun""
signature for identifying DM subhalos. In the present work, we systematically
explore, by means of state-of-the-art models of cold DM halos in the Galaxy,
the detectability of extended subhalos with Fermi-LAT. We simulate a DM signal
exploring different assumptions of subhalos distribution in the Galaxy and DM
profile, and reconstruct its flux through a realistic Fermi-LAT analysis
pipeline. In the most optimistic case, we show that a detection of extended DM
subhalos can be made for annihilation cross sections higher than $3 \times
10^{-26}$ cm$^3$/s (for a 100 GeV DM mass), still compatible with existing
gamma-ray constraints, and that, in this case, the preference for extension of
the source (vs point-like hypothesis) is significant. For fainter signals,
instead, halos not only do not show significant extension, but they are not
even detectable significantly as point-like sources.

Band 3 CO $J=$1-0 data, which allow us to assess the use of the [CI]
$^3P_1$-$^3P_0$ line as a total gas mass estimator. We find that the [CI] line
basically traces structures detected in CO (and dust), and a mean (median)
[CI]/CO luminosity ($L'_{\rm [CI]}$/$L'_{\rm CO}$) ratio of 0.17 (0.16) with a
scatter of 0.04. However, a pixel-by-pixel comparison revealed that there is a
radial $L'_{\rm [CI]}$/$L'_{\rm CO}$ gradient and a superlinear $L'_{\rm CO}$
vs. $L'_{\rm [CI]}$ relation (slope = 1.54 $\pm$ 0.02) at this spatial scale,
which can be explained by radial excitation and/or line opacity gradients.
Based on the molecular gas masses converted from the dust continuum emission,
we found that the CO-to-H$_2$ and [CI]-to-H$_2$ conversion factors are
relatively flat across the molecular gas disk with a median value of
3.5$^{+1.9}_{-1.3}$ and 20.7$^{+9.2}_{-4.9}$ $M_{\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$
pc$^2$)$^{-1}$, respectively. A non-LTE calculation yields that typical
molecular gas properties seen in nearby (U)LIRGs ($n_{\rm H_2}$ = 10$^{3-4}$
cm$^{-3}$, $T_{\rm kin}$ $\sim$ 50 K, and $X_{\rm CI}$ = (0.8-2.3) $\times$
10$^{-5}$) can naturally reproduce the derived [CI]-to-H$_2$ conversion factor.
However, we caution that a careful treatment of the physical gas properties is
required in order to measure H$_2$ gas mass distributions in galaxies using a
single [CI] line. Otherwise, a single [CI] line is not a good molecular gas

spectrum visible today, we find a suppression factor arising from the finite
lifetime of the sound waves and compare with the commonly used result in the
literature, which corresponds to the asymptotic value of our suppression
factor. We point out that the asymptotic value is only applicable for a very
long lifetime of the sound waves, which is highly unlikely due to the onset of

particles of the Standard Model is amongst the most important Higgs boson
properties which have not yet been constrained with high precision. In this
study, all relevant inclusive and differential Higgs boson measurements from
the ATLAS and CMS experiments are used to constrain the $\mathcal{CP}$-nature
of the top-Yukawa interaction. The model dependence of the constraints is
studied by successively allowing for new physics contributions to the couplings
of the Higgs boson to massive vector bosons, to photons, and to gluons. In the
most general case, we find that the current data still permits a significant
$\mathcal{CP}$-odd component in the top-Yukawa coupling. Furthermore, we
explore the prospects to further constrain the $\mathcal{CP}$ properties of
this coupling with future LHC data by determining $tH$ production rates
independently from possible accompanying variations of the $t\bar t H$ rate.
This is achieved via a careful selection of discriminating observables. At the
HL-LHC, we find that evidence for $tH$ production at the Standard Model rate
can be achieved in the Higgs to diphoton decay channel alone.

shown some transient events have especially prominent SCE, indicating a large

with the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories LIGO and Virgo, are
also an anticipated GW source for LISA. LISA will observe them during the early
inspiral stage of evolution; some of them will chirp through the LISA band and
reappear some time later in the band of $3^{rd}$ generation ground-based
detectors. SBHBs could serve as laboratories for testing the theory of General
Relativity and inferring the astrophysical properties of the underlying
population. In this study, we assess LISA's ability to infer the parameters of
those systems, a crucial first step in understanding and interpreting the
observation of those binaries and their use in fundamental physics and
astrophysics. We simulate LISA observations for several fiducial sources and
perform a full Bayesian analysis. We demonstrate and explain degeneracies in
the parameters of some systems. We show that the redshifted chirp mass and the
sky location are always very well determined, with typical errors below
$10^{-4}$ (fractional) and $0.4 \ {\rm deg^2}$. The luminosity distance to the
source is typically measured within $40-60\%$, resulting in a measurement of
the chirp mass in the source frame of $\mathcal{O}(1 \%)$. The error on the
time to coalescence improves from $\mathcal{O}(1 \ {\rm day})$ to
$\mathcal{O}(30 \ {\rm s})$ as we observe the systems closer to their merger.
We introduce an augmented Fisher-matrix analysis which gives reliable
predictions for the intrinsic parameters compared to the full Bayesian
analysis. Finally, we show that combining the use of the long-wavelength

of a degradation function at high frequencies yields reliable results for the

a sequence of incentives to align the agent's behavior with a desired

sequence that, once offered, induces the desired agent behavior even when the
agent's intrinsic motivation is unknown to the principal. We model the agent's

reward function, which belongs to a finite set of possible reward functions,
and consider the incentives as additional rewards offered to the agent. We
first show that the behavior modification problem (BMP), i.e., the problem of
synthesizing an incentive sequence that induces a desired agent behavior at
minimum total cost to the principal, is PSPACE-hard. Moreover, we show that by
imposing certain restrictions on the incentive sequences available to the
principal, one can obtain two NP-complete variants of the BMP. We also provide
a sufficient condition on the set of possible reward functions under which the
BMP can be solved via linear programming. Finally, we propose two algorithms to

$M_\oplus$) with a 6.3-d period. We combined astrometric measurements from the
Hipparcos and Gaia satellites with a precisely determined spectroscopic orbit
in an attempt to constrain the inclination of the orbital plane of the outer
planet. We measured an inclination of $i_b=49.9_{-4.5}^{+5.3}$ deg for the
orbital plane of $\pi$ Mensae b, leading to a direct measurement of its mass of
$13.01_{-0.95}^{+1.03}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$. We found a significant mutual
inclination between the orbital planes of the two planets; a 95% credible
interval for $i_{\rm mut}$ of between $34.5^\circ$ and $140.6^\circ$ after
accounting for the unknown position angle of the orbit of $\pi$ Mensae c,
strongly excluding a co-planar scenario for the two planets within this system.
All orbits are stable in the present-day configuration, and secular
oscillations of planet c's eccentricity are quenched by general relativistic
precession. Planet c may have undergone high eccentricity tidal migration
triggered by Kozai-Lidov cycles, but dynamical histories involving disk
migration or in situ formation are not ruled out. Nonetheless, this system
provides the first direct evidence that giant planets with large mutual
inclinations have a role to play in the origins and evolution of some
super-Earth systems.

approach, based on process replication for detection, combined with different
levels of checkpointing for automatic recovery, has the goal of helping users
of scientific applications to obtain executions with correct results. SEDAR is
structured in three levels: (1) only detection and safe-stop with notification;
(2) recovery based on multiple system-level checkpoints; and (3) recovery based
on a single valid user-level checkpoint. As each of these variants supplies a
particular coverage but involves limitations and implementation costs, SEDAR
can be adapted to the needs of the system. In this work, a description of the
methodology is presented and the temporal behavior of employing each SEDAR
strategy is mathematically described, both in the absence and presence of
faults. A model that considers all the fault scenarios on a test application is
introduced to show the validity of the detection and recovery mechanisms. An
overhead evaluation of each variant is performed with applications involving
different communication patterns; this is also used to extract guidelines about
when it is beneficial to employ each SEDAR protection level. As a result, we
show its efficacy and viability to tolerate transient faults in target HPC

subsequent step of feature matching. Non-rigid deformation makes it difficult
to remove mismatches because no parametric transformation can be found. To
solve this problem, we first propose an algorithm based on the re-weighting and
1-point RANSAC strategy (R1P-RNSC), which is a parametric method under a
reasonable assumption that the non-rigid deformation can be approximately
represented by multiple locally rigid transformations. R1P-RNSC is fast but
suffers from a drawback that the local smoothing information cannot be taken
into account. Then, we propose a non-parametric algorithm based on the
expectation maximization algorithm and dual quaternion (EMDQ) representation to
generate the smooth deformation field. The two algorithms compensate for the
drawbacks of each other. Specifically, EMDQ needs good initial values provided
by R1P-RNSC, and R1P-RNSC needs EMDQ for refinement. Experimental results with
real-world data demonstrate that the combination of the two algorithms has the
best accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods, which can handle up
to 85% of outliers in real-time. The ability to generate dense deformation
field from sparse matches with outliers in real-time makes the proposed

rings that is essentially of finite type and flat is locally complete
intersection if and only $S$ is proxy small as a bimodule. This means that the
thick subcategory generated by $S$ as a module over the enveloping algebra
$S\otimes_RS$ contains a perfect complex supported fully on the diagonal ideal.
This is in the spirit of the classical result that $\varphi$ is smooth if and

a perfect complex. The geometric analogue, dealing with maps between schemes,
is also established. Applications include simpler proofs of factorization
theorems for locally complete intersection maps.

proposed as the first transduction model replying entirely on self-attention
mechanisms without using sequence-aligned recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or
convolution, and it achieved significant improvements for sequence to sequence
tasks. The introduced intensive computation and storage of these pre-trained
language representations has impeded their popularity into computation and
memory-constrained devices. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is widely
used to accelerate deep learning algorithms for its high parallelism and low
latency. However, the trained models are still too large to accommodate to an
FPGA fabric. In this paper, we propose an efficient acceleration framework,
Ftrans, for transformer-based large scale language representations. Our
framework includes enhanced block-circulant matrix (BCM)-based weight
representation to enable model compression on large-scale language
representations at the algorithm level with few accuracy degradation, and an
acceleration design at the architecture level. Experimental results show that
our proposed framework significantly reduces the model size of NLP models by up
to 16 times. Our FPGA design achieves 27.07x and 81x improvement in performance

can provide reliable and robust user authentication, given the availability of

resulted in many accurate face verification architectures. However, their
typical size (hundreds of megabytes) makes them infeasible to be incorporated

lightweight face recognition network of just a few megabytes that can operate
with sufficient accuracy in comparison to much larger models. The network also
should be able to operate under different poses, given the variability
naturally observed in uncontrolled environments where mobile devices are

recognition where at least acquisition of the enrolment image can be
controlled. At the cost of a slight degradation in performance, we also test an

for automation and control of dynamic systems. A dynamic system is a system
where the rates of changes of its state variables are not negligible. Quantum
entanglement is realized by the Spontaneous Parametric Down-conversion process.
Two entangled autonomous systems exhibit correlated behavior without any
classical communication in between them due to the quantum entanglement
phenomenon. Specifically, the behavior of a system, Bob, at a distance, is
correlated with a corresponding system, Alice. In an automation scenario, the
'Bob Robot' is entangled with the 'Alice Robot' in performing autonomous tasks
without any classical connection between them. Quantum cryptography is a
capability that allows guaranteed security. Such capabilities can be
implemented in control of autonomous mechanical systems where, for instance, an
'Alice Autonomous System' can control a 'Bob Autonomous System' for
applications of automation and robotics. The applications of quantum
technologies to mechanical systems, at a scale larger than the atomistic scale,
for control and automation, is a novel contribution of this paper. Notably, the
feedback control transfer function of an integrated classical dynamic system
and a quantum state is proposed.

incorporated pristine interstellar material as well as processed nebular
matter, providing insights into the composition and prevailing conditions over
wide swaths of the solar nebula at the time of planet formation. Dynamically
new Oort cloud comets harbor primitive ices that have been stored thousands of
astronomical units from the Sun and have suffered minimal thermal or radiative
processing since their emplacement ~4.5 Gyr ago. Periodic, more dynamically
evolved comets such as the Halley-type and Jupiter-family comets reveal the
effects of lives spent over a range of heliocentric distances, including
perihelion passages into the very inner solar system. Systematically
characterizing the information imprinted in the native ice compositions of
these objects is critical to understanding the formation and evolution of the
solar system, the presence of organic matter and water on the terrestrial
planets, the chemistry present in protoplanetary disks around other stars, and
the nature of interstellar interlopers such as 2I/Borisov. Although comet
rendezvous and sample return missions can provide remarkable insights into the

block patterns limits the reliability of routinely-used community detection
algorithms, and requires extensions of model-based solutions to realistically
characterize the node partition process, incorporate information from node
attributes, and provide improved strategies for estimation and uncertainty
quantification. To cover these gaps, we develop a new class of extended
stochastic block models (ESBM) that infer groups of nodes having common
connectivity patterns via Gibbs-type priors on the partition process. This
choice encompasses many realistic priors for criminal networks, covering
solutions with fixed, random and infinite number of possible groups, and
facilitates the inclusion of node attributes in a principled manner. Among the
new alternatives in our class, we focus on the Gnedin process as a realistic
prior that allows the number of groups to be finite, random and subject to a
reinforcement process coherent with criminal networks. A collapsed Gibbs
sampler is proposed for the whole ESBM class, and refined strategies for
estimation, prediction, uncertainty quantification and model selection are
outlined. The ESBM performance is illustrated in realistic simulations and in
an application to an Italian mafia network, where we unveil key complex block
structures, mostly hidden from state-of-the-art alternatives.

the Klein-Gordon part of the dynamics. The Landau damping part of the electric
field decays faster than free transport at low frequencies and damps as in the
confined case at high frequencies; in fact, it decays at the same rate as in
the screened case. As such, neither contribution to the electric field behaves
as in the vacuum case.

renewed interest fueled by possible fine engineering of several magnetic
interactions, notably the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This
allows the stabilization of complex chiral spin textures such as chiral
magnetic domain walls (DWs), spin spirals, and magnetic skyrmions. We report
here on the ultrafast behavior of chiral DWs after optical pumping in
perpendicularly magnetized asymmetric multilayers, probed using time-resolved
circular dichroism in x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (CD-XRMS). We observe
a picosecond transient reduction of the CD-XRMS, which is attributed to the
spin current-induced coherent and incoherent torques within the continuously
dependent spin texture of the DWs. We argue that a specific demagnetization of
the inner structure of the DW induces a flow of hot spins from the interior of
the neighboring magnetic domains. We identify this time-varying change of the
DW textures shortly after the laser pulse as a distortion of the homochiral
N'eel shape toward a transient mixed Bloch-N\'eel-Bloch textures along a
direction transverse to the DW. Our study highlights how time-resolved CD-XRMS
can be a unique tool for studying the time evolution in other systems showing a
non-collinear electric/magnetic ordering such as skyrmion lattices,
conical/helical phases, as well as the recently observed antiskyrmion lattices,

often studied using individual modes obtained from empirical orthogonal
function (EOF) analyses. The prevailing reduced-order model of the leading EOF
(EOF1) of zonal-mean zonal wind, called the annular mode, consists of an
eddy-mean flow interaction mechanism that results in a positive feedback of
EOF1 onto itself. However, a few studies have pointed out that under some
circumstances in observations and GCMs, strong couplings exist between EOF1 and
EOF2 at some lag times, resulting in decaying-oscillatory, or propagating,
annular modes. Here, we introduce a reduced-order model for coupled EOF1 and
EOF2 that accounts for potential cross-EOF eddy-zonal flow feedbacks. Using the
analytical solution of this model, we derive conditions for the existence of
the propagating regime based on the feedback strengths. Using this model, and
idealized GCMs and stochastic prototypes, we show that cross-EOF feedbacks play
an important role in controlling the persistence of the annular modes by
setting the frequency of the oscillation. We find that stronger cross-EOF
feedbacks lead to less persistent annular modes. Applying the coupled-EOF model
to the Southern Hemisphere reanalysis data shows the existence of strong
cross-EOF feedbacks. The results highlight the importance of considering the
coupling of EOFs and cross-EOF feedbacks to fully understand the natural and
forced variability of the zonal-mean large-scale circulation.

spectrum sharing technique in cellular network. In this work, cellular system
is considered as primary and internet of things devices (IoDs), engaged in D2D
communications, are considered to be secondary system. The devices access the
licensed spectrum by means of the cooperation in two-way primary
communications. Furthermore, IoDs are energized by harvesting the energy from
radio frequency (RF) signals, using simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) protocol. Closed form expressions of outage probability for
both cellular and D2D communications are derived and the impact of various
design parameters for both AF and DF relaying techniques are studied. Based on
the simulation results, it is found that the proposed spectrum sharing
protocol, for both DF relaying and AF relaying schemes, outperform another
similar network architecture in terms of spectrum efficiency. It is also
observed that the performance of the proposed system using DF relaying is
better than AF relaying scheme in terms of energy efficiency at same transmit

  Attack and Countermeasure","To be published in IEEE Transactions on Computers",,"10.1109/TC.2022.3174560",,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since 2016, sharding has become an auspicious solution to tackle the
scalability issue in legacy blockchain systems. Despite its potential to
strongly boost the blockchain throughput, sharding comes with its own security
issues. To ease the process of deciding which shard to place transactions,
existing sharding protocols use a hash-based transaction sharding in which the
hash value of a transaction determines its output shard. Unfortunately, we show
that this mechanism opens up a loophole that could be exploited to conduct a
single-shard flooding attack, a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, to
overwhelm a single shard that ends up reducing the performance of the system as
a whole.
  To counter the single-shard flooding attack, we propose a countermeasure that
essentially eliminates the loophole by rejecting the use of hash-based
transaction sharding. The countermeasure leverages the Trusted Execution
Environment (TEE) to let blockchain's validators securely execute a transaction
sharding algorithm with a negligible overhead. We provide a formal
specification for the countermeasure and analyze its security properties in the
Universal Composability (UC) framework. Finally, a proof-of-concept is
developed to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of our solution.

  Aim. We investigate the effect of incidental affect (fear and happiness) on
privacy behavioral intention.
  Method. We recruited $330$ participants for a within-subjects experiment in
three random-controlled user studies. The participants were exposed to three
conditions \textsf{neutral}, \textsf{fear}, \textsf{happiness} with
standardised stimuli videos for incidental affect induction. Fear and happiness
were assigned in random order. The participants' privacy behavioural intentions
(PBI) were measured followed by a Positive and Negative Affect Schedule
(PANAS-X) manipulation check on self-reported affect. The PBI and PANAS-X were
compared across treatment conditions.
  Results. We observed a statistically significant difference in PBI and
Protection Intention in neutral-fear and neutral-happy comparisons. However
across fear and happy conditions, we did not observe any statistically
significant change in PBI scores.
  Conclusions. We offer the first systematic analysis of the impact of
incidental affects on Privacy Behavioral Intention (PBI) and its
sub-constructs. We are the first to offer a fine-grained analysis of
neutral-affect comparisons and interactions offering insights in hitherto
unexplained phenomena reported in the field.

theories offer a geometric framework (with a metric and an independent

same spectrum as bimetric gravity models. In addition to an Einsteinlike
massless spin-2 excitation, there is a massive spin-2 one (of range
$\kappa^{-1}$) coming from the torsion sector, rather than from a second
metric. We prove the existence of three broad classes of spherically-symmetric
black hole solutions in torsion bigravity. First, the Schwarzschild solution
defines an asymptotically-flat torsionless black hole for all values of the
parameters. [And we prove that one cannot deform a Schwarzschild solution, at
the linearized level, by adding an infinitesimal torsion hair.] Second, when
considering finite values of the range, we find that there exist
non-asymptotically-flat torsion-hairy black holes in a large domain of
parameter space. Third, we find that, in the limit of infinite range, there
exists a two-parameter family of asymptotically flat torsion-hairy black holes.
The latter black hole solutions give an interesting example of non-Einsteinian
(but still purely geometric) black hole structures which might be
astrophysically relevant when considering a range of cosmological size.

tool to estimate the stellar mass (M*) of a galaxy. However, an individual CMLR
tends to give distinct M* for a same galaxy when it is applied in different
bands. Examining five representative CMLRs from literature, we find that the
difference in M* predicted in different bands from optical to near-infrared by
a CMLR is 0.1-0.3 dex. Therefore, based on a sample of low surface brightness
galaxies (LSBG) that covers a wide range of color and luminosity, we
re-calibrated each original CMLR in r, i, z, J, H, and K bands to give
internally self-consistent M* for a same galaxy. The g-r is the primary color
indicator in the re-calibrated relations which show little dependenceon red (r
- z) or near-infrared (J - K) colors.Additionally, the external discrepancies
in the originally predicted stellar mass-to-light ratio (M*/L) by the five
independent CMLRs have been greatly reduced after re-calibration, especially in
near-infrared bands, implying that the near-infrared luminosities are more
robust to predict M*/L. For each CMLR, the re-calibrated relations provided in
this work could produce internally self-consistent M* from divergent
photometric bands, and are extensions of the re-calibrations from
Johnson-Cousin filter system by the pioneering work of McGaugh & Schombert

architectures and on agile iterative development methods to design, implement,

control of a single designer. Academic privacy engineering literature typically
abstracts away such conditions of software production in order to achieve
generalizable results. Yet, through a systematic study of the literature, we
show that proposed solutions inevitably make assumptions about software
architectures, development methods and scope of designer control that are
misaligned with current practices. These misalignments are likely to pose an
obstacle to operationalizing privacy engineering solutions in the wild.
Specifically, we identify important limitations in the approaches that
researchers take to design and evaluate privacy enhancing technologies which
ripple to proposals for privacy engineering methodologies. Based on our
analysis, we delineate research and actions needed to re-align research with
practice, changes that serve a precondition for the operationalization of
academic privacy results in common software engineering practices.

with the unique qualities of microservices in mind. The Dagger architecture
relies on an FPGA-based NIC, closely coupled with the processor over a
configurable memory interconnect, designed to offload and accelerate RPC
stacks. Unlike the traditional cloud systems that use PCIe links as the NIC I/O
interface, we leverage memory-interconnected FPGAs as networking devices to
provide the efficiency, transparency, and programmability needed for
fine-grained microservices. We show that this considerably improves CPU

are the way we see them and how to successfully reach our goals. Therefore,
strategy is theory based because theory provides an intellectual framework for
predicting outcomes leading to the end goal the strategy pursues. This article
will present a theory, strategic cyberwar theory, that states that the utility
of strategic cyberwar is tied to the likelihood of institutional instability in
the targeted nation. In an ideal scenario, the cyber attacks are systematically
attacking the targeted adversary institutions triggering the dormant entropy
embedded in a nation with weak institutions. This will lead to submission to
foreign policy and intent. The current alternative to strategic cyberwar theory
is to unsystematically attack the adversary with cyber attacks where
exploitation opportunities occur, which is likely to degrade parts of the
information infrastructure, but it will not reach any strategic goals. If an
adversarial society is unaffected by a cyber conflict, the conflict itself has
not reached a decisive outcome, and results only in tit for tat game or
stalemate. In strategic cyberwar theory1, the concept is to cyber attack the
core of the institutional framework of the adversarial nation in pursuit of
destabilization.

diseases. As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is
crucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the RT-PCR test which is
considered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a
high false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a
feasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this
work, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class
classification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia
classes. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals
with preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature
extraction. These extracted features are passed as an input to the ELM at the
third stage, resulting in the identification of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in
this work has been motivated by its faster convergence, better generalization
capability, and shorter training time in comparison to the conventional
gradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become
available, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based
competitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95

When compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is
found to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification
scenario. Further, LIME has been integrated with the proposed COV-ELM model to
generate annotated CXR images. The annotations are based on the superpixels

observed that the superpixels correspond to the regions of the human lungs that

Set problem on several types of geometric objects: intervals on the real line,
arbitrary axis-aligned squares in the plane and axis-aligned $d$-dimensional
hypercubes.
  It is known that a maximum independent set of a collection of $n$ intervals
can be found in $O(n\log n)$ time, while it is already \textsf{NP}-hard for a
set of unit squares. Moreover, the problem is inapproximable on many important
graph families, but admits a \textsf{PTAS} for a set of arbitrary pseudo-disks.
Therefore, a fundamental question in computational geometry is whether it is
possible to maintain an approximate maximum independent set in a set of dynamic
geometric objects, in truly sublinear time per insertion or deletion. In this
work, we answer this question in the affirmative for intervals, squares and
hypercubes.
  First, we show that for intervals a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum
independent set can be maintained with logarithmic worst-case update time. This
is achieved by maintaining a locally optimal solution using a constant number
of constant-size exchanges per update.
  We then show how our interval structure can be used to design a data
structure for maintaining an expected constant factor approximate maximum
independent set of axis-aligned squares in the plane, with polylogarithmic
amortized update time. Our approach generalizes to $d$-dimensional hypercubes,
providing a $O(4^d)$-approximation with polylogarithmic update time.
  Those are the first approximation algorithms for any set of dynamic arbitrary
size geometric objects; previous results required bounded size ratios to obtain
polylogarithmic update time. Furthermore, it is known that our results for
squares (and hypercubes) cannot be improved to a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation with the same update time.

optimality property since each passivating state feedback controller is optimal
with respect to some specific performance index. Due to the nonlinear
port-Hamiltonian system structure, however, explicit (forward) methods for
optimal control of port-Hamiltonian systems require the generally intractable
analytical solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Adaptive dynamic
programming methods provide a means to circumvent this issue. However, the few
existing approaches for port-Hamiltonian systems hinge on very specific
sub-classes of either performance indices or system dynamics or require the
intransparent guessing of stabilizing initial weights. In this paper, we
contribute towards closing this largely unexplored research area by proposing a
time-continuous adaptive feedback controller for the optimal control of general
time-continuous input-state-output port-Hamiltonian systems with respect to
general Lagrangian performance indices. Its control law implements an online
learning procedure which uses the Hamiltonian of the system as an initial value
function candidate. The time-continuous learning of the value function is
achieved by means of a certain Lagrange multiplier that allows to evaluate the
optimality of the current solution. In particular, constructive conditions for
stabilizing initial weights are stated and asymptotic stability of the
closed-loop equilibrium is proven. Our work is concluded by simulations for
exemplary linear and nonlinear optimization problems which demonstrate
asymptotic convergence of the controllers resulting from the proposed online

Automated body parsing is a crucial step towards computer-aided GMA, in which
infant body parts are segmented and tracked over time for movement analysis.
However, acquiring fully annotated data for video-based body parsing is
particularly expensive due to the large number of frames in IMVs. In this
paper, we propose a semi-supervised body parsing model, termed SiamParseNet
(SPN), to jointly learn single frame body parsing and label propagation between
frames in a semi-supervised fashion. The Siamese-structured SPN consists of a
shared feature encoder, followed by two separate branches: one for intra-frame
body parts segmentation, and one for inter-frame label propagation. The two
branches are trained jointly, taking pairs of frames from the same videos as
their input. An adaptive training process is proposed that alternates training
modes between using input pairs of only labeled frames and using inputs of both
labeled and unlabeled frames. During testing, we employ a multi-source
inference mechanism, where the final result for a test frame is either obtained
via the segmentation branch or via propagation from a nearby key frame. We
conduct extensive experiments on a partially-labeled IMV dataset where SPN
outperforms all prior arts, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

to predict the number of events over future periods of time. Such predictions

social sciences and humanities in the development, governance, and study of
artificial intelligence systems, this paper presents one sociologist's view on
the problem of algorithmic bias and the reproduction of societal bias.
Discussions of bias in AI cover much of the same conceptual terrain that
sociologists studying inequality have long understood using more specific terms
and theories. Concerns over reproducing societal bias should be informed by an
understanding of the ways that inequality is continually reproduced in society
-- processes that AI systems are either complicit in, or can be designed to
disrupt and counter. The contrast presented here is between conservative and
radical approaches to AI, with conservatism referring to dominant tendencies
that reproduce and strengthen the status quo, while radical approaches work to
disrupt systemic forms of inequality. The limitations of conservative
approaches to class, gender, and racial bias are discussed as specific
examples, along with the social structures and processes that biases in these
areas are linked to. Societal issues can no longer be out of scope for AI and
machine learning, given the impact of these systems on human lives. This
requires engagement with a growing body of critical AI scholarship that goes
beyond biased data to analyze structured ways of perpetuating inequality,
opening up the possibility for radical alternatives.

improvements in accuracy should be balanced out with computational demands of a
model. In practice, performance metrics of model are computationally expensive
to obtain. Previous work uses a proxy (e.g., number of operations) or a
layer-wise measurement of neural network layers to estimate end-to-end hardware
performance but the imprecise prediction diminishes the quality of NAS. To
address this problem, we propose BRP-NAS, an efficient hardware-aware NAS
enabled by an accurate performance predictor-based on graph convolutional
network (GCN). What is more, we investigate prediction quality on different
metrics and show that sample efficiency of the predictor-based NAS can be
improved by considering binary relations of models and an iterative data

improving upon the second-order baseline. Finally, to raise awareness of the

degrees of freedom to avoid or alleviate these decoherence mechanisms. Here we
report the observation of relaxation from the excited valley state to the
ground state in a Si/SiGe quantum dot, at zero magnetic field. Valley state
read-out is aided by a valley-dependent tunneling effect, which we attribute to
valley-orbit coupling. We find a long intervalley relaxation time of 12.0 $\pm$

Furthermore, we compare our findings with the spin relaxation time and find
that the spin-valley ""hot spot"" relaxation is roughly four times slower than
intervalley relaxation, consistent with established theoretical predictions.
The precision of this technique, adapted from electron spin read-out via
energy-dependent tunneling, is an improvement over indirect valley relaxation
measurements and could be a useful probe of valley physics in spin and valley

Mstar > 10^(10) Msun, and are mainly located on the green valley. This trend is
consistent with a scenario in which star formation of the host galaxies is
suppressed by AGN feedback, that is, AGN activity may be responsible for the
transition of these galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence. We also
investigated the SMBH mass to stellar mass relation of the z < 1 quasars, and
found a consistent slope with the local relation, while the SMBHs may be
slightly undermassive. However, the above results are subject to our sample
selection, which biases against host galaxies with low masses and/or large
quasar-to-host flux ratios.

detections in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data at 3.4 and
4.6 um (rest-frame ~5000-6500 A). The amount of dust reddening was estimated
with spectral energy distribution (SED) fits over optical and mid-infrared
wavelengths. Two of the four candidates were found to be red quasars with dust
reddening of E(B-V) > 0.1. The remaining SHELLQs quasars without individual
WISE detections are significantly fainter in the WISE bands and bluer than the
red quasars, although we did detect them in the W1 band in a stacked image. We
also conducted the same SED fits for high-z optically-luminous quasars, but no
red quasar was found. This demonstrates the power of Subaru HSC to discover
high-z red quasars, which are fainter than the limiting magnitudes of past
surveys in the rest-frame ultraviolet, due to dust extinction.

example, faceted {\Sigma}11 <110> tilt grain boundaries were observed to
exhibit mobility values that could be strongly dependent on the direction of
migration. In order to understand whether this directionally-anisotropic
mobility is a general phenomenon and to isolate mechanistic explanations for
this behavior, molecular dynamics simulations of bicrystals evolved under an
artificial driving force are used to study interface migration for a range of
boundary plane inclination angles and temperatures in multiple face centered
cubic metals (Al, Ni, and Cu). We find that directionally-anisotropic mobility
is active in a large fraction of these boundaries in Ni and Cu and should
therefore impact the coarsening of polycrystalline materials. On the other
hand, no such anisotropy is observed in any of the Al boundaries, showing that
this behavior is material-dependent. Migration of the faceted boundaries is
accomplished through transformation events at facet nodes and incommensurate
boundary plane facets, which are termed shuffling modes. Three major shuffling
modes have been identified, namely Shockley shuffling, slip plane shuffling,
and disordered shuffling. A shift from the first two ordered modes to the third
disordered mode is found to be responsible for reducing or removing
directionally-anisotropic mobility, especially at the highest temperatures

filters) to guide a task-model encoder. For object manipulation, the system
first recognizes the name of a target object and its attributes from verbal
instructions. The information serves as a where-to-look FoA filter to confine
the areas in which the target object existed in the demonstration. The system
then detects the timings of grasp and release that occurred in the filtered
areas. The timings serve as a when-to-look FoA filter to confine the period of
object manipulation. Finally, a task-model encoder recognizes the task models
by employing FoA filters. We demonstrate the robustness of the verbal FoA in
attenuating spatio-temporal noises by comparing it with an existing action
localization network. The contributions of this study are as follows: (1) to
propose a verbal FoA for LfO, (2) to design an algorithm to calculate FoA
filters from verbal input, and (3) to demonstrate the effectiveness of a verbal
FoA in localizing an action by comparing it with a state-of-the-art vision
system.

an initial constant repulsive force between the segments, followed by an abrupt
attractive force. Such an object, when placed on a sturdy ground, will jump,
and the motion can be calculated using only the constant acceleration
equations, making the example suitable for algebra-based physics. We then

to memory can induce bit flips in neighboring memory locations. Being a
hardware vulnerability, rowhammer bypasses all of the system memory protection,
allowing adversaries to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of data.
Rowhammer attacks have shown to enable privilege escalation, sandbox escape,
and cryptographic key disclosures. Recently, several proposals suggest
exploiting the spatial proximity between the accessed memory location and the
location of the bit flip for a defense against rowhammer. These all aim to deny
the attacker's permission to access memory locations near sensitive data. In
this paper, we question the core assumption underlying these defenses. We
present PThammer, a confused-deputy attack that causes accesses to memory
locations that the attacker is not allowed to access. Specifically, PThammer
exploits the address translation process of modern processors, inducing the
processor to generate frequent accesses to protected memory locations. We
implement PThammer, demonstrating that it is a viable attack, resulting in a
system compromise (e.g., kernel privilege escalation). We further evaluate the
effectiveness of proposed software-only defenses showing that PThammer can
overcome those.

heterogeneity is present, arising from unobserved variables such as cultural
background and upbringing of students, the quality of mentorship and other
forms of emotional and professional support received by students, and other
unobserved variables that may affect response probabilities. To address such

assumes that both items and respondents are embedded in an unobserved metric

the distance between the respondent's and the item's position in the latent

which come with exceptional computing and memory throughput capabilities. To
this end, we introduce EZLDA which achieves efficient and scalable LDA training
on GPUs with the following three contributions: First, EZLDA introduces
three-branch sampling method which takes advantage of the convergence
heterogeneity of various tokens to reduce the redundant sampling task. Second,
to enable sparsity-aware format for both D and W on GPUs with fast sampling and
updating, we introduce hybrid format for W along with corresponding token
partition to T and inverted index designs. Third, we design a hierarchical
workload balancing solution to address the extremely skewed workload imbalance
problem on GPU and scaleEZLDA across multiple GPUs. Taken together, EZLDA
achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art attempts with lower
memory consumption.

needs to prepare a uniform distribution of simulation particles, so-called the
pre-initial condition (pre-IC). The standard method to construct the pre-IC is
to place the particles on the lattice grids evenly spaced in the
three-dimensional spatial coordinates. However, even after the initial
displacement of each particle according to cosmological perturbations, the
particle distribution remains to display an artificial anisotropy. Such an
artifact causes systematic effects in simulations at later time until the
evolved particle distribution sufficiently erases the initial anisotropy. In
this paper, we study the impacts of the pre-IC on the anisotropic separate
universe simulation, where the effect of large-scale tidal field on structure
formation is taken into account using the anisotropic expansion in a local
background (simulation volume). To quantify the impacts, we compare the
simulations employing the standard grid pre-IC and the glass one, where the
latter is supposed to suppress the initial anisotropy. We show that the
artificial features in the grid pre-IC simulations are seen until $z\sim 9$,
while the glass pre-IC simulations appear to be stable and accurate over the
range of scales we study. From these results we find that a coupling of the
large-scale tidal field with matter clustering is enhanced compared to the
leading-order prediction of perturbation theory in the quasi non-linear regime
in the redshift range $5\lesssim z\lesssim 15$, indicating the importance of
tidal field on structure formation at such high redshifts, e.g. during the
epoch of reionization.

vision, especially for few-shot classification tasks. The key idea of
meta-learning for few-shot classification is to mimic the few-shot situations
faced at test time by randomly sampling classes in meta-training data to
construct few-shot tasks for episodic training. While a rich line of work
focuses solely on how to extract meta-knowledge across tasks, we exploit the
complementary problem on how to generate informative tasks. We argue that the
randomly sampled tasks could be sub-optimal and uninformative (e.g., the task
of classifying ""dog"" from ""laptop"" is often trivial) to the meta-learner. In
this paper, we propose an adaptive task sampling method to improve the
generalization performance. Unlike instance based sampling, task based sampling
is much more challenging due to the implicit definition of the task in each
episode. Therefore, we accordingly propose a greedy class-pair based sampling
method, which selects difficult tasks according to class-pair potentials. We
evaluate our adaptive task sampling method on two few-shot classification
benchmarks, and it achieves consistent improvements across different feature
backbones, meta-learning algorithms and datasets.

optimizing a computational model to minimize a rate-distortion objective.
Currently, the most effective learned image codecs take the form of an

can be efficiently integrated into a deep neural network. In contrast, backward
adaptation typically makes predictions based on the causal context of each

minimizing serial processing. Empirically, we see an average rate savings of
6.7% on the Kodak image set and 11.4% on the Tecnick image set compared to a

features, we observe that there is another type of feature, which is commonly

prediction result. We call such a type of feature as procedural bias.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose that the features/voxels in neuroimage
data are consist of three orthogonal parts: lesion features, procedural bias,
and null features. To stably select lesion features and leverage procedural
bias into prediction, we propose an iterative algorithm (termed GSplit LBI) as
a discretization of differential inclusion of inverse scale space, which is the
combination of Variable Splitting scheme and Linearized Bregman Iteration
(LBI). Specifically, with a variable the splitting term, two estimators are
introduced and split apart, i.e. one is for feature selection (the sparse
estimator) and the other is for prediction (the dense estimator). Implemented
with Linearized Bregman Iteration (LBI), the solution path of both estimators
can be returned with different sparsity levels on the sparse estimator for the
selection of lesion features. Besides, the dense the estimator can additionally
leverage procedural bias to further improve prediction results. To test the
efficacy of our method, we conduct experiments on the simulated study and
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The validity and
the benefit of our model can be shown by the improvement of prediction results

VAEs and GANs do so in segments and produce the final level by stitching these
separately generated segments together. In this paper, we build on these
methods by training VAEs to learn a sequential model of segment generation such
that generated segments logically follow from prior segments. By further
combining the VAE with a classifier that determines whether to place the
generated segment to the top, bottom, left or right of the previous segment, we
obtain a pipeline that enables the generation of arbitrarily long levels that
progress in any of these four directions and are composed of segments that
logically follow one another. In addition to generating more coherent levels of
non-fixed length, this method also enables implicit blending of levels from
separate games that do not have similar orientation. We demonstrate our
approach using levels from Super Mario Bros., Kid Icarus and Mega Man, showing
that our method produces levels that are more coherent than previous latent
variable-based approaches and are capable of blending levels across games.

dimension. Each particle performs random walks on a one-dimensional ring in
such a way that the probability of hopping toward the nearest particle is $W=
[1 - \epsilon (x+\mu)^{-\sigma}]/2$ (the probability of moving away from its

by its nearest particle and each hopping is generally biased. On encounter, two
particles are immediately removed from the system. We first study the survival
probability and the mean spreading behaves in the long-time limit if there are
only two particles in the beginning. Then, we study how the density decays to
zero if all sites are occupied at the outset. We find that the asymptotic

The task knowledge provides the goals of each individual task within the

uses a body structural analogy to decompose a robot's body configuration into
different roles: body parts that are dominant for imitating the human motion

When humans analyze a scene, they usually prefer to describe image gist first,

a desirable scene graph should be also hierarchically constructed, and
introduce a new scheme for modeling scene graph. Concretely, a scene is
represented by a human-mimetic Hierarchical Entity Tree (HET) consisting of a

with a Hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (Hybrid-LSTM) which specifically encodes
hierarchy and siblings context to capture the structured information embedded

communication between localized spatially segregated dynamically active
signaling compartments that have a permeable boundary. Each cell secretes a
signaling chemical into the bulk region at a constant rate and receives a
feedback of the bulk chemical from the entire collection of cells. This global
feedback, which activates signaling pathways within the cells, modifies the
intracellular dynamics according to the external environment. The cell
secretion and global feedback are regulated by permeability parameters across
the cell membrane. For arbitrary reaction-kinetics within each cell, the method
of matched asymptotic expansions is used in the limit of small cell radius to
construct steady-state solutions of the PDE-ODE model, and to derive a globally
coupled nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem (GCEP) that characterizes the
linear stability properties of the steady-states. In the limit of large bulk
diffusivity an asymptotic analysis of the PDE-ODE model leads to a limiting ODE
system for the spatial average of the concentration in the bulk region that is
coupled to the intracellular dynamics within the cells. Results from the linear
stability theory and ODE dynamics are illustrated for Sel'kov
reaction-kinetics, where the kinetic parameters are chosen so that each cell is
quiescent when uncoupled from the bulk medium. For various specific spatial
configurations of cells, the linear stability theory is used to construct phase
diagrams in parameter space characterizing where a switch-like emergence of
intracellular oscillations can occur through a Hopf bifurcation.

pixel-wise spectral embedding approaches, SSME models the spatial and spectral

gradually shift the model training from the easier AT task to the harder NAT

introduce semi-autoregressive translation (SAT) as intermediate tasks. SAT

it reduces to AT when k = 1 and to NAT when k = N (N is the length of target

with different pacing functions and number of tasks trained at the same time.
We called our method as task-level curriculum learning for NAT (TCL-NAT).

  Re-Identification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data uncertainty in practical person reID is ubiquitous, hence it requires
not only learning the discriminative features, but also modeling the
uncertainty based on the input. This paper proposes to learn the sample
posterior and the class prior distribution in the latent space, so that not
only representative features but also the uncertainty can be built by the
model. The prior reflects the distribution of all data in the same class, and
it is the trainable model parameters. While the posterior is the probability
density of a single sample, so it is actually the feature defined on the input.
We assume that both of them are in Gaussian form. To simultaneously model them,
we put forward a distribution loss, which measures the KL divergence from the
posterior to the priors in the manner of supervised learning. In addition, we
assume that the posterior variance, which is essentially the uncertainty, is
supposed to have the second-order characteristic. Therefore, a $\Sigma-$net is
proposed to compute it by the high order representation from its input.
Extensive experiments have been carried out on Market1501, DukeMTMC, MARS and

animate the subject in the source images according to the motion in the driving
video. In our attention mechanism, dense similarities between the learned

retrieve the appearance information from the source images. Taking a different
approach from the well-studied warping based models, our attention-based model
has several advantages. By reassembling non-locally searched pieces from the
source contents, our approach can produce more realistic outputs. Furthermore,
our system can make use of multiple observations of the source appearance (e.g.
front and sides of faces) to make the results more accurate. To reduce the
training-testing discrepancy of the self-supervised learning, a novel
cross-identity training scheme is additionally introduced. With the training
scheme, our networks is trained to transfer motions between different subjects,
as in the real testing scenario. Experimental results validate that our method
produces visually pleasing results in various object domains, showing better
performances compared to previous works.

adaptive queries, such as substring, subsequence, and jumbled-index queries.
Such problems have applications, e.g., in computational biology. We provide a
number of new and improved bounds for exact string reconstruction for settings
where either the string or the queries are ""mixed-up"". For example, we show
that a periodic (i.e., ""mixed-up"") string, $S=p^kp'$, of smallest period $p$,
where $|p'|<|p|$, can be reconstructed using $O(\sigma|p|+\lg n)$ substring
queries, where $\sigma$ is the alphabet size, if $n=|S|$ is unknown. We also
show that we can reconstruct $S$ after having been corrupted by a small number
of errors $d$, measured by Hamming distance. In this case, we give an algorithm
that uses $O(d\sigma|p| + d|p|\lg \frac{n}{d+1})$ queries. In addition, we show
that a periodic string can be reconstructed using $2\sigma\lceil\lg n\rceil +
2|p|\lceil\lg \sigma\rceil$ subsequence queries, and that general strings can
be reconstructed using $2\sigma\lceil\lg n\rceil + n\lceil\lg \sigma\rceil$
subsequence queries, without knowledge of $n$ in advance. This latter result
improves the previous best, decades-old result, by Skiena and Sundaram.
Finally, we believe we are the first to study the exact-learning query
complexity for string reconstruction using jumbled-index queries, which are a
""mixed-up"" typeA of query that have received much attention of late.

significant scientific challenge, it remains an open question whether it is
feasible to discover alternatives to fundamental concepts of RL such as value
functions and temporal-difference learning. This paper introduces a new
meta-learning approach that discovers an entire update rule which includes both
'what to predict' (e.g. value functions) and 'how to learn from it' (e.g.
bootstrapping) by interacting with a set of environments. The output of this
method is an RL algorithm that we call Learned Policy Gradient (LPG). Empirical
results show that our method discovers its own alternative to the concept of

LPG generalises effectively to complex Atari games and achieves non-trivial

based on representing high-dimensional data using similarity-preserving binary
codes used for efficient indexing and search. It has recently been shown that
variational autoencoders, with Bernoulli latent representations parametrized by
neural nets, can be successfully trained to learn such codes in supervised and
unsupervised scenarios, improving on more traditional methods thanks to their
ability to handle the binary constraints architecturally. However, the scenario
where labels are scarce has not been studied yet.
  This paper investigates the robustness of hashing methods based on
variational autoencoders to the lack of supervision, focusing on two
semi-supervised approaches currently in use. The first augments the variational
autoencoder's training objective to jointly model the distribution over the
data and the class labels. The second approach exploits the annotations to
define an additional pairwise loss that enforces consistency between the
similarity in the code (Hamming) space and the similarity in the label space.
Our experiments show that both methods can significantly increase the hash
codes' quality. The pairwise approach can exhibit an advantage when the number
of labelled points is large. However, we found that this method degrades
quickly and loses its advantage when labelled samples decrease. To circumvent
this problem, we propose a novel supervision method in which the model uses its
label distribution predictions to implement the pairwise objective. Compared to
the best baseline, this procedure yields similar performance in fully
supervised settings but improves the results significantly when labelled data
is scarce. Our code is made publicly available at

adaptation. Furthermore, the increase of modalities brings more difficulty in
aligning feature distributions among multiple domains. To mitigate these
problems, we propose a Learning to Combine for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation
(LtC-MSDA) framework via exploring interactions among domains. In the nutshell,
a knowledge graph is constructed on the prototypes of various domains to
realize the information propagation among semantically adjacent
representations. On such basis, a graph model is learned to predict query
samples under the guidance of correlated prototypes. In addition, we design a
Relation Alignment Loss (RAL) to facilitate the consistency of categories'
relational interdependency and the compactness of features, which boosts
features' intra-class invariance and inter-class separability. Comprehensive
results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing methods with a remarkable margin. Our code is available at

propagation can substantially reduce the labeling cost, which has been a
critical issue in developing visual recognition models. Yet, how to propagate
labels reliably, especially on a dataset with unknown outliers, remains an open
question. Conventional methods such as linear diffusion lack the capability of
handling complex graph structures and may perform poorly when the seeds are
sparse. Latest methods based on graph neural networks would face difficulties
on performance drop as they scale out to noisy graphs. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose a new framework that allows labels to be propagated
reliably on large-scale real-world data. This framework incorporates (1) a
local graph neural network to predict accurately on varying local structures
while maintaining high scalability, and (2) a confidence-based path scheduler
that identifies outliers and moves forward the propagation frontier in a
prudent way. Experiments on both ImageNet and Ms-Celeb-1M show that our
confidence guided framework can significantly improve the overall accuracies of
the propagated labels, especially when the graph is very noisy.

keeping it private from the computational servers. The state-of-the-art
approaches to this problem rely on quantizing the data into a finite field, so
that the cryptographic approaches for secure multiparty computing can then be
employed. These approaches, however, can result in substantial accuracy losses
due to fixed-point representation of the data and computation overflows. To
address these critical issues, we propose a novel algorithm to solve the
problem when data is in the analog domain, e.g., the field of real/complex
numbers. We characterize the privacy of the data from both
information-theoretic and cryptographic perspectives, while establishing a
connection between the two notions in the analog domain. More specifically, the
well-known connection between the distinguishing security (DS) and the mutual
information security (MIS) metrics is extended from the discrete domain to the
continues domain. This is then utilized to bound the amount of information
about the data leaked to the servers in our protocol, in terms of the DS
metric, using well-known results on the capacity of single-input
multiple-output (SIMO) channel with correlated noise. It is shown how the
proposed framework can be adopted to do computation tasks when data is
represented using floating-point numbers. We then show that this leads to a
fundamental trade-off between the privacy level of data and accuracy of the
result. As an application, we also show how to train a machine learning model
while keeping the data as well as the trained model private. Then numerical
results are shown for experiments on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore,
experimental advantages are shown comparing to fixed-point implementations over
finite fields.

predictive since all relevant parameters for deviations from the exact scaling
solution vanish. Realistic particle physics and quantum gravity are compatible
with this setting. The non-linear restrictions for scaling solutions can
explain properties as an asymptotically vanishing cosmological constant or
dynamical dark energy that would seem to need fine tuning of parameters from a
perturbative viewpoint. As an example we discuss a pregeometry based on a
diffeomorphism invariant Yang-Mills theory. It is a candidate for an
ultraviolet completion of quantum gravity with a well behaved graviton

weight. However, to find informative parts of the video, it is necessary to
consider how all the frames of the video are related to each other. To this

recursive graph modeling networks for video summarization, termed SumGraph, to
represent a relation graph, where frames are regarded as nodes and nodes are
connected by semantic relationships among frames. Our networks accomplish this
through a recursive approach to refine an initially estimated graph to
correctly classify each node as a keyframe by reasoning the graph
representation via graph convolutional networks. To leverage SumGraph in a more
practical environment, we also present a way to adapt our graph modeling in an
unsupervised fashion. With SumGraph, we achieved state-of-the-art performance

knowledge discovery tasks such as classification or fact-checking. Here, we
consider a given set of vertices, called seed vertices, and focus on mining
their associated neighboring vertices, paths, and, more generally, path
patterns that involve classes of ontologies linked with knowledge graphs. Due
to the combinatorial nature and the increasing size of real-world knowledge
graphs, the task of mining these patterns immediately entails scalability
issues. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a pattern mining
approach that relies on a set of constraints (e.g., support or degree

mining of real-world knowledge graphs, we illustrate our approach with PGxLOD,

significant role in both industry and academy societies. Cellular
Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication technology has been one of the
prominent services for 5G. For C-V2X transmission mode, there is a newly
defined communication channel (sidelink) that can support direct C-V2X
communication. Direct C-V2X communication is a technology that allows vehicles
to communicate and share safety-related information with other traffic
participates directly without going through the cellular network. The C-V2X
data packet will be delivered to all traffic Users (UE) in the proximity of the
Transmitter (Tx). Some UEs might not successfully receive the data packets
during one transmission but the sidelink Tx is not able to check whether the
Receivers (Rxs) get the information or not due to the lack of feedback channel.
For enabling the strict requirements in terms of reliability and latency for
C-V2X communication, we propose and evaluate one retransmission scheme and
retransmission with different traffic speed scheme. These schemes try to
improve the reliability of the safety-related data by one blind retransmission
without requiring feedback. Although this retransmission scheme is essential to
C-V2X communication, the scheme has a limitation in the performance aspect
because of its redundant retransmission. Since radio resources for CV2X
communication are limited, we have to detect the effect of retransmission on
the performance of the communication system. To the end, the simulator for
evaluating the proposed schemes for the C-V2X communication has been
implemented, and the performances of the different communication schemes are
shown through the Packet Reception Ratio (PRR).

then increases again, until it diverges as the charge product approaches one.
If the charge $Q$ of the black hole is very small, the minimum of the ISCO

always increase the ISCO radius in this limit. Stable bound orbits of charged

which encourages network to better exploit the inherent 3D anatomical

fine-tuning from the Rubik's cube++ pre-trained weight can achieve better

human-computer interaction community. In a broad range of areas hand gesture
techniques can be applied specifically in sign language recognition, robotic
surgery, etc. In the process of hand gesture recognition, proper detection, and
tracking of the moving hand become challenging due to the varied shape and size
of the hand. Here the objective is to track the movement of the hand
irrespective of the shape, size, and color of the hand. And, for this, a motion
template guided by optical flow (OFMT) is proposed. OFMT is a compact
representation of the motion information of a gesture encoded into a single
image. In the experimentation, different datasets using bare hand with an open
palm, and folded palm wearing green-glove are used, and in both cases, we could
generate the OFMT images with equal precision. Recently, deep network-based
techniques have shown impressive improvements as compared to conventional
hand-crafted feature-based techniques. Moreover, in the literature, it is seen
that the use of different streams with informative input data helps to increase
the performance in the recognition accuracy. This work basically proposes a
two-stream fusion model for hand gesture recognition and a compact yet
efficient motion template based on optical flow. Specifically, the two-stream
network consists of two layers: a 3D convolutional neural network (C3D) that
takes gesture videos as input and a 2D-CNN that takes OFMT images as input. C3D
has shown its efficiency in capturing spatio-temporal information of a video.
Whereas OFMT helps to eliminate irrelevant gestures providing additional motion
information. Though each stream can work independently, they are combined with
a fusion scheme to boost the recognition results. We have shown the efficiency
of the proposed two-stream network on two databases.

overwhelms health service systems worldwide. Many patients suffer from systemic
life-threatening problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. Thus the
intelligent prognosis is in an urgent need to assist physicians to take an
early intervention, prevent the adverse outcome, and optimize the medical
resource allocation. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the
data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic
mechanisms, rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we
propose a deep-learning-based approach, CovidCare, which leverages the existing
electronic medical records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with
emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical
features based on massive existing EMR data via transfer learning. The
transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model's
representation behavior based on knowledge distillation, which embeds the
health status more comprehensively in the source dataset. We conduct the length
of stay prediction experiments for patients on a real-world COVID-19 dataset.
The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently
outperforms the comparative baseline methods. CovidCare also reveals that, 1)
hs-cTnI, hs-CRP and Platelet Counts are the most fatal biomarkers, whose
abnormal values usually indicate emergency adverse outcome. 2) Normal values of
gamma-GT, AP and eGFR indicate the overall improvement of health. The medical
findings extracted by CovidCare are empirically confirmed by human experts and
medical literatures.

to investigate the response of the continua at 3600\AA\ and 4250\AA\ and also
the H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ lines during WLFs modeled with radiative
hydrodynamics simulations. We take non-thermal electron beams as the energy

heating can clearly show enhancements in the continua at 3600\AA\ and 4250\AA\

a smaller spectral index, or a penumbral initial atmosphere leads to a stronger

Ly$\alpha$ line, however, it is more preferably enhanced in a quiet-Sun initial

notable that the continua at 3600\AA\ and 4250\AA\ and the H$\alpha$ line
exhibit a dimming at the beginning of the heating and reach their peak

An approach has been proposed to obtain the equilibrium in-plane structural
deformation and out-of-plane corrugation in moir\'{e} superlattices under
pressure. We find that the in-plane relaxation becomes much stronger under
higher pressure, while the corrugation height in each layer is maintained. The
comparison between band structures of relaxed and rigid structures demonstrates
that not only the gaps on the electron and hole sides ($\Delta_e$ and
$\Delta_h$) are significantly underestimated without relaxation but also the
detailed dispersions of the middle bands of rigid structures are rather
different from those of relaxed systems. $\Delta_e$ and $\Delta_h$ in TBG reach
maximum values around critical pressures with narrowest middle bands.
Topological transitions occur in TDBG under pressure with the middle valence
and conduction bands in one valley touching and their Chern numbers transferred
to each other. The pressure can also tune the gap at the neutrality point of
TDBG, which becomes closed for a pressure range and reopened under higher
pressure. The behavior of electronic structure of supertlattices under pressure
is sensitive to the twist angle $\theta$ with the critical pressures generally
increase with $\theta$.

Here, we report experimental investigation of BOs and WSL simulated with a
5-qubit programmable superconducting processor, of which the effective

to the system by properly tuning all individual qubits, we observe that the

near the neighborhood of their initial positions, which demonstrates the
characteristics of BOs and WSL. We verify that the WSL length is inversely
correlated to the potential gradient. Benefiting from the precise single-shot
simultaneous readout of all qubits in our experiments, we can also investigate
the thermal transport, which requires the joint measurement of more than one
qubits. The experimental results show that, as an essential characteristic for
BOs and WSL, the thermal transport is also blocked under a linear potential.

frames within a video are geometrically correlated via this common 3D map. In
order to fill a target inpainting area in a frame, it is straightforward to
transform pixels from other frames into the current one with correct occlusion.
Furthermore, we are able to fuse multiple videos through 3D point cloud
registration, making it possible to inpaint a target video with multiple source
videos. The motivation is to solve the long-time occlusion problem where an
occluded area has never been visible in the entire video. To our knowledge, we
are the first to fuse multiple videos for video inpainting. To verify the

bits, whose security is guaranteed by the law of physics. In practice, the
secret key rate of a QKD protocol is always lowered with the increasing of
channel distance, which severely limits the applications of QKD. Recently,
twin-field (TF) QKD has been proposed and intensively studied, since it can
beat the rate-distance limit and greatly increase the achievable distance of
QKD. Remarkalebly, K. Maeda et. al. proposed a simple finite-key analysis for
TF-QKD based on operator dominance condition. Although they showed that their
method is sufficient to beat the rate-distance limit, their operator dominance
condition is not general, i.e. it can be only applied in three decoy states
scenarios, which implies that its key rate cannot be increased by introducing
more decoy states, and also cannot reach the asymptotic bound even in case of
preparing infinite decoy states and optical pulses. Here, to bridge this gap,
we propose an improved finite-key analysis of TF-QKD through devising new
operator dominance condition. We show that by adding the number of decoy
states, the secret key rate can be furtherly improved and approach the
asymptotic bound. Our theory can be directly used in TF-QKD experiment to
obtain higher secret key rate. Our results can be directly used in experiments
to obtain higher key rates.

separate the impact of different temperature-dependent depopulation processes

TADF systems include radiative and non-radiative first- and second-order

these OLEDs. On the one hand, we evaluate the depopulation of intermolecular
exciplex triplet states via non-radiative direct triplet decay, RISC and
triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA). On the other hand, we determine the
contribution to EL from the formation of singlet exciplex states via polarons,
RISC and TTA. Our results show that TTA accounts for a significant part to
triplet depopulation and contributes to EL while limiting the overall device
quantum efficiency.

explicit bijection between two families of walks. The first family is formed by
what we name triangular walks, which are two-dimensional walks moving in six
directions (0{\deg}, 60{\deg}, 120{\deg}, 180{\deg}, 240{\deg}, 300{\deg}) and
confined within a triangle. The other family is comprised of two-colored
Motzkin paths with bounded height, in which the horizontal steps may be
forbidden at maximal height.
  We provide several new bijections. The first one is derived from a simple
inductive proof, taking advantage of a $2^n$-to-one function from generic
triangular walks to triangular walks only using directions 0{\deg}, 120{\deg},
240{\deg}. The second is based on an extension of Mortimer and Prellberg's
results to triangular walks starting not only at a corner of the triangle, but
at any point inside it. It has a linear-time complexity and is in fact
adjustable: by changing some set of parameters called a scaffolding, we obtain
a wide range of different bijections.
  Finally, we extend our results to higher dimensions. In particular, by
adapting the previous proofs, we discover an unexpected bijection between
three-dimensional walks in a pyramid and two-dimensional simple walks confined
in a bounded domain shaped like a waffle.

some aspects of these random edge ideals - linear resolution, unmixedness and
algebraic invariants like the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, projective
dimension and depth. We first show a double phase transition for existence of
linear presentation and resolution and determine the critical windows as well.
As a consequence, we obtain that except for a very specific choice of
parameters (i.e., $n,p := p(n)$), with high probability, a random edge ideal
has linear presentation if and only if it has linear resolution. This shows
certain conjectures hold true for large random graphs with high probability
even though the conjectures were shown to fail for determinstic graphs. Next,
we study asymptotic behaviour of some algebraic invariants - the
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, projective dimension and depth - of such random
edge ideals in the sparse regime (i.e., $p = \frac{\lambda}{n}, \lambda \in
(0,\infty)$). These invariants are studied using local weak convergence (or
Benjamini-Schramm convergence) and relating them to invariants on Galton-Watson
trees. We also show that when $p \to 0$ or $p \to 1$ fast enough, then with
high probability the edge ideals are unmixed and for most other choices of $p$,
these ideals are not unmixed with high probability. This is further progress
towards the conjecture that random monomial ideals are unlikely to have
Cohen-Macaulay property (see De Loera et al. 2019a,2019b) in the setting when
the number of variables goes to infinity but the degree is fixed.

Specifically, we start with considering linear time-varying systems and, for
these, we prove a time scale analogous of an upper bound due to Coppel. We make
use of this upper bound to give stability and input-to-state stability
conditions for linear time-varying systems. {Then, we consider nonlinear
time-varying dynamical systems on time scales and} establish a sufficient
condition for the convergence of the solutions. Finally, after linking our
results to the existence of a Lyapunov function, we make use of our approach to
study certain epidemic dynamics and complex networks. For the former, we give a
sufficient condition on the parameters of a SIQR model on time scales ensuring
that its solutions converge to the disease-free solution. For the latter, we
first give a sufficient condition for pinning controllability of complex time
scale networks and then use this condition to study certain collective opinion
dynamics. The theoretical results are complemented with simulations.

resulting optimal control representation admits a game theoretic perspective,
in which training residual networks can be interpreted as cooperative
trajectory optimization on state-augmented dynamical systems. This Game

previous work, yet generates a much complex update rule that better leverages

we can generate any band patterns with desired relative position and

simulated at higher Reynolds numbers, random noise, or localised vortical

Most existing approaches only rely on the image-text instance pair to learn

superficial associations contained in the instance pairwise data, with no
consideration of any external commonsense knowledge, which may hinder their
capabilities to reason the higher-level relationships between image and text.
In this paper, we propose a Consensus-aware Visual-Semantic Embedding (CVSE)
model to incorporate the consensus information, namely the commonsense
knowledge shared between both modalities, into image-text matching.
Specifically, the consensus information is exploited by computing the
statistical co-occurrence correlations between the semantic concepts from the
image captioning corpus and deploying the constructed concept correlation graph
to yield the consensus-aware concept (CAC) representations. Afterwards, CVSE
learns the associations and alignments between image and text based on the
exploited consensus as well as the instance-level representations for both
modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets verify that
the exploited consensus makes significant contributions to constructing more
meaningful visual-semantic embeddings, with the superior performances over the

generated by a single droplet impact on wetted walls. This approach enables a
smooth transition from the inertia-driven to the viscous-controlled regime of
crown propagation. The modelling strategy is based on the stagnation-point
flow, because it resembles closely the hydrodynamic flow in the lamella and
offers two main advantages. First, it allows a simple estimation of the
wall-film thinning rate, caused by the impulse transfer from the impacting
droplet to the wall film. Second, thanks to the self-similarity of the
solution, it enables a straightforward estimation of momentum losses during
film spreading along the wall. By incorporating this estimation into existing
inviscid models, an excellent agreement with experiments is found during the
entire crown elevation phase. In general, the analysis shows that momentum
losses due to viscous effects cannot be neglected during a significant portion
of crown propagation, particularly for thin wall films. The proposed
methodology paves the way for predicting the inception of crown bottom breakup
(CBB). In this case, the crown lamella disintegrates directly at its base due
to the spontaneous creation of holes that create a web-like structure in the
lamella prior to its break-up. Our theoretical analysis shows that this
premature break-up of the crown lamella is associated to local instability
effects, caused by the unbalance between inertial forces and surface tension.

potential between two electrons that form a bound singlet bipolaron state at

image analysis, which is indispensable for quantitative analysis. When
developing machine-learning based methods for automated segmentation, manual
annotations are usually used as the ground truth toward which the models learn
to mimic. While the bulky parts of the segmentation targets are relatively easy
to label, the peripheral areas are often difficult to handle due to ambiguous
boundaries and the partial volume effect, etc., and are likely to be labeled
with uncertainty. This uncertainty in labeling may, in turn, result in
unsatisfactory performance of the trained models. In this paper, we propose
superpixel-based label softening to tackle the above issue. Generated by
unsupervised over-segmentation, each superpixel is expected to represent a
locally homogeneous area. If a superpixel intersects with the annotation
boundary, we consider a high probability of uncertain labeling within this
area. Driven by this intuition, we soften labels in this area based on signed
distances to the annotation boundary and assign probability values within [0,
1] to them, in comparison with the original ""hard"", binary labels of either 0
or 1. The softened labels are then used to train the segmentation models
together with the hard labels. Experimental results on a brain MRI dataset and
an optical coherence tomography dataset demonstrate that this conceptually
simple and implementation-wise easy method achieves overall superior
segmentation performances to baseline and comparison methods for both 3D and 2D

conventional constituent quark models, and it is a candidate for having an
""exotic"" meson-baryon or ""penta-quark"" structure, similar to states recently
reported in the hidden charm sector.
  The $\Lambda(1405)$ can be produced in the reaction $\gamma p \rightarrow
K^+\Lambda(1405)$. The pure I=0 decay mode into $\Sigma^0\pi^0$ is prohibited
for the mass-overlapping $\Sigma(1385)$. Combining a large aperture forward
magnetic spectrometer and a central BGO crystal calorimeter, the BGO-OD
experiment is ideally suited to measure this decay with the $K^+$ in the

investigate several topological aspects of the $LT$-equivariant index theory
for proper $LT$-spaces, where proper $LT$-spaces are infinite-dimensional
manifolds equipped with ""proper cocompact"" $LT$-actions. Concretely, we
introduce ""$\mathcal{R}KK$-theory for infinite-dimensional manifolds"", and by
using it, we formulate an infinite-dimensional version of the $KK$-theoretical
Poincar\'e duality homomorphism, and an infinite-dimensional version of the
$\mathcal{R}KK$-theory counterpart of the assembly map, for proper $LT$-spaces.
  The left hand side of the Poincar\'e duality homomorphism is formulated by
the ""$C^*$-algebra of a Hilbert manifold"" introduced by Guoliang Yu. Thus, the
result of this paper suggests that this construction carries some topological
information of Hilbert manifolds. In order to formulate the assembly map in a
classical way, we need crossed products, which require an invariant measure of
a group. However, there is an alternative formula to define them using
generalized fixed-point algebras. We will adopt it as the definition of
""crossed products by $LT$"".

high-dimensional datasets using $k$NN graphs. To find the low-dimensional
embedding, these algorithms combine an attractive force between neighboring
pairs of points with a repulsive force between all points. One of the most
popular examples of such algorithms is t-SNE. Here we empirically show that
changing the balance between the attractive and the repulsive forces in t-SNE
using the exaggeration parameter yields a spectrum of embeddings, which is
characterized by a simple trade-off: stronger attraction can better represent
continuous manifold structures, while stronger repulsion can better represent
discrete cluster structures and yields higher $k$NN recall. We find that UMAP
embeddings correspond to t-SNE with increased attraction; mathematical analysis
shows that this is because the negative sampling optimisation strategy employed
by UMAP strongly lowers the effective repulsion. Likewise, ForceAtlas2,
commonly used for visualizing developmental single-cell transcriptomic data,
yields embeddings corresponding to t-SNE with the attraction increased even
more. At the extreme of this spectrum lie Laplacian Eigenmaps. Our results
demonstrate that many prominent neighbor embedding algorithms can be placed

evaluating the tails of the area distributions, sometimes with account of

ancestor (LCA) of two vertices $u$ and $v$ is a common ancestor $w$ of $u$ and
$v$ such that no descendant of $w$ has the same property. In this paper, we
consider the problem of computing an LCA, if any, for all pairs of vertices in
a DAG. The fastest known algorithms for this problem exploit fast matrix
multiplication subroutines and have running times ranging from $O(n^{2.687})$
[Bender et al.~SODA'01] down to $O(n^{2.615})$ [Kowaluk and Lingas~ICALP'05]
and $O(n^{2.569})$ [Czumaj et al.~TCS'07]. Somewhat surprisingly, all those
bounds would still be $\Omega(n^{2.5})$ even if matrix multiplication could be
solved optimally (i.e., $\omega=2$). This appears to be an inherent barrier for
all the currently known approaches, which raises the natural question on
whether one could break through the $O(n^{2.5})$ barrier for this problem.
  In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively: in particular, we
present an $\tilde O(n^{2.447})$ ($\tilde O(n^{7/3})$ for $\omega=2$) algorithm
for finding an LCA for all pairs of vertices in a DAG, which represents the
first improvement on the running times for this problem in the last 13 years. A
key tool in our approach is a fast algorithm to partition the vertex set of the
transitive closure of $G$ into a collection of $O(\ell)$ chains and $O(n/\ell)$
antichains, for a given parameter $\ell$. As usual, a chain is a path while an
antichain is an independent set. We then find, for all pairs of vertices, a
\emph{candidate} LCA among the chain and antichain vertices, separately. The
first set is obtained via a reduction to min-max matrix multiplication. The
computation of the second set can be reduced to Boolean matrix multiplication
similarly to previous results on this problem. We finally combine the two
solutions together in a careful (non-obvious) manner.

  with States","The paper submitted to CONCUR 2020",,,,"cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A vector addition system with states (VASS) consists of a finite set of
states and counters. A transition changes the current state to the next state,
and every counter is either incremented, or decremented, or left unchanged. A
state and value for each counter is a configuration; and a computation is an
infinite sequence of configurations with transitions between successive
configurations. A probabilistic VASS consists of a VASS along with a
probability distribution over the transitions for each state. Qualitative
properties such as state and configuration reachability have been widely
studied for VASS. In this work we consider multi-dimensional long-run average
objectives for VASS and probabilistic VASS. For a counter, the cost of a
configuration is the value of the counter; and the long-run average value of a
computation for the counter is the long-run average of the costs of the
configurations in the computation. The multi-dimensional long-run average
problem given a VASS and a threshold value for each counter, asks whether there
is a computation such that for each counter the long-run average value for the
counter does not exceed the respective threshold. For probabilistic VASS,
instead of the existence of a computation, we consider whether the expected
long-run average value for each counter does not exceed the respective
threshold. Our main results are as follows: we show that the multi-dimensional
long-run average problem (a) is NP-complete for integer-valued VASS; (b) is
undecidable for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters); and (c) can
be solved in polynomial time for probabilistic integer-valued VASS, and
probabilistic natural-valued VASS when all computations are non-terminating.

computer vision. In the VIPriors challenge, only very limited numbers of
training samples are allowed, leading to that the current state-of-the-art and
deep learning-based semantic segmentation techniques are hard to train well. To
overcome this shortcoming, therefore, we propose edge-preserving guidance to
obtain the extra prior information, to avoid the overfitting under small-scale
training dataset. First, a two-channeled convolutional layer is concatenated to
the last layer of the conventional semantic segmentation network. Then, an edge
map is calculated from the ground truth by Sobel operation and followed by
concatenating a hard-thresholding operation to indicate whether the pixel is
the edge or not. Then, the two-dimensional cross-entropy loss is adopted to
calculate the loss between the predicted edge map and its ground truth, termed
as an edge-preserving loss. In this way, the continuity of boundaries between
different instances can be forced by the proposed edge-preserving loss.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve excellent
performance under small-scale training set, compared to state-of-the-art
semantic segmentation techniques.

the Cityscapes dataset, there are more accurate boundary groundtruths
available, so that BMask R-CNN obtains remarkable improvements over Mask R-CNN.

  In the case of the second language we consider three denotational semantics,
with varying degrees of correlation between possible program values and
expected rewards. The operational semantics combine the usual semantics of
standard constructs with optimization over spaces of possible execution
strategies. The denotational semantics, which are compositional, rely on the
selection monad, to handle choice, augmented with an auxiliary monad to handle
other effects, such as rewards or probability.
  We establish adequacy theorems that the two semantics coincide in all cases.
We also prove full abstraction at base types, with varying notions of
observation in the probabilistic case corresponding to the various degrees of
correlation. We present axioms for choice combined with rewards and

filter in conventional FRM approach are replaced by a power complementary and
linear phase FB. Additionally, a new masking strategy is proposed by which an
M-channel FB can be designed by alternately masking even channels and odd
channels. By using this masking strategy, it is only necessary to alternately
mask even channels and odd channels by the two masking filters while modulating
them over the multiple spectra replicas appearing in [0,2$\pi$] to generate
uniform ModFRM FB. Also, reconfigurability of filter bank can be achieved by
adjusting the interpolation values appropriately, to obtain more masking
responses. To reduce the overall implementation complexity, masking filters are
optimized using the interpolated FIR (IFIR) technique. The results indicate
that the proposed method requires substantially less multipliers in comparison
to the reconfigurable FB existing in literature. Finally, non-uniform FB are
generated from the uniform FB by combining nearby channels. The proposed
non-uniform ModFRM FB is used for the extraction of different communication
standards in the software defined radio (SDR) channelizer. When more channels
are to be extracted, the proposed scheme was able to achieve a reduced hardware
complexity in comparison to other filter bank based SDR channelizers.

Efimov effect and ergodic evolution. After an initial period of rapid quantum
depletion, a universal prethermal stage is established characterized by a
kinetic temperature and an emergent Bogoliubov dispersion law while the
microscopic degrees of freedom remain far-from-equilibrium. Integrability is
then broken by higher-order interaction terms in the many-body Hamiltonian,
leading to a momentum-dependent departure from power law to decaying
exponential behavior of the occupation numbers at large momentum. We find also
signatures of the Efimov effect in the many-body dynamics and make a precise
identification between the observed beating phenomenon and the binding energy
of an Efimov trimer. Throughout the work, our predictions for a uniform gas are
quantitatively compared with experimental results for quenched unitary Bose
gases in uniform potentials.

real-world images and synthetic renderings in the RGB or mask space, we compare
them in a feature space optimized for 3D pose refinement. Second, we introduce
a novel differentiable renderer that learns to approximate the rasterization
backward pass from data instead of relying on a hand-crafted algorithm. For
this purpose, we predict deep cross-domain correspondences between RGB images
and 3D model renderings in the form of what we call geometric correspondence
fields. These correspondence fields serve as pixel-level gradients which are
analytically propagated backward through the rendering pipeline to perform a
gradient-based optimization directly on the 3D pose. In this way, we precisely
align 3D models to objects in RGB images which results in significantly
improved 3D pose estimates. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Pix3D

electrons. We show that the Metis VL channel will detect a mixture of both,
with predominance of the helium emission at intermediate temperatures between
30 - 50,000 K. Then we use the code HAZEL to compute the degree of linear
polarization detectable in the VL channel. This is a mixture of D$_3$

in the presence of a magnetic field and the polarization axis is rotated (Hanle

Based on the offline space and offline solution, we calculate online basis

reduce relative errors substantially. Numerical examples are provided to

part, we investigate the conditions for consistent gauging of sigma models in
the presence of a nonclosed 3-form. In the Abelian case, we find that the
target of the gauged theory has the structure of a contact Courant algebroid,
twisted by a 3-form and two 2-forms. Gauge invariance constrains the theory to
(small) Dirac structures of the contact Courant algebroid. In the non-Abelian

transitive Courant algebroids and their corresponding Dirac structures. In the
second part of the paper, we study two-dimensional sigma models related to
Jacobi structures. The latter generalise Poisson and contact geometry in the
presence of an additional vector field. We demonstrate that one can construct a
sigma model whose gauge symmetry is controlled by a Jacobi structure, and
moreover we twist the model by a 3-form. This construction is then the analogue

hence vulnerable to large-scale code-reuse attacks. Compiler-based
diversification improves the resilience and security of software systems by
automatically generating different assembly code versions of a given program.
Existing techniques are efficient but do not have a precise control over the
quality of the generated code variants.
  This paper introduces Diversity by Construction (DivCon), a constraint-based
compiler approach to software diversification. Unlike previous approaches,
DivCon allows users to control and adjust the conflicting goals of diversity
and code quality. A key enabler is the use of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)
to generate highly diverse assembly code efficiently.
  Experiments using two popular compiler benchmark suites confirm that there is
a trade-off between quality of each assembly code version and diversity of the
entire pool of versions. Our results show that DivCon allows users to trade
between these two properties by generating diverse assembly code for a range of
quality bounds. In particular, the experiments show that DivCon is able to
mitigate code-reuse attacks effectively while delivering near-optimal code (<
10% optimality gap).
  For constraint programming researchers and practitioners, this paper
demonstrates that LNS is a valuable technique for finding diverse solutions.
For security researchers and software engineers, DivCon extends the scope of
compiler-based diversification to performance-critical and resource-constrained
applications.

rather the passenger waits for the first driver, from a population of

two-stage Bayesian hierarchical model to overcome the considerable

flow, whose predictions are aggregated at the daily level to compensate the

sub-daily (e.g. hourly) predictions of the passenger waiting times. We

jetted radio galaxies form the low-luminosity tail of the distribution,
suggestive that the sequence can be extended to the young jetted galaxy
populations. We observe a significant difference in the shape of Compton and
synchrotron spectra: significant anti-correlation (r ~ -0.80) exists between
the broadband Compton and synchrotron spectral indices. Furthermore, the
broadband spectral indices vary significantly with redshift (z) at low redshift
(z less than 0.3) and remain fairly constant at high (z greater than or egual
to 0.3) redshift. The trend of the variations suggests a form of the
evolutionary connection between subclasses of blazars. Thus, while the
selection effect may be significant at low redshift, an evolutionary sequence
can also be important. Our results are not only consistent with a unified
scheme for blazars and their young jetted galaxy counterparts but also suggest
that the broadband spectral sequence of blazars is not a secondary effect of

coordinates of dynamic epidemic models are coupled, the presence of unobserved
coordinates leads to a statistically difficult problem. The aim is to propose
an easy-to-use and general inference method that is able to tackle these

two-layer model is constructed. Via a diffusion-based approach, a Gaussian
approximation of the epidemic density-dependent Markovian jump process is
obtained, representing the state model. The observational model, consisting of
noisy observations of certain model coordinates, is approximated by Gaussian

using Kalman filtering recursion is developed to estimate parameters of both
the state and observational models. The performance of estimators of key model
parameters is assessed on simulated data of SIR epidemic dynamics for different
scenarios with respect to the population size and the number of observations.
This performance is compared with that obtained using the well-known maximum
iterated filtering method. Finally, the inference method is applied to a real
data set on an influenza outbreak in a British boarding school in 1978.

observation with the CoRoT satellite. An analysis of its light curve revealed
several independent p and g pulsation modes, in addition to showing that the
amplitude of the modes is directly correlated with the outburst. We modelled
the results obtained with CoRoT. We modelled the flattening of the structure of
the star due to rapid rotation in two ways: Chandrasekhar-Milne's expansion and
2D structure computed with ROTORC. We then modelled kappa-driven pulsations. We
also adapted the formalism of the excitation and amplitude of stochastically
excited gravito-inertial modes to rapidly rotating stars, and we modelled those
pulsations as well. We find that while pulsation p modes are excited by the
kappa mechanism, the observed g modes are a result of stochastic excitation. In
contrast, g and r waves are stochastically excited in the convective core and
transport angular momentum to the surface, increasing its rotation rate. This
destabilises the external layers of the star, which then emits transient
stochastically excited g waves. These transient waves produce most of the
low-frequency signal detected in the CoRoT data and ignite the outburst. During
this unstable phase, p modes disappear at the surface because their cavity is
broken. Following the outburst and ejection of the surface layer, relaxation
occurs, making the transient g waves disappear and p modes reappear. This work
includes the first coherent model of stochastically excited gravito-inertial
pulsation modes in a rapidly rotating Be star. It provides an explanation for
the correlation between the variation in the amplitude of frequencies detected
in the CoRoT data and the occurrence of an outburst. This scenario could apply
to other pulsating Be stars, providing an explanation to the long-standing
questions surrounding Be outbursts and disks.

cross-disciplinary teams that can translate machine learning research into

standards focused specifically on Data Science projects. Aims: This study
investigates the extent to which Data Science projects follow code standards.
In particular, which standards are followed, which are ignored, and how does
this differ to traditional software projects? Method: We compare a corpus of
1048 Open-Source Data Science projects to a reference group of 1099 non-Data
Science projects with a similar level of quality and maturity. Results: Data
Science projects suffer from a significantly higher rate of functions that use
an excessive numbers of parameters and local variables. Data Science projects
also follow different variable naming conventions to non-Data Science projects.
Conclusions: The differences indicate that Data Science codebases are distinct
from traditional software codebases and do not follow traditional software
engineering conventions. Our conjecture is that this may be because traditional
software engineering conventions are inappropriate in the context of Data
Science projects.

approaches to quantum gravity. A promising example is tensorial group field
theory but its phase diagram remains an open issue. The results of recent
attempts in terms of the functional renormalization group method remain
inconclusive since they are restricted to truncations of low order. We overcome
this barrier with a local-potential approximation for $\textrm{U}(1)$ tensor
fields at arbitrary rank $r$ focusing on a specific class of so-called
cyclic-melonic interactions. Projecting onto constant field configurations, we
obtain the full set of renormalization-group flow equations. At large cut-offs
we find equivalence with $r-1$ dimensional $\textrm{O}(N)$ scalar field theory
in the large-$N$ limit, modified by a tensor-specific, relatively large
anomalous dimension. However, on small length scales there is equivalence with
the corresponding scalar field theory with vanishing dimension and, thus, no
phase transition. This is confirmed by numerical analysis of the full
non-autonomous equations where we always find symmetry restoration. The
essential reason for this effect are isolated zero modes. This result should
therefore be true for tensor field theories on any compact domain and including
any tensor-invariant interactions. Thus, group field theories with non-compact
degrees of freedom will be necessary to describe a phase transition to
continuum spacetime.

temperature and polarization the BAO data provide nearly an order of magnitude
improvement on curvature constraints. The RSD measurements indicate a growth
rate that is consistent with predictions from Planck primary data and with
General Relativity. When combining the results of SDSS BAO and RSD with
external data, all multiple-parameter extensions remain consistent with a
$\Lambda$CDM model. Regardless of cosmological model, the precision on
$\Omega_\Lambda$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$, remains at roughly 1\%, showing
changes of less than 0.6\% in the central values between models. The inverse
distance ladder measurement under a o$w_0w_a$CDM yields $H_0= 68.20 \pm 0.81 \,
\rm km\, s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$, remaining in tension with several direct
determination methods. (abridged)

simulations to determine the selection function of a galaxy redshift survey and
calculate 3-dimensional (3D) clustering statistics. This is a forward model of
the process by which images of the night sky are transformed into a 3D
large--scale structure catalog. The photometric pipeline automatically detects
and models galaxies and then generates a catalog of such galaxies with detailed
information for each one of them, including their location, redshift and so on.
Systematic biases in the imaging data are therefore imparted into the catalogs
and must be accounted for in any scientific analysis of their information
content.
  Obiwan simulates this process for samples selected from the Legacy Surveys
imaging data. This imaging data will be used to select target samples for the
next-generation Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) experiment. Here,
we apply Obiwan to a portion of the SDSS-IV extend Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey Emission Line Galaxies (ELG) sample. Systematic biases in
the data are clearly identified and removed. We compare the 3D clustering
results to those obtained by the map--based approach applied to the full eBOSS
sample. We find the results are consistent, thereby validating the eBOSS ELG
catalogs, presented in Raichoor(2020), used to obtain cosmological results.

The accuracy of these measurements is confirmed using an extensive set of mock

Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). Derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) -IV Data Release 16 (DR16), these catalogs provide the data samples,
corrected for observational systematics, and random positions sampling the
survey selection function. Combined, they allow large-scale clustering
measurements suitable for testing cosmological models. We describe the methods
used to create these catalogs for the eBOSS DR16 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and
Quasar samples. The quasar catalog contains 343,708 redshifts with $0.8 < z <
2.2$ over 4,808\,deg$^2$. We combine 174,816 eBOSS LRG redshifts over
4,242\,deg$^2$ in the redshift interval $0.6 < z < 1.0$ with SDSS-III BOSS LRGs
in the same redshift range to produce a combined sample of 377,458 galaxy
redshifts distributed over 9,493\,deg$^2$. Improved algorithms for estimating
redshifts allow that 98 per cent of LRG observations result in a successful
redshift, with less than one per cent catastrophic failures ($\Delta z > 1000$
${\rm km~s}^{-1}$). For quasars, these rates are 95 and 2 per cent (with
$\Delta z > 3000$ ${\rm km~s}^{-1}$). We apply corrections for trends between
the number densities of our samples and the properties of the imaging and
spectroscopic data. For example, the quasar catalog obtains a $\chi^2$/DoF$=
776/10$ for a null test against imaging depth before corrections and a
$\chi^2$/DoF$=6/8$ after. The catalogs, combined with careful consideration of
the details of their construction found here-in, allow companion papers to
present cosmological results with negligible impact from observational
systematic uncertainties.

analysis of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data
Release 16 (DR16) galaxy sample. The challenges are primarily based on
high-fidelity catalogs constructed from the Outer Rim simulation - a large box
size realization (3 Gpc/h) characterized by an unprecedented combination of
volume and mass resolution, down to 1.85x10^9 M_sun/h. We generate synthetic
galaxy mocks by populating Outer Rim halos with a variety of halo occupation
distribution (HOD) schemes of increasing complexity, spanning different
redshift intervals. We then assess the performance of three complementary
redshift space distortion (RSD) models in configuration and Fourier space,
adopted for the analysis of the complete DR16 eBOSS sample of Luminous Red
Galaxies (LRGs). We find all the methods mutually consistent, with comparable
systematic errors on the Alcock-Paczynski parameters and the growth of
structure, and robust to different HOD prescriptions - thus validating the
robustness of the models and the pipelines used for the baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) and full shape clustering analysis. In particular, all the
techniques are able to recover a_par and a_perp to within 0.9%, and fsig8 to
within 1.5%. As a by-product of our work, we are also able to gain interesting
insights on the galaxy-halo connection. Our study is relevant for the final
eBOSS DR16 `consensus cosmology', as the systematic error budget is informed by
testing the results of analyses against these high-resolution mocks. In
addition, it is also useful for future large-volume surveys, since similar
mock-making techniques and systematic corrections can be readily extended to
model for instance the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) galaxy
sample.

galaxies targeted by spectroscopic surveys. Accurate prediction of clustering
of galaxies will require understanding galaxy physics which is a very hard and
highly non-linear problem. Approximate models of redshift space distortion
(RSD) take a perturbative approach to solve the evolution of dark matter and
galaxies in the universe.
  In this paper we focus on eBOSS emission line galaxies (ELGs) which live in
intermediate mass haloes. We create a series of mock catalogues using haloes
from the Multidark and {\sc Outer Rim} dark matter only N-body simulations. Our
mock catalogues include various effects inspired by baryonic physics such as
assembly bias and the characteristics of satellite galaxies kinematics,
dynamics and statistics deviating from dark matter particles.
  We analyse these mocks using the TNS RSD model in Fourier space and the CLPT
in configuration space. We conclude that these two RSD models provide an
unbiased measurement of redshift space distortion within the statistical error
of our mocks. We obtain the conservative theoretical systematic uncertainty of
$3.3\%$, $1.8\%$ and $1.5\%$ in $f\sigma_8$, $\alpha_{\parallel}$ and
$\alpha_{\bot}$ respectively for the TNS and CLPT models. We note that the
estimated theoretical systematic error is an order of magnitude smaller than
the statistical error of the eBOSS ELG sample and hence are negligible for the
purpose of the current eBOSS ELG analysis.

constrain the expansion history of the Universe and the growth rate of

fibre-fed spectrograph on the Sloan telescope prevent two fibres being placed
closer than 62"", the fibre-collision scale, in a single pass of the instrument
on the sky. These `fibre collisions' strongly correlate with the intrinsic
clustering of targets and can bias measurements of the two-point correlation
function resulting in a systematic error on the inferred values of the
cosmological parameters. We combine the new techniques of
pairwise-inverse-probability weighting and the angular up-weighting to correct
the clustering measurements for the effect of fibre collisions. Using mock
catalogues we show that our corrections provide unbiased measurements, within
data precision, of both the projected correlation function $w_p$ and the
multipoles $\xi^l$ of the redshift-space correlation functions down to
0.1Mpc/h, regardless of the tracer type. We apply the corrections to the eBOSS
DR16 catalogues. We find that, on scales greater than s~20Mpc/h for $\xi^l$, as
used to make BAO and large-scale RSD measurements, approximate methods such as
Nearest-Neighbour up-weighting are sufficiently accurate given the statistical
errors of the data. Using the PIP method, for the first time for a
spectroscopic program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we are able to
successfully access the 1-halo term in the 3D clustering measurements down to
~0.1Mpc/h scales. Our results will therefore allow studies that use the
small-scale clustering measurements to strengthen the constraints on both
cosmological parameters and the halo-occupation distribution models.

statistical and systematical uncertainties, we measure the linear growth rate
of structure $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.35\pm0.10$, the Hubble distance
$D_H(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 19.1^{+1.9}_{-2.1}$ and the comoving angular
diameter distance $D_M(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 19.9\pm1.0$. These results
are in agreement with the Fourier space analysis, leading to consensus values
of: $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.315\pm0.095$, $D_H(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} =
19.6^{+2.2}_{-2.1}$ and $D_M(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 19.5\pm1.0$,
consistent with $\Lambda$CDM model predictions with Planck parameters.

how ELGs populate haloes. We explore the shape of the average HOD, the fraction
of satellite galaxies, their probability distribution function (PDF), and their
density and velocity profiles. Our baseline HOD shape was fitted to a
semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution, with a decaying
occupation of central ELGs at high halo masses. We consider Poisson and
sub/super-Poissonian PDFs for satellite assignment. We model both NFW and
particle profiles for satellite positions, also allowing for decreased
concentrations. We model velocities with the virial theorem and particle
velocity distributions. Additionally, we introduce a velocity bias and a net
infall velocity. We study how these choices impact the clustering statistics
while keeping the number density and bias fixed to that from eBOSS ELGs. The
projected correlation function, $w_p$, captures most of the effects from the
PDF and satellites profile. The quadrupole, $\xi_2$, captures most of the
effects coming from the velocity profile. We find that the impact of the mean
HOD shape is subdominant relative to the rest of choices. We fit the clustering

games, which are a general class of strategic games used to succinctly
represent the players' private costs. There is a finite set of resources and
the strategy set of each player corresponds to a set of subsets of resources.
The cost of a resource is an arbitrary function that depends on the load vector
of the resources in a specified neighborhood. As our main result, we give
complete characterizations of the cost functions guaranteeing the existence of
pure Nash equilibria for weighted and unweighted players, respectively.
  1. For unweighted players, pure Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist for
any choice of the players' strategy space if and only if the cost of each
resource is an arbitrary function of the load of the resource itself and linear
in the load of all other resources where the linear coefficients of mutual
influence of different resources are symmetric.
  2. For games with weighted players, pure Nash equilibria are guaranteed to
exist for any choice of the players' strategy space if and only if the cost of
a resource is linear in all resource loads, and the linear factors of mutual
influence are symmetric, or there is no interaction among resources and the
cost is an exponential function of the local resource load.
  3. For the special case that the players' strategy sets are matroids, we show
that pure Nash equilibria exist under a local monotonicity property, even when
cost functions are player-specific. We point out an application of this result
to bilevel load balancing games, which are motivated by the study of network
infrastructures that are resilient against external attackers and internal
congestion effects.
  4. Finally, we derive hardness results for deciding whether a given strategy
is a pure Nash equilibrium for network routing games and matroid games,
respectively.

consequence of interaction with the interior over geological time. We aim to
quantify the influence of planetary bulk composition on the
interior--atmosphere evolution for Earth-sized terrestrial planets to aid in
the interpretation of future observations of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres.
Methods: We used a geochemical model to determine the major-element composition
of planetary interiors (MgO, FeO, and SiO2) following the crystallization of a
magma ocean after planet formation, predicting a compositional profile of the
interior as an initial condition for our long-term thermal evolution model. Our
1D evolution model predicts the pressure-temperature structure of the interior,
which we used to evaluate near-surface melt production and subsequent volatile
outgassing. Volatiles are exchanged between the interior and atmosphere
according to mass conservation. Results: Based on stellar compositions reported
in the Hypatia catalog, we predict that about half of rocky exoplanets have a
mantle that convects as a single layer (whole-mantle convection), and the other
half exhibit double-layered convection due to the presence of a mid-mantle
compositional boundary. Double-layered convection is more likely for planets
with high bulk planetary Fe-content and low Mg/Si-ratio. We find that planets
with low Mg/Si-ratio tend to cool slowly because their mantle viscosity is
high. Accordingly, low-Mg/Si planets also tend to lose volatiles swiftly
through extensive melting. Moreover, the dynamic regime of the lithosphere
(plate tectonics vs.\ stagnant lid) has a first-order influence on the thermal
evolution and volatile cycling. These results suggest that the composition of
terrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres can provide information on the dynamic
regime of the lithosphere and the thermo-chemical evolution of the interior.

Here, we utilize the photogravitational planar restricted three-body problem in
one-planet giant branch systems in order to characterize the orbits of grains
as the parent star luminosity and mass undergo drastic changes. We perform a
detailed dynamical analysis of the character of grain orbits (collisional,
escape, or bounded) as a function of location and energy throughout giant
branch evolution. We find that for stars with main-sequence masses of
$2.0M_{\odot}$, giant branch evolution, combined with the presence of a planet,
ubiquitously triggers escape in grains smaller than about 1 mm, while leaving
grains larger than about 5 cm bound to the star. This result is applicable for
systems with either a terrestrial or giant planet, is largely independent of
the location of the planet, and helps establish a radiative size threshold for
escape of small particles in giant branch planetary systems.

scheduling problem. We must schedule a number of jobs on $m$ machines, where
each job has unit length, and the graph of precedence constraints consists of a
set of chains. Each precedence constraint is labelled with an integer that
denotes the exact (or minimum) delay between the jobs. We study different
cases; delays can be given in unary and in binary, and the case that we have a
single machine is discussed separately. We consider the complexity of this
problem parameterized by the number of chains, and by the thickness of the
instance, which is the maximum number of chains whose intervals between release
date and deadline overlap.
  We show that this scheduling problem with exact delays in unary is
$W[t]$-hard for all $t$, when parameterized by the thickness, even when we have
a single machine ($m = 1$). When parameterized by the number of chains, this
problem is $W[1]$-complete when we have a single or a constant number of
machines, and $W[2]$-complete when the number of machines is a variable. The
problem with minimum delays, given in unary, parameterized by the number of
chains (and as a simple corollary, also when parameterized by the thickness) is
$W[1]$-hard for a single or a constant number of machines, and $W[2]$-hard when
the number of machines is variable.
  With a dynamic programming algorithm, one can show membership in XP for exact

thickness or number of chains. For a single machine, with exact delays in

with branching and solving a system of difference constraints. For all other

results can be readily applied and provide a unified treatment to many
different problems in statistics and machine learning involving spectral
learning of higher-order orthogonally decomposable tensors. In particular, we
illustrate the implications of our bounds in the context of high dimensional
tensor SVD problem, and how it can be used to derive optimal rates of
convergence for spectral learning.

communities that are influenced by stochastic temporal environmental
fluctuations. The results apply to discrete time (stochastic difference
equations), continuous time (stochastic differential equations), compact and
non-compact state spaces and degenerate or non-degenerate noise. In addition,
we can also include in the dynamics auxiliary variables that model
environmental fluctuations, population structure, eco-environmental feedbacks
or other internal or external factors.
  We are able to significantly generalize the recent discrete time results by
Benaim and Schreiber (Journal of Mathematical Biology '19) to non-compact state
spaces, and we provide stronger persistence and extinction results. The
continuous time results by Hening and Nguyen (Annals of Applied Probability
'18) are strengthened to include degenerate noise and auxiliary variables.
  Using the general theory, we work out several examples. In discrete time, we
classify the dynamics when there are one or two species, and look at the Ricker
model, Log-normally distributed offspring models, lottery models, discrete
Lotka-Volterra models as well as models of perennial and annual organisms. For
the continuous time setting we explore models with a resource variable,
stochastic replicator models, and three dimensional Lotka-Volterra models.

stability of high-order (including split-form) summation-by-parts methods, with
e.g. two-point entropy-conserving fluxes, approximating non-linear conservation
laws. Our main finding is that local energy stability, i.e., the numerical
growth rate does not exceed the growth rate of the continuous problem, is not
guaranteed even when the scheme is non-linearly stable and that this may have
adverse implications for simulation results. We show that entropy-conserving
two-point fluxes are inherently locally energy unstable, as they can be
dissipative or anti-dissipative. Unfortunately, these fluxes are at the core of
many commonly used high-order entropy-stable extensions, including split-form
summation-by-parts discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods (or spectral
collocation methods). For the non-linear Burgers equation, we further
demonstrate numerically that such schemes cause exponential growth of errors
during the simulation. Furthermore, we encounter a similar abnormal behaviour
for the compressible Euler equations, for a smooth exact solution of a density
wave. Finally, for the same case, we demonstrate numerically that other
commonly known split-forms, such as the Kennedy and Gruber splitting, are also
locally energy unstable.

We demonstrate, at a temperature above one Kelvin, single-qubit rotations

adiabatic, diabatic and composite sequences to optimize the qubit control
fidelity and the gate time. We find two-qubit gates that can be executed within

hardware that can be embedded with classical electronics for quantum integrated

Networks (GCNs). However, the computing of GCN usually requires a large memory
space for keeping the entire graph. In consequence, GCN is not flexible enough,
especially for large scale graphs in complex real-world applications.
Fortunately, methods based on Matrix Factorization (MF) naturally support
constructing mini-batches, and thus are more friendly to distributed computing
compared with GCN. Accordingly, in this paper, we analyze the connections
between GCN and MF, and simplify GCN as matrix factorization with unitization
and co-training. Furthermore, under the guidance of our analysis, we propose an
alternative model to GCN named Unitized and Co-training Matrix Factorization
(UCMF). Extensive experiments have been conducted on several real-world
datasets. On the task of semi-supervised node classification, the experimental
results illustrate that UCMF achieves similar or superior performances compared
with GCN. Meanwhile, distributed UCMF significantly outperforms distributed GCN
methods, which shows that UCMF can greatly benefit large scale and complex
real-world applications. Moreover, we have also conducted experiments on a
typical task of graph embedding, i.e., community detection, and the proposed
UCMF model outperforms several representative graph embedding models.

example, we present the case of the quasar J2346+0705 that was reported with
two different redshifts, $z_{1} = 5.063$ and $z_{2} = 0.171$, in the
literature. We measured the apparent proper motions ($\mu$) of three components
identified in its radio jet by utilizing VLBI data taken from 2014 to 2018. We
obtained $\mu_{J1} = 0.334 \pm 0.099$ mas yr$^{-1}$, $\mu_{J2} = 0.116 \pm
0.029$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and $\mu_{J3} = 0.060 \pm 0.005$ mas yr$^{-1}$. The
maximal proper motion is converted to an apparent transverse speed of
$\beta_{\rm app} = 41.2\pm12.2\,c$. if the source is at redshift 5.063. This
value exceeds the blazar jet speeds known to date. This and other arguments
suggest that J2346+0705 is hosted by a low-redshift galaxy. Our method may be
applicable for other high-redshift AGN candidates lacking unambiguous
spectroscopic redshift determination or having photometric redshift estimates
only, but showing prominent radio jets allowing for VLBI measurements of fast
jet proper motions.

on a metric Lie algebra over the real numbers. Recently, it was shown that
irreducible Lie algebras which are additionally $2$-step nilpotent admit at
most one orthogonal bi-invariant complex structure up to sign. The main result
generalizes this statement to metric Lie algebras with any number of
irreducible factors and which are not necessarily $2$-step nilpotent. It states
that there are either $0$ or $2^k$ such complex structures, with $k$ the number
of irreducible factors of the metric Lie algebra. The motivation for this
problem comes from differential geometry, for instance to construct
non-parallel Killing-Yano $2$-forms on nilmanifolds or to describe the compact
Chern-flat quasi-K\""ahler manifolds.
  The main tool we develop is the unique orthogonal decomposition into
irreducible factors for metric Lie algebras with no non-trivial abelian factor.
This is a generalization of a recent result which only deals with nilpotent Lie
algebras over the real numbers. Not only do we apply this fact to describe the
orthogonal bi-invariant complex structures on a given metric Lie algebra, but
it also gives us a method to study different inner products on a given Lie

leaves traces in the evolution of the transverse and longitudinal
magnetizations during such a deep out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We shed light on
the emergence of singularities in the thermodynamic infinite-size limit, likely
related to the integrability of the model. Finite systems in periodic and open
boundary conditions develop peculiar power-law finite-size scaling laws related
to revival phenomena, but apparently unrelated to the quantum transition,
because their main features are generally observed in quenches to generic
values of $g$. We also investigate the effects of dissipative interactions with
an environment, modeled by a Lindblad equation with local decay and pumping
dissipation operators within the quadratic fermionic model obtainable by a
Jordan-Wigner mapping. Dissipation tends to suppress the main features of the
unitary dynamics of closed systems. We finally address the effects of
integrability breaking, due to further lattice interactions, such as in
anisotropic next-to-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI) models. We show that some
qualitative features of the post-quench dynamics persist, in particular the
different behaviors when quenching to quantum ferromagnetic and paramagnetic

we show that finding optimal solutions to joint replenishment instances with

because the hospital serves a healthier population overall. In this paper, we
develop a method of ``direct standardization'' where we re-weight each hospital

compare the weighted averages across hospitals. Adapting methods from survey
sampling and causal inference, we find weights that directly control for
imbalance between the hospital patient mix and the target population, even
across many patient attributes. Critically, these balancing weights can also be
tuned to preserve sample size for more precise estimates. We also derive
principled measures of statistical precision, and use outcome modeling and

\drvm$\gtrsim$ 3 \kms, where \drvm\ is the maximum APOGEE-detected shift in the

variation in the close binary fraction in our sample, with stellar parameters
like mass and age playing a secondary role. In addition to the previously
identified strong anti-correlation between the close binary fraction and \feh\,
we find that high abundances of $\alpha$ elements also suppress multiplicity at
most values of \feh\ sampled by APOGEE. The anti-correlation between $\alpha$
abundances and multiplicity is substantially steeper than that observed for Fe,
suggesting C, O, and Si in the form of dust and ices dominate the opacity of
primordial protostellar disks and their propensity for fragmentation via
gravitational stability. Near \feh{} = 0 dex, the bias-corrected close binary

Affect, for example, can be inferred both by a short sound token and by sonic
patterns over a longer temporal window such as an entire recording. In this
letter, we focus on inferring meaning from this dichotomy of contexts. We show
how contextual representations of short sung vocal lines can be implicitly
learned from fundamental frequency ($F_0$) and thus be used as a meaningful
feature space for downstream Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks. We
propose three self-supervised deep learning paradigms which leverage pseudotask
learning of these two levels of context to produce latent representation
spaces. We evaluate the usefulness of these representations by embedding unseen
pitch contours into each space and conducting downstream classification tasks.
Our results show that contextual representation can enhance downstream
classification by as much as 15\% as compared to using traditional statistical
contour features.

However, the variable scale and unknown category of salient objects are great
challenges all the time. These are closely related to the utilization of
multi-level and multi-scale features. In this paper, we propose the aggregate
interaction modules to integrate the features from adjacent levels, in which
less noise is introduced because of only using small up-/down-sampling rates.
To obtain more efficient multi-scale features from the integrated features, the
self-interaction modules are embedded in each decoder unit. Besides, the class
imbalance issue caused by the scale variation weakens the effect of the binary
cross entropy loss and results in the spatial inconsistency of the predictions.
Therefore, we exploit the consistency-enhanced loss to highlight the
fore-/back-ground difference and preserve the intra-class consistency.

effects of cholesterol and ergosterol as the major sterol of mammalian and
fungal cells, respectively, on binary mixtures with
1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) as a proxy for saturated
lipids. In agreement with previous work, we observe that the addition of sterol
molecules modifies the order of DPPC both in the gel phase and in the liquid
phase. When disentangling the overall tilt angle and the structure of the tail
imposed by trans/gauche configurations of torsion angles in the tail,
respectively, a more detailed picture of the impact of sterols can be
formulated, revealing, e.g., an approximate temperature-concentration
superposition ranging from the liquid to the gel phase. Furthermore, a new
quantitative measure to identify the presence of collective sterol effects is
discussed. Moreover, when comparing both types of sterols, addition of
cholesterol has a noticeably stronger impact on phospholipid properties than of
ergosterol. The observed differences can be attributed to higher planarity of
the cholesterol ring system. This planarity combined with an inherent asymmetry
in its molecular interactions leads to better alignment and hence stronger
interaction with saturated acyl chains. Our results suggest that the high order
demonstrated for ergosterol in fungal plasma membranes must therefore be
generated via additional mechanisms.

  Linear codes that can correct even a single deletion are limited to have
information rate at most $1/2$ (achieved by the trivial 2-fold repetition
code). Previously, it was (erroneously) reported that more generally no
non-trivial linear codes correcting $k$ deletions exist, i.e., that the
$(k+1)$-fold repetition codes and its rate of $1/(k+1)$ are basically optimal
for any $k$. We disprove this and show the existence of binary linear codes of
length $n$ and rate just below $1/2$ capable of correcting $\Omega(n)$
insertions and deletions. This identifies rate $1/2$ as a sharp threshold for
recovery from deletions for linear codes, and reopens the quest for a better
understanding of the capabilities of linear codes for correcting
insertions/deletions.
  We prove novel outer bounds and existential inner bounds for the rate vs.
(edit) distance trade-off of linear insdel codes. We complement our existential
results with an efficient synchronization-string-based transformation that
converts any asymptotically-good linear code for Hamming errors into an
asymptotically-good linear code for insdel errors. Lastly, we show that the

for example OCEAN (Five factor) indicator, MBTI (Myers Brigg Type Indicator)
etc. However, questionnaire based psychometric tests have some known
shortcomings. This work explores whether these shortcomings can be mitigated
through computer-based gaming platforms for evaluating psychometric parameters.
A computer based psychometric game framework called Antarjami has been
developed for evaluating OCEAN (Five factor) indicators. It investigates the
feasibility of extracting psychometric parameters through computer-based games,
utilizing underlying improvements in the area of modern artificial
intelligence. The candidates for the test are subjected to a number scenarios
as part of the computer based game and their reactions/responses are used to
evaluate their psychometric parameters. As part of the study, the parameters
obtained from the game were compared with those evaluated using paper based
tests and scores given by a panel of psychologists. The achieved results were
very promising.

camera geometry. The robust estimation is usually based on solving camera
geometry problems from a minimal number of input data measurements, i.e.,
solving minimal problems, in a RANSAC-style framework. Minimal problems often
result in complex systems of polynomial equations. The existing
state-of-the-art methods for solving such systems are either based on Gr\""obner
bases and the action matrix method, which have been extensively studied and
optimized in the recent years or recently proposed approach based on a sparse
resultant computation using an extra variable.
  In this paper, we study an interesting alternative sparse resultant-based
method for solving sparse systems of polynomial equations by hiding one
variable. This approach results in a larger eigenvalue problem than the action
matrix and extra variable sparse resultant-based methods; however, it does not
need to compute an inverse or elimination of large matrices that may be
numerically unstable. The proposed approach includes several improvements to
the standard sparse resultant algorithms, which significantly improves the
efficiency and stability of the hidden variable resultant-based solvers as we
demonstrate on several interesting computer vision problems. We show that for
the studied problems, our sparse resultant based approach leads to more stable
solvers than the state-of-the-art Gr\""obner bases-based solvers as well as
existing sparse resultant-based solvers, especially in close to critical
configurations. Our new method can be fully automated and incorporated into
existing tools for the automatic generation of efficient minimal solvers.

car-following and lane-changing, is a crucial task to understand the
interactions between individual vehicles in traffic streams. Leveraging a
recently developed theory named physics regularized Gaussian process (PRGP),
this study presents a stochastic microscopic traffic model that can capture the
randomness and measure errors in the real world. Physical knowledge from
classical car-following models is converted as physics regularizers, in the
form of shadow Gaussian process (GP), of a multivariate PRGP for improving the
modeling accuracy. More specifically, a Bayesian inference algorithm is
developed to estimate the mean and kernel of GPs, and an enhanced latent force
model is formulated to encode physical knowledge into stochastic processes.
Also, based on the posterior regularization inference framework, an efficient
stochastic optimization algorithm is developed to maximize the evidence
lower-bound of the system likelihood. To evaluate the performance of the
proposed models, this study conducts empirical studies on real-world vehicle
trajectories from the NGSIM dataset. Since one unique feature of the proposed
framework is the capability of capturing both car-following and lane-changing
behaviors with one single model, numerical tests are carried out with two
separated datasets, one contains lane-changing maneuvers and the other doesn't.
The results show the proposed method outperforms the previous influential
methods in estimation precision.

To achieve high product quality, the powder is best spread as a uniform, dense

that can produce a consistent layer quality for the many powders used, which
show considerable differences in spreadability. Therefore, we investigate the
influence of material properties, process parameters and the type of spreading
tool on the layer quality. The discrete particle method is used to simulate the
spreading process and to define metrics to evaluate the powder layer
characteristics. We found that particle shape and surface roughness in terms of
rolling resistance and interparticle sliding friction as well as particle
cohesion all have a major (sometimes surprising) influence on the powder layer
quality: more irregular shaped particles, rougher particle surfaces and/or
higher interfacial cohesion usually, but not always, lead to worse
spreadability. Our findings illustrate that there is a trade-off between
material properties and process parameters. Increasing the spreading speed
decreases layer quality for non- and weakly cohesive powders, but improves it
for strongly cohesive ones. Using a counter-clockwise rotating roller as a
spreading tool improves the powder layer quality compared to spreading with a
blade. Finally, for both geometries, a unique correlation between the quality
criteria uniformity and mass fraction is reported and some of the findings are
related to size-segregation during spreading.

checking approach is termed as PAC model checking due to incorporation of
learned models with correctness guarantees expressed using the terms error
probability and confidence. Based on the error probability and confidence
level, our approach provides statistically formal guarantees that the
time-evolving trajectories of the black-box dynamical system over finite time
horizons fall within the range of the learned model plus a bounded interval,
contributing to insights on the reachability of the black-box system and thus
on the satisfiability of its safety requirements. The learned model together
with the bounded interval is obtained by scenario optimization, which boils
down to a linear programming problem. Three examples demonstrate the

also show that Scheme A achieves an improved download rate compared to the
recently proposed scheme by Samy et al. under the so-called $\epsilon$-privacy

Moreover, we provide an information-theoretic converse bound for the maximum
possible download rate for the MI and MaxL privacy metrics under a practical

of high order accurate numerical methods for solving hyperbolic partial
differential equations (PDEs). However when the spatial dimensions are high,
the number of spatial grid points increases significantly. It leads to large
amount of operations and computational costs in the numerical simulations by
using nonlinear high order accuracy WENO schemes such as a fifth order WENO
scheme. How to achieve fast simulations by high order WENO methods for high
spatial dimension hyperbolic PDEs is a challenging and important question. In
the literature, sparse-grid technique has been developed as a very efficient
approximation tool for high dimensional problems. In a recent work [Lu, Chen
and Zhang, Pure and Applied Mathematics Quarterly, 14 (2018) 57-86], a third
order finite difference WENO method with sparse-grid combination technique was
designed to solve multidimensional hyperbolic equations including both linear
advection equations and nonlinear Burgers' equations. In application problems,
higher than third order WENO schemes are often preferred in order to
efficiently resolve the complex solution structures. In this paper, we extend
the approach to higher order WENO simulations specifically the fifth order WENO
scheme. A fifth order WENO interpolation is applied in the prolongation part of
the sparse-grid combination technique to deal with discontinuous solutions.
Benchmark problems are first solved to show that significant CPU times are
saved while both fifth order accuracy and stability of the WENO scheme are
preserved for simulations on sparse grids. The fifth order sparse grid WENO
method is then applied to kinetic problems modeled by high dimensional Vlasov
based PDEs to further demonstrate large savings of computational costs by
comparing with simulations on regular single grids.

Gauss-Markov processes are considered, with a special attention to the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Samples are acquired from the process, quantized,
and then encoded for transmission using either infinite incremental redundancy
(IIR) or fixed redundancy (FR) coding schemes. A fixed processing time is
consumed at the receiver for decoding and sending feedback to the transmitter.
Decoded messages are used to construct a minimum mean square error (MMSE)
estimate of the process as a function of time. This is shown to be an
increasing functional of the age-of-information (AoI), defined as the time
elapsed since the sampling time pertaining to the latest successfully decoded
message. Such functional depends on the quantization bits, codewords lengths
and receiver processing time. The goal, for each coding scheme, is to optimize
sampling times such that the long-term average MMSE is minimized. This is then
characterized in the setting of general increasing functionals of AoI, not
necessarily corresponding to MMSE, which may be of independent interest in
other contexts.
  We first show that the optimal sampling policy for IIR is such that a new
sample is generated only if the AoI exceeds a certain threshold, while for FR
it is such that a new sample is delivered just-in-time as the receiver finishes
processing the previous one. Enhanced transmissions schemes are then developed
in order to exploit the processing times to make new data available at the
receiver sooner. For both IIR and FR, it is shown that there exists an optimal
number of quantization bits that balances AoI and quantization errors, and
hence minimizes the MMSE. It is also shown that for longer receiver processing
times, the relatively simpler FR scheme outperforms IIR.

and adversarial-based discrepancies. However, it remains challenging to
determine which method is suitable for a given application since they are built
with certain priors or bias. Thus they may fail to uncover the underlying

proposes Learning to Match (L2M) to automatically learn the cross-domain
distribution matching without relying on hand-crafted priors on the matching

the distribution matching loss in a data-driven way. L2M is a general framework
that unifies task-independent and human-designed matching features. We design a

self-supervised label propagation. Experiments on public datasets substantiate
the superiority of L2M over SOTA methods. Moreover, we apply L2M to transfer
from pneumonia to COVID-19 chest X-ray images with remarkable performance. L2M
can also be extended in other distribution matching applications where we show
in a trial experiment that L2M generates more realistic and sharper MNIST

artificial intelligence (AI) in all fields depends heavily on data size and
computational power. Sacrificing massive computing resources in exchange for
better precision rates of the network model is recognized by many researchers.
This leads to huge computing consumption and satisfactory results are not
always expected when computing resources are limited. Therefore, it is
necessary to find a balance between resources and model performance to achieve
satisfactory results. This article proposes a self-adaptive quality of
experience (QoE) framework, DeepNetQoE, to guide the training of deep networks.
A self-adaptive QoE model is set up that relates the model's accuracy with the
computing resources required for training which will allow the experience value
of the model to improve. To maximize the experience value when computer
resources are limited, a resource allocation model and solutions need to be
established. In addition, we carry out experiments based on four network models
to analyze the experience values with respect to the crowd counting example.
Experimental results show that the proposed DeepNetQoE is capable of adaptively
obtaining a high experience value according to user needs and therefore guiding
users to determine the computational resources allocated to the network models.

texture regions on tissue surfaces, we propose effective post-processing steps
for the local stereo matching method to enlarge the radius of constraint, which
include outliers removal, hole filling and smoothing. Since the tissue models
obtained by stereo matching are limited to the field of view of the imaging

simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) method to align the models. Low

we say that a CRN with distinguished input and output species computes a
positive real function $f : R+ $\rightarrow$ R+$, if for any initial
concentration x of the input species, the concentration of the output molecular
species stabilizes at concentration f (x). The Turing-completeness of that
notion of chemical analog computation has been established by proving that any
computable real function can be computed by a CRN over a finite set of
molecular species. Rate-independent CRNs form a restricted class of CRNs of
high practical value since they enjoy a form of absolute robustness in the
sense that the result is completely independent of the reaction rates and
depends solely on the input concentrations. The functions computed by
rate-independent CRNs have been characterized mathematically as the set of
piecewise linear functions from input species. However, this does not provide a
mean to decide whether a given CRN is rate-independent. In this paper, we
provide graphical conditions on the Petri Net structure of a CRN which entail
the rate-independence property either for all species or for some output

Internet, where people have an overwhelming number of available options to
choose from, e.g. products to buy in an e-commerce site, or restaurants to
visit in a large city. Recommender systems arose as a data-driven personalized
decision support tool to assist users in these situations: they are able to
process user-related data, filtering and recommending items based on the users
preferences, needs and/or behaviour. Unlike most conventional recommender
approaches where items are inanimate entities recommended to the users and
success is solely determined upon the end users reaction to the
recommendation(s) received, in a Reciprocal Recommender System (RRS) users
become the item being recommended to other users. Hence, both the end user and
the user being recommended should accept the 'matching' recommendation to yield
a successful RRS performance. The operation of an RRS entails not only
predicting accurate preference estimates upon user interaction data as
classical recommenders do, but also calculating mutual compatibility between
(pairs of) users, typically by applying fusion processes on unilateral
user-to-user preference information. This paper presents a snapshot-style
analysis of the extant literature that summarizes the state-of-the-art RRS
research to date, focusing on the algorithms, fusion processes and fundamental
characteristics of RRS, both inherited from conventional user-to-item
recommendation models and those inherent to this emerging family of approaches.
Representative RRS models are likewise highlighted. Following this, we discuss
the challenges and opportunities for future research on RRSs, with special
focus on (i) fusion strategies to account for reciprocity and (ii) emerging
application domains related to social recommendation.

of these states, it purportedly allows distinguishing in an experimentally
testable way the predictions of quantum mechanics from those of models of local

show, however, that the models of local hidden variables constrained by the
Bell inequality all share a subtle, though crucial, feature that is not
required by fundamental physical principles and, hence, it might not be
fulfilled in the actual experimental setup that tests the inequality. Indeed,
the disputed feature neither can be properly implemented within the standard
framework of quantum mechanics and it is even at odds with the fundamental
principle of relativity. Namely, the proof of the inequality requires the
existence of a preferred absolute frame of reference (supposedly provided by
the lab) with respect to which the hidden properties of the entangled particles
and the orientations of each one of the measurement devices that test them can
be independently defined through a long sequence of realizations of the
experiment. We notice, however, that while the relative orientation between the
two measurement devices is a properly defined physical magnitude in every
single realization of the experiment, their global rigid orientation with
respect to a lab frame is a spurious gauge degree of freedom. Following this
observation, we were able to explicitly build a model of local hidden variables
that does not share the disputed feature and, hence, it is able to reproduce
the predictions of quantum mechanics for the entangled states of two qubits.

spacecraft plasma thrusters for interplanetary flights. The solar radiation is
considered as an energy source for the ionization and the acceleration of
particles of captured space environment that is used as drop weight. The method
of capturing the space environment, which is dependent on its density, the
velocity of the spacecraft, and the power of solar radiation, defines the
technical feasibility of this scheme. Both pulsed and continuous operations of
the plasma accelerator are possible under some conditions as shown in the
estimates.

  magnetic flux lattice","36 pages, 34 figures",,"10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2021.115446",,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anyon usually exists as collective excitation of two dimensional electron gas
subjected to strong magnetic field, carrying fractional charges and exotic
statistical character beyond fermion and boson. Fractional quantum Hall effect
(FQHE) is the only experimental system showing solid evidence of anyon and a
serial of fractional charges so far. Searching for new serial of fractional
charges in FQHE or other physical system is still a challenge for both
theoretical and experimental study. Here a topological fusion theory of
propagating paths winding around a pair of fluxes is proposed to explore the
physical origin of fractional charges. This topological path fusion theory not
only generated all of the existed serial of fractional charges in FQHE and
found the exact correspondence between FQHE and integral quantum Hall effect
(IQHE), but also predicted new serial of fractional charges in FQHE. Further
more, serial irrational charges like $2/(3+\sqrt{2})$ in one dimensional
lattice of magnetic fluxes as well as that in two dimensional lattice of
magnetic fluxes, such as $(1+\sqrt{2})$, are predicted. Even in three
dimensional network of magnetic fluxes, a serial of fractionally charged anyon
is predicted by this topological path fusion theory, which has exactly
correspondence with the knot lattice model of anyon. In fact, in a
multi-connected space time without magnetic field, this topological path fusion
theory still holds, revealing an universal existence of fractional charge and
mass in quantum material with strong confinement of particles (such as photonic
crystal with porous nano-structures) and paving a new way for topological
quantum computation.
