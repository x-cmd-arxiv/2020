micropolar elasticity theory. This formalism accounts for not only
translational micromotions of a medium but also rotational ones. It is found
that there appears the phonon band splitting depending on the
left/right-circular polarization in a purely phonon sector without invoking any
outside subsystem. The phonon spectrum reveals parity breaking while preserving
time-reversal symmetry, i.e. it possesses true chirality. We find that
hybridization of the micro-rotational and translational modes gives rise to the
acoustic phonon branch with a ""roton"" minimum reminiscent of the elementary
excitations in the superfluid helium-4. We argue that a mechanism of this
phenomena is in line with Nozi\`{e}res' reinterpretation [J. Low Temp. Phys.

crystallization instability. We discuss a close analogy between the

the Bogoliubov quasiparticles and gapful density fluctuations in ${}^{4}$He.

Y$^{3+}$ or Nd$^{3+}$ ions to the proteins carboxylate groups. Characteristic
reentrant condensation for BLG moieties with bound trivalent ions was found in
a broad concentration range around the point of zero net charge. The highest
colloidal stability of BLG was found for ion concentrations <20$\mu$M and
>50$\mu$M. Investigations on macroscopic foams from BLG solutions, revealed the
existence of structure-property relations between the interfacial charging
state and the foam stability. In fact, a minimum in foam stability at 20$\mu$M
ion concentration was found when the interfacial net charge was negligible. Our
results provide new information on the charge reversal at the liquid-gas

important step in the clarification of reentrant con-densation effects at

economic dispatch problem of electrical networks is proposed in this paper. The
scheme consists of two parts. The first part is an event-triggered
repartitioning method that splits the network into a fixed number of
non-overlapping sub-systems {(microgrids)}. The objective of the repartitioning
procedure is to obtain self-sufficient microgrids, i.e., those that can meet
their local loads using their own generation units. However, since the
algorithm does not guarantee that all the resulting microgrids are
self-sufficient, the microgrids that are not self-sufficient must then form a
coalition with some of their neighboring microgrids. This process becomes the
second part of the scheme. By performing the coalition formation, we can
decompose the economic dispatch problem of the network into coalition-based
sub-problems such that each subproblem is feasible. Furthermore, we also show
that the solution obtained by solving the coalition-based sub-problems is a
feasible but sub-optimal solution to the centralized problem. Additionally,
some numerical simulations are also carried out to show the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

the quadcopter (comparatively simple UAV design without thrust vectoring). This
approach allows learning a control policy for systems with multiple inputs and
multiple outputs. The performance of the learned policy is evaluated by
physics-based simulations for the tasks of hovering and way-point navigation.
The flight simulations utilize a flight controller based on reinforcement
learning without any additional PID components. The results show faster
learning with the presented approach as opposed to learning the control policy
from scratch for this new UAV design created by modifications in a conventional
quadcopter, i.e., the addition of more degrees of freedom (4-actuators in
conventional quadcopter to 8-actuators in tilt-rotor quadcopter). We
demonstrate the robustness of our learned policy by showing the recovery of the
tilt-rotor platform in the simulation from various non-static initial
conditions in order to reach a desired state. The developmental policy for the
tilt-rotor UAV also showed superior fault tolerance when compared with the
policy learned from the scratch. The results show the ability of the presented

we call truncated smoothing; this in turn allows us to define a new family of
metrics which generalize the interleaving distance for Reeb graphs.
Intuitively, we ""chop off"" parts near local minima and maxima during the course
of smoothing, where the amount cut is controlled by a parameter $\tau$. After
formalizing truncation as a functor, we show that when applied after the
smoothing functor, this prevents extensive expansion of the range of the
function, and yields particularly nice properties (such as maintaining
connectivity) when combined with smoothing for $0 \leq \tau \leq 2\varepsilon$,
where $\varepsilon$ is the smoothing parameter. Then, for the restriction of
$\tau \in [0,\varepsilon]$, we have additional structure which we can take
advantage of to construct a categorical flow for any choice of slope $m \in
[0,1]$. Using the infrastructure built for a category with a flow, this then
gives an interleaving distance for every $m \in [0,1]$, which is a
generalization of the original interleaving distance, which is the case $m=0$.
While the resulting metrics are not stable, we show that any pair of these for
$m,m' \in [0,1)$ are strongly equivalent metrics, which in turn gives stability
of each metric up to a multiplicative constant. We conclude by discussing
implications of this metric within the broader family of metrics for Reeb
graphs.

hierarchical data structures, most commonly recording the activity of multiple
neurons in multiple animals across multiple trials. Accordingly, the
measurements constituting the dataset are not independent, even though the
traditional statistical analyses often applied in such cases (e.g., Students

effective tool to accurately analyze such data and while it has been used
extensively in the statistical literature, its use is not widespread in
neuroscience - despite the ubiquity of hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we
illustrate the intuitiveness and utility of this approach to analyze

traditional statistical tests can result in a false positive rate of over 45%,

This anomalous behavior can be overcome within the GKBA formalism by coupling
to an external bath, which leads to a transition of the EI system towards the

quadratic convergence in purely irrotational systems and pure solenoidal

The estimated depth of the galaxy sample, $r\sim17.8$, the high signal-to-noise

for galaxy velocity dispersion measurements, which are invaluable to study the

dispersion values are corrected to 1 effective radius aperture. We also present

emission is emerging from the spine of the jet with an average diameter of 3-7

by a larger-scale, slower CO-emitting structure. The jet and narrow wind are
turbulent ($\sigma>$40 kms$^{-1}$) and have steep radial gas excitation
gradients. The jet shows velocity reversals that we propose are caused by
precession, or episodic directional changes. We suggest that an important
process powering the outflow is magneto-centrifugal driving. In contrast, the
large-scale CO-envelope may be a slow wind, or cocoon that stems from jet-wind
interactions. An asymmetric, nuclear r$\sim$2 pc and hot (>180 K) dust

spectroscopy can reveal many different chemical components in exoplanet

observations. Each transit data set will contain instrument systematics that
depend on the instrument used and will need to be calibrated out with an
instrument systematic model. The proposed solution in Wakeford et al. (2016)
(arXiv:1601.02587 [astro-ph.EP]) is to use a marginalisation across a grid of
systematic models in order to retrieve marginalised transit parameters. Doing
this over observations in multiple wavelengths yields a robust transmission
spectrum of an exoplanet. ExoTiC-ISM provides tools to perform this analysis,
and its current capability contains a systematic grid that is applicable to the
Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) detector on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST),
particularly for the two infrared grisms G141 and G102. By modularisation of
the code and implementation of more systematic grids, ExoTiC-ISM can be used
for other instruments, and an implementation for select detectors on the James

Contemporary literature shows solutions to monitor and mitigate aging using
hardware and software monitoring mechanisms and reconfiguration techniques. The
goal of this review of the state-of-the-art is to identify existing monitoring
and reconfiguration solutions for aging. This survey evaluates the aging
research, focusing the years from 2012 to 2019, and proposes a classification
for monitors and reconfiguration techniques. Results show that the most common
monitor type used for aging detection is to monitor timing errors, and the most
common reconfiguration technique used to deal with aging is voltage scaling.
Furthermore, most of the literature contributions are in the digital field,
using hardware solutions for monitoring aging in circuits. There are few
literature contributions in the analog area, being the scope of this survey in
the digital domain. By scrutinizing these solutions, this survey points

planets and brown dwarf companions. These multi-object systems can provide
information about the formation of low-mass companions in wide orbits and/or
help us to speculate about possible migration scenarios. Accurate
classification of companions is crucial for testing formation pathways. Aims.
In this work we further characterise the recently discovered candidate for a
planetary-mass companion CS Cha b and determine if it is still accreting.
Methods. MUSE is a four-laser-adaptive-optics-assisted medium-resolution
integral-field spectrograph in the optical part of the spectrum. We observed
the CS Cha system to obtain the first spectrum of CS Cha b. The companion is
characterised by modelling both the spectrum from 6300 $\unicode{x212B}$ to
9300 $\unicode{x212B}$ and the photometry using archival data from the visible
to the near-infrared (NIR). Results. We find evidence of accretion and outflow
signatures in H$\mathrm{\alpha}$ and OI emission. The atmospheric models with
the highest likelihood indicate an effective temperature of $3450\pm50$ K with
a $\log{g}$ of $3.6\pm0.5$ dex. Based on evolutionary models, we find that the
majority of the object is obscured. We determine the mass of the faint
companion with several methods to be between 0.07 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.71
$M_{\odot}$ with an accretion rate of $\dot{M} = 4 \times 10^{-11 \pm 0.4}$
Myr$^{-1}$. Conclusions. Our results show that CS Cha B is most likely a
mid-M-type star that is obscured by a highly inclined disc, which has led to
its previous classification using broadband NIR photometry as a planetary-mass
companion. This shows that it is important and necessary to observe over a
broad spectral range to constrain the nature of faint companions

with a sticky unpenetrable substrate or wall. The interface is subject to two
effects going in opposite directions. Contact between the interface and the
substrate are given an energetic bonus while an external force with constant
intensity pulls the interface away from the wall. Our interface is modeled by
the graph of a one-dimensional nearest-neighbor path on $\mathbb{Z}_+$,
starting at $0$ and ending at $0$ after $2N$ steps, the wall corresponding to
level-zero the horizontal axis. At equilibrium each path
$\xi=(\xi_x)_{x=0}^{2N}$, is given a probability proportional to
$\lambda^{H(\xi)} \exp(\frac{\sigma}{N}A(\xi))$, where $H(\xi):=\#\{x \ :
\xi_x=0\}$ and $A(\xi)$ is the area enclosed between the path $\xi$ and the

the value of each $\xi_x$ at a constant rate via corner-flip.
  Investigating the statics of the model, we derive the full phase diagram in
$\lambda$ and $\sigma$ of this model, and identify the critical line which
separates a localized phase where the pinning force sticks the interface to the
wall and a delocalized one, for which the external force stabilizes $\xi$
around a deterministic shape at a macroscopic distance of the wall. On the
dynamical side, we identify a second critical line, which separates a rapidly
mixing phase (for which the system mixes in polynomial time) to a slow phase
where the mixing time grows exponentially. In this slowly mixing regime we
obtain a sharp estimate of the mixing time on the $\log$ scale, and provide
evidences of a metastable behavior.

providing iteratively better pre-alignment and maximizes the corpus size by
using annotations from our automatic alignment models. Evaluation is conducted

in the general context encompassing parametric and nonparametric competing
models, dependent data, as well as misspecifications. Our investigation shows
that asymptotically the multiple testing procedure almost surely selects the
best possible inverse model that minimizes the minimum Kullback-Leibler
divergence from the true model. We also show that the error rates, namely,
versions of the false discovery rate and the false non-discovery rate converge
to zero almost surely as the sample size goes to infinity. Asymptotic
{\alpha}-control of versions of the false discovery rate and its impact on the

Poisson log regression and inverse geometric logit and probit regression, where
the regressions are either linear or based on Gaussian processes. Additionally,

reliability of a certain energy loss mechanism, apart from its path-length, is
its temperature dependence. Despite its importance and comprehensive dedicated
studies, this issue is still awaiting for more stringent constraints. To this
end, we here propose a novel observable to extract temperature dependence
exponent of high-$p_{\perp}$ particle's energy loss, based on $R_{AA}$. More
importantly, by combining analytical arguments, full-fledged numerical
calculations and comparison with experimental data, we argue that this
observable is highly suited for testing (and rejecting) the long-standing
$\Delta E/E \propto L^2 T^3$ paradigm. The anticipated significant reduction of
experimental errors will allow direct extraction of temperature dependence, by
considering different centrality pair in $A + A$ collisions (irrespective of

this observable, which reflects the underlying energy loss mechanism, is very

nebulosities separated by a dark lane, suggesting a typical disk-jets system,
but highly asymmetric. They are likely produced by scattered light in cavities
carved out by jets on an infalling envelope of material, which also present
line emission of H2 and [FeII]. The presence of the complex molecular species
observed with ALMA confirms that we are mapping a hot molecular core. The CH3CN
emission concentrates at the position of the dark lane and it appears slightly
elongated from southwest to northeast in agreement with the inclination of the
system as observed at near-IR. The morphology of the CH3OCHO emission is more
complex and extends along some filaments and concentrates in knots and clumps,
mainly southwards the dark-lane, suggesting that the southern jet is
encountering a dense region. The northern jet flows more freely, generating
more extended features. This is in agreement with the red-shifted molecular
outflow traced by the 12CO J=3-2 line extending towards the northwest and the
lack of a blue-shifted outflow. This configuration can be explained by
considering that the YSO is located at the furthest edge of the molecular clump
along the line of sight, which is consistent with the position of the source in
the cloud mapped in the C18O J=3-2 line. The detection of HCN, HNC, HCO+, and

construct a curious agent building world models while visually exploring a 3D
physical environment rich with distillations of representative real-world

effective learning progress-based curiosity signal. We show that
$\gamma$-Progress naturally gives rise to an exploration policy that directs
attention to complex but learnable dynamics in a balanced manner, thus
overcoming the ""white noise problem"". As a result, our $\gamma$-Progress-driven

surface tension and sum-frequency generation (SFG). This has enabled us to
relate bulk to interfacial properties with respect to the charging state and
the surfactants' binding efficiency. We found that the latter two are strongly
dependent on the alkyl chain length of the surfactant and that binding is much
more efficient as the alkyl chain length of the surfactant increases. This also

corroborated by SFG spectroscopy, where we observe a decrease in the intensity

inspired by classic model theory. A class of graphs $C$ is monadically stable
if it is impossible to define arbitrarily long linear orders in vertex-colored
graphs from $C$ using a fixed first-order formula. Similarly, monadic
dependence corresponds to the impossibility of defining all graphs in this way.
Examples of monadically stable graph classes are nowhere dense classes, which
provide a robust theory of sparsity. Examples of monadically dependent classes
are classes of bounded rankwidth (or equivalently, bounded cliquewidth), which
can be seen as a dense analog of classes of bounded treewidth. Thus, monadic
stability and monadic dependence extend classical structural notions for graphs
by viewing them in a wider, model-theoretical context. We explore this emerging
theory by proving the following:
  - A class of graphs $C$ is a first-order transduction of a class with bounded
treewidth if and only if $C$ has bounded rankwidth and a stable edge relation
(i.e. graphs from $C$ exclude some half-graph as a semi-induced subgraph).
  - If a class of graphs $C$ is monadically dependent and not monadically
stable, then $C$ has in fact an unstable edge relation.
  As a consequence, we show that classes with bounded rankwidth excluding some

are effective and lead to polynomial time algorithms.

network-bottlenecked due to bursty request patterns, large response sizes, and

difficult to ensure consistently low response times (< 100ms). Khameleon is a
framework for DVE applications that uses a novel combination of prefetching and
response tuning to dynamically trade-off response quality for low latency.
Khameleon exploits DVE's approximation tolerance: immediate lower-quality
responses are preferable to waiting for complete results. To this end,
Khameleon progressively encodes responses, and runs a server-side scheduler
that proactively streams portions of responses using available bandwidth to
maximize user's perceived interactivity. The scheduler involves a complex
optimization based on available resources, predicted user interactions, and
response quality levels; yet, decisions must also be real-time. To overcome
this, Khameleon uses a fast greedy approximation which closely mimics the
optimal approach. Using image exploration and visualization applications with
real user interaction traces, we show that across a wide range of network and

different dialects and it is often necessary to summarize a large number of
posts into a representative sample to provide a synopsis. Yet, any such
representative sample should sufficiently portray the underlying dialect
diversity to present the voices of different participating communities
representing the dialects. Extractive summarization algorithms perform the task
of constructing subsets that succinctly capture the topic of any given set of
posts. However, we observe that there is dialect bias in the summaries
generated by common summarization approaches, i.e., they often return summaries
that under-represent certain dialects.
  The vast majority of existing ""fair"" summarization approaches require
socially salient attribute labels (in this case, dialect) to ensure that the
generated summary is fair with respect to the socially salient attribute.
Nevertheless, in many applications, these labels do not exist. Furthermore, due
to the ever-evolving nature of dialects in social media, it is unreasonable to
label or accurately infer the dialect of every social media post. To correct
for the dialect bias, we employ a framework that takes an existing text
summarization algorithm as a blackbox and, using a small set of dialect-diverse
sentences, returns a summary that is relatively more dialect-diverse.
Crucially, this approach does not need the posts being summarized to have
dialect labels, ensuring that the diversification process is independent of
dialect classification/identification models. We show the efficacy of our
approach on Twitter datasets containing posts written in dialects used by
different social groups defined by race or gender; in all cases, our approach
leads to improved dialect diversity compared to standard text summarization
approaches.

values of the Born-Infeld parameter $b$. This behaviour is an additional
feature compared to the van der Waals like phase transition observed in charged
AdS black holes. Therefore, it is worth observing the underlying microscopic
origin of this reentrant phase transition. Depending on the value of the
parameter $b$, the black hole system has four different cases: no phase
transition, a reentrant phase transition with two scenarios, or a van der
Waals-like (standard) phase transition. In this article, by employing a novel
Ruppeiner geometry method in the parameter space of temperature and volume, we
investigate the microstructure of Born-Infeld AdS black hole via the phase
transition study, which includes standard and reentrant phase transition. We
find that the microstructures of the black hole that lead to standard and
reentrant phase transitions are distinct in nature. The standard phase
transition is characterised by the typical RN-AdS microstructure. In this case,
the small black hole phase has a dominant repulsive interaction for the low
temperature case. Interestingly, during the reentrant phase transition,
displayed by the system in a range of pressures for specific $b$ values, the
dominant attractive nature of interaction in the microstructure is preserved.
Our results suggest that in the reentrant phase transition case, the
intermediate black holes behave like a bosonic gas, and in the standard phase
transition case the small black holes behave like a quantum anyon gas. In both
cases, the large black hole phase displays an interaction similar to the
bosonic gas. The critical phenomenon is observed from the curvature scalar,
including the signature of the reentrant phase transition.

widely used and successful ideas in multi-armed bandits and reinforcement
learning. However, existing optimistic algorithms (primarily UCB and its
variants) are often unable to deal with large context spaces. Essentially all
existing well performing algorithms for general contextual bandit problems rely
on weighted action allocation schemes; and theoretical guarantees for
optimism-based algorithms are only known for restricted formulations. In this
paper we study general contextual bandits under the realizability condition,
and propose a simple generic principle to design optimistic algorithms, dubbed
""Upper Counterfactual Confidence Bounds"" (UCCB). We show that these algorithms
are provably optimal and efficient in the presence of large context spaces. Key
components of UCCB include: 1) a systematic analysis of confidence bounds in
policy space rather than in action space; and 2) the potential function
perspective that is used to express the power of optimism in the contextual
setting. We further show how the UCCB principle can be extended to infinite
action spaces, by constructing confidence bounds via the newly introduced
notion of ""counterfactual action divergence.""

respond to external stimuli. We have used the photochromic reaction of a
spiropyran surfactant to render interfacial, rising bubble as well as foaming
properties active to light stimuli. In order to address the air-water
interface, we have applied sum-frequency generation (SFG) which has provided
qualitative information on the surface excess and the interfacial charging
state as a function of light irradiation and pH. Under blue light, the
surfactant forms a closed ring spiro form (SP), whereas under dark conditions
the ring opens and the merocyanine (MC) form is generated. Using SFG, we show
that different pH conditions of the bulk solution lead to changes in the
interfacial charging state. We have exploited the fact that the MC surfactant's
O-H group can be deprotonated with pH, and used that to tune the molecules net
charge at the interface. In fact, SFG shows that with increasing pH the
intensity of the OH stretching band from interfacial water molecules increases
which we associate to an increase in surface net charge. At a pH of 5.3,
irradiation with blue light leads to a reversible decrease of OH intensities,
whereas the CH intensities were unchanged compared to the corresponding
intensities under dark conditions. These results are indicative of changes in
the surface net charge with light, which are also expected to influence the
foam stability via changes in the electrostatic disjoining pressure. In fact,
measurements of the foam stabilities are consistent with this hypothesis with
higher foam stability in the dark. At pH 2.7 this behavior is reversed. This is
corroborated by rising bubble experiments, which demonstrated an unprecedented
reduction of ~30% in bubble velocity when the bubbles were irradiated with blue
light compared to the velocity of bubbles with the surfactants in the dark
state.

differs from the rest of the dataset, is a classic problem in machine learning
and data mining. In both theoretical work and in applications, the anomaly is
assumed to have a specific structure defined by membership in an
$\textit{anomaly family}$. For example, in temporal data the anomaly family may
be time intervals, while in network data the anomaly family may be connected
subgraphs. The most prominent approach for anomaly estimation is to compute the
Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of the anomaly; however, it was recently
observed that for normally distributed data, the MLE is a $\textit{biased}$
estimator for some anomaly families. In this work, we demonstrate that in the
normal means setting, the bias of the MLE depends on the size of the anomaly
family. We prove that if the number of sets in the anomaly family that contain
the anomaly is sub-exponential, then the MLE is asymptotically unbiased. We
also provide empirical evidence that the converse is true: if the number of
such sets is exponential, then the MLE is asymptotically biased. Our analysis
unifies a number of earlier results on the bias of the MLE for specific anomaly
families. Next, we derive a new anomaly estimator using a mixture model, and we
prove that our anomaly estimator is asymptotically unbiased regardless of the
size of the anomaly family. We illustrate the advantages of our estimator
versus the MLE on disease outbreak and highway traffic data.

information in current literature about the best analytic methods for pre-post

We discuss six methods commonly used in literature: one way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance main effect and interaction models on
post-treatment measurement (ANCOVA I and II), ANOVA on change score between
baseline and post-treatment measurements, repeated measures and constrained
repeated measures models (cRM) on baseline and post-treatment measurements as
joint outcomes. We review a number of study endpoints in pre-post designs and
identify the difference in post-treatment measurement as the common treatment
effect that all six methods target. We delineate the underlying differences and
links between these competing methods in homogeneous and heterogeneous study
population. We demonstrate that ANCOVA and cRM outperform other alternatives
because their treatment effect estimators have the smallest variances. cRM has
comparable performance to ANCOVA I main effect model in homogeneous scenario
and to ANCOVA II interaction model in heterogeneous scenario. In spite of that,
ANCOVA has several advantages over cRM, including treating baseline measurement
as covariate because it is not an outcome by definition, the convenience of
incorporating other baseline variables and handling complex heteroscedasticity
patterns in a linear regression framework.

while it is still gamma-ray bright, but contrary to simple theoretical
expectations, the detected 3.5-78 keV emission of V906 Car is much weaker than
the simultaneously observed >100 MeV emission. No non-thermal X-ray emission is
detected, and our deep limits imply that the gamma-rays are likely hadronic.
After correcting for substantial absorption (N_H ~ 2 x 10^23 cm^-2), the
thermal X-ray luminosity (from a 9 keV optically-thin plasma) is just ~2% of
the gamma-ray luminosity. We consider possible explanations for the low thermal
X-ray luminosity, including the X-rays being suppressed by corrugated,
radiative shock fronts or the X-rays from the gamma-ray producing shock are
hidden behind an even larger absorbing column (N_H >10^25 cm^-2). Adding
XMM-Newton and Swift/XRT observations to our analysis, we find that the
evolution of the intrinsic X-ray absorption requires the nova shell to be
expelled 24 days after the outburst onset. The X-ray spectra show that the
ejecta are enhanced in nitrogen and oxygen, and the nova occurred on the
surface of a CO-type white dwarf. We see no indication of a distinct super-soft
phase in the X-ray lightcurve, which, after considering the absorption effects,
may point to a low mass of the white dwarf hosting the nova.

act as an additional source of energy loss in the cores of population-III
stars, dramatically altering their evolution. We investigate the effects of two
paradigmatic weakly coupled, low-mass particles, axions and hidden photons, and
find that the pulsational pair instability, which causes a substantial amount
of mass loss, is suppressed. As a result, it is possible to form black holes of
$72\msun$ or heavier, deep inside the black hole mass gap predicted by the
Standard Model. The upper edge of the mass gap is raised to $>130{\rm
M}_\odot$, implying that heavier black holes, anticipated to be observed after
LIGO's sensitivity is upgraded, would also be impacted. In contrast, thermally
produced heavy particles would remain in the core, leading to the tantalizing
possibility that they drive a new instability akin to the electron-positron
pair instability. We investigate this effect analytically and find that stars
that avoid the electron-positron pair instability could experience this new
instability. We discuss our results in light of current and upcoming

these circumstellar, or protoplanetary, discs that the first stages of planet
formation occur. Recent observations from ALMA suggest that planet formation
may already be well under way after only 1 Myr of a star's life. However, stars
do not form in isolation; they form from the collapse and fragmentation of
giant molecular clouds several parsecs in size. This results in young stars
forming in groups - often referred to as 'clusters'. In these star-forming
regions the stellar density is much higher than the location of the Sun, and
other stars in the Galactic disc that host exoplanets. As such, the environment
where stars form has the potential to influence the planet formation process.
In star-forming regions, protoplanetary discs can be truncated or destroyed by
interactions with passing stars, as well as photoevaporation from the radiation
fields of very massive stars. Once formed, the planets themselves can have
their orbits altered by dynamical encounters - either directly from passing
stars or through secondary effects such as the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. In this
contribution, I review the different processes that can affect planet formation
and stability in star-forming regions. I discuss each process in light of the
typical range of stellar densities observed for star-forming regions. I finish
by discussing these effects in the context of theories for the birth

established, yet poorly characterised due to the insufficient number of
reliable Faraday depths (FDs) from extragalactic radio sources (EGSs) through
this reversal region. We have therefore performed broadband (1-2 GHz)
spectro-polarimetric observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA) to determine the FD values of 194 EGSs in the Galactic longitude range of
$20^\circ$-$52^\circ$ within $\pm 5^\circ$ from the Galactic mid-plane,
covering the Sagittarius arm tangent. This factor of five increase in the EGS
FD density has led to the discovery of a disparity in FD values across the
Galactic mid-plane in the Galactic longitude range of $40^\circ$-$52^\circ$.
Combined with existing pulsar FD measurements, we suggest that the Sagittarius
arm can host an odd-parity disk field. We further compared our newly derived
EGS FDs with the predictions of three major Galactic magnetic field models, and
concluded that none of them can adequately reproduce our observational results.
This has led to our development of new, improved models of the Milky Way disk

final BOSS DR12 dataset. They arise from the joint analysis of geometric and
dynamic distortions of average void shapes (i.e., the stacked void-galaxy
cross-correlation function) in redshift space. Our model uses tomographic
deprojection to infer real-space void profiles and self-consistently accounts
for the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD)
without any prior assumptions on cosmology or structure formation. It is
derived from first physical principles and provides an extremely good
description of the data at linear perturbation order. We validate this model
with the help of mock catalogs and apply it to the final BOSS data to constrain
the RSD and AP parameters $f/b$ and $D_AH/c$, where $f$ is the linear growth
rate, $b$ the linear galaxy bias, $D_A$ the comoving angular diameter distance,
$H$ the Hubble rate, and $c$ the speed of light. In addition, we include two
nuisance parameters in our analysis to marginalize over potential systematics.
We obtain $f/b=0.540\pm0.091$ and $D_AH/c=0.588\pm0.004$ from the full void
sample at a mean redshift of $z=0.51$. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, this
implies $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.312\pm0.020$ for the present-day matter density
parameter. When we use additional information from the survey mocks to
calibrate our model, these constraints improve to $f/b=0.347\pm0.023$,
$D_AH/c=0.588\pm0.003$, and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.310\pm0.017$. However, we
emphasize that the calibration depends on the specific model of cosmology and
structure formation assumed in the mocks, so the calibrated results should be
considered less robust. Nevertheless, our calibration-independent constraints
are among the tightest of their kind to date, demonstrating the immense
potential of using cosmic voids for cosmology in current and future data.

well-defined filling $\nu$, which is a real number representing the average

integer), this imposes very strong constraints on the low-energy theory of the

vastly generalizing the Luttinger and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems. The most
powerful constraint comes about if $\nu$ is continuously tunable (i.e. the

theory must have a very large emergent symmetry group -- larger than any
compact Lie group. An example is the Fermi surface of a Fermi liquid, where the
charge at every point on the Fermi surface is conserved. We expect that in
many, if not all, cases, even exotic non-Fermi liquids will have the same
emergent symmetry group as a Fermi liquid, even though they could have very
different dynamics. We call a system with this property an ""ersatz Fermi
liquid"". We show that ersatz Fermi liquids share a number of properties in
common with Fermi liquids, including Luttinger's theorem (which is thus
extended to a large class of non-Fermi liquids) and periodic ""quantum
oscillations"" in the response to an applied magnetic field. We also establish
versions of Luttinger's theorem for the composite Fermi liquid in quantum Hall
systems and for spinon Fermi surfaces in Mott insulators. Our work makes

only at the southern edge of the SNR as previously known, but also inside the
X-ray shell. We spatially resolved nine molecular clouds using ALMA with an
angular resolution of $5''$, corresponding to a spatial resolution of $\sim$1
pc at the distance of the LMC. Typical cloud sizes and masses are $\sim$2.0 pc
and $\sim$100 $M_\odot$, respectively. High-intensity ratios of CO $J$ = 3-2 /
1-0 $> 1.5$ are seen toward the molecular clouds, indicating that shock-heating
has occurred. Spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy reveals that thermal X-rays
in the center of N132D are produced not only behind a molecular cloud, but also
in front of it. Considering the absence of a thermal component associated with
the forward shock towards one molecular cloud located along the line of sight
to the center of the remnant, this suggests that this particular cloud is
engulfed by shock waves and is positioned on the near side of remnant. If the
hadronic process is the dominant contributor to the gamma-ray emission, the
shock-engulfed clouds play a role as targets for cosmic-rays. We estimate the
total energy of cosmic-ray protons accelerated in N132D to be $\sim$0.5-$3.8

method for metric reconstruction based on the latter approach and show the
advantages over existing ones. We start by studying general linear
perturbations around the vacuum state. Generic thread configurations turn out
to encode the information about the metric in a highly nonlocal way, however,
we show that for boundary regions with a local modular Hamiltonian there is
always a canonical choice for the perturbed thread configurations that exploits
bulk locality. To do so, we express the bit thread formalism in terms of
differential forms so that it becomes manifestly background independent. We
show that the Iyer-Wald formalism provides a natural candidate for a canonical
local perturbation, which can be used to recast the problem of metric
reconstruction in terms of the inversion of a particular linear differential
operator. We examine in detail the inversion problem for the case of spherical
regions and give explicit expressions for the inverse operator in this case.
Going beyond linear order, we argue that the operator that must be inverted
naturally increases in order. However, the inversion can be done recursively at
different orders in the perturbation. Finally, we comment on an alternative way
of reconstructing the metric non-perturbatively by phrasing the inversion
problem as a particular optimization problem.

large electronic densities of states necessary for the broken symmetry phase.
The phase transition occurs in the steady-state of the system achieved due to
interplay between the coherent external drive, electron-electron interactions,
and dissipative processes arising from the coupling to phonons and the
electromagnetic environment. We obtain the phase diagram of the system using
numerical calculations that match predictions obtained from a phenomenological

low-energy part. We find that, even accounting for known systematic errors, the
Fermi-LAT data exclude to at least 95% C.L. any extragalactic transparent
source class, irrespective of its redshift evolution, if the neutrino spectrum
extends to the TeV scale or below. If the neutrino spectrum has an abrupt
cutoff at $\sim10$ TeV, barely compatible with current observations, the
tension can be reduced, but this way out requires a significant modification to
the current understanding of the origin of the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray
flux at GeV energies. In contrast, these considerations do not apply if a
sizable fraction of IceCube data originates within the Galactic halo (a
scenario however typically in tension with other constraints) or from a yet
unidentified class of ""opaque"" extragalactic emitters, which do not let the
high-energy gamma rays get out.

z=0.5. We find that, while dwarf galaxies often exhibit disturbed morphologies
(5 and 20 per cent are disturbed at z=1 and z=3 respectively), only a small
proportion of the morphological disturbances seen in dwarf galaxies are driven
by mergers at any redshift (for 10^9 Msun, mergers drive only 20 per cent
morphological disturbances). They are instead primarily the result of
interactions that do not end in a merger (e.g. fly-bys). Given the large
fraction of apparently morphologically disturbed dwarf galaxies which are not,
in fact, merging, this finding is particularly important to future studies
identifying dwarf mergers and post-mergers morphologically at intermediate and
high redshifts. Dwarfs typically undergo one major and one minor merger between
z=5 and z=0.5, accounting for 10 per cent of their total stellar mass. Mergers
can also drive moderate star formation enhancements at lower redshifts (3 or 4
times at z=1), but this accounts for only a few per cent of stellar mass in the
dwarf regime given their infrequency. Non-merger interactions drive
significantly smaller star formation enhancements (around two times), but their
preponderance relative to mergers means they account for around 10 per cent of
stellar mass formed in the dwarf regime.

across a range of timescales provides insight into the underlying physical
processes that regulate star formation within galaxies. We compile the SFHs of
galaxies at $z=0$ from an extensive set of models, ranging from cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations (Illustris, IllustrisTNG, Mufasa, Simba, EAGLE),
zoom simulations (FIRE-2, g14, and Marvel/Justice League), semi-analytic models
(Santa Cruz SAM) and empirical models (UniverseMachine), and quantify the
variability of these SFHs on different timescales using the power spectral
density (PSD) formalism. We find that the PSDs are well described by broken
power-laws, and variability on long timescales ($\gtrsim1$ Gyr) accounts for
most of the power in galaxy SFHs. Most hydrodynamical models show increased
variability on shorter timescales ($\lesssim300$ Myr) with decreasing stellar
mass. Quenching can induce $\sim0.4-1$ dex of additional power on timescales
$>1$ Gyr. The dark matter accretion histories of galaxies have remarkably
self-similar PSDs and are coherent with the in-situ star formation on
timescales $>3$ Gyr. There is considerable diversity among the different models
in their (i) power due to SFR variability at a given timescale, (ii) amount of
correlation with adjacent timescales (PSD slope), (iii) evolution of median
PSDs with stellar mass, and (iv) presence and locations of breaks in the PSDs.
The PSD framework is a useful space to study the SFHs of galaxies since model
predictions vary widely. Observational constraints in this space will help
constrain the relative strengths of the physical processes responsible for this
variability.

well-motivated scenario of this kind. Here the hidden-sector dark matter can be
produced in abundance through the Kibble-Zurek mechanism describing the
non-equilibrium dynamics of defects produced in a second order phase

on hidden-sector magnetic monopoles, and consider more general cosmological
histories. We find that a monopole mass of order ($1-10^5$) PeV is generic for
the thermal histories considered here, if monopoles are to entirely reproduce
the current abundance of dark matter. In particular, in a scenario involving an
early era of matter domination, the monopole number density is always less than

condition on critical exponents is satisfied. This results in a larger monopole
mass needed to account for a fixed relic abundance in such cosmologies.

physics and reactor monitoring. For these studies the total absorption
technique was chosen, since it is the only method that allows one to obtain
beta decay probabilities free from a systematic error called the Pandemonium

the IGISOL facility of the University of Jyvaskyla (Finland) using isotopically
pure beams provided by the JYFLTRAP Penning trap. Examples are presented to
show that the results of our measurements on selected nuclei have had a large

can study the competition between gamma- and neutron-emission from states above
the neutron separation energy. The gamma-to-neutron emission ratios can be used
to constrain neutron capture (n,gamma)cross sections for unstable nuclei of
interest in astrophysics. The information obtained from the measurements can
also be used to test nuclear model predictions of half-lives and Pn values for

quantifying the relevance of neutrino microphysics in compact astrophysical
objects, limiting the ability to perform numerical simulations and encouraging
the employment of semi-analytical tools, such as the linear stability analysis.
Given the high neutrino density, the dependence of pairwise conversions on the
neutrino energy has been deemed to play a negligible role. We show that fast
pairwise conversions are affected by the neutrino energy, especially in the
non-linear regime. An earlier onset of flavor conversions and a higher
oscillation frequency are found as the vacuum frequency increases (i.e., the
neutrino energy decreases); the oscillation periodicity, otherwise present, is
gradually destroyed as the vacuum frequency increases. Such effects are,
however, not further exacerbated by the inclusion of spectral energy
distributions for neutrinos, contrary to what was found for ""slow""
neutrino-neutrino conversions. In addition, our findings highlight the
dependence of fast pairwise conversions on the neutrino mass ordering for
realistic values of the neutrino vacuum frequency. Our findings highlight the
limitations intrinsic to widely adopted approximations and extrapolations based
on the linear regime of fast conversions. In order to gauge their possible
impact on the source physics, a more sophisticated modeling of pairwise
conversions is necessary.

intracluster medium (ICM) are developed that include scattering from both
classical collisions and self-generated whistler waves. The calculation employs
an expansion of the kinetic electron equation along the ambient magnetic field
in the limit of strong scattering and assumes whistler waves with low phase
speeds $V_w\sim{v}_{te}/\beta_e\ll{v}_{te}$ dominate the turbulent spectrum,
with $v_{te}$ the electron thermal speed and $\beta_e\gg1$ the ratio of
electron thermal to magnetic pressure. We find: (1) temperature-gradient-driven
whistlers dominate classical scattering when $L_c>L/\beta_e$, with $L_c$ the
classical electron mean-free-path and $L$ the electron temperature scale
length, and (2) in the whistler dominated regime the electron thermal flux is
controlled by both advection at $V_w$ and a comparable diffusive term. The
findings suggest whistlers limit electron heat flux over large regions of the
ICM, including locations unstable to isobaric condensation. Consequences
include: (1) the Field length decreases, extending the domain of thermal
instability to smaller length-scales, (2) the heat flux temperature dependence
changes from $T_e^{7/2}/L$ to $V_wnT_e\sim{T}_e^{1/2}$, (3) the magneto-thermal
and heat-flux driven buoyancy instabilities are impaired or completely
inhibited, and (4) sound waves in the ICM propagate greater distances, as
inferred from observations. This description of thermal transport can be used
in macroscale ICM models.

shows that an unprecedented high spatial resolution is achieved. For DS1, a
detailed study of the H$_{2}$, [Fe II] and [Si VI] emission lines reveals a
three-phase gas morphology: (1) the low-velocity [Fe II] emission representing
the glowingwall of an hourglass structure, (2) the high-velocity compact blobs
of low and high ionization emissions filling the hourglass volume and (3) the
distribution of H$_{2}$ molecular gas defines the thick and irregular walls of
a bubble surrounding a cavity. Both the hourglass and the molecular emissions
have an asymmetry caused by the fragmentation of the north-eastern molecular
wall, closest to the active galactic nucleus, resulting in highvelocity compact
blobs of ionized gas outside the bubble. The south-western part of the bubble
is excavated by the jet, where the blobs remain confined and are blown along
the bubble's inner boundary. We propose that those blobs are driven by a hot
""secondary wind"" coming from the spot where the jet interacts and injects its
energy in the molecular gas. The combination of a primary wind launched by the
central source and the secondary wind is what we call a two-stage outflow. For
DS2, we detected a [Si VI] outflow nearly coplanar to the maser disc and
orthogonal to the CO outflow found by a previous study. Such unexpected
scenario is interpreted as the interaction between the central radiation field
and a two-phase gas density torus.

  In order to evaluate a dataset a priori, data complexity metrics have been
used extensively. They provide information regarding different intrinsic

and a course of action that improves performance. However, most complexity
metrics focus on just one characteristic of the data, which can be insufficient
to properly evaluate the dataset towards the classifiers' performance. In fact,
class overlap, a very detrimental feature for the classification process

both good estimates for class overlap, and great correlations with the
classification performance. For that purpose, a novel family of metrics have
been developed. Being based on ball coverage by classes, they are named after
Overlap Number of Balls. Finally, some prospects for the adaptation of the

persistent radio emitter. The extraordinary coronal flaring activity is thought
to be the origin of compact radio emission and other associated phenomena as
large slingshot prominences. Aim: We aim to investigate the radio emission
mechanism and the milliarcsecond radio structure around AB Dor A. Methods: We
performed phase-referenced VLBI observations at 22.3 GHz, 8.4 GHz, and 1.4 GHz
over more than one decade using the Australian VLBI array. Results: Our 8.4 GHz
images show a double core-halo morphology, similar at all epochs, with emission
extending at heights between 5 and 18 stellar radii. Furthermore, the sequence
of the 8.4 GHz maps shows a clear variation of the source structure within the
observing time. However, images at 1.4 GHz and 22.3 GHz are compatible with a
compact source. The phase-reference position at 8.4 GHz and 1.4 GHz are
coincident with those expected from the well-known milliarcsecond-precise
astrometry of this star, meanwhile the 22.3 GHz position is 4$\sigma$ off the
prediction in the north-west direction. The origin of this offset is still
unclear. Conclusions: We have considered several models to explain the
morphology and evolution of the inner radio structure detected in AB Dor A
which include emission from the stellar polar caps, a flaring,
magnetically-driven loop structure, and the presence of helmet streamers. A
possible close companion to AB Dor A has been also investigated. Our results
confirm the extraordinary coronal magnetic activity of this star, able to
produce compact radio structures at very large heights, so far only seen in
binary interacting systems.

polarization of optical wavefronts. Implementation of active tunability of
metasurfaces promises compact flat optics capable of reconfigurable wavefront
shaping. Phase-change materials (PCMs), such as germanium telluride or
germanium antimony telluride, are a prominent material class enabling
reconfigurable metasurfaces due to their large refractive index change upon
structural transition. However, commonly employed laser-induced switching of
PCMs limits the achievable feature sizes and thus, restricts device
miniaturization. Here, we propose thermal scanning-probe-induced local
switching of germanium telluride to realize near-infrared metasurfaces with
feature sizes far below what is achievable with diffraction-limited optical
switching. Our design is based on a planar multilayer stack and does not
require fabrication of protruding dielectric or metallic resonators as commonly
applied in the literature. Instead, we numerically demonstrate that a
broad-band tuning of perfect absorption could be realized by the localized and
controlled tip-induced crystallization of the PCM layer. The spectral response
of the metasurface is explained using simple resonance mode analysis and
numerical simulations. To facilitate experimental realization, we provide a
detailed theoretical description of the tip-induced crystallization employing
multiphysics simulations to demonstrate the great potential for fabricating
compact reconfigurable metasurfaces. Our concept allows for tunable perfect
absorption and can be applied not only for thermal imaging or sensing, but also
for spatial frequency filtering.

developed to precisely interpret the switching characteristics, and to quantify
the impact of current saturation on power dissipation, thermal diffusion, and

disordered array of fixed obstacles. The interplay of two different types of
randomness, quenched disorder and stochastic noise, is investigated to unravel
their impact on the transport properties. We compute lines of isodiffusivity as
a function of the rotational diffusion coefficient and the obstacle density. We
find that increasing noise or disorder tends to amplify diffusion, yet for
large randomness the competition leads to a strong suppression of transport. We
rationalize both the suppression and amplification of transport by comparing
the relevant time scales of the free motion to the mean period between
collisions with obstacles.

equation with several nonlinear/nonlocal terms. Among these, the vorticity
accelerates divergence while others suppress divergence and enhance the finite

global solutions of the multi-dimensional EP system. Despite of these, we show
that the Riccati system can afford to have global solutions under a suitable

of particle dampers (PD) attached to a vertically driven, single degree of
freedom mechanical system. Although many studies focus on $\eta$, less work has
been devoted to $m$. It has been recently demonstrated [M. Masmoudi \textit{et
al}. Granular Matter 18 (2016) 71.] that $m$ non-linearly depends on the
driving acceleration $\gamma$ according to a power law, $m\propto\gamma^k$.
Experiments using 3D packings of particles suggest $k=-2$. However, simulations
with 1D columns of particles on a vibrating plate and theoretical predictions
based on the inelastic bouncing ball model (IBBM) suggest that $k=-1$. These
findings left open questions whether m may depend on the dimensionality of the
packing or on lateral interactions between walls and grains. In turn, $\eta$
was shown to follow a universal curve, $\eta\propto\gamma^{-1}$, whatever the
dimensionality and the constraints in the motion of the grains. In this work,
we consider PD under different confinement conditions in the motion of the
particles (1D, quasi-1D, quasi-2D and 3D). We find that the dynamical response
of the PD ($m$ and $\eta$) is not sensitive to the lateral confinement or
dimensionality. However, we have observed two distinct regimes: (i) In the
inertial regime, $\eta$ decays according to the IBBM for all dimensions,
$\eta\propto\gamma^{-1}$, while $m$ falls with an apparent power law behaviour
that matches Masmoudi's experiments, $m\propto\gamma^{-2}$, for all dimensions
but only in the range of moderate acceleration, before becoming negative for
very high accelerations. (ii) In the quasi-static regime, both $m$ and $\eta$
display a complex behavior as functions of the excitation amplitude, but tend
to the IBBM prediction, $m\propto\gamma^{-1}$ and $\eta\propto\gamma^{-1}$.

kind of employees have cooperated with the company's measures in the current
corona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation has had to these
employees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis, the pass
analysis was carried out using awareness data obtained from a questionnaire
survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese companies in China. The results
showed that employees with higher social capital and resilience were more
supportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who were
more supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their jobs.
However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it
was shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona
countermeasures but also enhances the turnover intention. This means that just
by raising the anxiety of employees, even if a company achieves the short-term
goal of having them cooperate with the company's countermeasures against
corona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by making them increase their
intention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and
to fear it properly. But more than that, it should be possible for the company
to help employees stay resilient, build good relationships with them, and
increase their social capital to make them support crisis measurement of the
company most effectively while keeping their turnover intention low.

waves to reconstruct the optical absorption contrast of the biological tissues.
Due to its relatively deep penetration (several centimeters in soft tissue),
high spatial resolution, and inherent functional sensitivity, PACT has great
potential for imaging mouse brains with endogenous and exogenous contrasts,
which is of immense interest to the neuroscience community. However,
conventional PACT either assumes homogenous optical fluence within the brain or
uses a simplified attenuation model for optical fluence estimation. Both
approaches underestimate the complexity of the fluence heterogeneity and can
result in poor quantitative imaging accuracy. To optimize the quantitative
performance of PACT, we explore for the first time 3D Monte Carlo simulation to
study the optical fluence distribution in a complete mouse brain model. We
apply the MCX Monte Carlo simulation package on a digital mouse (Digimouse)
brain atlas that has complete anatomy information. To evaluate the impact of
the brain vasculature on light delivery, we also incorporate the whole-brain
vasculature in the Digimouse atlas. The simulation results clearly show that
the optical fluence in the mouse brain is heterogeneous at the global level and
can decrease by a factor of five with increasing depth. Moreover, the strong
absorption and scattering of the brain vasculature also induce the fluence
disturbance at the local level. Our results suggest that both global and local
fluence heterogeneity contributes to the reduced quantitative accuracy of the
reconstructed PACT images of mouse brain.

samples $(x,y)\sim p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ where $y$ are partial observations of a

its uncertainty from the observations $y$. We refer to this problem as the

we propose a two-step scheme, which makes use of normalizing flows and joint
data to train a conditional generator $q_{\theta}(x|y)$ to approximate the
target posterior density $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$. Additionally, this preliminary phase
provides a density function $q_{\theta}(x|y)$, which can be recast as a prior

p_{Y}'(y')$, a likelihood model $y'|x$, and a prior on $x'$ are known. We then
train another invertible generator with output density $q'_{\phi}(x|y')$

considerable training speedup when reusing the pretrained network

The box-level pseudo ground truths mined by the target-domain detector in each

knowledge in the source dataset is more thoroughly exploited and leveraged.
Extensive experiments are conducted with Pascal VOC 2007 as the target

  We provide a static pricing scheme for the small-supply regime: where $k$ is
small but larger than $1$. Prior to our work, the best competitive ratio known
for this setting was the $1/2$ that follows from the single-unit prophet
inequality. Our pricing scheme is easy to describe as well as practical -- it
is anonymous, non-adaptive, and order-oblivious. We pick a single price that
equalizes the expected fraction of items sold and the probability that the
supply does not sell out before all customers are served; this price is then
offered to each customer while supply lasts. This extends an approach
introduced by Samuel-Cahn for the case of $k=1$. This pricing scheme achieves a
competitive ratio that increases gradually with the supply. Subsequent work by
Jiang, Ma, and Zhang shows that our pricing scheme is the optimal static
pricing for every value of $k$.

and SFR. We aim to understand the causes of their high star formation and
quantify the percentage of DSFGs that lie above the MS. We adopted a
multi-wavelength approach with data from optical to submillimetre wavelengths
from surveys at the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) to study a submillimetre sample
of high-redshift galaxies. Two submillimetre selection methods were used,
including: sources selected at 850$\mathrm{\, \mu m}$ with the Sub-millimetre
Common-User Bolometer Array 2) SCUBA-2 instrument and {\it Herschel}-Spectral
and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) selected sources (colour-colour
diagrams and 500$\mathrm{\, \mu m}$ risers), finding that 185 have good
multi-wavelength coverage. The resulting sample of 185 high-z candidates was
further studied by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with the CIGALE
fitting code. We derived photometric redshifts, stellar masses, SFRs, and
additional physical parameters, such as the infrared luminosity and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) contribution. We find that the different results in the
literature are, only in part, due to selection effects. The difference in
measured SFRs affects the position of DSFGs on the MS of galaxies; most of the
DSFGs lie on the MS (60\%). Finally, we find that the star formation efficiency
(SFE) depends on the epoch and intensity of the star formation burst in the
galaxy; the later the burst, the more intense the star formation.

physical processes causing variability in blazar jets, we have obtained high
time-resolution observations of BL Lacertae over a wide wavelength range: with
the \emph{Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite} (TESS) at 6,000-10,000 \AA\
with 2-minute cadence; with the Neil Gehrels \emph{Swift} satellite at optical,
UV, and X-ray bands; with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array at hard
X-ray bands; with the \emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope at $\gamma$-ray
energies; and with the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope for measurement of the
optical flux density and polarization. All light curves are correlated, with
similar structure on timescales from hours to days. The shortest timescale of
variability at optical frequencies observed with TESS is $\sim 0.5$ hr. The
most common timescale is $13\pm1$~hr, comparable with the minimum timescale of
X-ray variability, 14.5 hr. The multi-wavelength variability properties cannot
be explained by a change solely in the Doppler factor of the emitting plasma.
The polarization behavior implies that there are both ordered and turbulent
components to the magnetic field in the jet. Correlation analysis indicates
that the X-ray variations lag behind the $\gamma$-ray and optical light curves
by up to $\sim 0.4$ days. The timescales of variability, cross-frequency lags,
and polarization properties can be explained by turbulent plasma that is
energized by a shock in the jet and subsequently loses energy to synchrotron
and inverse Compton radiation in a magnetic field of strength $\sim3$ G

indicate a spatially variable distribution of the incidence of COVID-19
disease. An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a
consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions,
during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand
the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four
candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial
conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to
French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard
statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission
corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the
geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant
parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a
geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the
epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction
policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of
local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent
epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us
to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the
disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to
accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here,
in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is
of general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.

Toupin, The Classical Field Theories (1960), we use the full version of the
viscous stress tensor which was originally derived for compressible flows,
instead of the classical incompressible stress tensor. In our approach, the
divergence-free constraint for the viscous stress term is not enforced ahead of
discretization. Instead, our formulation allows the scheme itself to ""choose"" a
consistent way to interpret the divergence-free constraint: i.e., the
divergence-free constraint is interpreted (or enforced) in a consistent fashion
in both the mass conservation equation and the stress tensor term (in the
momentum equation). Furthermore, our approach preserves the original
symmetrical properties of the stress tensor, e.g. its rotational invariance,
and it remains physically correct in the context of compressible flows. As a
result, our approach facilitates versatility and code reuse. In this paper, we
introduce our approach and establish some important mathematical properties for
the resulting class of finite element schemes. More precisely, for general
mixed methods, which are not necessarily pointwise divergence-free, we
establish the existence of a new norm induced by the full, viscous bilinear
form. Thereafter, we prove the coercivity of the viscous bilinear form and the
semi-coercivity of a convective trilinear form. In addition, we demonstrate
L2-stability of the discrete velocity fields for the general class of methods
and (by deduction) the H(div)-conforming methods. Finally, we run some
numerical experiments to illustrate the behavior of the versatile mixed
methods, and we make careful comparisons with a conventional H(div)-conforming

centrality of a point in a given data cloud in $\IR^d$. If the depth of a point
can be represented as the minimum of the depths with respect to all
one-dimensional projections of the data, then the depth satisfies the so-called
projection property. Such depths form an important class that includes many of
the depths that have been proposed in literature. For depths that satisfy the
projection property an approximate algorithm can easily be constructed since
taking the minimum of the depths with respect to only a finite number of

the multivariate data. Such an algorithm is particularly useful if no exact
algorithm exists or if the exact algorithm has a high computational complexity,
as is the case with the halfspace depth or the projection depth. To compute
these depths in high dimensions, the use of an approximate algorithm with

manually translate them to differentiable code.
  We present a differentiable programming language, $\lambda_S$, that is the
first to deliver a semantics for higher-order functions, higher-order

  We use $\lambda_S$ to construct novel differentiable libraries for
representing probability distributions, implicit surfaces, and generalized
parametric surfaces -- all as instances of higher-order datatypes -- and
present case studies that rely on computing the derivatives of these

motion of deformable objects near a boundary lubricated by a fluid, and is one
of the key physical mechanisms to minimise friction and wear in natural and
engineered systems. Hence it is of particular interest to relate the thickness
of the lubricant layer to the entrainment (sliding/rolling) velocity, the
mechanical loading exerted onto the contacting elements, and properties of the
elastic boundary. In this work we provide an overview of the various regimes of
soft lubrication for two-dimensional cylinders in lubricated contact with
compliant walls. We discuss the limits of small and large entrainment velocity,
which is equivalent to large and small elastic deformations, as the cylinder
moves near thick or thin elastic layers. The analysis focusses on thin elastic
coatings, both compressible and incompressible, for which analytical scaling

pin-like contact-less metasurfaces is proposed in order to enable low loss and
high-power-handling capability in switching operations. Thanks to the
remarkable behaviour of glide symmetry, the meta-structures are used both as
wide-band EBG material to confine the field in the guide and as low-dispersive
guiding medium filling the guide itself. The reconfigurability is achieved by
adjusting the displacement between the metasurfaces. A higher displacement
enables propagation within the waveguide and a lower displacement suppresses
it. A two-state reconfigurability is therefore designed, allowing the device to
act as an on-off switch in the V-band. In particular, a dispersion analysis
highlights the potential of such technology to achieve switching operating over
a 55-66 GHz frequency range. A complete design including matching mechanism and
WR15 feeding is also described and shown to exhibit a $S_{11}<-10$ dB bandwidth
from 57.4 to 62.8 GHz. In the ""off"" state, the switch isolation is better than
65 dB and in the ""on"" state, the insertion losses are better than 0.7 dB within
the entire operating frequency range. The isolation between two adjacent
waveguides is also discussed to assess the integration of such a device within
a switching network.

long-lived patterns in its motions. This approach has been particularly
successful for molecular dynamics data, where slowly decorrelating patterns can
indicate large-scale conformational changes. Detecting such patterns is the
central objective of the variational approach to conformational dynamics (VAC),
as well as the related methods of time-lagged independent component analysis
and Markov state modeling. In VAC, the search for slowly decorrelating patterns
is formalized as a variational problem solved by the eigenfunctions of the
system's transition operator. VAC computes solutions to this variational
problem by optimizing a linear or nonlinear model of the eigenfunctions using
time series data. Here, we build on VAC's success by addressing two practical
limitations. First, VAC can give poor eigenfunction estimates when the lag time
parameter is chosen poorly. Second, VAC can overfit when using flexible
parameterizations such as artificial neural networks with insufficient
regularization. To address these issues, we propose an extension that we call
integrated VAC (IVAC). IVAC integrates over multiple lag times before solving
the variational problem, making its results more robust and reproducible than
VAC's.

we design a novel edge computing-assisted federated learning framework, in

As telecommunication technology improves, autonomous vehicles are getting
connected to each other and to infrastructures, forming Connected and
Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). CAVs will help humans achieve safe, efficient, and
autonomous transportation systems. However, CAVs will face significant security
challenges because many of their components are vulnerable to attacks, and a
successful attack on a CAV may have significant impacts on other CAVs and
infrastructures due to their communications. In this paper, we conduct a survey
on 184 papers from 2000 to 2020 to understand state-of-the-art CAV attacks and
defense techniques. This survey first presents a comprehensive overview of
security attacks and their corresponding countermeasures on CAVs. We then
discuss the details of attack models based on the targeted CAV components of
attacks, access requirements, and attack motives. Finally, we identify some
current research challenges and trends from the perspectives of both academic
research and industrial development. Based on our studies of academic
literature and industrial publications, we have not found any strong connection
between academic research and industry's implementation on CAV-related security
issues. While efforts from CAV manufacturers to secure CAVs have been reported,
there is no evidence to show that CAVs on the market have the ability to defend
against some novel attack models that the research community has recently
found. This survey may give researchers and engineers a better understanding of
the current status and trend of CAV security for CAV future improvement.

simulations. Aiming to cast some light in the possible sarin selective
filtration by graphene, we designed a bipartite simulation box with a porous
graphene nanosheet placed at the middle. Sarin and air molecules were initially
placed only on one side of the box so as to create an initial pressure towards
the passage of both to the other side. The box dimensions were chosen so that
the hole in the graphene was the only possible way through which sarin and air

passed through the hole in graphene was monitored during 10 ns of simulation

is a classic problem in streaming and sketching, dating back to Flajolet and
Martin's classic Probabilistic Counting (PCSA) algorithm from 1983. In this
paper we study the intrinsic tradeoff between the space complexity of the
sketch and its estimation error in the random oracle model. We define a new
measure of efficiency for cardinality estimators called the Fisher-Shannon
(Fish) number $\mathcal{H}/\mathcal{I}$. It captures the tension between the
limiting Shannon entropy ($\mathcal{H}$) of the sketch and its normalized
Fisher information ($\mathcal{I}$), which characterizes the variance of a
statistically efficient, asymptotically unbiased estimator.
  Our results are as follows.
  We prove that all base-$q$ variants of Flajolet and Martin's PCSA sketch have
Fish-number $H_0/I_0 \approx 1.98016$ and that every base-$q$ variant of
(Hyper)LogLog has Fish-number worse than $H_0/I_0$, but that they tend to
$H_0/I_0$ in the limit as $q\rightarrow \infty$. Here $H_0,I_0$ are precisely
defined constants.
  We describe a sketch called Fishmonger that is based on a smoothed,
entropy-compressed variant of PCSA with a different estimator function. It is
proved that with high probability, Fishmonger processes a multiset of $[U]$
such that at all times, its space is $O(\log^2\log U) + (1+o(1))(H_0/I_0)b
\approx 1.98b$ bits and its standard error is $1/\sqrt{b}$.
  We give circumstantial evidence that $H_0/I_0$ is the optimum Fish-number of
mergeable sketches for Cardinality Estimation. We define a class of
linearizable sketches and prove that no member of this class can beat
$H_0/I_0$. The popular mergeable sketches are, in fact, also linearizable.

analytics. In attributed graphs, both the structure and attribute information
can be utilized for link prediction. Most existing studies focus on
transductive link prediction where both nodes are already in the graph.
However, many real-world applications require inductive prediction for new
nodes having only attribute information. It is more challenging since the new
nodes do not have structure information and cannot be seen during the model
training. To solve this problem, we propose a model called DEAL, which consists
of three components: two node embedding encoders and one alignment mechanism.
The two encoders aim to output the attribute-oriented node embedding and the
structure-oriented node embedding, and the alignment mechanism aligns the two
types of embeddings to build the connections between the attributes and links.
Our model DEAL is versatile in the sense that it works for both inductive and

lattice model, we reveal that the surface state Dirac cone of the TI can
gradually merge into or be highly intertwined with the FMM bulk bands, and the
surface states percolate into the FMM and eventually hybridize with the quantum
well states therein. The magnetization can distort the spin-momentum locking of
the surface states and yield an asymmetric band structure, which causes a
laminar flow of room temperature persistent charge current. Moreover, the
proximity to the FMM also promotes a persistent laminar spin current. Through a
linear response theory, we elaborate that both the surface state and the FMM
bulk bands contribute to the current-induced spin torque, and their real wave
functions render the spin torque predominantly field-like, with a magnitude
highly influenced by the degree of the percolation of the surface states. On
the other hand, impurities can change the spin polarization expected from the
Edelstein effect and generate a damping-like torque, and produce a torque even
when the magnetization points in-plane and orthogonal to the current direction.

where tensors generally represent states or operators and contractions express
the algebra of these quantities. In this context, the states and operators
often preserve physical conservation laws, which are manifested as group
symmetries in the tensors. These group symmetries imply that each tensor has
block sparsity and can be stored in a reduced form. For nontrivial
contractions, the memory footprint and cost are lowered, respectively, by a
linear and a quadratic factor in the number of symmetry sectors.
State-of-the-art tensor contraction software libraries exploit this opportunity
by iterating over blocks or using general block-sparse tensor representations.
Both approaches entail overhead in performance and code complexity. With
intuition aided by tensor diagrams, we present a technique, irreducible

This technique yields a general algorithm for arbitrary group symmetric

  Let $\alpha^*\approx 1.763$ denote the solution to $\exp(1/x)=x$ and let
$\alpha>\alpha^*$. We prove that, for any triangle-free graph $G=(V,E)$ with
maximum degree $\Delta$, for all $q\geq\alpha\Delta+1$, the mixing time of the
Glauber dynamics for $q$-colorings is polynomial in $n=|V|$, with the exponent
of the polynomial independent of $\Delta$ and $q$. In comparison, previous
approximate counting results for colorings held for a similar range of $q$
(asymptotically in $\Delta$) but with larger girth requirement or with a
running time where the polynomial exponent depended on $\Delta$ and $q$
(exponentially). One further feature of using the spectral independence
approach to study colorings is that it avoids many of the technical
complications in previous approaches caused by coupling arguments or by passing
to the complex plane; the key improvement on the running time is based on
relatively simple combinatorial arguments which are then translated into

belt and the Euphrosyne family occupies a highly inclined region in the outer
main belt and contains a remarkably large number of members, which is
interpreted as an outcome of a disruptive cratering event. The goals of this
adaptive-optics imaging study were threefold: to characterize the shape of
Euphrosyne, to constrain its density, and to search for the large craters that
may be associated with the family formation event. We obtained disk-resolved
images of Euphrosyne using SPHERE/ZIMPOL at ESO's 8.2-m VLT as part of our
large program (ID: 199.C-0074, PI: Vernazza). We reconstructed its 3D-shape
using the adam shape modeling algorithm based on the SPHERE images and the
available lightcurves of this asteroid. We analyzed the dynamics of the
satellite with the genoid meta-heuristic algorithm. Finally, we studied the
shape of Euphrosyne using hydrostatic equilibrium models. Our SPHERE
observations show that Euphrosyne has a nearly spherical shape with the
sphericity index of 0.9888 and its surface lacks large impact craters.
Euphrosyne's diameter is 268+/-6 km, making it one of the top 10 largest main
belt asteroids. We detected a satellite of Euphrosyne -- S/2019 (31) 1-- that
is about 4 km across, on an circular orbit. The mass determined from the orbit
of the satellite together with the volume computed from the shape model imply a
density of 1665+/-242 kg/m^3, suggesting that Euphrosyne probably contain a
large fraction of water ice in its interior. We find that the spherical shape
of Euphrosyne is a result of the reaccumulation process following the impact,
as in the case of (10) Hygiea. However, our shape analysis reveals that,
contrary to Hygiea, the axis ratios of Euphrosyne significantly differ from the
ones suggested by fluid hydrostatic equilibrium following reaccumulation.

methods do not provide useful tools to study and cannot explicitly capture
temporal community dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose GRADE - a
probabilistic model that learns to generate evolving node and community
representations by imposing a random walk prior over their trajectories. Our
model also learns node community membership which is updated between time steps
via a transition matrix. At each time step link generation is performed by
first assigning node membership from a distribution over the communities, and
then sampling a neighbor from a distribution over the nodes for the assigned
community. We parametrize the node and community distributions with neural
networks and learn their parameters via variational inference. Experiments
demonstrate GRADE outperforms baselines in dynamic link prediction, shows
favourable performance on dynamic community detection, and identifies coherent

content popularity can change rapidly. These algorithms continuously learn
latent mappings between users and items, based on contexts associated with them
both. Recent recommendation algorithms that learn clustering or social
structures between users have exhibited higher recommendation accuracy.
However, as the number of users and items in the environment increases, the
time required to generate recommendations deteriorates significantly. As a
result, these cannot be deployed in practice. The state-of-the-art distributed
bandit algorithm - DCCB - relies on a peer-to-peer net-work to share
information among distributed workers. However, this approach does not scale
well with the increasing number of users. Furthermore, it suffers from slow
discovery of clusters, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address the above
issues, this paper proposes a novel distributed bandit-based algorithm called
DistCLUB. This algorithm lazily creates clusters in a distributed manner, and
dramatically reduces the network data sharing requirement, achieving high
scalability. Additionally, DistCLUB finds clusters much faster, achieving
better accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithm. Evaluation over both
real-world benchmarks and synthetic datasets shows that DistCLUB is on average
8.87x faster than DCCB, and achieves 14.5% higher normalized prediction

We associate them with SEP events at energies above 10 MeV. Examination of the
source region of each CME reveals that CMEs more often accompany a SEP event if
they originate from the longitude of E20-W100 relative to the observer.
However, a SEP event could still be absent if the CME is $<$ 2000 km/s. For the
associated CME-SEP pairs, we compute three timescales for each of the SEP
events, following Kahler (2005, 2013); namely the timescale of the onset (TO),
the rise time (TR), and the duration (TD). They are correlated with the
longitude of the CME source region relative to the footpoint of the Parker
spiral ($\Delta\Phi$) and $v_{CME}$. The TO tends to be short for
$|\Delta\Phi|$ $<$ 60$^{\circ}$ . This trend is weaker for TR and TD. The SEP
timescales are only weakly correlated with $v_{CME}$. Positive correlations of
both TR and TD with $v_{CME}$ are seen in poorly connected (large
$|\Delta\Phi|$) events. Additionally, TO appears to be negatively correlated
with $v_{CME}$ for events with small $|\Delta\Phi|$.

transportation cost sharing. This has become a popular trend in the emerging
paradigm of sharing economy. One crucial component to support effective
ride-sharing is the matching mechanism that pairs up suitable commuters.
Traditionally, matching has been performed in a centralized manner, whereby an
operator arranges ride-sharing according to a global objective (e.g., total
cost of all commuters). However, ride-sharing is a decentralized
decision-making paradigm, where commuters are self-interested and only
motivated to team up based on individual payments. Particularly, it is not
clear how transportation cost should be shared fairly between commuters, and
what ramifications of cost-sharing are on decentralized ride-sharing. This
paper sheds light on the principles of decentralized ride-sharing and
vehicle-pooling mechanisms based on stable matching, such that no one would be
better off to deviate from a stable matching outcome. We study various fair
cost-sharing mechanisms and the induced stable matching outcomes. We compare
the stable matching outcomes with a social optimal outcome (that minimizes
total cost) by theoretical bounds of social optimality ratios, and show that
several fair cost-sharing mechanisms can achieve high social optimality. We
also corroborate our results with an empirical study of taxi sharing under fair
cost-sharing mechanisms by a data analysis on New York City taxi trip dataset,
and provide useful insights on effective decentralized mechanisms for practical
ride-sharing and vehicle-pooling.

exhibit extensive areas of stable skyrmions, which overlap for a wide range of
anisotropy parameters. Although the existence of the out-of-plane skyrmions was
contradicted within the previous theoretical models, we prove that additional
surface twists lead to their stability, while the moderate easy-plane
anisotropy increases the stability range of in-plane skyrmions. Moreover, the
interplay between the anisotropy and the surface twists gives rise to a stable
spiral state canted with respect to the surfaces. Being absent in bulk
helimagnets, this oblique spiral occupies vast areas at the phase diagrams in

reduce the storage size, in the proposed methods, a node cannot keep all blocks
or cannot generate a block. We propose an architecture called Trail that allows
nodes to hold all blocks in a small storage and to generate and validate blocks
and transactions. Trail does not depend on a consensus algorithm or fork choice
rule. In this architecture, a client who issues transactions has the data to
prove its own balances and can generate a transaction containing the proof of
balances. The nodes in Trail do not store transactions, UTXOs and account
balances: they keep only blocks. The blocksize is approximately 8 KB, which is
100 times smaller than that of Bitcoin. Further, the block size is constant
regardless of the number of accounts and the number of transactions. Compared
to traditional blockchains, clients who issue transactions must store
additional data. However, we show that proper data archiving can keep the
account device storage size small. Trail allows more users to be block

been introduced and analyzed as a way to better explore and understand complex
systems and datasets characterized by multiway relationships. Recent work has
made use of a generalized hypergraph cut function which for a hypergraph
$\mathcal{H} = (V,E)$ can be defined by associating each hyperedge $e \in E$
with a splitting function ${\bf w}_e$, which assigns a penalty to each way of
separating the nodes of $e$. When each ${\bf w}_e$ is a submodular
cardinality-based splitting function, meaning that ${\bf w}_e(S) = g(|S|)$ for
some concave function $g$, previous work has shown that a generalized
hypergraph cut problem can be reduced to a directed graph cut problem on an
augmented node set. However, existing reduction procedures often result in a
dense graph, even when the hypergraph is sparse, which leads to slow runtimes
for algorithms that run on the reduced graph.
  We introduce a new framework of sparsifying hypergraph-to-graph reductions,
where a hypergraph cut defined by submodular cardinality-based splitting
functions is $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximated by a cut on a directed graph. Our
techniques are based on approximating concave functions using piecewise linear
curves. For $\varepsilon > 0$ we need at most $O(\varepsilon^{-1}|e| \log |e|)$
edges to reduce any hyperedge $e$, which leads to faster runtimes for
approximating generalized hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problems. For the machine
learning heuristic of a clique splitting function, our approach requires only

compared to uni-modal approaches with fusion of multi-modal features resulting

ignoring possible long-term dependencies within the data during fusion. In this
paper, we present a novel Memory based Attentive Fusion layer, which fuses
modes by incorporating both the current features and longterm dependencies in
the data, thus allowing the model to understand the relative importance of
modes over time. We introduce an explicit memory block within the fusion layer
which stores features containing long-term dependencies of the fused data. The
feature inputs from uni-modal encoders are fused through attentive composition
and transformation followed by naive fusion of the resultant memory derived
features with layer inputs. Following state-of-the-art methods, we have
evaluated the performance and the generalizability of the proposed fusion
approach on two different datasets with different modalities. In our
experiments, we replace the naive fusion layer in benchmark networks with our
proposed layer to enable a fair comparison. Experimental results indicate that
the MBAF layer can generalise across different modalities and networks to
enhance fusion and improve performance.

rate for the Type I X-ray bursts of five low-mass X-ray binary systems. We
chose sources with measured neutron star spins and a substantial population of
bursts from a large observational sample. The general trend for the burst rate
is qualitatively the same for all sources; the burst rate first increases with
the accretion rate up to a maximum, above which the burst rate declines,
despite the increasing accretion rate. At higher accretion rates, when the
burst rate decreases, the {\alpha}-value (the ratio of accretion energy and
burst energy) increases by up to a factor of 10 above that in the rising burst
rate regime. These observations are contrary to the predictions of 1D numerical
models, but can be explained as the consequence of a zone of stable burning on
the neutron star surface, which expands with increasing accretion rate. The
stable burning also ""pollutes"" the unstable burning layer with ashes,
contributing to the change in burst properties measured in the falling burst
rate regime. We find that the mass accretion rate at which the burst rate
begins to decrease is anti-correlated with the spin of the neutron star. We
conclude that the neutron star spin is a key factor, moderating the nuclear
burning stability, via the local accretion rate and fuel composition over the

fundamentally important to support the success of deep neural network learning.
A direct computation of the landscape beyond two layers is hard. Therefore, to
capture the global view of the landscape, an interpretable model of the
network-parameter (or weight) space must be established. However, the model is
lacking so far. Furthermore, it remains unknown what the landscape looks like
for deep networks of binary synapses, which plays a key role in robust and
energy efficient neuromorphic computation. Here, we propose a statistical
mechanics framework by directly building a least structured model of the
high-dimensional weight space, considering realistic structured data,
stochastic gradient descent training, and the computational depth of neural
networks. We also consider whether the number of network parameters outnumbers
the number of supplied training data, namely, over- or under-parametrization.
Our least structured model reveals that the weight spaces of the
under-parametrization and over-parameterization cases belong to the same class,
in the sense that these weight spaces are well-connected without any
hierarchical clustering structure. In contrast, the shallow-network has a
broken weight space, characterized by a discontinuous phase transition, thereby
clarifying the benefit of depth in deep learning from the angle of high
dimensional geometry. Our effective model also reveals that inside a deep
network, there exists a liquid-like central part of the architecture in the
sense that the weights in this part behave as randomly as possible, providing
algorithmic implications. Our data-driven model thus provides a statistical
mechanics insight about why deep learning is unreasonably effective in terms of
the high-dimensional weight space, and how deep networks are different from
shallow ones.

This is challenging, however, due to the linear response of most acoustic
systems. Here, we leverage the strong piezoelectricity of lithium niobate to
demonstrate fully tunable gain, loss, and nonlinearity for surface acoustic
waves using electric circuitry. This allows the construction of a nonlinear
acoustic parity-time-symmetric system and enables nonreciprocal transmission.
We achieve a nonreciprocity of 10 decibels for a 200-MHz acoustic wave at a low
input power of 3 $\mu$W and further demonstrate one-way circulation of acoustic

this piezoelectric platform for on-chip phononic processing and exploration of

short distances leads to a saturation in the number density of baryons and
generates perturbative quarks from the lower phase space, which leads to the
shell-like distribution of baryons by the Pauli exclusion principle. The
strange-quark Fermi sea always appears at high densities but the $\Lambda$

the ranges for the neutron-star surface magnetic dipole field strengths,

analysis under the subcritical luminosity condition indicate surface-field
strengths in the $\sim 10^{11}-10^{15}\,{\rm G}$ range. We argue that the PULX
do not require magnetar-strength surface dipole fields if beaming is taken into

magnetically channel the accretion flow in super-critical accretion disks.

procedure that can significantly affect a model's performance. In this paper we
propose a novel anchor assignment strategy that adaptively separates anchors
into positive and negative samples for a ground truth bounding box according to
the model's learning status such that it is able to reason about the separation
in a probabilistic manner. To do so we first calculate the scores of anchors
conditioned on the model and fit a probability distribution to these scores.
The model is then trained with anchors separated into positive and negative
samples according to their probabilities. Moreover, we investigate the gap
between the training and testing objectives and propose to predict the
Intersection-over-Unions of detected boxes as a measure of localization quality
to reduce the discrepancy. The combined score of classification and
localization qualities serving as a box selection metric in non-maximum
suppression well aligns with the proposed anchor assignment strategy and leads
significant performance improvements. The proposed methods only add a single
convolutional layer to RetinaNet baseline and does not require multiple anchors
per location, so are efficient. Experimental results verify the effectiveness
of the proposed methods. Especially, our models set new records for

can be applied to the two linearly crossed bands with the effective

transitions in partially defocus images is still challenging. To solve these
problems, we introduce depth information into DBD for the first time. When the
camera parameters are fixed, we argue that the accuracy of DBD is highly
related to scene depth. Hence, we consider the depth information as the
approximate soft label of DBD and propose a joint learning framework inspired
by knowledge distillation. In detail, we learn the defocus blur from ground
truth and the depth distilled from a well-trained depth estimation network at
the same time. Thus, the sharp region will provide a strong prior for depth
estimation while the blur detection also gains benefits from the distilled
depth. Besides, we propose a novel decoder in the fully convolutional
network(FCN) as our network structure. In each level of the decoder, we design
the Selective Reception Field Block(SRFB) for merging multi-scale features
efficiently and reuse the side outputs as Supervision-guided Attention
Block(SAB). Unlike previous methods, the proposed decoder builds reception
field pyramids and emphasizes salient regions simply and efficiently.
Experiments show that our approach outperforms 11 other state-of-the-art
methods on two popular datasets. Our method also runs at over 30 fps on a
single GPU, which is 2x faster than previous works. The code is available at:

In order to better understand factor-based conditioning information with

major US corporations. The first finding is that in all cases (solo and joint)
the most informative factor is always the market excess return factor. Further,
three major issues are discussed: a) the balance of a depth=1 tree as it
relates to properties of the stock return distribution, b) the mechanism behind
depth=1 tree balance in a joint regression tree and c) the dominant stock in a

considerable attention due to their superior properties offering E/Z
photo-isomerization with high yield. In order to compare and quantify their
performance, azobenzene tetraethylammonium (Azo-TB) and arylazopyrazole
tetraethylammonium (AAP-TB) bromides were synthesized and characterized in the
bulk (water) using NMR spectroscopy. At the air-water interface complementary
information from vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and
neutron reflectometry (NR) has revealed the effects of E/Z isomerization in
great detail. In bulk water the photostationary states of >89% for E/Z
switching in both directions were very similar for the surfactants, while their
interfacial behavior was substantially different. In particular, the surface
excess $\Gamma$ of the surfactants changed drastically between E/Z isomers for
AAP-TB (maximum change of $\Gamma$: 2.15 $\mu$mol/m$^2$); for Azo-TB the change
was only moderate (maximum change of $\Gamma$: 1.02 $\mu$mol/m$^2$). Analysis
of SFG spectra revealed that strong non-resonant contributions that heterodyned
the resonant vibrational bands were proportional to $\Gamma$, enabling the
aromatic C-H band to be interpreted as an indicator for changes in interfacial
molecular order. Close comparison of $\Gamma$ from NR with the SFG amplitude
from the aromatic C-H stretch as a function of concentrations and E/Z
conformation revealed substantial molecular order changes for AAP-TB. In
contrast, only $\Gamma$ and not the molecular order varied for Azo-TB. These
differences in interfacial properties are attributed to the molecular structure
of the AAP center that enables favorable lateral interactions at the air-water
interface, causing closed-packed interfacial layers and substantial changes
during E/Z photo-isomerization.

parameter in governing the eruptive character of large flares, with the
proportion of eruptive flares exhibiting a strong anti-correlation with

lower probability for the large flares it produces to be associated with a
coronal mass ejection (CME). This finding is supported by the high positive

categories via learning from few images of these categories, has attracted lots
of attention. Recently, meta-learning based methods have been shown as a
promising direction for FSIC. Commonly, they train a meta-learner
(meta-learning model) to learn easy fine-tuning weight, and when solving an
FSIC task, the meta-learner efficiently fine-tunes itself to a task-specific
model by updating itself on few images of the task. In this paper, we propose a
novel meta-learning based layer-wise adaptive updating (LWAU) method for FSIC.
LWAU is inspired by an interesting finding that compared with common deep
models, the meta-learner pays much more attention to update its top layer when
learning from few images. According to this finding, we assume that the
meta-learner may greatly prefer updating its top layer to updating its bottom
layers for better FSIC performance. Therefore, in LWAU, the meta-learner is
trained to learn not only the easy fine-tuning model but also its favorite
layer-wise adaptive updating rule to improve its learning efficiency. Extensive
experiments show that with the layer-wise adaptive updating rule, the proposed
LWAU: 1) outperforms existing few-shot classification methods with a clear
margin; 2) learns from few images more efficiently by at least 5 times than
existing meta-learners when solving FSIC.

multiple classifiers while explicitly controlling the diversity between them.
We derived the new cost by mathematical analysis and ""reverse engineering"" of

the attacker, detection of Trojan networks is challenging. Existing Trojan
detectors make strong assumptions about the types of triggers and attacks. We

by leveraging the versatility in trigger designs and source to target class
mappings. Our analysis results show that Trojan attacks affect the classifier

Exploiting these two factors, we propose an efficient Trojan detector that
operates without any knowledge of the attack and significantly outperforms

motion that causes image artifacts and limits the set of viable diagnostic

performed by fast, single-shot MRI and retrospective motion correction.
Estimation of fetal pose in real time during MRI stands to benefit prospective
methods to detect and mitigate fetal motion artifacts where inferred fetal
motion is combined with online slice prescription with low-latency decision
making. Current developments of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer a
novel approach for fetal landmarks detection. In this task 15 agents are
deployed to detect 15 landmarks simultaneously by DRL. The optimization is
challenging, and here we propose an improved DRL that incorporates priors on
physical structure of the fetal body. First, we use graph communication layers
to improve the communication among agents based on a graph where each node
represents a fetal-body landmark. Further, additional reward based on the
distance between agents and physical structures such as the fetal limbs is used
to fully exploit physical structure. Evaluation of this method on a repository
of 3-mm resolution in vivo data demonstrates a mean accuracy of landmark
estimation within 10 mm of ground truth as 87.3%, and a mean error of 6.9 mm.
The proposed DRL for fetal pose landmark search demonstrates a potential
clinical utility for online detection of fetal motion that guides real-time
mitigation of motion artifacts as well as health diagnosis during MRI of the

ultra-violet background (UVB) radiation. We perform a suite of radiation
hydrodynamics simulations to study the photoevaporation of minihalos. Our
simulations follow hydrodynamics, non-equilibrium chemistry, and the associated
cooling processes in a self-consistent manner. We conduct a parametric study by
considering a wide range of gas metallicity ($0\,Z_\odot \leq Z \leq
10^{-3}\,Z_\odot$), halo mass ($10^3 M_\odot \leq M \leq 10^8 M_\odot$), UVB
intensity ($0.01 \leq J_{21} \leq 1$), and turn-on redshift of ionizing sources
($10\leq z_{\rm IN} \leq 20$). We show that small halos are evaporated in a few
tens million years, whereas larger mass halos survive for ten times longer. We
show that the gas mass evolution of a minihalo can be characterized by a
scaling parameter that is given by a combination of the halo mass, background
radiation intensity, and redshift. Efficient radiative cooling in
metal-enriched halos induces fast condensation of the gas to form a dense,
self-shielded core. The cold, dense core can become gravitationally unstable in
halos with high metallicities. Early metal enrichment may allow star formation

  The major part of current works propose iterative solutions, which are far

are prohibitive. Moreover, they always require the full knowledge of the

and makes impossible to carry a huge amount of information.
  The present work aims to fill this gap presenting a novel scheme, from the
theoretical framework to realistic scheme. It introduces the solution of the

complexity between the base station and user equipment.

computational effort and noise sensitivity while the conservation of total

formulation treats motion in piecewise linear fields exactly and thus preserves
the non-canonical symplectic form. The algorithm itself is only quasi-geometric

approach: use of natural language where language helps human grasp conceptual
contexts. In this paper, therefore, we propose a new facial expression
synthesis model from language-based facial expression description. Our method
can synthesize the facial image with detailed expressions. In addition,
effectively embedding language features on facial features, our method can
control individual word to handle each part of facial movement. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted to verify the

proton-proton scattering in the ISR--LHC energy range is discussed for fixed
values of momentum transfer in the region of the forward diffraction cone, in
the region beyond the second maximum of $d\sigma/dt$ and in the vicinity of the
dip-bump structure. As can be seen from the currently available experimental
data, the differential cross-section in the region beyond the second maximum
has exactly the same properties as in the forward diffraction cone, including
the existence of a stationary point, that is, we observe a second diffraction
cone, which has the same origin as the forward peak. The simplest natural
explanation for this experimental fact is that the amplitude of high energy
elastic scattering is the sum of two similar terms that have the same status
and differ only in the values of parameters. The energy dependence of
$d\sigma/dt$ for a fixed $t$ in the region of the dip-bump structure, where
these two terms interfere, confirms the above observations. We discuss the
possible origin of the two-component structure of the high energy elastic
scattering amplitude and explain this by the structural symmetry of the

of flexibility in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) performance, data rate, and
power consumption. In this paper, we study subcarrier-wise backscatter
communication over ambient OFDM signals. This new AmBC is to exploit the
special spectrum structure of OFDM to transmit data over its squeezed
orthogonal subcarriers. We propose a basis transmission scheme and its two
modifications to support a higher data rate with superior BER performance
compared to existing methods. The basis scheme can transmit one bit per
subcarrier using on-off keying (OOK) modulation in the frequency domain. In the
first modification, interleaved subcarrier block transmission model is employed
to improve the BER performance of the system in frequency-selective channels.
It results in a trade-off between the size of the blocks and data rate. Thus,
in the second modification, interleaved index modulation (IM) is employed to
mitigate the data rate decrementation of the former modification. It also
stabilizes and controls the power of the signal to result in interference
reduction for a legacy receiver. Analytical and numerical evaluations provide a
proof to see the performance of the proposed method in terms of BER, data rate,

However, the optimal control of the RIS requires perfect channel state
information (CSI) of the individual channels that link the base station (BS)

channel (parameter) estimation needs to be efficiently conducted at the BS or

without a direct BS-MS channel, using atomic norm minimization to sequentially
estimate the channel parameters, i.e., angular parameters, angle differences,
and products of propagation path gains. We evaluate the mean square error of
the parameter estimates, the RIS gains, the average effective spectrum
efficiency bound, and average squared distance between the designed beamforming

  To that end, we develop a biologically-inspired light weight neural network
architecture that incorporates local learning and neuromodulation to enable

a design space spanning multiple local learning rules and their

wavenumbers in the $T$ spectra as reflecting the cross-sectional areas of the

that the bath density profile evolves on a $\sim \sqrt{t}$ time-scale and,
correspondingly, that the tracer's velocity decays as $\sim 1/\sqrt{t}$. Unlike
the well-studied non-driven tracer, whose dynamics becomes diffusive whenever
overtaking is allowed, we here find that driving the tracer preserves its
hallmark sub-diffusive single-file dynamics, even in the presence of

based on appearance similarity within an image. We build on this observation
and propose an approach capable of jointly propagating pixel labels from
multiple classes without having explicit class-specific appearance models. To
enable long-range propagation, our approach first globally measures appearance
similarity between labeled and unlabeled pixels across the entire image. Then
it locally integrates per-pixel measurements which improves the accuracy at
boundaries and removes noisy label switches in homogeneous regions. We also
design an efficient manual annotation interface that extends the traditional
polygon drawing tools with a suite of additional convenient features (and add
automatic propagation to it). Experiments with human annotators on the COCO
Panoptic Challenge dataset show that the combination of our better manual
interface and our novel automatic propagation mechanism leads to reducing
annotation time by more than factor of 2x compared to polygon drawing. We also
test our method on the ADE-20k and Fashionista datasets without making any
dataset-specific adaptation nor retraining our model, demonstrating that it can
generalize to new datasets and visual classes.

cybersecurity experts provide advice to SME. The experts recommendations offer
insights into what important capabilities of the solution are and how these
capabilities ought to be used for mitigating cybersecurity threats. The
adoption of a recommendation hints at a correct match of the solution, hence
successful consideration of requirements. Abandoned recommendations point to a

preserve its privacy and its utility [Bernardini et al., ECML PKDD 2019].
  ETFS can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$ time [Bernardini et al., CPM 2020].
The same paper shows that ETFS cannot be solved in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\delta})$
time, for any $\delta>0$, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH)

ETFS in which the elements of $\mathcal{S}$ can have arbitrary lengths. Our

described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble if the steady state of the system is
unique. However, such a description can fail if there are multiple steady state
solutions, for example, a bistability. In this case domains and domain walls
may form. In one-dimensional (1D) systems any type of noise (thermal or
non-thermal) will in general lead to a proliferation of such domains. We study
this physics in a 1D spin chain with two approximate conservation laws, energy
and the $z$-component of the total magnetization. A bistability in the
magnetization is induced by the coupling to suitably chosen Lindblad operators.
We analyze the theory for a weak coupling strength $\epsilon$ to the
non-equilibrium bath. In this limit, we argue that one can use hydrodynamic
approximations which describe the system locally in terms of space- and
time-dependent Lagrange parameters. Here noise terms enforce the creation of
domains, where the typical width of a domain wall goes as $\sim
1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$ while the density of domain walls is exponentially small in
$1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. This is shown by numerical simulations of a simplified
hydrodynamic equation in the presence of noise.

work. The angular velocity measurements are assumed to be sampled at a higher
rate compared to the attitude. The attitude determination problem from two or
more vector measurements in the body-fixed frame is formulated as Wahba's
problem. In the case when measurements are absent, a discrete-time model for
attitude kinematics is assumed in order to propagate the measurements. A
discrete-time Lyapunov function is constructed as the sum of a kinetic
energy-like term that is quadratic in the angular velocity estimation error and
an artificial potential energy-like term obtained from Wahba's cost function. A
filtering scheme is obtained by discrete-time stability analysis using a
suitable Lyapunov function. The analysis shows that the filtering scheme is
exponentially stable in the absence of measurement noise and the domain of
convergence is almost global. For a realistic evaluation of the scheme,
numerical experiments are conducted with inputs corrupted by bounded

The approach is based on do-calculus, and it can utilize data with non-trivial

do-search outputs an identifying formula on which numerical estimation can be

behavior on blood pressure mediated by the salt intake as an example. The
identifiability of this effect is resolved in various scenarios with different
assumptions on confounding. There are scenarios where the causal effect is
identifiable from a chain of experiments but not from survey data, as well as
scenarios where the opposite is true. As an illustration, we use survey data

always plagued by the problem of censoring. As the censoring mechanism is

baseline covariates are being adjusted for, such adjustment also raises
concerns. Pre-specification of which covariates will be adjusted for (and how)
is difficult, thus prompting the use of data-driven variable selection
procedures, which may impede valid inferences to be drawn. The adjustment for

that each change in adjustment set, also changes the censoring assumption and
the treatment effect estimand. In this paper, we discuss these concerns and
propose a simple variable selection strategy that aims to produce a valid test

circularly-polarized laser harmonics. For such pump pulses, the THz yield is
independent on the relative phase between the two colors. When the pump pulses
have same helicity, the increase in the THz yield is associated to longer
ionization sequences and higher electron transverse momenta acquired in the
driving field. Reversely, for two color pulses with opposite helicity, the
dramatic loss of THz power comes from destructive interferences driven by the
highly symmetric response of the photocurrents lined up on the third harmonic
of the fundamental pulse. While our experiments confirm an increased THz yield
for circularly polarized pumps of same helicity, surprisingly, the emitted THz
radiation is not linearly-polarized. This effect is explained by means of
comprehensive 3D numerical simulations highlighting the role of the spatial

  Class-specific Filters","European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in a range
of tasks. However, CNNs are often viewed as ""black-box"" and lack of
interpretability. One main reason is due to the filter-class entanglement -- an
intricate many-to-many correspondence between filters and classes. Most
existing works attempt post-hoc interpretation on a pre-trained model, while
neglecting to reduce the entanglement underlying the model. In contrast, we
focus on alleviating filter-class entanglement during training. Inspired by
cellular differentiation, we propose a novel strategy to train interpretable
CNNs by encouraging class-specific filters, among which each filter responds to
only one (or few) class. Concretely, we design a learnable sparse
Class-Specific Gate (CSG) structure to assign each filter with one (or few)
class in a flexible way. The gate allows a filter's activation to pass only
when the input samples come from the specific class. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating a sparse and
highly class-related representation of the input, which leads to stronger
interpretability. Moreover, comparing with the standard training strategy, our
model displays benefits in applications like object localization and
adversarial sample detection. Code link: https://github.com/hyliang96/CSGCNN.

isolated binary evolution. In this standard formation scenario, the first-born
neutron star goes through a recycling process and might be rapidly spinning
during the final inspiral, whereas the second-born star is expected to have
effectively zero spin at merger. Based on this feature, we propose a new
framework for the astrophysical characterization of binary neutron stars
observed from their gravitational wave emission. We further propose a prior for
the dimensionless spins of recycled neutron stars, given by a gamma

extrapolated from radio pulsar observations of Galactic binary neutron stars.
Interpreting GW170817 and GW190425 in the context of the standard formation

high stakes tasks. Doing batch RL in a way that yields a reliable new policy in
large domains is challenging: a new decision policy may visit states and
actions outside the support of the batch data, and function approximation and
optimization with limited samples can further increase the potential of
learning policies with overly optimistic estimates of their future performance.
Recent algorithms have shown promise but can still be overly optimistic in
their expected outcomes. Theoretical work that provides strong guarantees on
the performance of the output policy relies on a strong concentrability
assumption, that makes it unsuitable for cases where the ratio between
state-action distributions of behavior policy and some candidate policies is
large. This is because in the traditional analysis, the error bound scales up
with this ratio. We show that a small modification to Bellman optimality and
evaluation back-up to take a more conservative update can have much stronger
guarantees. In certain settings, they can find the approximately best policy
within the state-action space explored by the batch data, without requiring a
priori assumptions of concentrability. We highlight the necessity of our
conservative update and the limitations of previous algorithms and analyses by
illustrative MDP examples, and demonstrate an empirical comparison of our

of the ubiquitous filamentary structures of molecular clouds. This model is
based on the multiplicative random cascade, which is designed to replicate the
multifractal nature of intermittency in developed turbulence. We present a
modified version of the multiplicative process where the spatial fluctuations
as a function of scales are produced with the wavelet transforms of a
fractional Brownian motion realisation. This simple approach produces naturally
a log-normal distribution function and hierarchical coherent structures.
Despite the highly contrasted aspect of these coherent structures against a
smoother background, their Fourier power spectrum can be fitted by a single
power law. As reported in previous works using the multiscale non-Gaussian
segmentation (MnGSeg) technique, it is proven that the fit of a single power
law reflects the inability of the Fourier power spectrum to detect the
progressive non-Gaussian contributions that are at the origin of these
structures across the inertial range of the power spectrum. The mutifractal
nature of these coherent structures is discussed, and an extension of the
MnGSeg technique is proposed to calculate the multifractal spectrum that is
associated with them. Using directional wavelets, we show that filamentary
structures can easily be produced without changing the general shape of the
power spectrum. The cumulative effect of random multiplicative sequences
succeeds in producing the general aspect of filamentary structures similar to
those associated with star-forming regions. The filamentary structures are
formed through the product of a large number of random-phase linear waves at
different spatial wavelengths. Dynamically, this effect might be associated
with the collection of compressive processes that occur in the interstellar
medium.

privacy, we propose heteromodal split learning with feature aggregation
(HetSLAgg) that splits neural network (NN) models into camera-side and base
station (BS)-side segments. The BS-side NN segment fuses RF signals and
uploaded image features without collecting raw images. However, the usage of
multiple visual data leads to an increase in NN input dimensions, which gives
rise to additional communication and energy costs. To overcome additional
communication and energy costs due to image interpolation to blend different
frame rates, we propose a novel BS-side manifold mixup technique that offloads
the interpolation operations from cameras to a BS. Subsequently, we confront
energy costs for operating a larger size of the BS- side NN segment due to
concatenating image features across cameras and propose an energy-efficient
aggregation method. This is done via a linear combination of image features
instead of concatenating them, where the NN size is independent of the number
of cameras. Comprehensive test-bed experiments with measured channels
demonstrate that HetSLAgg reduces the prediction error by 44% compared to a
baseline leveraging only RF received power. Moreover, the experiments show that
the designed HetSLAgg achieves over 20% gains in terms of communication and
energy cost reduction compared to several baseline designs within at most 1% of

spaces with variable and mixed norms using growth envelopes. Our results extend
the ones for the corresponding classical spaces in a natural way. In the case
of spaces with mixed norms it turns out that the unboundedness in the worst
direction, i.e., in the direction where $p_{i}$ is the smallest, is crucial.
More precisely, the growth envelope is given by $E_G(L_{\vec{p}}(\Omega)) =
(t^{-1/\min\{p_{1}, \ldots, p_{d} \}},\min\{p_{1}, \ldots, p_{d} \})$ for mixed
Lebesgue and $E_G(L_{\vec{p},q}(\Omega)) = (t^{-1/\min\{p_{1}, \ldots, p_{d}

spaces we obtain $E_G(L_{p(\cdot)}(\Omega)) = (t^{-1/p_{-}},p_{-})$, where
$p_{-}$ is the essential infimum of $p(\cdot)$, subject to some further
assumptions. Similarly, for the variable Lorentz space it holds

predict an intermediate ambient occlusion map, which can be further refined by
the user to provides geometric cues to modulate the shadow generation. To train
our model, we design an efficient pipeline to produce diverse soft shadow

based heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) and respiration frequency
(RF) measuring, are playing more and more important roles under the application
scenarios where contact measurement is inconvenient or impossible. Since the
amplitude of the physiological signals is very small, they can be easily
affected by head movements, lighting conditions, and sensor diversities. To
address these challenges, we propose a cross-verified feature disentangling
strategy to disentangle the physiological features with non-physiological
representations, and then use the distilled physiological features for robust
multi-task physiological measurements. We first transform the input face videos
into a multi-scale spatial-temporal map (MSTmap), which can suppress the
irrelevant background and noise features while retaining most of the temporal
characteristics of the periodic physiological signals. Then we take pairwise
MSTmaps as inputs to an autoencoder architecture with two encoders (one for
physiological signals and the other for non-physiological information) and use
a cross-verified scheme to obtain physiological features disentangled with the
non-physiological features. The disentangled features are finally used for the
joint prediction of multiple physiological signals like average HR values and
rPPG signals. Comprehensive experiments on different large-scale public
datasets of multiple physiological measurement tasks as well as the
cross-database testing demonstrate the robustness of our approach.

solve challenging phase retrieval problems, in which one wants to reconstruct a

from non-convexity and often get stuck in local minima. We therefore propose
DeepInit Phase Retrieval, which uses regularized gradient descent under a deep
generative data prior to compute a trained initialization for a fast classical

hybrid approach is able to deliver very high reconstruction results at low

Conceptually, learned initializations may therefore help to overcome the
non-convexity of the problem by starting classical descent steps closer to the

The latter is traced by thermal radiation, where strong asymmetric clumps were

early stages of planet formation, when solids grow from micron-size to
planetesimals. Aims: Vortices are among the few known asymmetric dust trapping
scenarios. The present work aims at predicting their characteristics in a
complementary observable. Namely, line-of-sight velocities are well suited to
trace the presence of a vortex. Moreover, the dynamics of disks is subject to
recent developments. Methods: 2D hydro-simulations were performed where a
vortex forms at the edge of a gas depleted region. We derived idealized
line-of-sight velocity maps, varying disk temperature and orientation relative
to the observer. The signal of interest, as a small perturbation to the
dominant axisymetric component in velocity, may be isolated in observational
data using a proxy for the dominant quasi-Keplerian velocity. We propose that
the velocity curve on the observational major axis be such a proxy. Results:
Applying our method to the disk around HD 142527 as a study case, we predict
line-of-sight velocities scarcely detectable by currently available facilities,
depending on disk temperature. We show that corresponding spirals patterns can
also be detected with similar spectral resolutions, which will help

Furthermore, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in several low-

COVID-19, we propose the extraction of deep features (DF) from chest X-ray

classification using machine learning methods that do not require large
computational resources. We compiled a five-class dataset of X-ray chest images
including a balanced number of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia,
TB, and healthy cases. We compared the performance of pipelines combining 14
individual state-of-the-art pre-trained deep networks for DF extraction with
traditional machine learning classifiers. A pipeline consisting of ResNet-50
for DF computation and ensemble of subspace discriminant classifier was the
best performer in the classification of the five classes, achieving a detection
accuracy of 91.6+ 2.6% (accuracy + 95% Confidence Interval). Furthermore, the
same pipeline achieved accuracies of 98.6+1.4% and 99.9+0.5% in simpler
three-class and two-class classification problems focused on distinguishing
COVID-19, TB and healthy cases; and COVID-19 and healthy images, respectively.
The pipeline was computationally efficient requiring just 0.19 second to
extract DF per X-ray image and 2 minutes for training a traditional classifier
with more than 2000 images on a CPU machine. The results suggest the potential
benefits of using our pipeline in the detection of COVID-19, particularly in

partial redistribution in non-LTE conditions, developed in previous papers of
the series. The code was described in a previous paper of this series. However,
in that previous paper (number IV of the series), the numerical results were
unrealistic. The present paper presents an approximation, which was able to
restore the reliability of the outgoing polarization profiles. The convergence
of the results is also proved. It is demonstrated that the step increment
decreases like 1/N^a, with a > 1, so that the results series behaves like a
Riemann series, which is absolutely convergent. However, agreement between the
computed and observed linear polarization profiles remains qualitative only.
The discrepancy is assigned to the plane parallel atmosphere model, which is
insufficient to describe the chromosphere, where these lines are formed. As all
the integrals are numerical in the code, it could probably be adapted to more
realistic and higher dimensioned model atmospheres. However, it is time
consuming for lines having an hyperfine structure as the Na I D lines are. The
net linear polarization observed in Na I D1 with the polarimeter ZIMPOL mounted
on the McMath-Pierce telescope at Kitt Peak is not confirmed by the present
calculations and could be an artefact of instrumental polarization. The
presence of instrumental polarization could be confirmed by the higher linear

laser under pulsed perturbations of the phase of the injected field. We
characterize the laser response by counting the number of pulses emitted by the
laser, within a time interval, $\Delta$T , that starts when a perturbation is
applied. The success rate, SR($\Delta$T), is then defined as the number of
pulses emitted in the interval $\Delta$T , relative to the number of
perturbations. The analysis of the variation of SR with $\Delta$T allows to
separate a constant lag of technical origin and a frequency-dependent lag of
physical and dynamical origin. Once the lag is accounted for, the success rate
clearly captures locked and unlocked regimes and the transitions between them.
We anticipate that the success rate will be a practical tool for analyzing the
output of periodically forced systems, particularly when very regular

been adopted in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for a number of years.
Updating value functions with different backup lengths provides advantages in
different aspects, including bias and variance of value estimates, convergence
speed, and exploration behavior of the agent. Conventional methods such as
TD-lambda leverage these advantages by using a target value equivalent to an
exponential average of different step returns. Nevertheless, integrating step
returns into a single target sacrifices the diversity of the advantages offered
by different step return targets. To address this issue, we propose Mixture
Bootstrapped DQN (MB-DQN) built on top of bootstrapped DQN, and uses different
backup lengths for different bootstrapped heads. MB-DQN enables heterogeneity
of the target values that is unavailable in approaches relying only on a single
target value. As a result, it is able to maintain the advantages offered by
different backup lengths. In this paper, we first discuss the motivational
insights through a simple maze environment. In order to validate the
effectiveness of MB-DQN, we perform experiments on the Atari 2600 benchmark

of the energy supply. Solar parks are built to increase renewable energy
penetration and to supply local communities that become increasingly
self-sufficient. These parks are generally installed in rural areas where
electricity grid distribution capacity is limited. This causes the produced
energy to create grid congestion. Temporary storage can be a solution. In
addition to batteries, which are most suitable for intraday storage, hydrogen
provides a long-term storage option and can be used to overcome seasonal
mismatches in supply and demand. In this paper, we examine the operational
decisions related to storing energy using hydrogen, and buying from or selling
to the grid considering grid capacity limitations. We model the problem as a
Markov decision process taking into account seasonal production and demand
patterns, uncertain solar energy generation, and local electricity prices. We
show that ignoring seasonal demand and production patterns is suboptimal. In
addition, we show that the introduction of a hydrogen storage facility for a
solar farm in rural areas may lead to positive profits, whereas this is
loss-making without storage facilities. In a sensitivity analysis, we show that
only if distribution capacity is too small, hydrogen storage does not lead to
profits and reduced congestion at the cable connection. When the distribution
capacity is constrained, a higher storage capacity leads to more buying-related
actions from the electricity grid to prevent future shortages and to exploit
price differences. This leads to more congestion at the connected cable and is
an important insight for policy-makers and net-operators.

systems. In standard, gas-dominated protoplanetary discs, low-mass planets or
planetary cores undergo rapid inwards migration and are lost to the central
star. However, several recent studies indicate that the solid component in
protoplanetary discs can have a significant dynamical effect on disc-planet
interaction, especially when the solid-to-gas mass ratio approaches unity or
larger and the dust-on-gas drag forces become significant. As there are several
ways to raise the solid abundance in protoplanetary discs, for example through
disc winds and dust-trapping in pressure bumps, it is important to understand
how planets migrate through a dusty environment. To this end, we study planet
migration in dust-rich discs via a systematic set of high-resolution,
two-dimensional numerical simulations. We show that the inwards migration of
low-mass planets can be slowed down by dusty dynamical corotation torques. We
also identify a new regime of stochastic migration applicable to discs with
dust-to-gas mass ratios $\gtrsim 0.3$ and particle Stokes numbers $\gtrsim
0.03$. In these cases, disc-planet interaction leads to the continuous
development of small-scale, intense dust vortices that scatter the planet,
which can potentially halt or even reverse the inwards planet migration. We
briefly discuss the observational implications of our results and highlight
directions for future work.

performance. In the proposed architecture (mrU-Net), the input image and its
down-sampled versions were used as the network inputs. We added more

We trained and tested the network on four different medical datasets, including

mrU-Net outperformed U-Net with significantly higher accuracy and for the

mrU-Net led to a faster training rate on LUNA and DRIVE datasets when compared

higher capability in extracting image-derived features compared to U-Net.
mrU-Net illustrated a faster training rate and slightly more accurate image

efficiently quantifying statistical couplings across scales. This information
is encoded in the data, but most of it is lost when using conventional tools,
such as one-point statistics and power spectra. The wavelet scattering
transform (WST), a low-variance statistical descriptor of non-Gaussian
processes introduced in data science, opens a path towards this goal. We
applied the WST to noise-free maps of dust polarized thermal emission computed
from a numerical simulation of MHD turbulence. We analyzed normalized complex
Stokes maps and maps of the polarization fraction and polarization angle. The
WST yields a few thousand coefficients; some of them measure the amplitude of
the signal at a given scale, and the others characterize the couplings between
scales and orientations. The dependence on orientation can be fitted with the
reduced WST (RWST), an angular model introduced in previous works. The RWST
provides a statistical description of the polarization maps, quantifying their
multiscale properties in terms of isotropic and anisotropic contributions. It
allowed us to exhibit the dependence of the map structure on the orientation of
the mean magnetic field and to quantify the non-Gaussianity of the data. We
also used RWST coefficients, complemented by additional constraints, to
generate random synthetic maps with similar statistics. Their agreement with
the original maps demonstrates the comprehensiveness of the statistical
description provided by the RWST. This work is a step forward in the analysis

valuation functions for fractions of the item. This is a fundamental problem
with apparent applications to pricing communication bandwidth or cloud
computing services. We focus on simple sequential posted pricing mechanisms
that use linear pricing, i.e., a fixed price for the whole item and
proportional prices for fractions of it. We present results of the following
form that can be thought of as analogs of the well-known prophet inequality of
Samuel-Cahn (1984). For $\rho\approx 32\%$, if there is a linear pricing so
that sequential posted pricing sells a $\rho$-fraction of the item, this
results in a $\rho$-approximation of the optimal social welfare. The value of
$\rho$ can be improved to approximately $42\%$ if sequential posted pricing
considers the agents in random order. We also show that the best linear pricing
yields an expected revenue that is at most $O(\kappa^2)$ times smaller than the
optimal one, where $\kappa$ is a bound on the curvature of the valuation
functions. The proof extends and exploits the approach of Alaei et al. (2019)
and bounds the revenue gap by the objective value of a mathematical program.
The dependence of the revenue gap on $\kappa$ is unavoidable as a lower bound
of $\Omega(\ln{\kappa})$ indicates.

no masking is applied and we fall back to the standard convolution where the

study, based on different methods and dLOD records with different time span, we
show robust evidences to prove that the SYO and the EYO have no stable damping

prove whether it is a periodic signal, we use the optimal sequence estimation
method to stack 35 global geomagnetic records, the results also show an 7.6yr

degree of consistent synchronicity with the 7.6yr signal in dLOD. After
confirming that the jerks have no special consistency with the peaks/valleys of

suggest that jerks are possible excitation sources of the SYO/EYO. Meanwhile,

  - We provide a deterministic distributed network decomposition algorithm with

on the $O(\log^7 n)$-round algorithm of Rozho\v{n} and Ghaffari [STOC'20],

  - One drawback of the algorithm of Rozho\v{n} and Ghaffari, in the

i.e., Wuhan travel ban, intra-city quarantine and isolation, and inter-city

information acquisition play an important role. In this paper, we investigate
the correlation of local economy and the information acquisition on the
execution of containment measures to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in
Mainland China. First, we use a parsimonious model, i.e., SIR-X model, to
estimate the parameters, which represent the execution of intra-city quarantine
and isolation in major cities of Mainland China. In order to understand the
execution of intra-city quarantine and isolation, we analyze the correlation
between the representative parameters including local economy, mobility, and
information acquisition. To this end, we collect the data of Gross Domestic

search frequency from a widely-used Web mapping service, i.e., Baidu Maps, and
Web search engine, i.e., Baidu Search Engine, in Mainland China. Based on the
analysis, we confirm the strong correlation between the local economy and the
execution of information acquisition in major cities of Mainland China. We
further evidence that, although the cities with high GDP per capita attracts
bigger inflows from Wuhan, people are more likely to conduct the quarantine
measure and to reduce going out to other cities. Finally, the correlation
analysis using search data shows that well-informed individuals are likely to
carry out containment measures.

novel 'counting scale' termed LibraNet where the count value is analogized by
weight. By virtually placing a crowd image on one side of a scale, LibraNet

match the crowd count. At each step, LibraNet chooses one weight (action) from

that the role of resource competition on synthetic circuit outputs could be
immense. However, the effect of complexity of the circuit architecture on
resource sharing dynamics is yet unexplored. In this paper, we employ
mathematical modelling and in-silico experiments to identify the sources of
resource trade-off and to quantify its impact on the function of a genetic
circuit, keeping our focus on regulation of immediate downstream proteins. We
take the example of the fluorescent reporters, which are often used as protein
read-outs. We show that estimating gene expression dynamics from readings of
downstream protein data might be unreliable when the resource is limited and
ribosome affinities are asymmetric. We focus on the impact of mRNA copy number
and RBS strength on the nonlinear isocline that emerges with two regimes,
prominently separated by a tipping point, and study how correlation and
competition dominate each other depending on various circuit parameters.
Focusing further on genetic toggle circuit, we have identified major effects of

a resource from a set of permissible ones, in order to execute a certain task.
Each resource has a latency function, which depends on its workload, and a
client's cost is the completion time of her chosen resource. Two fundamental
variants of load balancing problems are {\em selfish load balancing} (aka. {\em
load balancing games}), where clients are non-cooperative selfish players aimed
at minimizing their own cost solely, and {\em online load balancing}, where
clients appear online and have to be irrevocably assigned to a resource without
any knowledge about future requests. We revisit both selfish and online load
balancing under the objective of minimizing the {\em Nash Social Welfare},
i.e., the geometric mean of the clients' costs. To the best of our knowledge,
despite being a celebrated welfare estimator in many social contexts, the Nash
Social Welfare has not been considered so far as a benchmarking quality measure
in load balancing problems. We provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy of
pure Nash equilibria and on the competitive ratio of the greedy algorithm under
very general latency functions, including polynomial ones. For this particular
class, we also prove that the greedy strategy is optimal as it matches the
performance of any possible online algorithm.

perform a qualitative and quantitative statistical analysis on the fluctuating

sampling rate and quantization resolution, imposing a major challenge in
power-limited systems. A common ADC architecture is based on sample-and-hold
(S/H) circuits, where the analog signal is being tracked only for a fraction of
the sampling period. In this paper, we propose the concept of eSampling ADCs,
which harvest energy from the analog signal during the time periods where the
signal is not being tracked. This harvested energy can be used to supplement
the ADC itself, paving the way to the possibility of zero-power consumption and
power-saving ADCs. We analyze the tradeoff between the ability to recover the
sampled signal and the energy harvested, and provide guidelines for setting the
sampling rate in the light of accuracy and energy constraints. Our analysis
indicates that eSampling ADCs operating with up to 12 bits per sample can
acquire bandlimited analog signals such that they can be perfectly recovered
without requiring power from the external source. Furthermore, our theoretical
results reveal that eSampling ADCs can in fact save power by harvesting more
energy than they consume. To verify the feasibility of eSampling ADCs, we
present a circuit-level design using standard complementary metal oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) 65 nm technology. An eSampling 8-bit ADC which samples at
40 MHZ is designed on a Cadence Virtuoso platform. Our experimental study
involving Nyquist rate sampling of bandlimited signals demonstrates that such
ADCs are indeed capable of harvesting more energy than that spent during
analog-to-digital conversion, without affecting the accuracy.

conclude from this result that univariate EDAs have difficulties with deception
and epistasis.
  In this work, we show that this negative finding is caused by an unfortunate
choice of the parameters of the UMDA. When the population sizes are chosen
large enough to prevent genetic drift, then the UMDA optimizes the DLB problem
with high probability with at most $\lambda(\frac{n}{2} + 2 e \ln n)$ fitness
evaluations. Since an offspring population size $\lambda$ of order $n \log n$
can prevent genetic drift, the UMDA can solve the DLB problem with $O(n^2 \log
n)$ fitness evaluations. In contrast, for classic evolutionary algorithms no
better run time guarantee than $O(n^3)$ is known (which we prove to be tight
for the ${(1+1)}$ EA), so our result rather suggests that the UMDA can cope
well with deception and epistatis.
  From a broader perspective, our result shows that the UMDA can cope better
with local optima than evolutionary algorithms; such a result was previously
known only for the compact genetic algorithm. Together with the lower bound of

strikingly ruled by the appearance of a dominant two-photon vertex which is
absent at the bare level and finite even in the weak-coupling limit. Such

  En route to proving these results, we design quantum algorithms for learning
a graph using cut queries. We show that a quantum algorithm can learn a graph
with maximum degree $d$ after $O(d \log(n)^2)$ many cut queries, and can learn
a general graph with $O(\sqrt{m} \log(n)^{3/2})$ many cut queries. These two
upper bounds are tight up to the poly-logarithmic factors, and compare to
$\Omega(dn)$ and $\Omega(m/\log(n))$ lower bounds on the number of cut queries
needed by a randomized algorithm for the same problems, respectively.

approximate counting with ""OR queries"", and learning sparse vectors from inner

information on two full cycles to understand the manifestations of SC 24, the
smallest cycle in the Space Age that has resulted in a weak heliospheric state
indicated by the reduced pressure. The backreaction of the heliospheric state
is to make the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) appear physically bigger than in
SC 23, but their magnetic content has been diluted resulting in a lower
geoeffectiveness. The heliospheric magnetic field is also lower in SC 24,
leading to the dearth of high-energy solar energetic particle (SEP) events.
These space weather events closely follow fast and wide (FW) CMEs. All but FW
CMEs are higher in number in SC 24. The CME rate vs. sunspot number (SSN)
correlation is high in both cycles but the rate increases faster in SC 24. We
revisit the study of limb CMEs (those with source regions within 30 degrees
from the limb) previously studied over partial cycles. We find that limb CMEs
are slower in SC 24 as in the general population but wider. Limb halo CMEs
follow the same trend of slower SC-24 CMEs. However, the SC-24 CMEs become
halos at a shorter distance from the Sun. Thus, slower CMEs becoming halos
sooner is a clear indication of the backreaction of the weaker heliospheric
state on CMEs. We can further pin down the heliospheric state as the reason for
the altered CME properties because the associated flares have similar
distributions in the two cycles, unaffected by the heliospheric state.

access data, they apply sophisticated optimizations. Incorrect optimizations
can result in logic bugs, which cause a query to compute an incorrect result

fully-automatic approach to detect optimization bugs in DBMS. Conceptually,
this approach aims to evaluate a query by an optimizing and a non-optimizing
version of a DBMS, to then detect differences in their returned result set,
which would indicate a bug in the DBMS. Obtaining a non-optimizing version of a
DBMS is challenging, because DBMS typically provide limited control over
optimizations. Our core insight is that a given, potentially randomly-generated
optimized query can be rewritten to one that the DBMS cannot optimize.
Evaluating this unoptimized query effectively corresponds to a non-optimizing
reference engine executing the original query. We evaluated NoREC in an
extensive testing campaign on four widely-used DBMS, namely PostgreSQL,
MariaDB, SQLite, and CockroachDB. We found 159 previously unknown bugs in the
latest versions of these systems, 141 of which have been fixed by the
developers. Of these, 51 were optimization bugs, while the remaining were error
and crash bugs. Our results suggest that NoREC is effective, general and
requires little implementation effort, which makes the technique widely
applicable in practice.

key factor to utilize the computation power of multiprocessor systems under
real-time constraints. While multiple protocols have been developed in the past
decades, their performance highly depends on the task partition and
prioritization. The recently proposed Dependency Graph Approach showed its
advantages and attracted a lot of interest. It is, however, restricted to task
sets where each task has at most one critical section. In this paper, we remove
this restriction and demonstrate how to utilize algorithms for the classical
job shop scheduling problem to construct a dependency graph for tasks with
multiple critical sections. To show the applicability, we discuss the
implementation in Litmus^{RT} and report the overheads. Moreover, we provide
extensive numerical evaluations under different configurations, which in many

predict the object-tag links in the KG for better tag recommendation and object
explanation. When predicting the object-tag links, both the first-order and
high-order proximities between entities in the KG propagate essential
similarity information for better prediction. Most existing methods focus on
preserving the first-order proximity between entities in the KG. However, they
cannot capture the high-order proximities in an explicit way, and the adopted
margin-based criterion cannot measure the first-order proximity on the global
structure accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Dual
Graph Embedding (DGE) that models both the first-order and high-order
proximities in the KG via an auto-encoding architecture to facilitate better
object-tag relation inference. Here the dual graphs contain an object graph and
a tag graph that explicitly depict the high-order object-object and tag-tag
proximities in the KG. The dual graph encoder in DGE then encodes these
high-order proximities in the dual graphs into entity embeddings. The decoder
formulates a skip-gram objective that maximizes the first-order proximity
between observed object-tag pairs over the global proximity structure. With the
supervision of the decoder, the embeddings derived by the encoder will be
refined to capture both the first-order and high-order proximities in the KG
for better link prediction. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets
demonstrate that DGE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

on multiple bipartite graphs has been receiving attention because of its
popular applications such as recommendations. How to make efficient relation
inference with few observed links is the main problem on multiple bipartite

learning shared representations to integrate knowledge from multi-source data
for shared entities. However, they merely model the correlations from one
aspect (e.g. distribution, representation), and cannot impose sufficient
constraints on different relations of the shared entities. One effective way of
modeling the multi-domain data is to learn the joint distribution of the shared
entities across domains.In this paper, we propose Collaborative Adversarial
Learning (CAL) that explicitly models the joint distribution of the shared

from a variational lower bound that maximizes the joint log-likelihoods of the
observations. In particular, CAL consists of distribution-level and
feature-level alignments for knowledge from multiple bipartite graphs. The
two-level alignment acts as two different constraints on different relations of

magnesium and iron in Milky Way satellite galaxies, field halo stars and

development of superconductivity and quantum field theory. The Anderson-Higgs
mechanism and the similarities between the Dirac and Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations are the most intriguing examples. In this last analogy, the massive
Dirac particle is identified with a quasiparticle excitation and the fermion
mass energy with the superconducting gap energy. Here we follow further this
parallelism and show that it predicts an outstanding phenomenon: the
superconducting Schwinger effect (SSE). As in the quantum electrodynamics
Schwinger effect, where an electron-positron couple is created from the vacuum
by an intense electric field, we show that an electrostatic field can generate
two coherent excitations from the superconducting ground-state condensate.
Differently from the dissipative thermal excitation, these form a new
macroscopically coherent and dissipationless state. We discuss how the
superconducting state is weakened by the creation of this kind of excitations.
In addition to shed a different light and suggest a method for the experimental
verification of the Schwinger effect, our results pave the way to the
understanding and exploitation of the interaction between superconductors and
electric fields.

Pseudo and classical bulge disc galaxies exhibit clear bimodality in terms of
all stellar parameters ($M_*$, sSFR, $r-K_s$). All pseudo bulge disc galaxies
are blue and star-forming and all classical bulge disc galaxies are red and
quiescent with less than $5\%$ digressions. Ambiguous bulge disc galaxies are

Several numerical algorithms have been developed over the years to solve the
eikonal equation. However, these methods require considerable modifications to
incorporate additional physics, such as anisotropy, and may even breakdown for
certain complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods.
Moreover, they suffer from computational bottleneck when repeated computations
are needed for perturbations in the velocity model and/or the source location,
particularly in large 3D models. Here, we propose an algorithm to solve the
eikonal equation based on the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). By minimizing a loss function formed by imposing the eikonal
equation, we train a neural network to output traveltimes that are consistent
with the underlying partial differential equation. We observe sufficiently high
traveltime accuracy for most applications of interest. We also demonstrate how
the proposed algorithm harnesses machine learning techniques like transfer
learning and surrogate modeling to speed up traveltime computations for updated
velocity models and source locations. Furthermore, we use a locally adaptive
activation function and adaptive weighting of the terms in the loss function to
improve convergence rate and solution accuracy. We also show the flexibility of
the method in incorporating medium anisotropy and free-surface topography
compared to conventional methods that require significant algorithmic
modifications. These properties of the proposed PINN eikonal solver are highly
desirable in obtaining a flexible and efficient forward modeling engine for

show that the response of a population to the gradient is complex. We find the

gravitational field, which has been used to obtain information about the
planet's composition and internal structure. Several models of Jupiter's
structure that fit the probe's data suggest that the planet has a diluted core,
with a total heavy-element mass ranging from ten to a few tens of Earth masses
(~5-15 % of the Jovian mass), and that heavy elements (elements other than H
and He) are distributed within a region extending to nearly half of Jupiter's
radius. Planet-formation models indicate that most heavy elements are accreted
during the early stages of a planet's formation to create a relatively compact
core and that almost no solids are accreted during subsequent runaway gas
accretion. Jupiter's diluted core, combined with its possible high
heavy-element enrichment, thus challenges standard planet-formation theory. A
possible explanation is erosion of the initially compact heavy-element core,
but the efficiency of such erosion is uncertain and depends on both the
immiscibility of heavy materials in metallic hydrogen and on convective mixing
as the planet evolves. Another mechanism that can explain this structure is
planetesimal enrichment and vaporization during the formation process, although
relevant models typically cannot produce an extended diluted core. Here we show
that a sufficiently energetic head-on collision (giant impact) between a large
planetary embryo and the proto-Jupiter could have shattered its primordial
compact core and mixed the heavy elements with the inner envelope. Models of
such a scenario lead to an internal structure that is consistent with a diluted
core, persisting over billions of years. We suggest that collisions were common
in the young Solar system and that a similar event may have also occurred for
Saturn, contributing to the structural differences between Jupiter and Saturn.

demonstrated by using it to process Direct Numerical Simulation data obtained
earlier from two statistically 1D, planar, fully-developed, weakly turbulent,
single-step-chemistry, premixed flames characterized by two significantly
different (7.52 and 2.50) density ratios, with all other things being
approximately equal. To emphasize the influence of combustion-induced thermal
expansion on turbulent flow of unburned mixture upstream of a premixed flame,
the focus of analysis is placed on structure functions conditioned to the
unburned mixture in both points. Two decomposition techniques, i.e. (i) a
widely used orthogonal Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition and (ii) a recently
introduced natural Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, are probed, with results
obtained using them being similar in the largest part of the computational
domain with the exception of narrow zones near the inlet and outlet boundaries.
Computed results indicate that combustion-induced thermal expansion can
significantly change turbulent flow of unburned mixture upstream of a premixed
flame by generating anisotropic potential velocity fluctuations whose spatial
structure differ substantially from spatial structure of the incoming
turbulence. The magnitude of such potential velocity fluctuations is greater
than the magnitude of the solenoidal velocity fluctuations in the largest part
of the mean flame brush in the case of the high density ratio. In the case of
the low density ratio, the latter magnitude is larger everywhere, but the two

correlation functions, having multiple segments of consecutive zero-values,
i.e. multiple zero correlation zones (ZCZs), is presented. All such sequences
have a common and block-repetitive structure of the positions of zeros in their
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) sequences, where the exact positions of zeros
in a DFT sequence do not impact the positions and sizes of ZCZs. This property
offers completely new degree of flexibility in designing signals with good
correlation properties under various spectral constraints. The non-zero values
of the DFT sequences are determined by the corresponding frequency-domain
modulation sequences, constructed as the element-by-element product of two
component sequences: a ""long"" one, which is common to the set of time-domain
sequences, and which controls the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) properties
of the time-domain sequences; and a ""short"" one, periodically extended to match
the length of the ""long"" component sequence, which controls the non-zero
crosscorrelation values of all time-domain sequences. It is shown that 0 dB
PAPR of time-domain sequences can be obtained if the ""long"" frequency-domain
component sequence is selected to be a modulatable constant amplitude zero
autocorrelation (MCAZAC) sequence. A generalized and simplified unified
construction of MCAZAC sequences is presented.

with exponentially small transition probabilities. We generalize previous
results in several directions. We give an estimate of the spectral gap of the
transition matrix and of the mixing time of the associated dynamics in terms of
the maximal stability level. These model-independent results hold in particular
for a large class of Probabilistic Cellular Automata (PCA), which we then focus
on. We consider the PCA in a finite volume, at small and fixed magnetic field,
and in the limit of vanishing temperature. This model is peculiar because of
the presence of three metastable states, two of which are degenerate with
respect to their energy. We identify rigorously the metastable states by giving
explicit upper bounds on the stability level of every other configuration. We
rely on these estimates to prove a recurrence property of the dynamics, which
is a cornerstone of the pathwise approach to metastability. Further, we also
identify the metastable states according to the potential-theoretic approach to
metastability, and this allows us to give precise asymptotics for the expected
transition time from any such metastable state to the stable state.

exist in the literature. One particularly common method employed to define the
cosmic web is to examine the density, velocity or potential field. Such methods
are advantageous since a Hessian matrix can be constructed whose eigenvectors
(and eigenvalues) indicate the principal directions (and strength) of local
collapse or expansion. Technically this is achieved by diagonalizing the
Hessian matrix using a fixed finite grid. The resultant large-scale structure
quantification is thus inherently limited by the grid's finite resolution.
Here, we overcome the obstacle of finite grid resolution by introducing a new
method to determine halo environment using an adaptive interpolation which is
more robust to resolution than the typical ""Nearest Grid Point"" (NGP) method.
Essentially instead of computing and diagonalizing the Hessian matrix once for
the entire grid, we suggest doing so once for each halo or galaxy in question.
We examine how the eigenvalues and eigenvector direction's computed using our
algorithm and the NGP method converge for different grid resolutions, finding
that our new method is convergent faster. Namely changes of resolution have a
much smaller effect than in the NGP method. We therefore suggest this method
for future use by the community.

the SDSS DR12 to investigate the correlation between satellite systems and the

satellites is significantly correlated with filaments, namely the major axis of
the satellite systems are preferentially aligned with the spine of the closest

away from the filament spine, while systems close to the filament spine show
significantly weaker alignment. Our results suggest that satellites are
accreted along filaments, which agrees with previous works. The case of which
away from the filament spine may help us to understand how the filament forms
as well as the peculiar satellite distribution in the Local Universe.

method to increase the throughput of NOMA-IoT networks. This paper develops an

deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and SARSA-learning. For light traffic,
SARSA-learning is used to explore the safest resource allocation policy with
low cost. For heavy traffic, DRL is used to handle traffic-introduced huge

main problems of fair resource allocation in NOMA techniques: 1) allocating
users dynamically and 2) balancing resource blocks and network traffic. We
analytically demonstrate that the rate of convergence is inversely proportional

complexity with acceptable accuracy and 2) NOMA-enabled IoT networks outperform
the conventional orthogonal multiple access based IoT networks in terms of

(POMDPs) is to compute a policy that satisfies a given specification. Such
policies have to take the full execution history of a POMDP into account,
rendering the problem undecidable in general. A common approach is to use a
limited amount of memory and randomize over potential choices. Yet, this
problem is still NP-hard and often computationally intractable in practice. A
restricted problem is to use neither history nor randomization, yielding
policies that are called stationary and deterministic. Previous approaches to
compute such policies employ mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). We
provide a novel MILP encoding that supports sophisticated specifications in the
form of temporal logic constraints. It is able to handle an arbitrary number of
such specifications. Yet, randomization and memory are often mandatory to
achieve satisfactory policies. First, we extend our encoding to deliver a
restricted class of randomized policies. Second, based on the results of the
original MILP, we employ a preprocessing of the POMDP to encompass memory-based
decisions. The advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art POMDP solvers
lie (1) in the flexibility to strengthen simple deterministic policies without
losing computational tractability and (2) in the ability to enforce the
provable satisfaction of arbitrarily many specifications. The latter point
allows taking trade-offs between performance and safety aspects of typical
POMDP examples into account. We show the effectiveness of our method on a broad
range of benchmarks.

essential imprints of the geometry and the structure of the magnetic fields in
the downstream region. Here we present the extension of our analysis to the
non-stationary case, especially suitable to model the highly variable emission
of high-energy emitting BL Lacs. We anticipate a large ($\Pi \approx 40\%$),
almost time-independent degree of polarization in the hard/medium X-ray band, a
prediction soon testable with the upcoming mission {\it IXPE}. The situation in
other bands, in particular in the optical, is more complex. A monotonic
decrease of the optical degree of polarization is observed during the
development of a flare. At later stages $\Pi$ reaches zero and then it starts
to increase, recovering large values at late times. The instant at which
$\Pi=0$ is marked by a rotation of the polarization angle by $90$ degrees.
However, at optical frequencies it is likely that more than one region
contributes to the observed emission, potentially making it difficult to detect
the predicted behavior.

number $r$ of equal-letter runs of the Burrows-Wheeler transform. A more recent
one is the size $\gamma$ of a smallest string attractor. Unfortunately, Kempa

popular microstructural dataset. The Northeastern University Steel Surface

hot-rolled steel in a format that is convenient for training and evaluating
models for image classification. We use the VGG16 convolutional neural network
pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset of natural images to extract feature
representations for each micrograph. After applying principal component
analysis to extract signal from the feature descriptors, we use k-means
clustering to classify the images without needing labeled training data. The
approach achieves $99.4\% \pm 0.16\%$ accuracy, and the resulting model can be
used to classify new images without retraining This approach demonstrates an
improvement in both performance and utility compared to a previous study. A
sensitivity analysis is conducted to better understand the influence of each
step on the classification performance. The results provide insight toward
applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to problems of interest in

authentication. This paper presents a deep learning-based spoofing attack to
generate synthetic wireless signals that cannot be statistically distinguished
from intended transmissions. The adversary is modeled as a pair of a
transmitter and a receiver that build the generator and discriminator of the
generative adversarial network, respectively, by playing a minimax game over
the air. The adversary transmitter trains a deep neural network to generate the
best spoofing signals and fool the best defense trained as another deep neural
network at the adversary receiver. Each node (defender or adversary) may have
multiple transmitter or receiver antennas. Signals are spoofed by jointly
capturing waveform, channel, and radio hardware effects that are inherent to
wireless signals under attack. Compared with spoofing attacks using random or
replayed signals, the proposed attack increases the probability of
misclassifying spoofing signals as intended signals for different network
topology and mobility patterns. The adversary transmitter can increase the
spoofing attack success by using multiple antennas, while the attack success
decreases when the defender receiver uses multiple antennas. For practical
deployment, the attack implementation on embedded platforms demonstrates the
low latency of generating or classifying spoofing signals.

the connection between the microscopic interactions among the grains or

criterion for breaking a bond is also based on an explicit Griffith energy

of each new observation. After proposing suitable threshold functions for the
chosen detectors, the asymptotic validity of the procedures is investigated in
the special case of monitoring for changes in the mean, both under the null

sequential tests in practice, an approach based on an asymptotic regression
model is used to estimate high quantiles of relevant limiting distributions.
Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the good finite-sample behavior of the
proposed monitoring schemes and suggest that they are superior to existing
competitors as long as changes do not occur at the very beginning of the
monitoring. Extensions to statistics exhibiting an asymptotic mean-like
behavior are briefly discussed. Finally, the application of the derived
sequential change-point detection tests is succinctly illustrated on
temperature anomaly data.

2014- March 16, 2019) with clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Post-stroke outcome was determined using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score

Demographics and other clinical variables including acute stroke severity
(measured as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), vascular risk

were recorded during index admission.
  Results: Utilizing the data from 912 acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients
(65+/-15 years of age, 58% male, 57% history of smoking, and 65% hypertensive)
in a generalized linear model, brain volume (per 155.1cm^3 ) was associated
with age (beta -0.3 (per 14.4 years)), male sex (beta 1.0) and prior stroke
(beta -0.2). In the multivariable outcome model, brain volume was an
independent predictor of mRS (beta -0.233), with reduced odds of worse
long-term functional outcomes (OR: 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9) in those with larger
brain volumes.
  Conclusions: Larger brain volume quantified on clinical MRI of AIS patients
at time of stroke purports a protective mechanism. The role of brain volume as
a prognostic, protective biomarker has the potential to forge new areas of
research and advance current knowledge of mechanisms of post-stroke recovery.

aim to maximize the energy efficiency of the system, including the data rate of
UE and the energy consumption of UAV via jointly optimizing the UAV's
trajectory and the phase shifts of reflecting elements of IRS, when the UE
moves and the selection of IRSs is considered for the energy saving purpose.
Since the system is complex and the environment is dynamic, it is challenging
to derive low-complexity algorithms by using conventional optimization methods.
To address this issue, we first propose a deep Q-network (DQN)-based algorithm
by discretizing the trajectory, which has the advantage of training time.
Furthermore, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based
algorithm to tackle the case with continuous trajectory for achieving better
performance. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms achieve
considerable performance compared to other traditional solutions.

the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of real-space observables after a quench. So
far the approach has been devised for global quenches or using local

spectroscopy method to local quenches. We show that it allows us to extract
quantitative information about global properties of the system, and in
particular the elementary excitation spectrum. Using state-of-the-art numerical
methods, we simulate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a variety of quantum

scheme for designing an appropriate local quench protocol for any chosen model.
We provide detailed examples of how the local quench protocol can be realised

detected and undetected sources. Based on these measurements, we measure the
position of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies and the specific SFR

not evolve significantly between $z\sim4.5$ and $z\sim5.5$, as opposed to lower
redshifts. We develop a method to derive the obscured SFR density (SFRD) using
the stellar masses or FUV-magnitudes as a proxy of FIR fluxes measured on the

luminosity functions from the literature. We obtain consistent results

Linial-Samorodnitsky-Wigderson in 2000, which was crucial to the analysis of
their permanent approximation algorithm. Such inequalities have played an
important role in the recent work on operator scaling and its generalizations
and applications, and in fact we use our bound to construct a new scaling
algorithm for real stable polynomials.
  In addition, we give a strong improvement on previous lower bounds of the
capacity of a non-homogeneous real stable polynomial, depending only on the
value of its gradient at $x = 1$. Crucially, this new bound is independent of
the degree of the polynomial, and has singly exponential dependence on the
number of variables. This compares favorably to the bounds used recently in the
fantastic work of Karlin-Klein-Oveis Gharan to give an improved approximation
factor for metric TSP, where this dependence is doubly exponential. Such bounds
were conjectured to exist by the authors, and thus our new bound should imply
further improvement to the approximation factor for metric TSP.
  The new technique we develop to prove this bound is productization, which
says that any real stable polynomial can be approximated at any point in the
positive orthant by a product of linear forms. Beyond the results of this
paper, our main hope is that this new technique will allow us to avoid

most notably in Celestial Mechanics, where the dissipation drives the motion of
natural and artificial satellites, leading them to migration of orbits,
resonant states, etc. Hence the need to develop theories that ensure the
existence of structures such as invariant tori or periodic orbits and device
efficient computational methods.
  In this work we concentrate on the existence of invariant tori for the
specific case of dissipative systems known as ""conformally symplectic"" systems,
which have the property that they transform the symplectic form into a multiple
of itself. To give explicit examples of conformally symplectic systems, we will
present two different models: a discrete system, the standard map, and a
continuous system, the spin-orbit problem. In both cases we will consider the
conservative and dissipative versions, that will help to highlight the
differences between the symplectic and conformally symplectic dynamics.
  For such dissipative systems we will present a KAM theorem in an a-posteriori
format. The method of proof is based on extending geometric identities
originally developed in [39] for the symplectic case. Besides leading to
streamlined proofs of KAM theorem, this method provides a very efficient
algorithm which has been implemented. Coupling an efficient numerical algorithm
with an a-posteriori theorem, we have a very efficient way to provide rigorous
estimates close to optimal.
  Indeed, the method gives a criterion (the Sobolev blow up criterion) that
allows to compute numerically the breakdown. We will review this method as well
as an extension of J. Greene's method and present the results in the
conservative and dissipative standard maps. Computing close to the breakdown,
allows to discover new mathematical phenomena such as the ""bundle collapse

A semantic map is commonly used intermediate representation for conditional

The proposed framework, SegVAE, synthesizes semantic maps in an iterative

abundant information in both breadth (large number of IDs) and depth
(sufficient number of samples) for training. However, in many real-world
scenarios of face recognition, the training dataset is limited in depth, i.e.
only two face images are available for each ID. $\textit{We define this
situation as Shallow Face Learning, and find it problematic with existing
training methods.}$ Unlike deep face data, the shallow face data lacks
intra-class diversity. As such, it can lead to collapse of feature dimension
and consequently the learned network can easily suffer from degeneration and
over-fitting in the collapsed dimension. In this paper, we aim to address the
problem by introducing a novel training method named Semi-Siamese Training
(SST). A pair of Semi-Siamese networks constitute the forward propagation
structure, and the training loss is computed with an updating gallery queue,
conducting effective optimization on shallow training data. Our method is
developed without extra-dependency, thus can be flexibly integrated with the
existing loss functions and network architectures. Extensive experiments on
various benchmarks of face recognition show the proposed method significantly
improves the training, not only in shallow face learning, but also for
conventional deep face data.

the presence of toxic compounds or to cell injury, leading to a cascade of
pathological processes that include glial cell activation. Noninvasive magnetic
resonance imaging markers of glial reactivity would be very useful for in vivo
detection and monitoring of inflammation processes in the brain, as well as for
evaluating the efficacy of personalized treatments. Due to their specific
location in glial cells, myo-inositol (mIns) and choline compounds (tCho) seem
the best candidates for probing glial-specific intra-cellular compartments.
However, their concentrations quantified using conventional proton magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are not specific for inflammation. In contrast, it
has been recently suggested that mIns intra-cellular diffusion, measured using
diffusion-weighted MRS (DW-MRS) in a mouse model of reactive astrocytes, could
be a specific marker of astrocytic hypertrophy. In order to evaluate the
specificity of both mIns and tCho diffusion to inflammation-driven glial
alterations, we performed DW-MRS in the corpus callosum of cuprizone-fed mice
after 6 weeks of intoxication and evaluated the extent of astrocytic and
microglial alterations using immunohistochemistry. Both mIns and tCho apparent
diffusion coefficients were significantly elevated in cuprizone-fed mice
compared to control mice, while histologic evaluation confirmed the presence of
severe inflammation. Additionally, mIns and tCho diffusion showed,
respectively, strong and moderate correlations with histological measures of
astrocytic and microglial area fractions, confirming DW-MRS as a promising tool
for specific detection of glial changes under pathological conditions.

magnetization strength conditions are studied. Magnetization is found to
strongly influence the shear viscosity coefficients when the gyrofrequency
exceeds the Coulomb collision frequency. Three regimes are identified as the
Coulomb coupling strength and magnetization strength are varied. The Green-Kubo
relations are used to separate kinetic and potential energy contributions to
each viscosity coefficient, showing how each contribution depends upon the
magnetization strength. The shear viscosity coefficient associated with the
component of the stress tensor parallel to the magnetic field, and the two
coefficients associated with the component perpendicular to the magnetic field,
are all found to merge to a common value at strong Coulomb coupling.

safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis.
However, DNNs have been shown suffering from poor robustness because of their
susceptibility to adversarial examples such that small perturbations to an
input result in misprediction. Addressing to this concern, various approaches
have been proposed to formally verify the robustness of DNNs. Most of these
approaches reduce the verification problem to optimization problems of
searching an adversarial example for a given input so that it is not correctly
classified to the original label. However, they are limited in accuracy and
scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can accelerate the
robustness verification techniques by guiding the verification with target
labels. The key insight of our approach is that the robustness verification
problem of DNNs can be solved by verifying sub-problems of DNNs, one per target
label. Fixing the target label during verification can drastically reduce the
search space and thus improve the efficiency. We also propose an approach by
leveraging symbolic interval propagation and linear relaxation techniques to
sort the target labels in terms of chances that adversarial examples exist.
This often allows us to quickly falsify the robustness of DNNs and the
verification for remaining target labels could be avoided. Our approach is
orthogonal to, and can be integrated with, many existing verification
techniques. For evaluation purposes, we integrate it with three recent
promising DNN verification tools, i.e., MipVerify, DeepZ, and Neurify.
Experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve these
tools by 36X speedup when the perturbation distance is set in a reasonable
range.

cascade that they generate according to a stochastic model for influence
diffusion. Differently from the non-adaptive influence maximization problem,
where all the seeds must be selected beforehand, here nodes are selected
sequentially one by one, and the decision on the $i$th seed is based on the
observed cascade produced by the first $i-1$ seeds. We focus on the myopic
feedback model, in which we can only observe which neighbors of previously
selected seeds have been influenced and on the independent cascade model, where
each edge is associated with an independent probability of diffusing influence.
Previous works showed that the adaptivity gap is at most $4$, which implies
that the non-adaptive greedy algorithm guarantees an approximation factor of
$\frac{1}{4}\left(1-\frac{1}{e}\right)$ for the adaptive problem. In this
paper, we improve the bounds on both the adaptivity gap and on the
approximation factor. We directly analyze the approximation factor of the
non-adaptive greedy algorithm, without passing through the adaptivity gap, and
show that it is at least $\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{e}\right)$. Therefore,
the adaptivity gap is at most $\frac{2e}{e-1}\approx 3.164$. To prove these
bounds, we introduce a new approach to relate the greedy non-adaptive algorithm
to the adaptive optimum. The new approach does not rely on multi-linear

techniques in the field. We believe that it is of independent interest and may

applicable to virtual agents to enhance human-computer interaction.
Specifically, we extend recent deep-learning-based, data-driven methods for
speech-driven gesture generation by incorporating representation learning. Our
model takes speech as input and produces gestures as output, in the form of a
sequence of 3D coordinates. We provide an analysis of different representations
for the input (speech) and the output (motion) of the network by both objective
and subjective evaluations. We also analyse the importance of smoothing of the
produced motion. Our results indicated that the proposed method improved on our
baseline in terms of objective measures. For example, it better captured the
motion dynamics and better matched the motion-speed distribution. Moreover, we
performed user studies on two different datasets. The studies confirmed that
our proposed method is perceived as more natural than the baseline, although
the difference in the studies was eliminated by appropriate post-processing:
hip-centering and smoothing. We conclude that it is important to take both
motion representation and post-processing into account when designing an
automatic gesture-production method.

estimated lost school revenue, productivity, and family economic burden. PM2.5
and ozone concentrations and absence rates vary across the School District.
Pollution exposure were associated with as high a rate ratio of 1.02 absences

Significantly, even PM2.5 and ozone exposure below regulatory standards (<12.1
ug/m$^3$ and <55 ppb) was associated with positive rate ratios of absences:
1.04 per ug/m$^3$ and 1.01 per ppb increase, respectively. Granular local
measurements enabled demonstration of air pollution impacts that varied between
schools undetectable with averaged pollution levels. Reducing pollution by 50%
would save $452,000 per year districtwide. Pollution reduction benefits would
be greatest in schools located in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.
Exposures to air pollution, even at low levels, are associated with increased
school absences. Heterogeneity in exposure, disproportionately affecting
socioeconomically disadvantaged schools, points to the need for fine resolution
exposure estimation. The economic cost of absences associated with air
pollution is substantial even excluding indirect costs such as hospital visits
and medication. These findings may help inform decisions about recess during
severe pollution events and regulatory considerations for localized pollution
sources.

collected historical driving data. The hybrid powertrain studied has a
series-parallel topology, and its control-oriented modeling is founded first.
Then, the distinctive deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, named deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is introduced. To enhance the derived
power split controls in the DRL framework, the global optimal control
trajectories obtained from dynamic programming (DP) are regarded as expert
knowledge to train the DDPG model. This operation guarantees the optimality of
the proposed control architecture. Moreover, the collected historical driving
data based on experienced drivers are employed to replace the DP-based
controls, and thus construct the human-like EMSs. Finally, different categories
of experiments are executed to estimate the optimality and adaptability of the
proposed human-like EMS. Improvements in fuel economy and convergence rate
indicate the effectiveness of the constructed control structure.

bodies. Triple systems are common in astronomy, but all observed periodic
triple systems are hierarchical up till now [6-8]. It is traditionally believed
that bound non-hierarchical triple systems are almost unstable and disintegrate
into a stable binary system and a single star [5], and thus stable periodic
orbits of non-hierarchical triple systems are rather scarce. Here we report one
family of 13315 stable periodic orbits of the non-hierarchical triple system
with unequal mass. Compared with the narrow mass region (only 10E-5) of the
stable figure-eight solution [9], our newly-found stable periodic orbits can
have fairly large mass region. It is found that many of these newly-found
stable periodic orbits have the mass ratios close to those of the hierarchical
triple systems that have been measured by the astronomical observation. It
implies that these stable periodic orbits of the non-hierarchical triple system
with distinctly unequal masses can be quite possibly observed in practice. Our
investigation also suggests that there should exist an infinite number of
stable periodic orbits of non-hierarchical triple systems with distinctly
unequal masses. Obviously, these stable periodic orbits of the non-hierarchical
unequal-mass triple system have broad impact for the astrophysical scenario:
they could inspire the theoretical and observational study of the
non-hierarchical triple system, the formation of triple stars [6], the
gravitational waves pattern [10] and the gravitational waves observation [11]

  First we give a sufficient condition on the ""modulus of diffusion"" of the

existence of a continuous solution to the associated Dirichlet problem with a

  As an application, we prove that if the equation has a continuous

estimate that, at typical policy margins in the United States today,
decarceration has zero net impact on crime outside of prison. That estimate is
uncertain, but at least as much evidence suggests that decarceration reduces
crime as increases it. The crux of the matter is that tougher sentences hardly
deter crime, and that while imprisoning people temporarily stops them from
committing crime outside prison walls, it also tends to increase their
criminality after release. As a result, ""tough-on-crime"" initiatives can reduce
crime in the short run but cause offsetting harm in the long run. A
cost-benefit analysis finds that even under a devil's advocate reading of this
evidence, in which incarceration does reduce crime in U.S., it is unlikely to
increase aggregate welfare.

employment and wages of natives in wealthy countries--where ""natives"" includes
previous immigrants and their descendants. While written for a non-technical
audience, the paper engages with technical issues and probes one particularly
intense scholarly debate in an appendix. While the available evidence is not
definitive, it paints a consistent picture. Industrial economies can generally
absorb migrants quickly, in part because capital is mobile and flexible, in
part because immigrants are consumers as well as producers. Thus, long-term
average impacts are probably zero at worst. And the long-term may come quickly,
especially if migration inflows are predictable to investors. Possibly, skilled
immigration boosts productivity and wages for many others. Around the averages,
there are distributional effects. Among low-income ""native"" workers, the ones
who stand to lose the most are those who most closely resemble new arrivals, in
being immigrants themselves, being low-skill, being less assimilated, and,
potentially, undocumented. But native workers and earlier immigrants tend to
benefit from the arrival of workers different from them, who complement more
than compete with them in production. Thus skilled immigration can offset the
effects of low-skill immigration on natives and earlier immigrants.

based on natural experiments--we can be reasonably confident that taxing
alcohol reduces drinking in general and problem drinking in particular. The
larger and cleaner the underlying natural experiment, the more apt a study is
to detect impacts on drinking. Estimates from the highest-powered study
settings, such as in Alaska in 2002 and Finland in 2004, suggest an elasticity
of mortality with respect to price of -1 to -3. A 10% price increase in the US
would, according to this estimate, save 2,000-6,000 lives and 48,000-130,000
years of life each year.

the execution time of the system. A pessimistic WCET estimation can lead to low
execution performances of the system, while an over-optimistic estimation can
lead to deadline misses, breaking one the basic constraints of critical
real-time systems (RTS). Partitioned systems are one special category of real
time systems, employed by the avionic community to deploy avionic software. The
ARINC-653 standard is one common avionic standard that employs the concept of
partitions. This standard defines partitioned architectures where one partition
should never directly interfere with another one. Assessing WCET of general

classification of hand movements from surface electromyography (sEMG) data
because they have the ability to perform automated person-specific feature
extraction from raw data. In this paper, we make the novel contribution of
proposing and evaluating a design for the early processing layers in the deep
CNN for multichannel sEMG. Specifically, we propose a novel temporal-to-spatial
(TtS) CNN architecture, where the first layer performs convolution separately
on each sEMG channel to extract temporal features. This is motivated by the
idea that sEMG signals in each channel are mediated by one or a small subset of
muscles, whose temporal activation patterns are associated with the signature
features of a gesture. The temporal layer captures these signature features for
each channel separately, which are then spatially mixed in successive layers to
recognise a specific gesture. A practical advantage is that this approach also
makes the CNN simple to design for different sample rates. We use NinaPro
database 1 (27 subjects and 52 movements + rest), sampled at 100 Hz, and
database 2 (40 subjects and 40 movements + rest), sampled at 2 kHz, to evaluate
our proposed CNN design. We benchmark against a feature-based support vector
machine (SVM) classifier, two CNNs from the literature, and an additional
standard design of CNN. We find that our novel TtS CNN design achieves 66.6%
per-class accuracy on database 1, and 67.8% on database 2, and that the TtS CNN
outperforms all other compared classifiers using a statistical hypothesis test
at the 2% significance level.

this paper aims to summarize driving cycle-driven energy management strategies

lobbed at these interventions invokes the spirit of Malthus. The good done, the
charge goes, is offset by the harm of spreading the earth's limited resources
more thinly: more people, and more misery per person. To the extent this holds,
the net benefit of savings lives is lower than it appears at first. On the
other hand, if lower mortality, especially in childhood, leads families to have
fewer children, life-saving interventions could reduce population. This
document critically reviews the evidence. It finds that the impact of
life-saving interventions on fertility and population growth varies by context,
and is rarely greater than 1:1. In places where lifetime births/woman has been
converging to 2 or lower, saving one child's life should lead parents to avert
a birth they would otherwise have. The impact of mortality drops on fertility
will be nearly 1:1, so population growth will hardly change. In the
increasingly exceptional locales where couples appear not to limit fertility
much, such as Niger and Mali, the impact of saving a life on total births will
be smaller, and may come about mainly through the biological channel of
lactational amenorrhea. Here, mortality-drop-fertility-drop ratios of 1:0.5 and
1:0.33 appear more plausible. But in the long-term, it would be surprising if
these few countries do not join the rest of the world in the transition to
lower and more intentionally controlled fertility.

taking advantage of a fixed-weight pre-trained subject classification network,
we ensure that our generative model remains agnostic to subject-specific

previously unseen subjects. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates
the efficacy of our synthetic data, leading to superior performance, with
improvements of up to 16 percentage points in zero-calibration classification

approach toward ECE that does not require observing the text achieves similar
performance compared to the baselines. We utilized only position information
relative to the emotion cause to accomplish this goal. Since position
information alone without observing the text resulted in higher F-measure, we
therefore uncovered a bias in the ECE single genre Sina-news benchmark. Further
analysis showed that an imbalance of emotional cause location exists in the
benchmark, with a majority of cause clauses immediately preceding the central
emotion clause. We examine the bias from a linguistic perspective, and show
that high accuracy rate of current state-of-art deep learning models that
utilize location information is only evident in datasets that contain such
position biases. The accuracy drastically reduced when a dataset with balanced
location distribution is introduced. We therefore conclude that it is the
innate bias in this benchmark that caused high accuracy rate of these deep
learning models in ECE. We hope that the case study in this paper presents both
a cautionary lesson, as well as a template for further studies, in interpreting
the superior fit of deep learning models without checking for bias.

experienced a greater reduction in traffic and air pollution during the

volumes in every case due to the complexity of interactions between emissions
and meteorology. We also found a strong relationship between lower
socioeconomic status and positive COVID-19 rates. This study provides initial
evidence for social distancing's effectiveness in limiting the spread of
COVID-19, while providing insight into how socioeconomic status has compounded
vulnerability during this crisis. Behavior restrictions disproportionately
benefit whiter and wealthier communities both through protection from spread of
COVID-19 and reduction in air pollution. Such findings may be further
compounded by the impacts of air pollution, which likely exacerbate COVID-19
transmission and mortality rates. Policy makers need to consider adapting

the eigenvalue equation but only one eigenvalue for a specific relationship
between model parameters. In particular, the existence of allowed cyclotron
frequencies conjectured by the authors is a mere artifact of the truncation
condition used to obtain exact solutions to the radial eigenvalue equation.

still a major public health problem in the country. To eradicate TB in
Bangladesh and to ensure proper monitoring and better health care service,
digital interventions may play a pivotal role. Over the years Bangladesh
Government has been actively working to hold a control over TB with the help of
donors, local and international NGOs. For sustainability there has been a need
to develop mHealth strategy for Bangladesh to align with the Digital Bangladesh
