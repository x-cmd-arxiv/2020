in an online-learning fashion, being capable of exploiting what was learned
previously to improve current and future tasks while still being able to
perform well on the previous tasks. One common limitation of many existing
continual learning methods is that they often train a model directly on all
available training data without validation due to the nature of continual
learning, thus suffering poor generalization at test time. In this work, we
present a novel framework of continual learning named ""Bilevel Continual
Learning"" (BCL) by unifying a {\it bilevel optimization} objective and a {\it
dual memory management} strategy comprising both episodic memory and
generalization memory to achieve effective knowledge transfer to future tasks
and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on old tasks simultaneously. Our
extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed BCL compared to many state-of-the-art methods. Our

prominent role in tuning the resonance of plasmonic structures through chemical
composition engineering. However, it has been unclear how alloying modifies the

chemical composition on the relaxation time of hot-carriers for the archetypal
Aux Ag1-x thin-film system. Through time-resolved optical spectroscopy
measurements in the visible wavelength range, we measure composition-dependent
relaxation times that vary up to 8x for constant pump fluency. Surprisingly, we
find that the addition of 2% of Ag into Au films can increase the hot carrier
lifetime by approximately 35% under fixed fluence, as a result of a decrease in
optical loss. Further, the relaxation time is found to be inversely
proportional to the imaginary part of the permittivity. Our results indicate
that alloying is a promising approach to effectively control hot-carrier
relaxation time in metals.

autoionization of the absorbing ion, ultimately destroying the Fe XXV K$\alpha$

graphs. They lie at the crossroads of graph theory and such analytical tools as
graph Laplacians, Markov processes and associated boundaries, analysis of
path-space, harmonic analysis, dynamics, and tail-invariant measures. Motivated
by recent advances for the special case of Bratteli diagrams, our present focus
will be on those graph systems $G$ with the property that the sets of vertices
$V$ and edges $E$ admit discrete level structures. A choice of discrete levels
in turn leads to new and intriguing discrete-time random-walk models.
  Our main extension (which greatly expands the earlier analysis of Bratteli
diagrams) is the case when the levels in the graph system $G$ under
consideration are now allowed to be standard measure spaces. Hence, in the
measure framework, we must deal with systems of transition probabilities, as
opposed to incidence matrices (for the traditional Bratteli diagrams).
  The paper is divided into two parts, (i) the special case when the levels are
countable discrete systems, and (ii) the (non-atomic) measurable category,
i.e., when each level is a prescribed measure space with standard Borel
structure. The study of the two cases together is motivated in part by recent
new results on graph-limits. Our results depend on a new analysis of certain
duality systems for operators in Hilbert space; specifically, one dual system
of operator for each level. We prove new results in both cases, (i) and (ii);
and we further stress both similarities, and differences, between results and
techniques involved in the two cases.

posterior progression and accordingly we provide a point-by-point analysis over
the disadvantages of using such conventional termination criteria. For example,
through the proposed geometric interpretation we show that confidence
thresholds defined over maximum of the state posteriors suffer from stiffness
that results in unnecessary evidence collection whereas uncertainty based
thresholding methods are fragile to number of categories and terminate
prematurely if some state candidates are already discovered to be unfavorable.
Moreover, both types of termination methods neglect the evolution of posterior

geometrical insight to overcome the limitations of these conventional methods

diffraction. The Fe-doping reduces the Ru-O bond length in both apical and
planar directions. The smaller Ru(Fe)O$_6$ octahedron leads to its reduced
distortion. The $Pbca$ space group is maintained in all the Fe-dopings, so is
the octahedral flattening. Warming has a similar effect on the lattice to that
of the Fe-doping in releasing the distorted octahedra but precipitates an
abrupt octahedral elongation near the N$\acute{e}$el temperature. Two competing
antiferromagnetic orders, $A$- and $B$-centered phases have been observed. The
Fe-doping-relaxed crystal structure prefers the latter to the former. As the
doping increases, the $B$-centered phase continuously grows at the cost of the
$A$-centered one and eventually replaces it at x=0.12. The absence of the
two-dimensional antiferromagnetic critical fluctuations above the magnetic
transition temperature and the three-dimensional magnetic correlation below the
transition, together with the anomalous lattice response, point to an important
role of orbital degree of freedom in driving the magnetic phase competition.

measuring its community structure; the higher its value (between $0$ and $1$),
the more clustered a graph is.
  In this paper we show that the modularity of a random $3-$regular graph is at
least $0.667026$ asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.), thereby proving a
conjecture of McDiarmid and Skerman stating that a random $3-$regular graph has
modularity strictly larger than $\frac{2}{3}$ a.a.s. We also improve the upper
bound given therein by showing that the modularity of such a graph is a.a.s. at
most $0.789998$.
  For a uniformly chosen graph $G_n$ over a given bounded degree sequence with
average degree $d(G_n)$ and with $|CC(G_n)|$ many connected components, we
distinguish two regimes with respect to the existence of a giant component. In
more detail, we precisely compute the second term of the modularity in the
subcritical regime. In the supercritical regime, we further prove that there is
$\varepsilon > 0$ depending on the degree sequence, for which the modularity is
a.a.s. at least \begin{equation*} \dfrac{2\left(1 -
\mu\right)}{d(G_n)}+\varepsilon, \end{equation*} where $\mu$ is the

such as higher stress levels, increased workloads, new workstreams, and more
caregiving responsibilities during lockdown. COVID-19 also caused the
overwhelming majority of information workers to rapidly shift to working from
home (WFH). The central question this work addresses is: can we isolate the
effects of WFH on information workers' collaboration activities from all other
factors, especially the other effects of COVID-19? This is important because in
the future, WFH will likely to be more common than it was prior to the
pandemic.
  We use difference-in-differences (DiD), a causal identification strategy
commonly used in the social sciences, to control for unobserved confounding
factors and estimate the causal effect of WFH. Our analysis relies on measuring
the difference in changes between those who WFH prior to COVID-19 and those who
did not. Our preliminary results suggest that on average, people spent more
time on collaboration in April (Post WFH mandate) than in February (Pre WFH
mandate), but this is primarily due to factors other than WFH, such as
lockdowns during the pandemic. The change attributable to WFH specifically is
in the opposite direction: less time on collaboration and more focus time. This
reversal shows the importance of using causal inference: a simple analysis
would have resulted in the wrong conclusion. We further find that the effect of
WFH is moderated by individual remote collaboration experience prior to WFH.
Meanwhile, the medium for collaboration has also shifted due to WFH: instant
messages were used more, whereas scheduled meetings were used less. We discuss
design implications -- how future WFH may affect focused work, collaborative
work, and creative work.

define the location of their private e-scooter/e-bike and the period of time
they are available for rent, match it with a particular demand, and then offer
suppliers the opportunity to get their e-scooters/e-bikes rented and returned
at the end of the renting period to the same (nearby) location. The management
party will need to match the e-scooter/e-bike to a series of renting demands
with the last demand as a destination very close to the initial location of the
e-scooter/e-bike at the start of the renting period. One potential advantage of
the proposed model is that it shifts the charging and maintenance efforts to a

the modified redshift of the modes that re-enter the horizon during the

topologically stable $Z$ strings ($Z$ flux tubes) from two opposite sides. The
structure is in sharp contrast to the topological triviality of the Nambu
monopole in the standard model (SM), which is attached by a single
non-topological $Z$ string. It is found that the Nambu monopole in 2HDM
possesses the same fiber bundle structure with those of the `t Hooft-Polyakov
monopole and the Wu-Yang description of the Dirac monopole, as a result of the
fact that the electromagnetic gauge field is well-defined even inside the
strings and is non-trivially fibered around the monopole, while the Nambu
monopole in the SM is topologically trivial because electroweak gauge symmetry
is restored at the core of the string. Consequently, the Nambu monopole in 2HDM
can be regarded as an embedding of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole into the
$SU(2)_W$ gauge symmetry, and the Dirac's quantization condition always holds,
which is absent for the Nambu monopole in the SM. Furthermore, we construct a

principle from near-horizon measurements of various astrophysical processes,
thus potentially enabling efficient tests of both black-hole properties and the
theory of general relativity in the strong-field regime. Here, we extend this
framework to allow for the parametrization of arbitrary asymptotically-flat,
spherically symmetric metrics and introduce the notion of a 11-dimensional
(11D) parametrization space $\Pi$, on which each solution can be visualised as
a curve or surface. An $\mathscr{L}^2$ norm on this space is used to measure
the deviation of a particular compact object solution from the Schwarzschild
black-hole solution. We calculate various observables, related to particle and
photon orbits, within this framework and demonstrate that the relative errors
we obtain are low (about $10^{-6}$). In particular, we obtain the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) frequency, the unstable photon-orbit impact
parameter (shadow radius), the entire orbital angular speed profile for
circular Kepler observers and the entire lensing deflection angle curve for
various types of compact objects, including non-singular and singular black
holes, boson stars and naked singularities, from various theories of gravity.

explore the energy region comparable to hadrons produced by GeV-scale neutrino

methods of moderating the T10 beam were employed: the dual technique of

as change the proton/minimum ionising particle (MIP) composition of the

protons reaching the TPC was successfully changed from $\sim0.3$ GeV without
moderator blocks to less than 0.1 GeV with four moderator blocks (40 cm path

subsample-ordered least angle regression (Solar) -- a novel ultrahigh
dimensional redesign of lasso -- on the empirical data with complicated
dependence structures and, hence, severe multicollinearity and grouping effect
issues. Previous researches show that Solar largely alleviates several known
high-dimensional issues with least-angle regression and $\mathcal{L}_1$
shrinkage. Also, With the same computation load, solar yields substantiali
mprovements over two lasso solvers (least-angle regression for lasso and
coordinate-descent) in terms of the sparsity (37-64\% reduction in the average
number of selected variables), stability and accuracy of variable selection.
Simulations also demonstrate that solar enhances the robustness of variable
selection to different settings of the irrepresentable condition and to
variations in the dependence structures assumed in regression analysis. To
confirm that the improvements are also available for empirical researches, we
choose the prostate cancer data and the Sydney house price data and apply two
lasso solvers, elastic net and Solar on them for comparison. The results shows
that (i) lasso is affected by the grouping effect and randomly drop variables
with high correlations, resulting unreliable and uninterpretable results; (ii)
elastic net is more robust to grouping effect; however, it completely lose
variable-selection sparsity when the dependence structure of the data is
complicated; (iii) solar demonstrates its superior robustness to complicated
dependence structures and grouping effect, returning variable-selection results
with better stability and sparsity. The code can be found at

for particle systems in which the direction of proposed displacements is
changed deterministically. This algorithm sweeps through directions analogously
to the popular MCMC sweep methods for particle or spin indices. Direction-sweep
MCMC can be applied to a wide range of original reversible or non-reversible
Markov chains, such as the Metropolis algorithm or the event-chain Monte Carlo
algorithm. For a single two-dimensional dipole, we consider direction-sweep
MCMC in the limit where restricted equilibrium is reached among the accessible
configurations before changing the direction. We show rigorously that
direction-sweep MCMC leaves the stationary probability distribution unchanged,
and that it profoundly modifies the Markov-chain trajectory. Long excursions,
with persistent rotation in one direction, alternate with long sequences of
rapid zigzags resulting in persistent rotation in the opposite direction in the
limit of small direction increments. The mapping to a Langevin equation then
yields the exact scaling of excursions while the zigzags are described through
a non-linear differential equation that is solved exactly. We show that the
direction-sweep algorithm can have shorter mixing times than the algorithms
with random updates of directions. We point out possible applications of
direction-sweep MCMC in polymer physics and in molecular simulation.

two fundamental questions, namely, what are the basic units to be labeled, and
how can these units be detected and classified in realistic settings, i.e.,
where no gold morphology is available. We empirically investigate these
questions on a novel NER benchmark, with parallel tokenlevel and morpheme-level
NER annotations, which we develop for Modern Hebrew, a morphologically

surface type, and albedo). The Stokes vector of the disk-averaged reflected
sunlight was computed for phase angles alpha from 0 to 180 degrees, and for
wavelengths lambda from 350 to 865 nm. The total flux F is one order of
magnitude higher than the polarized flux Q, and Q is two and four orders of
magnitude higher than U and V, respectively. Without clouds, the peak-to-peak
daily variations due to the planetary rotation increase with increasing lambda
for F, Q, and P, while they decrease for U and V. Clouds modify but do not
completely suppress the variations that are due to rotating surface features.
With clouds, the variation in F increases with increasing lambda, while in Q,
it decreases with increasing lambda, except at the largest phase angles. In
earlier work, it was shown that with oceans, Q changes color from blue through
white to red. The alpha where the color changes increases with increasing cloud
coverage. Here, we show that this unique color change in Q also occurs when the
oceans are partly replaced by continents, with or without clouds. The degree of

patterns, translating to non-trivial fermion couplings with both of the Higgs

changing neutral currents (FCNC), which get constraints from flavor physics
observables such as BR$(B\rightarrow X_s\gamma)$, $B_s - \bar{B}_s$ mixing etc.
The precision measurement of $Z b \bar{b}$ vertex, the top and Higgs mass along
with other Higgs coupling measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) also
enforce severe restrictions on the LSS model. Direct LHC search results of

marginalised posterior distributions, we find that the $S_8$-difference with
Planck is driven by a tension in the matter fluctuation amplitude parameter,
$\sigma_8$. We quantify the level of agreement between the CMB and our
large-scale structure constraints using a series of different metrics, finding
differences with a significance ranging between $\sim\! 3\,\sigma$, when
considering the offset in $S_{8}$, and $\sim\! 2\,\sigma$, when considering the
full multi-dimensional parameter space.

deg$^2$ (KiDS-1000). These redshift distributions represent one of the crucial
ingredients for weak gravitational lensing measurements with the KiDS-1000

that are re-weighted with the help of a self-organising map (SOM) to closely
resemble the KiDS-1000 sources, split into five tomographic redshift bins in
the photometric redshift range $0.1<z_\mathrm{B}\le1.2$. Sources are selected
such that they only occupy that volume of nine-dimensional magnitude-space that
is also covered by the reference samples (`gold' selection). Residual biases in
the mean redshifts determined from this calibration are estimated from mock
catalogues to be $\lesssim0.01$ for all five bins with uncertainties of $\sim
0.01$. This primary SOM estimate of the KiDS-1000 redshift distributions is
complemented with an independent clustering redshift approach. After validation
of the clustering-$z$ on the same mock catalogues and a careful assessment of
systematic errors, we find no significant bias of the SOM redshift
distributions with respect to the clustering-$z$ measurements. The SOM redshift
distributions re-calibrated by the clustering-$z$ represent an alternative
calibration of the redshift distributions with only slightly larger
uncertainties in the mean redshifts of $\sim 0.01-0.02$ to be used in KiDS-1000

clustering-$z$ are shown to be fully competitive on KiDS-1000 data.

of quantum systems that enables quantum advantage in any bounded-memory

linked to advantages in random access coding we focus here on a different
characteristic called sequential contextuality. It is shown not only to be
necessary and sufficient for quantum advantage, but also to quantify the degree

strongest type of inconsistency with non-contextual hidden variables, revealing
logical paradoxes with respect to those assumptions.

conjecture of Sarnak about the Liouville sequence having positive entropy.
Secondly, we obtain cancellation in averages of $\lambda$ over short polynomial
progressions $(n+P_1(m),\ldots, n+P_k(m))$, which in the case of linear
polynomials yields a new averaged version of Chowla's conjecture. We are in
fact able to prove our results on polynomial phases in the wider range $H\geq

Fourier uniformity of the Liouville function.

code decoding approaches due to its low-complexity and improved
error-correction performance. However, the inefficient criterion for locating
the correct bit-flipping position in SCF decoding limits its improvements. Due
to its improved bit-flipping criterion, Thresholded SCF (TSCF) decoding
algorithm exhibits a superior error-correction performance and lower
computational complexity than SCF decoding. However, the parameters of TSCF
decoding depend on multiple channel and code parameters, and are obtained via
Monte-Carlo simulations. Our main goal is to realize TSCF decoding as a
practical polar decoder implementation. To this end, we first realize an
approximated threshold value that is independent of the code parameters and
precomputations. The proposed approximation has negligible error-correction
performance degradation on the TSCF decoding. Then, we validate an alternative
approach for forming a critical set that does not require precomputations,
which also paves the way to the implementation of the Fast-TSCF decoder.
Compared to the existing fast SCF implementations, the proposed Fast-TSCF
decoder has $0.24$ to $0.41$ dB performance gain at frame error rate of
$10^{-3}$, without any extra cost. Compared to the TSCF decoding, Fast-TSCF
does not depend on precomputations and requires $87\%$ fewer decoding steps.
Finally, implementation results in TSMC 65nm CMOS technology show that the
Fast-TSCF decoder is $20\%$ and $82\%$ more area-efficient than the
state-of-the-art fast SCF and fast SC-List decoder architectures, respectively.

detrimental to the coherence of superconductor-based qubits.Here, we show that
the ubiquitous electron-boson interactions in superconductors can also break
the PHS of subgap conductances. We study the effect of such couplings on the
PHS of subgap conductances in superconductors using both the rate equation and
Keldysh formalism, which have different regimes of validity. In both regimes,
we found that such couplings give rise to a particle-hole $asymmetry$ in subgap
conductances which increases with increasing coupling strength, increasing
subgap-state particle-hole content imbalance and decreasing temperature. Our
proposed mechanism is general and applies even for experiments where the
subgap-conductance PHS breaking cannot be attributed to QP.

$z\gtrsim6$ quasars has been suspected to be biased by gravitational lensing.
Apart from the recent discovery of UHS J0439+1634 at $z\approx6.52$, no other
strongly lensed $z\gtrsim6$ quasar has been conclusively identified. The
hyperluminous $z\approx6.33$ quasar SDSS J0100+2802, believed to host a
supermassive black hole of $\sim10^{10} M_\odot$, has recently been claimed to
be lensed by a factor of $\sim450$, which would negate both its extreme
luminosity and black hole mass. However, its Ly$\alpha$-transparent proximity
zone is the largest known at $z>6$, suggesting an intrinsically extreme
ionizing luminosity. Here we show that the lensing hypothesis of $z\gtrsim6$
quasars can be quantitatively constrained by their proximity zones. We first
show that our proximity zone analysis can recover the strongly lensed nature of
UHS J0439+1634, with an estimated magnification
$\mu=28.0^{+18.4}_{-11.7}(^{+44.9}_{-18.3})$ at 68% (95%) credibility that is
consistent with previously published lensing models. We then show that the
large proximity zone of SDSS J0100+2802 rules out lensing magnifications of
$\mu>4.9$ at 95% probability, and conclusively rule out the proposed $\mu>100$
scenario. Future proximity zone analyses of existing $z\gtrsim6$ quasar samples
have the potential to identify promising strongly lensed candidates, constrain
the distribution of $z\gtrsim6$ quasar lensing, and improve our knowledge of

have shown that supermassive black holes play a fundamental role in regulating
the formation of stars throughout cosmic time. This has been clearly
demonstrated in the case of galaxy clusters in which powerful feedback from the
central black hole is preventing the hot intracluster gas from cooling
catastrophically, thus reducing the expected star formation rates by orders of
magnitude. These conclusions have however been almost entirely based on nearby
clusters. Based on new Chandra X-ray observations, we present the first
observational evidence for massive, runaway cooling occurring in the absence of
supermassive black hole feedback in the high-redshift galaxy cluster
SpARCS104922.6+564032.5 ($z=1.709$). The hot intracluster gas appears to be
fueling a massive burst of star formation ($\approx900$~M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$)
that is offset by dozens of kpc from the central galaxy. The burst is
co-spatial with the coolest intracluster gas but not associated with any galaxy
in the cluster. In less than 100 million years, such runaway cooling can form
the same amount of stars as in the Milky Way. Intracluster stars are therefore
not only produced by tidal stripping and the disruption of cluster galaxies,
but can also be produced by runaway cooling of hot intracluster gas at early
times. Overall, these observations show the dramatic impact when supermassive
black hole feedback fails to operate in clusters. They indicate that in the
highest overdensities such as clusters and proto-clusters, runaway cooling may
be a new and important mechanism for fueling massive bursts of star formation
in the early universe.

stellar encounters for particles with final pericenter distances above $50$AU.
The maximum extent $i_t$ of the inclination distribution scales with the
inclination of the encounter $\sin(i_s)$ for massive star flybys with low

objects places constraints on the dynamical history of our Solar System. For
example, these results imply an upper limit on product of the number density

entrained in outlying tidal features. Particularly, a well-defined tidal arm
reaches N(HI) comparable to the galaxy center but lacks SF. The molecular gas
mass inferred from the current SF rate (SFR) dominates over the atomic gas mass
in the central ~ 1.5 kpc. VCC 848 is consistent with being a main-sequence
star-forming galaxy for its current stellar mass and SFR. The HII region
luminosity distribution largely agrees with that of normal dwarf irregulars
with similar luminosities, except that the brightest HII region is
extraordinarily luminous. Our N-body/hydrodynamical simulations imply that VCC
848 is a merger between a gas-dominated primary progenitor and a gas-bearing
star-dominated secondary. The progenitors had their first passage on a
near-radial non-coplanar orbit more than 1 Gyr ago. The merger did not build up
a core as compact as typical compact dwarfs with centralized starburst, which
may be partly ascribed to the star-dominated nature of the secondary, and in a
general sense, a negative stellar feedback following intense starbursts
triggered at early stages of the merger.

Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum
algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm.
However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone.
Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these
hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum
computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one
approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this
problem have been published, our optimal synthesizer explores a larger solution
space, thus is optimal in a stronger sense. In addition, it reduces time and
space complexity exponentially compared to some leading optimal approaches. The
key to this success is a more efficient spacetime-based variable encoding of
the layout synthesis problem as a mathematical programming problem. By slightly
changing our formulation, we arrive at an approximate synthesizer that is even
more efficient and outperforms some leading heuristic approaches, in terms of
additional gate cost, by up to 100%, and also fidelity by up to 10x on a
comprehensive set of benchmark programs and architectures. For a specific
family of quantum programs named QAOA, which is deemed to be a promising
application for near-term quantum computers, we further adjust the approximate
synthesizer by taking commutation into consideration, achieving up to 75%
reduction in depth and up to 65% reduction in additional cost compared to the
tool used in a leading QAOA study.

present a simple method to estimate the variation in infectiousness by
examining the variation in early-time growth rates of new cases among different

its standard deviation, which implies pervasive superspreading. This result

discrete Fourier protocols saturates when the sampling rate reaches twice the

Nevertheless, reconstruction methods other than Fourier analysis can extract
useful information from data oversampled with respect to the NS-limit, given
that relevant prior knowledge is available. Here we present PhasE-Constrained
OverSampled MRI (PECOS), a method that exploits data oversampling in
combination with prior knowledge of the physical interactions between
electromagnetic fields and spins in MRI systems. In PECOS, highly
oversampled-in-time k-space data are fed into a phase-constrained variant of
Kaczmarz's algebraic reconstruction algorithm, where prior knowledge of the
expected spin contributions to the signal is codified into an encoding matrix.
PECOS can be used for scan acceleration in relevant scenarios by oversampling
along frequency-encoded directions, which is innocuous in MRI systems under
reasonable conditions. We find situations in which the reconstruction quality
can be higher than with NS-limited acquisitions and traditional Fourier
reconstruction. Besides, we compare the performance of a variety of encoding
pulse sequences as well as image reconstruction protocols, and find that
accelerated spiral trajectories in k-space combined with algebraic
reconstruction techniques are particularly advantageous. The proposed sampling
and reconstruction method is able to improve image quality for fully-sampled
k-space trajectories, while allowing accelerated or undersampled acquisitions
without regularization or signal extrapolation to unmeasured regions.

data. We combined the 12^CO/IR flux ratios and the LTE analysis of the 12^CO
images to derive the thermal structure of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) for
spatial scales raging from <200 pc to 2 kpc. From the 12^CO analysis we found
clear trend in the distribution of the derived temperatures and the 12^CO/IR
ratios. It is remarkable that at intermediate scales (360 pc-1 kpc) we see
large temperatures in the direction of the X-ray outflow while at smaller
scales (<200 pc-360 pc), the highest temperature, derived from the high-J
lines, is not found toward the nucleus, but toward the galaxy plane. The
thermal structure derived from the 12CO multi-transition analysis suggests that
mechanical heating, like shocks or turbulence, dominates the heating of the ISM
in the nucleus of NGC 4945 located beyond 100 pc from the center of the galaxy.
This result is further supported by the Kazandjian et al. 2015 models, which
are able to reproduce the emission observed at high-J (PACS) 12^CO transitions
when mechanical heating mechanisms are included. Shocks and/or turbulence are
likely produced by the barred potential and the outflow, observed in X-rays.

ability to model the irregular data, e.g., skeletal data in human action
recognition, providing an exciting new way to fuse rich structural information
for nodes residing in different parts of a graph. In human action recognition,
current works introduce a dynamic graph generation mechanism to better capture
the underlying semantic skeleton connections and thus improves the performance.
In this paper, we provide an orthogonal way to explore the underlying
connections. Instead of introducing an expensive dynamic graph generation
paradigm, we build a more efficient GCN on a Riemann manifold, which we think
is a more suitable space to model the graph data, to make the extracted
representations fit the embedding matrix. Specifically, we present a novel
spatial-temporal GCN (ST-GCN) architecture which is defined via the Poincar\'e
geometry such that it is able to better model the latent anatomy of the
structure data. To further explore the optimal projection dimension in the
Riemann space, we mix different dimensions on the manifold and provide an
efficient way to explore the dimension for each ST-GCN layer. With the final
resulted architecture, we evaluate our method on two current largest scale 3D
datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120. The comparison results show that
the model could achieve a superior performance under any given evaluation
metrics with only 40\% model size when compared with the previous best GCN
method, which proves the effectiveness of our model.

with an addition operation between arrays, and recover the full

implement hard and soft kinematical limits, which provide a map between poles
in kinematic space and their combinatoric arrays. We use the operation to give
a proof of a previously conjectured combinatorial duality for arrays in $(k,n)$

temporal evolution of spectral power from x-ray sources, but uniquely
extracting spectral content from a finite set of broad, spectrally overlapping
channel spectral sensitivities is decidedly nontrivial in these underdetermined
systems. We present the use of genetic algorithms to reconstruct a
probabilistic spectral intensity distribution and compare to the traditional
approach most commonly found in literature. Unlike many of the previously
published models, spectral reconstructions from this approach are neither
limited by basis functional forms, nor do they require a priori spectral
knowledge. While the original intent of such measurements was to diagnose the
temporal evolution of spectral power from quasi-blackbody radiation sources,
where the exact details of spectral content was not thought to be crucial, we
demonstrate that this new technique can greatly enhance the utility of the
diagnostic by providing more physical spectra and improved robustness to
hardware configuration for even strongly non-Planckian distributions.

Ga-doped ZnO emitter and the tandem cells are set as 1800 K and 300 K, while
the thicknesses of GaSb and InAs sub-cells are considered as 1.5um and 0.5um,
respectively. Fluctuational electrodynamics along with the multilayer dyadic
Green's function is used to study near-field radiative heat transfer with the
consideration of photon chemical potential, whereas radiative recombination and
nonradiative Auger recombination are taken into account for evaluating the
electrical performance of the tandem cells. At a vacuum gap of 50 nm, it is
found that the tandem cells with independent charge collections achieve
electrical power output 468.8 kW/m2 at a conversion efficiency of 41%,
generating relatively 87% (or 21%) more power with about absolute 5% (or 10%)
higher efficiency than the single GaSb (or InAs) cell of the same 2-um

Four convolutional neural network models were proposed. The first model

ISI channel inputs from noisy channel output sequences and evaluate the network

uses a rate-2/3, (1,7) runlength-limited (RLL) code with an E2PR4
partial-response channel target. Experimental results with ideal PR signals
show that the performance of PR-NN detection approaches that of Viterbi
detection in additive white gaussian noise (AWGN). Moreover, the PR-NN detector
outperforms Viterbi detection and achieves the performance of Noise-Predictive
Maximum Likelihood (NPML) detection in additive colored noise (ACN) at
different channel densities. A PR-NN detector trained with both AWGN and ACN
maintains the performance observed under separate training. Similarly, when
trained with ACN corresponding to two different channel densities, PR-NN
maintains its performance at both densities. Experiments confirm that this
robustness is consistent over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).
Finally, PR-NN displays robust performance when applied to a more realistic

magnetization and field structure required for jet launching. Applying the
PLUTO code, we present the first resistive MHD simulations of jet launching
including a non-scalar accretion disk mean-field $\alpha^2\Omega$-dynamo in the
context of large scale disk-jet simulations. Essentially, we find the
$\alpha_\phi$-dynamo component determining the amplification of the poloidal
magnetic field, which is strictly related to the disk magnetization (and, as a
consequence, to the jet speed, mass and collimation), while the $\alpha_R$ and
$\alpha_\theta$-dynamo components trigger the formation of multiple,
anti-aligned magnetic loops in the disk, with strong consequences on the
stability and dynamics of the disk-jet system. In particular, such loops
trigger the formation of dynamo inefficient zones, which are characterized by a
weak magnetic field, and therefore a lower value of the magnetic diffusivity.
The jet mass, speed and collimation are strongly affected by the formation of
the dynamo inefficient zones. Moreover, the $\theta$-component of the
$\alpha$-dynamo plays a key role when interacting with a non-radial component
of the seed magnetic field. We also present correlations between the strength
of the disk toy dynamo coefficients and the dynamical parameters of the jet

expulsion of the ejecta from the central binary. Moreover, we infer a
relatively small (a few times 10$^{-6}$ Msun) ejecta mass ahead of the shock,
considerably lower than the mass of 10$^4$ K gas inferred from radio

considerably higher than the observed X-ray luminosity. It is unclear why high

$h^{2,1}$ of complete intersection Calabi-Yau (CICY) 3-folds using machine
learning (ML), considering both the old and new datasets built respectively by
Candelas-Dale-Lutken-Schimmrigk / Green-H\""ubsch-Lutken and by
Anderson-Gao-Gray-Lee. In real world applications, implementing a ML system
rarely reduces to feed the brute data to the algorithm. Instead, the typical
workflow starts with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) which aims at
understanding better the input data and finding an optimal representation. It
is followed by the design of a validation procedure and a baseline model.
Finally, several ML models are compared and combined, often involving neural
networks with a topology more complicated than the sequential models typically
used in physics. By following this procedure, we improve the accuracy of ML
computations for Hodge numbers with respect to the existing literature. First,
we obtain 97% (resp. 99%) accuracy for $h^{1,1}$ using a neural network
inspired by the Inception model for the old dataset, using only 30% (resp. 70%)
of the data for training. For the new one, a simple linear regression leads to
almost 100% accuracy with 30% of the data for training. The computation of
$h^{2,1}$ is less successful as we manage to reach only 50% accuracy for both
datasets, but this is still better than the 16% obtained with a simple neural
network (SVM with Gaussian kernel and feature engineering and sequential
convolutional network reach at best 36%). This serves as a proof of concept
that neural networks can be valuable to study the properties of geometries
appearing in string theory.

re-constructs lasso paths using the $L_0$ norm and averages the resulting
solution paths across subsamples. Path averaging retains the ranking
information of the informative variables while averaging out sensitivity to
high dimensionality, improving variable selection stability, efficiency, and
accuracy. We prove that: (i) with a high probability, path averaging perfectly
separates informative variables from redundant variables on the average $L_0$
path; (ii) solar variable selection is consistent and accurate; and (iii) the
probability that solar omits weak signals is controllable for finite sample
size. We also demonstrate that: (i) solar yields, with less than $1/3$ of the
lasso computation load, substantial improvements over lasso in terms of the
sparsity (64-84\% reduction in redundant variable selection) and accuracy of
variable selection; (ii) compared with the lasso safe/strong rule and variable
screening, solar largely avoids selection of redundant variables and rejection
of informative variables in the presence of complicated dependence structures;
(iii) the sparsity and stability of solar conserves residual degrees of freedom
for data-splitting hypothesis testing, improving the accuracy of post-selection
inference on weak signals with limited $n$; (iv) replacing lasso with solar in
bootstrap selection (e.g., bolasso or stability selection) produces a
multi-layer variable ranking scheme that improves selection sparsity and
ranking accuracy with the computation load of only one lasso realization; and
(v) given the computation resources, solar bootstrap selection is substantially
faster (98\% lower computation time) than the theoretical maximum speedup for
parallelized bootstrap lasso (confirmed by Amdahl's law).

SOFIA/upGREAT and complement them by data of HCO+ and CO. We use the [13CII]
line to measure the optical depth of the [CII] emission, and find that the
[CII] line profiles are influenced by self-absorption, while the [13CII] line
remains unaffected by these effects. Hence, for dense PDRs, [13CII] emission is
a better tracer of gas kinematics. The optical depth of the [CII] line is up to
10 in S235A. We find an expanding motion of the [CII]-emitting layer of the
PDRs into the front molecular layer in both regions. Comparison of the gas and
dust columns shows that gas components visible neither in the [CII] nor in
low-J CO lines may contribute to the total column across S235A. We test whether
the observed properties of the PDRs match the predictions of spherical models
of expanding HII region + PDR + molecular cloud. Integrated intensities of the
[13CII], [CII] and [OI] lines are well-represented by the model, but the models
do not reproduce the double-peaked [CII] line profiles due to an insufficient
column density of C+. The model predicts that the [OI] line could be a more
reliable tracer of gas kinematics, but the foreground self-absorbing material
does not allow using it in the considered regions.

automatically detecting the level of trust that a user has on a virtual

purpose, containing human-computer speech interactions where subjects were
asked to answer various factual questions with the help of a virtual assistant,
which they were led to believe was either very reliable or unreliable. We find
that the subject's speech can be used to detect which type of VA they were
using, which could be considered a proxy for the user's trust toward the VA's
abilities, with an accuracy up to 76\%, compared to a random baseline of 50\%.
These results are obtained using features that have been previously found
useful for detecting speech directed to infants and non-native speakers.

models describing different physics. One instance is represented by the model
describing the generation of active force, coupled with the one of tissue
mechanics. For the numerical solution of the coupled model, partitioned
schemes, that foresee the sequential solution of the two subproblems, are often
used. However, this approach may be unstable. For this reason, the coupled
model is commonly solved as a unique system using Newton type algorithms, at
the price, however, of high computational costs. In light of this motivation,
in this paper we propose a new numerical scheme, that is numerically stable and
accurate, yet within a fully partitioned (i.e. segregated) framework.
Specifically, we introduce, with respect to standard segregated scheme, a
numerically consistent stabilization term, capable of removing the nonphysical
oscillations otherwise present in the numerical solution of the commonly used
segregated scheme. Our new method is derived moving from a physics-based
analysis on the microscale energetics of the force generation dynamics. By
considering a model problem of active mechanics we prove that the proposed
scheme is unconditionally absolutely stable (i.e. it is stable for any time
step size), unlike the standard segregated scheme, and we also provide an
interpretation of the scheme as a fractional step method. We show, by means of
several numerical tests, that the proposed stabilization term successfully
removes the nonphysical numerical oscillations characterizing the non
stabilized segregated scheme solution. Our numerical tests are carried out for
several force generation models available in the literature, namely the
Niederer-Hunter-Smith model, the model by Land and coworkers, and the
mean-field force generation model that we have recently proposed. Finally, we
apply the proposed scheme [...]

  The beaming factor calculations, which use realistic models of stellar

particularly for the filters $u$, $u'$, $U$, $g$, $g'$, and $B$. The black body
approach is only valid for high effective temperatures and/or long effective
wavelengths. Therefore, for more accurate analyses of light curves, we
recommend the use of the beaming factors presented in this paper. Concerning
limb-darkening, the distribution of specific intensities for 3D models
indicates that, in general, these models are less bright toward the limb than
their 1D counterparts, which implies steeper profiles. To describe these
intensities better, we recommend the use of the four-term law (also for 1D
models) given the level of precision that is being achieved with Earth-based
instruments and space missions such as Kepler and TESS (and PLATO in the

its probabilistic nature while the Hilbert space structure plays a secondary
and ultimately optional role. The dynamics of probability distributions is
driven by the maximization of an entropy subject to constraints that carry the
relevant physical information -- directionality, correlations, gauge
interactions, etc. The challenge is to identify those constraints and to
establish a criterion for how the constraints themselves are updated. In this
paper the ED framework is extended to describe a spin-1/2 point particle. In ED
spin is neither modelled as a rotating body, nor through the motion of a point
particle; it is an epistemic property of the wave function. The constraint that
reflects the peculiar rotational properties of spin is most effectively
expressed in the language of geometric algebra. The updating of all constraints
is carried out in a way that stresses the central importance of symmetry
principles. First we identify the appropriate symplectic and metric structures
in the phase space of probabilities, their conjugate momenta, and the spin
variables. This construction yields a derivation of the Fubini-Study metric for
a spin-1/2 particle which highlights its deep connection to information
geometry. Then we construct an ED that preserves both the symplectic structure
(a Hamiltonian flow) and the metric structure (a Killing flow). We show that
generic Hamiltonian-Killing flows are linear in the wave function. Imposing
further that the Hamiltonian be the generator of an entropic evolution in time
leads to an entropic dynamics described by the Pauli equation. We conclude with
a discussion of the new interpretation of the formalism which yields a physical
picture that is significantly different from that provided by other
interpretations.

boundary condition. As a control parameter crosses a critical value, the
trivial stable equilibrium solution will lose its stability, and undergoes a
dynamic transition to a new physical state, described by a local attractor. The
main result of this paper is to fully characterize the type and detailed
structure of the transition using dynamic transition theory. In particular,
employing techniques from center manifold theory, we reduce this infinite
dimensional problem to a finite one since the space on which the exchange of
stability occurs is finite dimensional. The problem then reduces to analysis of
single or double Hopf bifurcations, and we completely classify the possible
phase changes depending on the dispersion for every spacial period.

  Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2020)",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-agent navigation in dynamic environments is of great industrial value
when deploying a large scale fleet of robot to real-world applications. This
paper proposes a decentralized partially observable multi-agent path planning
with evolutionary reinforcement learning (MAPPER) method to learn an effective
local planning policy in mixed dynamic environments. Reinforcement
learning-based methods usually suffer performance degradation on long-horizon
tasks with goal-conditioned sparse rewards, so we decompose the long-range
navigation task into many easier sub-tasks under the guidance of a global
planner, which increases agents' performance in large environments. Moreover,
most existing multi-agent planning approaches assume either perfect information
of the surrounding environment or homogeneity of nearby dynamic agents, which
may not hold in practice. Our approach models dynamic obstacles' behavior with
an image-based representation and trains a policy in mixed dynamic environments
without homogeneity assumption. To ensure multi-agent training stability and
performance, we propose an evolutionary training approach that can be easily
scaled to large and complex environments. Experiments show that MAPPER is able
to achieve higher success rates and more stable performance when exposed to a
large number of non-cooperative dynamic obstacles compared with traditional
reaction-based planner LRA* and the state-of-the-art learning-based method.

well-studied NP-hard problem. The set of solutions of the standard
linearization of this problem is called the multilinear set. We study a
cardinality constrained version of it with upper and lower bounds on the number
of nonzero variables. We call the set of solutions of the standard
linearization of this problem a multilinear set with cardinality constraints.
We characterize a set of conditions on these multilinear terms (called
properness) and observe that under these conditions the convex hull description
of the set is tractable via an extended formulation. We then give an explicit
polyhedral description of the convex hull when the multilinear terms have a
nested structure. Our description has an exponential number of inequalities
which can be separated in polynomial time. Finally, we generalize these
inequalities to obtain valid inequalities for the general case.

  Science and Engineering",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the use of deception for strategic planning in
adversarial environments. We model the interaction between the agent (player 1)
and the adversary (player 2) as a two-player concurrent game in which the
adversary has incomplete information about the agent's task specification in
temporal logic. During the online interaction, the adversary can infer the
agent's intention from observations and adapt its strategy so as to prevent the
agent from satisfying the task. To plan against such an adaptive opponent, the
agent must leverage its knowledge about the adversary's incomplete information
to influence the behavior of the opponent, and thereby being deceptive. To
synthesize a deceptive strategy, we introduce a class of hypergame models that
capture the interaction between the agent and its adversary given asymmetric,
incomplete information. A hypergame is a hierarchy of games, perceived
differently by the agent and its adversary. We develop the solution concept of
this class of hypergames and show that the subjectively rationalizable strategy
for the agent is deceptive and maximizes the probability of satisfying the task
in temporal logic. This deceptive strategy is obtained by modeling the opponent
evolving perception of the interaction and integrating the opponent model into
proactive planning. Following the deceptive strategy, the agent chooses actions
to influence the game history as well as to manipulate the adversary's
perception so that it takes actions that benefit the goal of the agent. We
demonstrate the correctness of our deceptive planning algorithm using robot
motion planning examples with temporal logic objectives and design a detection
mechanism to notify the agent of potential errors in modeling of the
adversary's behavior.

literature has been adapted to model the actual number of Covid-19 cases in
Spain. The results of this work show that the real load of Covid-19 in Spain in
the period considered is well above the data registered by the public health
system. Specifically, the model estimates show that, cumulatively until June
1st, 2020, there were 2,425,930 cases of Covid-19 in Spain with characteristics
similar to those reported (95\% credibility interval: 2,148,261 - 2,813,864),
from which were actually registered only 518,664. Considering the results
obtained from the second wave of the Spanish seroprevalence study, which
estimates 2,350,324 cases of Covid-19 produced in Spain, in the period of time
considered, it can be seen that the estimates provided by the model are quite
good. This work clearly shows the key importance of having good quality data to
optimize decision-making in the critical context of dealing with a pandemic.

range of flight conditions and are a great source of inspiration to engineers.
The unsteady aerodynamics of flapping-wings are dominated by large-scale
vortical structures that augment the aerodynamic performance but are sensitive
to minor changes in the wing actuation. We experimentally optimise the pitch
angle kinematics of a flapping wing system in hover to maximise the stroke
average lift and hovering efficiency using a evolutionary algorithm and in-situ
force and torque measurements at the wing root. Additional flow field
measurements are conducted to link the vortical flow structures to the
aerodynamic performance for the Pareto-optimal kinematics. The optimised pitch
angle profiles yielding maximum stroke-average lift coefficients have
trapezoidal shapes and high average angles of attack. These kinematics create
strong leading-edge vortices early in the cycle which enhance the force
production on the wing. The most efficient pitch angle kinematics resemble
sinusoidal evolutions and have lower average angles of attack. The leading-edge
vortex grows slower and stays close-bound to the wing throughout the majority
of the stroke-cycle. This requires less aerodynamic power and increases the
hovering efficiency by 93% but sacrifices 43% of the maximum lift. In all
cases, a leading-edge vortex is fed by vorticity through the leading edge
shear-layer which makes the shear-layer velocity a good indicator for the
growth of the vortex and its impact on the aerodynamic forces. We estimate the
shear-layer velocity at the leading edge solely from the input kinematics and
use it to scale the average and the time-resolved evolution of the circulation
and the aerodynamic forces.

be complete in presenting all of the relevant available topics. In this study,
Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to identify 100 topics from all of the

Recall (i.e., 80% of the relevant documents were found by the categorizer,
designated the hit set and 20% were missed, designated the missed set). Despite
the fact that less than all of the relevant documents were identified by the
categorizer, the documents that were identified contained all of the topics
derived from the full set of documents. This same pattern held whether the
categorizer was a na\""ive Bayes categorizer trained on a random selection of

present article for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-globally
Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients. By incorporating a pair of method
parameters $\theta, \eta \in [0, 1]$ into both the drift and diffusion parts,
the new schemes are indeed a kind of drift-diffusion double implicit methods.
Within a general framework, we offer upper mean-square error bounds for the
proposed schemes, based on certain error terms only getting involved with the
exact solution processes. Such error bounds help us to easily analyze
mean-square convergence rates of the schemes, without relying on a priori
high-order moment estimates of numerical approximations. Putting further
globally polynomial growth condition, we successfully recover the expected
mean-square convergence rate of order one for the considered schemes with
$\theta \in [\tfrac12, 1], \eta \in [0, 1]$. Also, some of the proposed schemes
are applied to solve three SDE models evolving in the positive domain $(0,
\infty)$. More specifically, the particular drift-diffusion implicit Milstein
method ($ \theta = \eta = 1 $) is utilized to approximate the Heston
$\tfrac32$-volatility model and the stochastic Lotka-Volterra competition
model. The semi-implicit Milstein method ($\theta =1, \eta = 0$) is used to
solve the Ait-Sahalia interest rate model. Thanks to the previously obtained
error bounds, we reveal the optimal mean-square convergence rate of the
positivity preserving schemes under more relaxed conditions, compared with
existing relevant results in the literature. Numerical examples are also

function (SDF) to filter out observations of short-term and dynamic features
from multiple deployments of the robot. The remaining long-term observations
are used to build a vector map by robust local linear regression. The
uncertainty in the resulting LTVM is computed via Monte Carlo resampling the
observations arising from long-term features. By combining occupancy-grid based
SDF filtering of observations with continuous space regression of the filtered

At lower Reynolds numbers from 180 to 600, the small scales can not be scaled

optical transients, including supernovae (particularly the superluminous
class), classical novae, stellar mergers, tidal disruption events, and fast
blue optical transients. These same shocks can accelerate relativistic ions,
generating high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission via hadronic pion
production. The recent discovery of time-correlated optical and gamma-ray
emission in classical novae has revealed the important role of radiative shocks
in powering these events, enabling an unprecedented view of the properties of
ion acceleration, including its efficiency and energy spectrum, under similar
physical conditions to shocks in extragalactic transients. Here we introduce a
model for connecting the radiated optical fluence of non-relativistic
transients to their maximal neutrino and gamma-ray fluence. We apply this
technique to a wide range of extragalactic transient classes in order to place
limits on their contributions to the cosmological high-energy gamma-ray and
neutrino backgrounds. Based on a simple model for diffusive shock acceleration
at radiative shocks, calibrated to novae, we demonstrate that several of the
most luminous transients can accelerate protons up to energies $E_{\rm max}
\gtrsim 10^{16}$ eV, sufficient to contribute to the IceCube astrophysical
background. Furthermore, several of the considered sources$-$particularly
hydrogen-poor supernovae$-$may serve as ""hidden"" gamma-ray sources due to the
high gamma-ray opacity of their ejecta, evading constraints imposed by the
non-blazar Fermi-LAT background. However, adopting an ion acceleration
efficiency $\sim$ 0.3-1$\%$ motivated by nova observations, we find that
currently known classes of non-relativistic, potentially shock-powered
transients contribute at most a few percent of the total IceCube background.

inevitably exploded as supernovae that polluted the Universe with metals, the
history of cosmic reionization and enrichment are intimately intertwined. While
the overly sensitive Ly-alpha transition completely saturates in a neutral IGM,
strong low-ionization metal lines like the MgII 2796,2804 doublet will give
rise to a detectable `metal-line forest' if the metals produced during
reionization (Z ~ 10^{-3}Z_sol) permeate the neutral IGM. We simulate the MgII
forest for the first time by combining a large hydrodynamical simulation with a
semi-numerical reionization topology, assuming a simple enrichment model where
the IGM is uniformly suffused with metals. In contrast to the traditional
approach of identifying discrete absorbers, we treat the absorption as a
continuous random field and measure its two-point correlation function,
leveraging techniques from precision cosmology. We show that a realistic mock
dataset of 10 JWST spectra can simultaneously determine the Mg abundance,
[Mg/H], with a 1sigma precision of 0.02 dex and measure the global neutral
fraction <x_HI> to 5% for a Universe with <x_HI> = 0.74 and [Mg/H] = -3.7.
Alternatively, if the IGM is pristine, a null-detection of the MgII forest
would set a stringent upper limit on the IGM metallicity of [Mg/H] < -4.4 at
95% credibility, assuming <x_HI> > 0.5 from another probe. Concentrations of
metals in the circumgalactic environs of galaxies can significantly contaminate
the IGM signal, but we demonstrate how these discrete absorbers can be easily
identified and masked such that their impact on the correlation function is
negligible. The MgII forest thus has tremendous potential to precisely
constrain the reionization and enrichment history of the Universe.

orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost. We demonstrate examples that
learned from soil moisture and streamflow, where dPL drastically outperformed

decision-making problems. Existing performant controllers, such as controllers
derived from reinforcement learning algorithms, often fall short of safety
guarantees. On the contrary, controllers that guarantee safety, such as those
derived from classical control theory, require restrictive assumptions and are
often conservative in performance. Our goal is to blend a performant and a safe
controller to generate a single controller that is safer than the performant
and accumulates higher rewards than the safe controller. To this end, we
propose a blending algorithm using the framework of contextual multi-armed
multi-objective bandits. At each stage, the algorithm observes the
environment's current context alongside an immediate reward and cost, which is
the underlying safety measure. The algorithm then decides which controller to
employ based on its observations. We demonstrate that the algorithm achieves
sublinear Pareto regret, a performance measure that models coherence with an
expert that always avoids picking the controller with both inferior safety and
performance. We derive an upper bound on the loss in individual objectives,
which imposes no additional computational complexity. We empirically
demonstrate the algorithm's success in blending a safe and a performant
controller in a safety-focused testbed, the Safety Gym environment. A
statistical analysis of the blended controller's total reward and cost reflects
two key takeaways: The blended controller shows a strict improvement in
performance compared to the safe controller, and it is safer than the

by determining or constraining the direction and the magnitude of the momentum
carried by ejecta. A model is developed for the impact ejecta plume optical
depth, using a point source scaling model of the DART impact. The model is
applied to expected LICIACube plume images and shows how plume images enable
characterization of the ejecta mass versus velocity distribution. The ejecta
plume structure, as it evolves over time, is determined by the amount of ejecta
that has reached a given altitude at a given time. The evolution of the plume
optical depth profiles determined from LICIACube images can distinguish between
strength-controlled and gravity-controlled impacts, by distinguishing the
respective mass versus velocity distributions. LICIACube plume images
discriminate the differences in plume structure and evolution that result from
different target physical properties, mainly strength and porosity, thereby
allowing inference of these properties to improve the determination of momentum
transfer.

shows a slight decay with decreasing metallicity. Our results reinforce the

variety of regression models, including varying coefficient, multilevel,
longitudinal models, and models with functional covariates and responses. It
can also be used for multi-class classification, with low or high dimensional
covariates.
  The I-prior is generally defined as a maximum entropy prior. For a regression
function, the I-prior is Gaussian with covariance kernel proportional to the
Fisher information on the regression function, which is estimated by its
posterior distribution under the I-prior. The I-prior has the intuitively
appealing property that the more information is available on a linear
functional of the regression function, the larger the prior variance, and the
smaller the influence of the prior mean on the posterior distribution.
  Advantages compared to competing methods, such as Gaussian process regression
or Tikhonov regularization, are ease of estimation and model comparison. In
particular, we develop an EM algorithm with a simple E and M step for
estimating hyperparameters, facilitating estimation for complex models. We also
propose a novel parsimonious model formulation, requiring a single scale
parameter for each (possibly multidimensional) covariate and no further
parameters for interaction effects. This simplifies estimation because fewer
hyperparameters need to be estimated, and also simplifies model comparison of
models with the same covariates but different interaction effects; in this
case, the model with the highest estimated likelihood can be selected.
  Using a number of widely analyzed real data sets we show that predictive
performance of our methodology is competitive. An R-package implementing the
methodology is available (Jamil, 2019).

report that the Fermi energy level exhibits a large variation with MA
orientation, and it is this Fermi level variation that makes this material
unique and so different from the non-organic perovskites. The Fermi level
variation with orientation of MA is proposed to be responsible for the
experimentally observed intrinsic open-circuit voltage V_OC, ambipolarity, and
long lifetime of the excitons. Based on our results, ferroelectric domains in
the low-temperature orthorhombic phase or clusters of MA molecules not rotating
in unison (as a consequence of e.g. impurities and/or defects) in the
higher-temperature tetragonal and cubic phases are proposed to be responsible
for ambipolarity. This is because any given two adjacent domains or clusters
with different MA s average orientations may have very different Fermi levels,
causing them to behave as an effective diode. Also, the measured significant
lifetime of excitons in MAPbI3 finds a natural explanation using this effective
diode. Thus, our work provides a unified manner for explaining at least these
three important properties in terms of the rotation-induced Fermi level
variations. We used the density functional theory to get our results.

have tried introducing randomness to reduce the learning requirement. Based on
the original construction of Igelnik and Pao, single layer neural-networks with

the hopes in having computer systems capable of seamlessly conversing with
humans and able to understand natural language. Neural architectures have been
employed to generate text excerpts to various degrees of success, in a
multitude of contexts and tasks that fulfil various user needs. Notably, high
capacity deep learning models trained on large scale datasets demonstrate
unparalleled abilities to learn patterns in the data even in the lack of
explicit supervision signals, opening up a plethora of new possibilities
regarding producing realistic and coherent texts. While the field of natural
language generation is evolving rapidly, there are still many open challenges
to address. In this survey we formally define and categorize the problem of
natural language generation. We review particular application tasks that are
instantiations of these general formulations, in which generating natural
language is of practical importance. Next we include a comprehensive outline of
methods and neural architectures employed for generating diverse texts.
Nevertheless, there is no standard way to assess the quality of text produced
by these generative models, which constitutes a serious bottleneck towards the
progress of the field. To this end, we also review current approaches to
evaluating natural language generation systems. We hope this survey will
provide an informative overview of formulations, methods, and assessments of
neural natural language generation.

processes of molecules within an ice mantle is lacking. In this work, we
investigated diffusive hydrogenation reactions of carbon monoxide (CO) embedded
in amorphous solid water (ASW) as a model case and discovered that the
hydrogenation of CO efficiently proceeds to yield H2CO and CH3OH even above 20
K when CO is buried beneath ASW. The experimental results suggest that hydrogen
atoms diffuse through the cracks of ASW and have a sufficient residence time to
react with embedded CO. The hydrogenation reactions occurred even at
temperatures up to ~70 K. Cracks collapse at elevated temperatures but the
occurrence of hydrogenation reactions means that the cracks would not
completely disappear and remain large enough for penetration by hydrogen atoms.
Considering the hydrogen-atom fluence in the laboratory and molecular clouds,
we suggest that the penetration of hydrogen and its reactions within the ice
mantle occur in astrophysical environments. Unified Astronomy

applications such as online recommendation and digital marketing. In these
problems, a decision at each time is a combination of choices from different
types of entities. To solve it, we introduce stochastic low-rank tensor
bandits, a class of bandits whose mean rewards can be represented as a low-rank
tensor. We consider two settings, tensor bandits without context and tensor
bandits with context. In the first setting, the platform aims to find the
optimal decision with the highest expected reward, a.k.a, the largest entry of
true reward tensor. In the second setting, some modes of the tensor are
contexts and the rest modes are decisions, and the goal is to find the optimal
decision given the contextual information. We propose two learning algorithms
tensor elimination and tensor epoch-greedy for tensor bandits without context,
and derive finite-time regret bounds for them. Comparing with existing
competitive methods, tensor elimination has the best overall regret bound and
tensor epoch-greedy has a sharper dependency on dimensions of the reward
tensor. Furthermore, we develop a practically effective Bayesian algorithm
called tensor ensemble sampling for tensor bandits with context. Numerical
experiments back up our theoretical findings and show that our algorithms
outperform various state-of-the-art approaches that ignore the tensor low-rank
structure. In an online advertising application with contextual information,
our tensor ensemble sampling reduces the cumulative regret by 75% compared to
the benchmark method.

privacy concerns in many areas. Federated learning is a popular approach for
privacy protection that collects the local gradient information instead of real
data. One way to achieve a strict privacy guarantee is to apply local
differential privacy into federated learning. However, previous works do not
give a practical solution due to three issues. First, the noisy data is close
to its original value with high probability, increasing the risk of information
exposure. Second, a large variance is introduced to the estimated average,
causing poor accuracy. Last, the privacy budget explodes due to the high
dimensionality of weights in deep learning models. In this paper, we proposed a
novel design of local differential privacy mechanism for federated learning to
address the abovementioned issues. It is capable of making the data more
distinct from its original value and introducing lower variance. Moreover, the
proposed mechanism bypasses the curse of dimensionality by splitting and
shuffling model updates. A series of empirical evaluations on three commonly
used datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that our solution
can not only achieve superior deep learning performance but also provide a
strong privacy guarantee at the same time.

demonstrate the storage and release of electromagnetic waves using this
meta-atom in the microwave region. The transient time of the meta-atom
immediately after commencing laser light illumination of the silicon in the
meta-atom is found to be inversely proportional to the incident laser power.
The transmittance of the meta-atom at the resonance frequency increases to ten
times that obtained without laser illumination at 5.2 ns after the start of
laser illumination for a laser power of 1600 mW, a laser spot size of 2 mm
$\times$ 1 mm, and a laser wavelength of 447 nm. In contrast, the transient
time after turning the laser light off is dependent on the carrier lifetime of

results of evaluation of the transient response of the meta-atom, we propose a
method for the storage and release of electromagnetic waves using a Fabry-Perot

electromagnetic wave that is stored in the Fabry-Perot resonator for a few tens
of nanoseconds is then successfully released by illuminating the silicon in the

higher frequency region because metamaterials with semiconductor elements can
even be used as active metamaterials in the optical region as long as their

review-response pairs are aggregated from many different apps, it remains
challenging for such models to generate app-specific responses, which, on the

Solving the challenge by simply building a model per app (i.e., training with
review-response pairs of a single app) may be insufficient because individual
apps have limited review-response pairs, and such pairs typically lack the
relevant information needed to respond to a new review. To enable app-specific
response generation, this work proposes AARSynth: an app-aware response

with information specific to a given app. Given a new user review, it first
retrieves the top-K most relevant app reviews and the most relevant snippet
from the app description. The retrieved information and the new user review are
then fed into a fused machine learning model that integrates the seq2seq model
with a machine reading comprehension model. The latter helps digest the
retrieved reviews and app description. Finally, the fused model generates a
response that is customized to the given app. We evaluated AARSynth using a
large corpus of reviews and responses from Google Play. The results show that
AARSynth outperforms the state-of-the-art system by 22.2% on BLEU-4 score.

operation methods on such qubits are in high demand. It was shown that both
molecular electronic and nuclear spin levels can be used as qubits. In solid
state systems with dopants, an electric field was shown to effectively change
the spacing between the nuclear spin qubit levels when the electron spin
density is high at the nucleus of the dopant. Inspired by such solid-state
systems, we propose that divalent lanthanide (Ln) complexes with an unusual
electronic configuration of Ln$^{2+}$ have a strong interaction between the Ln
nuclear spin and the electronic degrees of freedom, which renders electrical
tuning of the interaction. As an example, we study electronic structure and
hyperfine interaction of the $^{159}$Tb nucleus in a neutral
Tb(II)(Cp$^{\rm{iPr5}}$)$_2$ single-molecule magnet (SMM) using the complete
active space self-consistent field method with spin-orbit interaction included
within the restricted active space state interaction. Our calculations show
that the low-energy states arise from $4f^8(6s,5d_{z^2})^1$,
4$f^8$(5$d_{x^2-y^2}$)$^1$, and $4f^8(5d_{xy})^1$ configurations. We compute
the hyperfine interaction parameters and the electronic-nuclear spectrum within
our multiconfigurational approach. We find that the hyperfine interaction is
about one order of magnitude greater than that for Tb(III)Pc$_2$ SMMs. This
stems from the strong Fermi contact interaction between the Tb nuclear spin and
the electron spin density at the nucleus that originates from the occupation of
the $(6s,5d)$ orbitals. We also uncover that the response of the Fermi contact
term to electric field results in electrical tuning of the electronic-nuclear
level separations. This hyperfine Stark effect may be useful for applications
of molecular nuclear spins for quantum computing.

of a trained DNN are accessed by the detector. We first propose a data-limited
TrojanNet detector (TND), when only a few data samples are available for
TrojanNet detection. We show that an effective data-limited TND can be
established by exploring connections between Trojan attack and
prediction-evasion adversarial attacks including per-sample attack as well as
all-sample universal attack. In addition, we propose a data-free TND, which can
detect a TrojanNet without accessing any data samples. We show that such a TND
can be built by leveraging the internal response of hidden neurons, which
exhibits the Trojan behavior even at random noise inputs. The effectiveness of
our proposals is evaluated by extensive experiments under different model

(SLS) environments over North America asserts that upstream elevated terrain
and the Gulf of Mexico are both essential to their formation. This work tests
this hypothesis using two prescribed-ocean climate model experiments with North
American topography removed or the Gulf of Mexico converted to land and
analyzes how SLS environments and associated synoptic-scale drivers (southerly
Great Plains low-level jets, drylines, elevated mixed layers, and extratropical
cyclones) change relative to a control historical run. Overall, SLS
environments depend strongly on upstream elevated terrain but weakly on the
Gulf of Mexico. Removing elevated terrain substantially reduces SLS
environments especially over the continental interior due to broad reductions
in both thermodynamic and kinematic parameters, leaving a more zonally-uniform
residual distribution that is maximized near the Gulf coast and decays toward
the continental interior. This response is associated with a strong reduction
in synoptic-scale drivers and a cooler and drier mean-state atmosphere.
Replacing the Gulf of Mexico with land modestly reduces SLS environments
thermodynamically over the Great Plains and increases them kinematically over
the eastern U.S, shifting the primary local maximum eastward into Illinois; it
also eliminates the secondary, smaller local maximum over southern Texas. This
response is associated with modest changes in synoptic-scale drivers and a
warmer and drier lower-tropospheric mean state. These experiments provide
insight into the role of elevated terrain and the Gulf of Mexico in modifying
the spatial distribution and seasonality of SLS environments.

transitions, in which layer remodeling induced by mean and Gaussian curvatures
plays a major role. This is the case in smectic films under thermal treatment,
where focal conics can be reshaped into conical pyramids and concentric ring
structures. We build on earlier research on a smectic-isotropic, two phase
configuration in which diffusive evolution of the interface was driven by
curvature, while mass transport was neglected. Here, we explicitly consider
evaporation-condensation processes in a smectic phase with mass transport
through a coexisting isotropic fluid phase, as well as the hydrodynamic
stresses at the interface and the resulting flows. By employing the
Coleman-Noll procedure, we derive a phase-field model that accounts for a
varying density field coupled to smectic layering of the order parameter. The
resulting equations govern the evolution of an interface between a modulated
phase and an isotropic fluid phase with distinct densities, and they capture
compressibility effects in the interfacial region and topological transitions.
We first verify a numerical implementation of the governing equations by
examining the dispersion relation for interfacial transverse modes. The inverse
decay rate is shown to scale as $Q^{2}$ ($Q$ is the wavenumber of the
perturbation) due to hydrodynamic effects, instead of the $Q^{4}$ expected for
diffusive decay. Then, by integrating the equations forward in time, we
investigate fluid flow on distorted layers and focal conics, and show how
interfacial stresses and density contrast significantly determine the structure
of the flow and the evolution of the configuration.

from many electrons tunnelling across the junction for a given nuclear
vibration. Conversely, the current-driven nuclear dynamics feed back to the
electronic current, which can be captured according extended expressions for
the current that have explicit dependencies on classical nuclear velocities and
accelerations. Current-induced nuclear forces and the non-adiabatic electric

Applying the theory to molecular junctions demonstrated that non-adiabatic

non-equilibrium and, in particular, showed that non-equilibrium and equilibrium
descriptions of nuclear motion produce significantly different current
characteristics. It is observed that non-equilibrium descriptions generally
produce heightened conductance profiles relative to the equilibrium
descriptions and provide evidence that the effective temperature is an
effective measure of the steady-state characteristics. Finally, we observe that

blowtorch effect via the emergence of multi-minima potential energy surfaces in
conjunction with non-uniform temperature profiles. The Landauer blowtorch

paralyzes the rationality of existing methods. We propose a binary data
denoising framework, namely BIND, which optimizes the detection of true

likely from the background. BIND is supported by thoroughly derived

supporting remote object detection by means of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and
develop a framework to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the wireless

of the last layer of the head model to the edge server, instead of the DNN

structure unaltered. Herein, our focus is on DNNs for three different object
detection tasks, which present a much more convoluted structure, and modify the
architecture of the network to: (i) achieve in-network compression by
introducing a bottleneck layer in the early layers on the head model, and (ii)

Low visual fidelity breaks immersion for human-in-the-loop driving experiments.
Conventional computer graphics pipelines use detailed 3D models, meshes,
textures, and rendering engines to generate 2D images from 3D scenes. These
processes are labor-intensive, and they do not generate photorealistic imagery.
Here we introduce a hybrid generative neural graphics pipeline for improving
the visual fidelity of driving simulations. Given a 3D scene, we partially
render only important objects of interest, such as vehicles, and use generative
adversarial processes to synthesize the background and the rest of the image.
To this end, we propose a novel image formation strategy to form 2D semantic
images from 3D scenery consisting of simple object models without textures.
These semantic images are then converted into photorealistic RGB images with a
state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on real-world
driving scenes. This replaces repetitiveness with randomly generated but
photorealistic surfaces. Finally, the partially-rendered and GAN synthesized
images are blended with a blending GAN. We show that the photorealism of images
generated with the proposed method is more similar to real-world driving
datasets such as Cityscapes and KITTI than conventional approaches. This
comparison is made using semantic retention analysis and Frechet Inception

recognition area due to the significant spatial and temporal shifts across the
source (i.e. training) and target (i.e. test) domains. As such, recent works on
visual domain adaptation which leverage adversarial learning to unify the
source and target video representations and strengthen the feature
transferability are not highly effective on the videos. To overcome this
limitation, in this paper, we learn a domain-agnostic video classifier instead
of learning domain-invariant representations, and propose an Adversarial
Bipartite Graph (ABG) learning framework which directly models the
source-target interactions with a network topology of the bipartite graph.
Specifically, the source and target frames are sampled as heterogeneous
vertexes while the edges connecting two types of nodes measure the affinity
among them. Through message-passing, each vertex aggregates the features from
its heterogeneous neighbors, forcing the features coming from the same class to
be mixed evenly. Explicitly exposing the video classifier to such cross-domain
representations at the training and test stages makes our model less biased to
the labeled source data, which in-turn results in achieving a better
generalization on the target domain. To further enhance the model capacity and
testify the robustness of the proposed architecture on difficult transfer
tasks, we extend our model to work in a semi-supervised setting using an
additional video-level bipartite graph. Extensive experiments conducted on four

deep neural networks, to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In scientific
domains, the scientist often wishes to discover which features are actually
important for making the predictions. These discoveries may lead to costly
follow-up experiments and as such it is important that the error rate on
discoveries is not too high. Model-X knockoffs enable important features to be
discovered with control of the FDR. However, knockoffs require rich generative
models capable of accurately modeling the knockoff features while ensuring they
obey the so-called ""swap"" property. We develop Deep Direct Likelihood Knockoffs
(DDLK), which directly minimizes the KL divergence implied by the knockoff swap
property. DDLK consists of two stages: it first maximizes the explicit
likelihood of the features, then minimizes the KL divergence between the joint
distribution of features and knockoffs and any swap between them. To ensure
that the generated knockoffs are valid under any possible swap, DDLK uses the
Gumbel-Softmax trick to optimize the knockoff generator under the worst-case
swap. We find DDLK has higher power than baselines while controlling the false
discovery rate on a variety of synthetic and real benchmarks including a task
involving a large dataset from one of the epicenters of COVID-19.

application fields, it is still vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial
examples that can lead to misclassification of DNNs easily. To overcome this
challenge, many defensive methods are proposed. Indeed, a powerful adversarial
example is a key benchmark to measure these defensive mechanisms. In this
paper, we propose a novel method (TEAM, Taylor Expansion-Based Adversarial
Methods) to generate more powerful adversarial examples than previous methods.
The main idea is to craft adversarial examples by minimizing the confidence of
the ground-truth class under untargeted attacks or maximizing the confidence of
the target class under targeted attacks. Specifically, we define the new
objective functions that approximate DNNs by using the second-order Taylor
expansion within a tiny neighborhood of the input. Then the Lagrangian
multiplier method is used to obtain the optimize perturbations for these
objective functions. To decrease the amount of computation, we further
introduce the Gauss-Newton (GN) method to speed it up. Finally, the
experimental result shows that our method can reliably produce adversarial
examples with 100% attack success rate (ASR) while only by smaller
perturbations. In addition, the adversarial example generated with our method
can defeat defensive distillation based on gradient masking.

the algorithms developed on each side tend to be sophisticated and do not

  In this paper, we provide a meta-problem and a duality theorem that lead to a
new unified view on robust and heavy-tailed mean estimation in high dimensions.
We show that the meta-problem can be solved either by a variant of the Filter
algorithm from the recent literature on robust estimation or by the quantum
entropy scoring scheme (QUE), due to Dong, Hopkins and Li (NeurIPS '19). By
leveraging our duality theorem, these results translate into simple and
efficient algorithms for both robust and heavy-tailed settings. Furthermore,
the QUE-based procedure has run-time that matches the fastest known algorithms
on both fronts.
  Our analysis of Filter is through the classic regret bound of the
multiplicative weights update method. This connection allows us to avoid the

pair generation by continuous spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC)
followed by a time multiplexing set-up with a binary temporal division
strategy, considering several types of experimental losses. With such source,
the sub-Poissonian statistics of the output signal is the key for achieving
sub-shot-noise performance. We compare the numerical results with two
paradigmatic limits: the shot-noise limit (achieved using coherent sources) and
the quantum limit (obtained with an ideal photon-number Fock state as the input
source). We also investigate conditions in which threshold detectors can be
used, and the effect of input light fluctuations on the measurement error.
Results show that sub-shot-noise performance can be achieved, even without
using number-resolving detectors, with improvement factors that range from 1.5

inequality (CVI) constraints, where the objective function is convex and the
CVI is associated with a monotone mapping and a convex Cartesian product set.
This mathematical formulation captures a wide range of optimization problems
including those complicated by the presence of equilibrium constraints,
complementarity constraints, or an inner-level large scale optimization
problem. In particular, an important motivating application arises from the
notion of efficiency estimation of equilibria in multi-agent networks, e.g.,
communication networks and power systems. In the literature, the iteration
complexity of the existing solution methods for optimization problems with CVI
constraints appears to be unknown. To address this shortcoming, we develop a
first-order method called averaging randomized block iteratively regularized
gradient (aRB-IRG). The main contributions include: (i) In the case where the
associated set of the CVI is bounded and the objective function is
nondifferentiable and convex, we derive new non-asymptotic suboptimality and
infeasibility convergence rate statements in a mean sense. We also obtain
deterministic variants of the convergence rates when we suppress the randomized
block-coordinate scheme. Importantly, this paper appears to be the first work
to provide these rate guarantees for this class of problems. (ii) In the case
where the CVI set is unbounded and the objective function is smooth and
strongly convex, utilizing the properties of the Tikhonov trajectory, we
establish the global convergence of aRB-IRG in an almost sure and a mean sense.
We provide the numerical experiments for computing the best Nash equilibrium in

system. A future reading of an iris can be transformed and compared against
template vectors to determine or verify the identity of an individual. As
templates are often stored together, they are a valuable target to an attacker.
We show how to invert templates across a variety of iris recognition systems.
That is, we show how to transform templates into realistic looking iris images

Our inversion is based on a convolutional neural network architecture we call

faced with the task of piloting an UAV under risk and uncertainty, paralleling
a real-world decision-making scenario. Our findings support the notion of
humans in Cyberphysical Systems underlying behavioral biases regardless of --

Nevertheless, practical demonstrations of such an advantage remain particularly
challenging because of the difficulty in bringing together all necessary
theoretical and experimental ingredients. Here, we show an experimental
demonstration of a quantum computational advantage in a prover-verifier
interactive setting, where the computational task consists in the verification
of an NP-complete problem by a verifier who only gets limited information about
the proof sent by an untrusted prover in the form of a series of unentangled
quantum states. We provide a simple linear optical implementation that can
perform this verification task efficiently (within a few seconds), while we
also provide strong evidence that, fixing the size of the proof, a classical
computer would take much longer time (assuming only that it takes exponential
time to solve an NP-complete problem). While our computational advantage
concerns a specific task in a scenario of mostly theoretical interest, it
brings us a step closer to potential useful applications, such as server-client
quantum computing.

variables, a problem of high relevance to many applications in modern
statistics. Since the consistency of bootstrap was justified by Gaussian
approximation in Chernozhukov et al. (2013), quite a few attempts have been
made to sharpen the error bound for bootstrap and reduce the sample size
requirement for bootstrap consistency. In this paper, we show that the sample
size requirement can be dramatically improved when we make the inference
slightly conservative, that is, to inflate the bootstrap quantile
$t_{\alpha}^*$ by a small fraction, e.g. by $1\%$ to $1.01\,t^*_\alpha$. This
simple procedure yields error bounds for the coverage probability of
conservative bootstrap at as fast a rate as $\sqrt{(\log p)/n}$ under suitable
conditions, so that not only the sample size requirement can be reduced to
$\log p \ll n$ but also the overall convergence rate is nearly parametric.
Furthermore, we improve the error bound for the coverage probability of the
standard non-conservative bootstrap to $[(\log (np))^3 (\log p)^2/n]^{1/4}$
under general assumptions on data. These results are established for the
empirical bootstrap and the multiplier bootstrap with third moment match. An
improved coherent Lindeberg interpolation method, originally proposed in Deng
and Zhang (2017), is developed to derive sharper comparison bounds, especially
for the maxima.

to incorporate the extracted information into the nonlinear constraints of NMPC

controller robust by considering the uncertainty of localization and NMPC using
the Shannon entropy. This step enables us to track either the position or
velocity references, or none of them if necessary. As a result, the collision
avoidance constraints are defined in the local coordinates of MAVs and it
remains active and guarantees collision avoidance, despite localization
uncertainties, e.g., position estimation drifts. Additionally, as the platform
continues the mission, this will result in less uncertain position estimations,
due to the feature extraction and loop closure. The efficacy of the suggested

Unfortunately, users usually do not have the required knowledge and resources

failures of many end-user-focused public-key infrastructures (PKIs). In fact,
as for today, no end-user PKI, able to authenticate users to web servers, has a

various pathological changes. We investigate this problem from a data

gamma correction on each color channel of the entire image, while the latter
intentionally enhances or decreases only the fine-grained blood vessel regions
using morphological transformations. With the additional training samples
generated by applying these two modules sequentially, a model could learn more

One of the main obstacles is that the outer function depends on the represented

We derive modifications of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation that transfer
smoothness properties of the represented function to the outer function and can
be well approximated by ReLU networks. It appears that instead of two hidden

is that of a deep neural network where most of the layers are required to
approximate the interior function.

find the VOC to be gradually tuned between those of the two binary systems,

photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) depth profiling, which is used to estimate the
photovoltaic gap in the ternary systems. Our results reveal an excellent
agreement between the estimated photovoltaic gap and the VOC for all mixing
ratios, suggesting that the energetic alignment between the blend components
varies depending on the ratio D:A1:A2. Furthermore, our results indicate that
the sum of radiative and non-radiative losses in these ternary systems is
independent of the blend composition. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority

formulation relies on a novel time-dependent mobility model. The mobility
coefficient is adjusted adaptively as a function of gradients of the velocity
and the order parameter in the diffuse interface region in such a way that the
free energy minimization properly opposes the convective distortion. The ratio
of the convective distortion to the free energy minimization is termed as the
convective distortion parameter, which characterizes the deviation from the
hyperbolic tangent shape due to the convection effect. The mass conservation is
achieved by enforcing a Lagrange multiplier with both temporal and spatial
dependence on the phase-field function. We integrate the interface-preserving
and conservative phase-field formulation with the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations and the continuum surface tension force model for the simulation of
incompressible two-phase flows. A positivity preserving scheme designed for the
boundedness and stability of the solution is employed for the variational
discretization using unstructured finite elements. We examine the convergence
and accuracy of the Allen-Cahn phase-field solver through a generic
one-dimensional bistable diffusion-reaction system in a stretching flow. We
quantify and systematically assess the relative interface thickness error and
the relative surface tension force error with respect to the convective

Several noise-robust optimizers have therefore been developed to resolve this

has a proof of its convergence. However, in practice, it does not improve
learning performance in robotics scenarios. This reason is hypothesized that
most of robot learning problems are non-stationary, but AmsGrad assumes the
maximum second momentum during learning to be stationarily given. In order to
adapt to the non-stationary problems, an improved version, which slowly decays

an advanced form of space-variant aberration correction. Beyond imaging,
TM-based methods are emerging in a range of fields including optical
communications, optical micro-manipulation, and optical computing. In many
cases the TM is very sensitive to perturbations in the configuration of the
scattering medium it represents. Therefore applications often require an
up-to-the-minute characterisation of the fragile TM, typically entailing
hundreds to thousands of probe measurements. In this work we explore how these
measurement requirements can be relaxed using the framework of compressive
sensing: incorporation of prior information enables accurate estimation from
fewer measurements than the dimensionality of the TM we aim to reconstruct.
Examples of such priors include knowledge of a memory effect linking input and
output fields, an approximate model of the optical system, or a recent but
degraded TM measurement. We demonstrate this concept by reconstructing a
full-size TM of a multimode fibre supporting 754 modes at compression ratios
down to ~5% with good fidelity. The level of compression achievable is
dependent upon the strength of our priors. We show in this case that imaging is
still possible using TMs reconstructed at compression ratios down to ~1% (8
probe measurements). This compressive TM sampling strategy is quite general and
may be applied to any form of scattering system about which we have some prior
knowledge, including diffusers, thin layers of tissue, fibre optics of any
known refractive profile, and reflections from opaque walls. These approaches
offer a route to measurement of high-dimensional TMs quickly or with access to

myriad of emergent phases. A prominent case is that of the high-Tc cuprates for
which the relationship between superconductivity and a short-ranged,
incommensurate charge density wave in the CuO2 planes involving the dx2-y2
orbitals (Cu-CDW) is a subject of great current interest. Strong modifications
of the strength and coherence of this Cu-CDW have been achieved by applying
large magnetic fields, uniaxial pressure, or via the interfacial coupling in
cuprate/manganite multilayers. However, such modifications do not alter the
dominant orbital character. Here we investigate cuprate/manganite multilayers
with resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and show that a new kind of
Cu-based density wave order can be induced that has not been previously
observed in the cuprates. This order has an unusually small wave vector of Q =
0.096 reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.), a large correlation length of about 40
nm, and a predominant dz2 orbital character, instead of the typical dx2-y2
character. Its appearance is determined by the hole doping of the manganite
which is a key parameter controlling the interfacial charge transfer and
orbital reconstruction. We anticipate that the observation of a previously
unknown type of density wave order at the YBCO interface will allow for fresh
perspectives on the enigmatic relation between superconductivity and charge
order (CO) in the cuprates.

for improving both their performance and interpretability in visual tasks
including image classification. The essence of the spatial attention is to
learn a weight map which represents the relative importance of activations
within the same layer or channel. All existing attention mechanisms are local
attentions in the sense that weight maps are image-specific. However, in the
medical field, there are cases that all the images should share the same weight
map because the set of images record the same kind of symptom related to the
same object and thereby share the same structural content. In this paper, we
thus propose a novel global spatial attention mechanism in CNNs mainly for
medical image classification. The global weight map is instantiated by a
decision boundary between important pixels and unimportant pixels. And we
propose to realize the decision boundary by a binary classifier in which the
intensities of all images at a pixel are the features of the pixel. The binary
classification is integrated into an image classification CNN and is to be
optimized together with the CNN. Experiments on two medical image datasets and
one facial expression dataset showed that with the proposed attention, not only
the performance of four powerful CNNs which are GoogleNet, VGG, ResNet, and
DenseNet can be improved, but also meaningful attended regions can be obtained,
which is beneficial for understanding the content of images of a domain.

measurement results of a qubit-based sensor. A client delegates a measurement
task to a remote server that has a quantum sensor, and eavesdropper (Eve)
steals every classical information stored in the server side. By using quantum
properties, the QRS provides an asymmetricity about the information gain where
the client gets more information about the sensing results than Eve. However,
quantum states are fragile against decoherence, and so it is not clear whether
such a QRS is practically useful under the effect of realistic noise. Here, we
investigate the performance of the QRS with dephasing during the interaction
with the target fields. In the QRS, the client and server need to share a Bell
pair, and an imperfection of the Bell pair leads to a state preparation error
in a systematic way on the server side for the sensing. We consider the effect
of both dephasing and state preparation error. The uncertainty of the client
side decreases with the square root of the repetition number $M$ for small $M$,
which is the same scaling as the standard quantum metrology. On the other hand,
for large $M$, the state preparation error becomes as relevant as the
dephasing, and the uncertainty decreases logarithmically with $M$. We compare
the information gain between the client and Eve. This leads us to obtain the
conditions for the asymmetric gain to be maintained even under the effect of
dephasing.

systems and toolkits fall short in supporting the authoring of SSVs due to
three limitations. First, many systems have limited scalability, assuming that
data fits in the memory of one computer. Second, too much developer work, e.g.,
using custom code to generate mark layouts or render objects, is required.
Third, many systems focus on only a small subset of the SSV design space (e.g.
supporting a specific type of visual marks). To address these limitations, we
have developed Kyrix-S, a system for easy authoring of SSVs at scale. Kyrix-S
derives a declarative grammar that enables specification of a variety of SSVs
in a few tens of lines of code, based on an existing survey of scatterplot
tasks and designs. The declarative grammar is supported by a distributed layout
algorithm which automatically places visual marks onto zoom levels. We store
data in a multi-node database and use multi-node spatial indexes to achieve
interactive browsing of large SSVs. Extensive experiments show that 1) Kyrix-S
enables interactive browsing of SSVs of billions of objects, with response

In this paper we review the recent literature to provide guidance to

a framework to guide the choice between classes of explainable AI methods
(explainable modelling versus post-hoc explanation; model-based,
attribution-based, or example-based explanations; global and local
explanations). Furthermore, we find that quantitative evaluation metrics, which
are important for objective standardized evaluation, are still lacking for some
properties (e.g. clarity) and types of explanations (e.g. example-based
methods). We conclude that explainable modelling can contribute to trustworthy

complementary measures might be needed to create trustworthy AI in health care

a hot corona. In the presence of high quality data and with the correct
astrophysical model, X-ray reflection spectroscopy can be quite a powerful tool
to probe the strong gravity region, study the morphology of the accreting
matter, measure black hole spins, and even test Einstein's theory of general
relativity in the strong field regime. There are a few relativistic reflection
models available today and developed by different groups. All these models
present some differences and have a number of simplifications introducing
systematic uncertainties. The question is whether different models provide
different measurements of the properties of black holes and how to arrive at a
common model for the whole X-ray astronomy community. In this paper, we start
exploring this issue by analyzing a Suzaku observation of the stellar-mass
black hole in GRS 1915+105 and simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations
of the supermassive black hole in MCG-6-30-15. The relativistic reflection
component of these sources is fitted with RELCONV$\times$REFLIONX,

solution of system is globally bounded; when $N\geq3$, suitable large $a_1,
b_2$ (local intraspecific competitions) ensure there is no blowup.
  o If $a_3, a_4, b_3, b_4<0$, i.e., there are globally intraspecific and
interspecific cooperations, then for any $N\geq1$, a clear and largeness

  The obvious way to simplify the analysis of speculative-execution attacks is
to eliminate speculative execution. This is normally dismissed as being

Arrays of biomimetic fish scales in typical overlapping arrangements are placed
on a flat plate in a low-turbulence laminar water channel. Transition to
turbulence is triggered by controlled excitation of a Tollmien-Schlichting (TS)
wave. It was found that the TS wave can be attenuated with scales on the plate
which generate streamwise streaks. As a consequence, the transition location
was substantially delayed in the downstream direction by 55% with respect to
the uncontrolled reference case. This corresponds to a theoretical drag
reduction of about 27%. We thus hypothesize that fish scales can stabilize the
laminar boundary layer and prevent it from early transition, reducing friction
drag. This technique can possibly be used for bio-inspired surfaces as a
laminar flow control means.

the chromosphere above sunspot penumbrae. They are transient events that last
from a few seconds to several minutes and are thought to originate from
magnetic reconnection processes. Previous studies have mainly focused on their
morphological and spectral characteristics, and more recently on their
spectropolarimetric signals during the maximum brightness stage. Studies
addressing the temporal evolution of PMJs have also been carried out, but they
are based on spatial and spectral time variations only.
  Aims. Here we investigate the temporal evolution of the polarization signals
produced by short-lived PMJs (lifetimes $<$ 2 minutes) to infer how the
magnetic field vector evolves in the upper photosphere and mid-chromosphere.
  Methods. We use fast-cadence spectropolarimetric observations of the Ca II
854.2 nm line taken with the CRisp Imaging Spectropolarimeter at the Swedish
1-m Solar Telescope. The weak-field approximation (WFA) is used to estimate the
strength and inclination of the magnetic field vector.
  Results. The WFA reveals larger magnetic field changes in the upper
photosphere than in the chromosphere during the PMJ maximum brightness stage.
In the photosphere, the magnetic field inclination and strength undergo a
transient increase for most PMJs, but in 25$\%$ of the cases the field strength
decreases during the brightening. In the chromosphere, the magnetic field tends
to be slightly stronger during the PMJs.
  Conclusions. The propagation of compressive perturbation fronts followed by a
rarefaction phase in the aftershock region may explain the observed behavior of
the magnetic field vector. The fact that such behavior varies among the
analyzed PMJs could be a consequence of the limited temporal resolution of the
observations and the fast-evolving nature of the PMJs.

phase-space distribution function of DM has been overlooked. In this work, we
tackle this problem by making use of self-consistent equilibrium phase-space
models based on the Eddington inversion formalism and an extension of this
method to a DM halo with some degree of anisotropy in velocity space. We
demonstrate that incorrectly accounting for the variation of the DM velocity
distribution with position in the Galaxy leads to a systematic error between a
factor two and two orders of magnitude, depending in particular on the target
star, the DM candidate mass and the type of interaction involved. Moreover, we
show that underlying phase-space properties, such as the anisotropy of the
velocity tensor, actually play an important part -- previously disregarded --
and can have a sizable impact on predictions of capture rates and subsequent
observables. We argue that Eddington-like methods, which self-consistently
account for kinematic constraints on the components of the Galaxy, actually
provide a reliable next-to-minimal approach to narrow down uncertainties from
phase-space modeling on predictions of observables related to DM capture in

diagnostic and treatment protocols are a primary concern. Mathematical modeling
and simulation is a promising approach to personalized cancer medicine. Yet,
the complexity, heterogeneity and multiscale nature of cancer present severe
challenges. One of the major barriers to use mathematical models to predict the
outcome of therapeutic regimens in a particular patient lies in their
initialization and parameterization in order to reflect individual cancer
characteristics accurately. Here we present a study where we used multitype
measurements acquired routinely on a single breast tumor, including
histopathology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and molecular profiling, to
personalize a multiscale hybrid cellular automaton model of breast cancer
treated with chemotherapeutic and antiangiogenic agents. We model drug
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics at the tumor tissue level but with
cellular and subcellular resolution. We simulate those spatio-temporal dynamics
in 2D cross-sections of tumor portions over 12-week therapy regimes, resulting
in complex and computationally intensive simulations. For such computationally
demanding systems, formal statistical inference methods to estimate individual
parameters from data have not been feasible in practice to until most recently,
after the emergence of machine learning techniques applied to likelihood-free
inference methods. Here we use the inference advances provided by Bayesian
optimization to fit our model to simulated data of individual patients. In this
way, we investigate if some key parameters can be estimated from a series of
measurements of cell density in the tumor tissue, as well as how often the
measurements need to be taken to allow reliable predictions.

the matched controls with a comparable distribution of known confounders. We
propose an adaptive two-stage design with the options of early stopping for

  (https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/technical-sessions)",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Grey-box fuzz testing has revealed thousands of vulnerabilities in real-world
software owing to its lightweight instrumentation, fast coverage feedback, and
dynamic adjusting strategies. However, directly applying grey-box fuzzing to
input-dependent multithreaded programs can be extremely inefficient. In
practice, multithreading-relevant bugs are usually buried in sophisticated
program flows. Meanwhile, the existing grey-box fuzzing techniques do not
stress thread-interleavings which affect execution states in multithreaded
programs. Therefore, mainstream grey-box fuzzers cannot effectively test
problematic segments in multithreaded programs despite they might obtain high
code coverage statistics.
  To this end, we propose MUZZ, a new grey-box fuzzing technique that hunts for
bugs in multithreaded programs. MUZZ owns three novel thread-aware
instrumentations, namely coverage-oriented instrumentation, thread-context
instrumentation, and schedule-intervention instrumentation. During fuzzing,
these instrumentations engender runtime feedback to stress execution states
caused by thread interleavings. By leveraging the feedback in the dynamic seed
selection and execution strategies, MUZZ preserves more valuable seeds that
expose bugs in a multithreading context.
  We evaluate MUZZ on 12 real-world software programs. Experiments show that
MUZZ outperforms AFL in both multithreading-relevant seed generation and
concurrency-vulnerability detection. Further, by replaying the target programs
against the generated seeds, MUZZ also reveals more concurrency-bugs (e.g.,
data-races, thread-leaks) than AFL. In total, MUZZ detected 8 new
concurrency-vulnerabilities and 19 new concurrency-bugs. At the time of
writing, 4 CVE IDs have been assigned to the reported issues.

functions to the KLF, we derive the star formation history of the nuclear star

Gyr ago or longer, followed by a largely quiescent phase that lasted for more
than 5 Gyr. We clearly detect the presence of intermediate-age stars of about 3
Gyr in age. This event makes up about 15% of the originally formed stellar mass
of the cluster. A few percent of the stellar mass formed in the past few 100
Myr. Our results appear to be inconsistent with a quasi-continuous star
formation history. The stellar density increases exponentially towards Sgr A*
at all magnitudes between Ks=15 to 19. We also show that the precise properties
of the stellar cusp around Sgr A* are hard to determine because the star
formation history suggests that the star counts can be significantly
contaminated, at all magnitudes, by stars that are too young to be dynamically
relaxed. We find that the probability of observing any young (non-millisecond)
pulsar in a tight orbit around Sgr A* and beamed towards Earth is very low. We
argue that typical globular clusters, such as they are observed in and around

mass in any significant way. The nuclear cluster may have formed following
major merger events in the early history of the Milky Way.

We recall that a proper ideal
$I$ of $R$ is called a semiprimary ideal of $R$ if whenever $a,b\in R$ and $ab
\in I$, then $a\in \sqrt{I}$ or $b\in \sqrt{I}$. We say $I$ is a {\it weakly

$a\in \sqrt{I}$ or $b\in \sqrt{I}$. In this paper, we introduce a new class of
ideals that is closely related to the class of (weakly) semiprimary ideals. Let
$I(R)$ be the set of all ideals of $R$ and let $\delta: I(R) \rightarrow I(R)$
be a function. Then $\delta$ is called an expansion function of ideals of $R$
if whenever $L, I, J$ are ideals of $R$ with $J \subseteq I$, then $L \subseteq
\delta(L)$ and $\delta(J) \subseteq \delta(I)$. Let $\delta$ be an expansion
function of ideals of $R$. Then a proper ideal $I$ of $R$ (i.e., $I \not = R$)
is called a ({\it $\delta$-semiprimary}) {\it weakly $\delta$-semiprimary}
ideal of $R$ if ($ab \in I$) $0 \not = ab \in I$ implies $a \in \delta(I)$ or
$b \in \delta(I)$. For example, let $\delta: I(R) \rightarrow I(R)$ such that
$\delta(I) = \sqrt{I}$. Then $\delta$ is an expansion function of ideals of $R$
and hence a proper ideal $I$ of $R$ is a ($\delta$-semiprimary) weakly
$\delta$-semiprimary ideal of $R$ if and only if $I$ is a (semiprimary) weakly
semiprimary ideal of $R$. A number of results concerning weakly
$\delta$-semiprimary ideals and examples of weakly $\delta$-semiprimary ideals

segmentation tasks. However, the predictive performance of these algorithms
depends on the quality of labels. This problem is particularly pertinent in the
medical image domain, where both the annotation cost and inter-observer
variability are high. In a typical label acquisition process, different human
experts provide their estimates of the ""true"" segmentation labels under the
influence of their own biases and competence levels. Treating these noisy
labels blindly as the ground truth limits the performance that automatic
segmentation algorithms can achieve. In this work, we present a method for
jointly learning, from purely noisy observations alone, the reliability of
individual annotators and the true segmentation label distributions, using two
coupled CNNs. The separation of the two is achieved by encouraging the
estimated annotators to be maximally unreliable while achieving high fidelity
with the noisy training data. We first define a toy segmentation dataset based
on MNIST and study the properties of the proposed algorithm. We then
demonstrate the utility of the method on three public medical imaging
segmentation datasets with simulated (when necessary) and real diverse
annotations: 1) MSLSC (multiple-sclerosis lesions); 2) BraTS (brain tumours);
3) LIDC-IDRI (lung abnormalities). In all cases, our method outperforms
competing methods and relevant baselines particularly in cases where the number
of annotations is small and the amount of disagreement is large. The
experiments also show strong ability to capture the complex spatial
characteristics of annotators' mistakes.

  In these lecture notes, I present a review of the magnetic mechanisms applied
to the outer regions R>1 AU of these discs, which are the planet-formation
regions. In contrast to usual astrophysical plasmas, the gas in these regions
is noticeably cold (T<300 K) and dense, which implies a very low ionisation
fraction close to the disc midplane. In these notes, I deliberately ignore the
innermost R~0.1 AU region which is influenced by the star-disk interaction and
various radiative effects.
  I start by presenting a short overview of the observational evidence for the
dynamics of these objects. I then introduce the methods and approximations used
to model these plasmas, including non-ideal MHD, and the uncertainties
associated with this approach. In this framework, I explain how the global
dynamics of these discs is modelled, and I present a stability analysis of this
plasma in the local approximation, introducing the non-ideal magneto-rotational
instability. Following this mostly analytical part, I discuss numerical models
which have been used to describe the saturation mechanisms of this instability,
and the formation of large-scale structures by various saturation mechanisms.
Finally, I show that local numerical models are insufficient since magnetised
winds are also emitted from the surface of these objects. After a short
introduction on winds physics, I present global models of protoplanetary discs,
including both a large-scale wind and the non-ideal dynamics of the disc.

study the case where infected agents recover and only develop immunity if they
are continuously infected for some time. Otherwise, they become susceptible
again. We show that field theory bounds the peak of the infectious rate.
Consequently, the theory's phases characterise the disease dynamics: (i) a
pandemic phase and (ii) a response regime. The model excellently describes the
epidemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China. We find

primary user (PU) transmission in the presence of an interferer. In the
millimeter wave (mmWave) band, due to high attenuation, there are fewer
multipaths, and the channel is sparse, giving rise to fewer directions of
arrivals (DoAs). Sensing in only these paths instead of blind energy detection
can reap significant benefits. An analog beamforming weight vector is designed
such that the beamforming gain in the true DoAs of the PU signal is maximized
while minimizing interference from the interferer. To demonstrate the bound on
the system performance, the proposed sensing scheme is designed under the
knowledge of full channel state information (CSI) at the SU for the PU-SU and
Interferer-SU channels. However, as the CSI may not be available at the SU,
another BFED sensing scheme is proposed, which only utilizes the estimate the
DoAs. To model the estimates of DoAs, perturbations are added to the true DoAs.
The distribution of the test statistic for BFED with full CSI schemes is
derived under the null hypothesis so that the threshold of the Neyman-Pearson
detector can be found analytically. The performance of both schemes is also
compared with the traditional energy detector for multi-antenna systems.

sources, such as nearby gamma-ray bursts or supernovae, have shown that these
events could lead to severe changes in atmospheric composition. Depletion of
ozone, the most notable of these changes, is extremely dangerous to living
organisms as any decrease in ozone levels leads to an increase in the
irradiance of harmful solar radiation at the Earth's surface. In this work we
consider dark matter as an astrophysical source of gamma rays, by the
annihilation and decay of WIMPs found within dark compact halo objects known as
UltraCompact Minihaloes (UCMHs). We calculate the fluence of gamma rays
produced in this way and simulate the resulting changes to terrestrial ozone
levels using the Goddard Space Flight Center 2D Atmospheric Model. We also
calculate the rate at which such events would occur, using estimates for the
mass distribution of these haloes within the Milky Way. We find that the ozone
depletion from UCMHs can be significant, and even of similar magnitude to the
levels which have been linked to the cause of the Late-Ordovician mass
extinction event. However, the probability of such encounters over the Earth's
entire history is relatively low. This suggests that, while dark compact
objects like UCMHs could have had an impact on the Earth's biosphere, other
astrophysical phenomena like gamma-ray bursts or supernovae seem a more likely
source of these effects.

radio relic associated with fossil plasma from a radio galaxy and with a

  Aims: We use the XMM-Newton and Suzaku observations to reveal the
thermodynamical nature of the reported re-acceleration site and other X-ray
edges. Meanwhile, we aim to investigate the temperature profile in the
low-density outskirts with Suzaku data.
  Methods: We perform both imaging and spectral analysis to measure the density

We present a new method to calibrate the XMM-Newton soft proton background.
Archival Chandra, Suzaku, and ROSAT data are used to estimate the cosmic X-ray

  Results: At the south-eastern edge, both XMM-Newton and Suzaku's temperature
jumps point to a $\mathcal{M}\sim1.2$ shock, which agrees with result from SB
fits with Chandra, and supports the re-acceleration scenario at this shock
front. The southern edge shows a more complex scenario, where a shock and the
presence of stripped cold material may coincide. The Suzaku temperature
profiles in the southern low density regions are marginally higher than the
typical relaxed cluster temperature profile. The measured value
$kT_{500}=4.84\pm0.04\pm0.19$ keV with XMM-Newton and
$kT_{500}=5.17\pm0.07\pm0.13$ keV with Suzaku are significantly lower than

theoretically. However, the standard theory of their formation encounters many
difficulties, such as dust fall and disk lifetime problems. We positively
analyze them, expecting that those problems as a whole may indicate some
consistent effective model. Thus we propose a dynamical model of the planet
formation based on the assumption that the inner void of gas is commonly formed
in the disk without specifying any Physical origin. The basic processes of this
model are the dust fall, the accumulation, and the slingshots. The dust in the
protoplanetary disk rapidly falls as it grows to the meter size. Then, all of
them stops at the outer edge of the void where the gas friction disappears.
Such dust clusters rapidly coalesce with each other and easily cause the
runaway in the dense and coherent environment. Then the huge clusters are
formed there and they are the first generation planets Hot-Jupiters. They
immediately slingshot smaller clusters around them towards the outer regions.
They are Rockey-Planets, Cold-Gas-Giants, Ice-Giants, and `Trans Neptunian
objects including `Kuiper belt/Oort cloud objects`, depending on the original
core mass or the distance blown. Combining numerical calculations of the
slingshots and coagulation equations, we obtain the planet population diagram,
including the possibility of the massive thermal metamorphosis, the origin of
the variety of planetary systems, and the possibility of stray planets/objects.

- neutrals) simulations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) at a smoothly
changing interface between a solar prominence thread and the corona. The
purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the RTI and the effects
of the partial ionization on the development of RTI using non-linear two-fluid
numerical simulations. Our two-fluid model takes into account viscosity,
thermal conductivity, and collisional interaction between neutrals and charges:
ionization/recombination, energy and momentum transfer, and frictional heating.
In this paper I, the sensitivity of the RTI dynamics to the prominence
equilibrium configuration, including the impact of the magnetic field strength
and shear supporting the prominence thread, and the amount of prominence
mass-loading is explored. We show that, at small scales, a realistically smooth
prominence-corona interface leads to qualitatively different linear RTI
evolution than that expected for a discontinuous interface, while magnetic
field shear has the stabilizing effect of reducing the growth rate or
eliminating the instability. In the non-linear phase, we observe that in the
presence of field shear the development of the instability leads to formation
of coherent and interacting 2.5D magnetic structures, which, in turn, can lead
to substantial plasma flow across magnetic field lines and associated
decoupling of the fluid velocities of charges and neutrals.

find that the combination of self-propulsion, friction, mutual attraction, and
surface curvature produce milling patterns where each agent in a swarm
oscillates on a limit cycle, with different agents splayed along the cycle such
that the swarm's center-of-mass remains stationary. In general, such patterns
loose stability when mutual attraction is insufficient to overcome the
constraint of curvature, and we uncover two broad classes of stationary
milling-state bifurcations. In the first, a spatially periodic mode undergoes a
Hopf bifurcation as curvature is increased which results in unstable
spatiotemporal oscillations. This generic bifurcation is analyzed for the
sphere and demonstrated numerically for several surfaces. In the second, a
saddle-node-of-periodic-orbits occurs in which stable and unstable milling
states collide and annihilate. The latter is analyzed for milling states on

include equations for the evolution of the underlying bed (morphodynamics) and
the motion of an associated sedimentary phase. We investigate the linear
stability properties of these systems in considerable generality. Naive
formulations of the morphodynamics, featuring exchange of sediment between a
well-mixed suspended load and the bed, lead to mathematically ill-posed
governing equations. This is traced to a singularity in the linearised system
at Froude number $Fr = 1$ that causes unbounded unstable growth of
short-wavelength disturbances. The inclusion of neglected physical processes
can restore well posedness. Turbulent momentum diffusion (eddy viscosity) and a
suitably parametrised bed load sediment transport are shown separately to be
sufficient in this regard. However, we demonstrate that such models typically
inherit an associated instability that is absent from non-morphodynamic
settings. Implications of our analyses are considered for simple generic
closures, including a drag law that switches between fluid and granular
behaviour, depending on the sediment concentration. Steady morphodynamic flows
bifurcate into two states: dilute flows, which are stable at low $Fr$, and
concentrated flows which are always unstable to disturbances in concentration.
By computing the growth rates of linear modes across a wide region of parameter
space, we examine in detail the effects of specific model parameters including
the choices of sediment erodibility, eddy viscosity and bed load flux. These
analyses may be used to inform the ongoing development of operational models in
engineering and geosciences.

for significantly improving exciton transport efficiency through `wires'
comprising a chain of molecular sites with an intrinsic energy gradient.
Specifically, by introducing `barriers' to the energy landscape at regular
intervals along the transport path, we find that undesirable radiative
recombination processes are suppressed due to a clear separation of sub-radiant
and super-radiant eigenstates in the system. This, in turn, can lead to an
improvement in transmitted power by many orders of magnitude, even for very
long chains. From there, we analyse the robustness of this phenomenon to
changes in both system and environment properties to show that this effect can
be beneficial over a range of different thermal and optical environment
regimes. Finally, we show that the novel energy landscape presented here may
provide a useful foundation for overcoming the short length scales over which
exciton diffusion typically occurs in organic photo-voltaics and other
nanoscale transport scenarios, thus leading to considerable potential
improvements in the efficiency of such devices.

we jointly reconstruct the underlying density field from simulated Lyman-Alpha

that these data are synergistic, with the Lyman Alpha forest providing
reconstruction of low density regions and galaxy surveys tracing the density
peaks. We find a more accurate power spectra reconstruction going to higher
scales when fitting these two data-sets simultaneously than if using either one
individually. When applied to cosmic web analysis, we find performing the joint
analysis is equivalent to a Lyman Alpha survey with significantly increased
sight-line spacing. Since we reconstruct the velocity field and matter field
jointly, we demonstrate the ability to evolve the mock observed volume further

regions which will evolve into clusters. We apply our reconstructions to study
protocluster structure and evolution, finding for realistic survey parameters
we can provide accurate mass estimates of the z \approx 2 structures and their

transmission rates is taken as the objective function to derive scenarios with
a low level transmission risk. After the determination of an appropriate seat
layout, the cellular automata is used to derive and evaluate a corresponding

equation, which as compared to previous approaches easily lends itself to
further approximations. The static linear permittivity of polar fluids
$\epsilon$ is calculated as a function of temperature, density and molecular
dipole moment in vacuo for arbitrary pair interaction potentials. Then, using
the Kirkwood superposition approximation for the three-body orientational
distribution function, we suggest a simple way to construct model potentials of
mean torques considering permanent and induced dipole moments. We successfully
compare the theory with the experimental temperature dependence of the static
linear permittivity of various polar fluids such as a series of linear
monohydroxy alcohols, water, tributyl phosphate, acetonitrile, acetone,
nitrobenzene and dimethyl sulfoxide, by fitting only one single parameter,
which describes the induction to dipole-dipole energy strength ratio. We
demonstrate that comparing the value of $g_K$ with unity in order to deduce the
alignment state of permanent dipole pairs, as is currently done is in many
situations, is a misleading oversimplification, while the correct alignment
state is revealed when considering the proper interaction potential. Moreover
we show, that picturing H-bonding polar fluids as polar molecules with
permanent and induced dipole moments without invoking any specific H-bonding
mechanism is in many cases sufficient to explain experimental data of the
static dielectric constant. In this light, the failure of the theory to
describe the experimental temperature dependence of the static dielectric
constant of glycerol, a non-rigid polyalcohol, is not due to the lack of
specific H-bonding mechanisms, but rather to an oversimplified model potential

does not admit a local hidden variable description for $\alpha>0.559$ and
$\alpha>\frac{1}{2}$, in cases (i) and (ii) respectively, which in both cases
provides a device-independent certification of the entanglement of the state.
These bounds are significantly lower than the previously best-known bound of

will be increasingly important to support the transition of power systems
toward zero emissions. The reason is that PHS can mitigate the variability and
uncertainty of renewable energy production from solar and wind power to balance
electricity demand with supply. In this paper, we propose an integer
programming problem for PHS siting that uses a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to
meet an energy storage requirement. It assumes the existence of a reservoir,
lake, or river, and decides where to build a reservoir that will constitute the
PHS with the existing body of water. This model finds minimum-cost project
candidates given parameters such as desired head, power, and operation time.
The paper discusses different solution methods to assure reservoir closure and
avoid its fragmentation. A heuristic explores the representations of the DEM,
from more aggregate to more precise, to sequentially refine the solution based
on the last selected site, which reduces computational effort. The formulation
is general and the objective function includes both construction and equipment
costs. Constraints are related to the energy storage target and reservoir
closure based on the DEM. We illustrate the methodology by selecting multiple
PHS projects next to the reservoir of the Sobradinho hydropower plant in

inverter-based energy resources, it is impractical to maintain the accurate
model and deploy measurements at all nodes due to the large-scale of ADNs.
Thus, current models of ADNs are usually involving significant errors or even
unknown. Moreover, ADNs are usually partially observable since only a few
measurements are available at pilot nodes or nodes with significant users. To
provide a practical Volt/Var control (VVC) strategy for such networks, a
data-driven VVC method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the system response
policy, approximating the relationship between the control variables and states
of monitoring nodes, is estimated by a recursive regression closed-form
solution. Then, based on real-time measurements and the newly updated system
response policy, a VVC strategy with convergence guarantee is realized. Since
the recursive regression solution is embedded in the control stage, a
data-driven closed-loop VVC framework is established. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is validated in an unbalanced distribution system considering
nonlinear loads where not only the rapid and self-adaptive voltage regulation
is realized but also system-wide optimization is achieved.

studied in model theory, in the context of \emph{dependent} theories. A set
system that is definable by a formula of first-order logic with parameters has
finite VC-dimension if and only if the formula is a dependent formula.
  In this paper we study the VC-dimension and the VC-density of the edge
relation $Exy$ on Johnson graphs and on Hamming graphs. On a graph $G$, the set
system defined by the formula $Exy$ is the vertex set of $G$ along with the
collection of all \emph{open neighbourhoods} of $G$.
  We show that the edge relation has VC-dimension at most $4$ on Johnson graphs
and at most $3$ on Hamming graphs and these bounds are optimal.
  We furthermore show that the VC-density of the edge relation on the class of
all Johnson graphs is $2$, and on the class of all Hamming graphs the
VC-density is $2$ as well. Moreover, we show that our bounds on the
VC-dimension carry over to the class of all induced subgraphs of Johnson

respectively. It also follows that the VC-dimension of the set systems of
\emph{closed neighbourhoods} in Johnson graphs and Hamming graphs is bounded.
  Johnson graphs and Hamming graphs are well known examples of distance
transitive graphs.
  Neither of these graph classes is nowhere dense nor is there a bound on their

the low-temperature behavior of three different classical models of 1D soft

cluster phase, the peculiar pairing of neighboring soft particles can be
nontrivially mapped onto a 1D discrete classical Ising model. We also observe a
related phenomenon, namely the presence of an anomalous peak in the
low-temperature specific heat, thus indicating the emergence of Schottky

valley centered at the AA regions, the AA-p orbitals, account for the most part
of the spectral weight of the flats bands. Exchange and assisted-hopping terms
between these orbitals are found to be small. Therefore, the low energy
properties of TBG will be determined by the density-density interactions. These
interactions decay with the distance much faster than in the two orbital model,
following a 1/r law in the absence of gates. The magnitude of the largest
interaction in the model, the onsite term between the flat band orbitals, is
controlled by the size of the AA regions and is estimated to be ~ 40 meV. To
screen this interaction, the metallic gates have to be placed at a distance
smaller than 5 nm. For larger distances only the long-range part of the
interaction is substantially screened. The model reproduces the band
deformation induced by doping found in other approaches within the Hartree
approximation. Such deformation reveals the presence of other orbitals in the
flat bands and is sensitive to the inclusion of the interactions involving
them.

Galileon scalar sector, assumed to be a relict of some other physics that
solves the cosmological constant problem rather than a solution in its own
right. This allows the energy density carried by the Galileon scalar to be
sufficiently small that it evades stringent constraints from the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect, which otherwise rules out the cubic Galileon theory.
Although the model with disformal coupling does not exhibit screening, we show
there is a `screening-like' phenomenon in which the energy density carried by
the Galileon scalar is suppressed during matter domination when the quadratic
and cubic Galileon operators are both relevant and the quadratic sector has a
stable kinetic term. We obtain the explicit 3+1 form of Maxwell's equations in
the presence of the disformal coupling, and the wave equations that govern
electromagnetic waves. The disformal coupling is known to generate a small mass
that modifies their velocity of propagation. We use the WKB approximation to
study electromagnetic waves in this theory and show that, despite remarkable
recent constraints from the LIGO/Virgo observatories that restrict the
difference in propagation velocity between electromagnetic and gravitational
radiation to roughly 1 part in $10^{15}$, the disformal coupling is too weak to
be constrained by events such as GW170817 or by the dispersion of
electromagnetic radiation at different wavelengths.

most relevant information in the graph structure are needed. However, existing
methods do not learn representations that can be interpreted in a

node2coords, a representation learning algorithm for graphs, which learns
simultaneously a low-dimensional space and coordinates for the nodes in that
space. The patterns that span the low dimensional space reveal the graph's most
important structural information. The coordinates of the nodes reveal the
proximity of their local structure to the graph structural patterns. In order
to measure this proximity by taking into account the underlying graph, we
propose to use Wasserstein distances. We introduce an autoencoder that employs
a linear layer in the encoder and a novel Wasserstein barycentric layer at the
decoder. Node connectivity descriptors, that capture the local structure of the
nodes, are passed through the encoder to learn the small set of graph
structural patterns. In the decoder, the node connectivity descriptors are
reconstructed as Wasserstein barycenters of the graph structural patterns. The
optimal weights for the barycenter representation of a node's connectivity
descriptor correspond to the coordinates of that node in the low-dimensional
space. Experimental results demonstrate that the representations learned with
node2coords are interpretable, lead to node embeddings that are stable to
perturbations of the graph structure and achieve competitive or superior

key to understanding their ground normal state, however, existing pseudogap
models have essential inconsistencies with experiments. In our approach
pseudogap emerges due to impact of autolocalized carriers on stationary states
of delocalized ones and topology of the 2D hole-like dispersion. Autolocalized
carriers create potential which transforms Bloch quasiparticles into
distributed wave packets (DWPs) with different momentums in areas with
different potential. Topology of hole-like constant energy curves in
2D-conducting cuprates forbids DWPs with average momentums near antinode.
Manifestation of permitted DWPs in ARPES spectra demonstrates all known
pseudogap features including midpoint shift, giant broadening and Fermi
momentum misalignment. Calculated doping dependence of the pseudogap width and
onset temperature agrees with experiments. The obtained ground normal state of
the hole-doped cuprates, in which all the doped holes are autolocalized until
high doping is reached and near-antinodal electron DWPs are absent, explains
Fermi surface reconstruction from small electron pocket to large hole-like
Fermi surface observed in quantum oscillation measurements. Our results open a
possibility of creating systems with artificial pseudogap and switchable
density of states on the base of highly polarizable layered structures with 2D
conductivity and hole-like dispersion.

them available on the Web through SPARQL endpoints, queryable using the SPARQL

Semantic Web experts, it hinders broader use of RDF data by common Web users,
engineers and developers unfamiliar with Semantic Web technologies, who
normally rely on Web RESTful APIs for querying Web-available data and creating
applications over them. To solve this problem, we have developed RAMOSE, a
generic tool developed in Python to create REST APIs over SPARQL endpoints.
Through the creation of source-specific textual configuration files, RAMOSE
enables the querying of SPARQL endpoints via simple Web RESTful API calls that
return either JSON or CSV-formatted data, thus hiding all the intrinsic
complexities of SPARQL and RDF from common Web users. We provide evidence that
the use of RAMOSE to provide REST API access to RDF data within OpenCitations
triplestores is beneficial in terms of the number of queries made by external
users to such RDF data using the RAMOSE API compared with the direct access via
the SPARQL endpoint. Our findings show the importance for suppliers of RDF data
of having an alternative API access service, which enables its use by those
with no (or little) experience in Semantic Web technologies and the SPARQL
query language. RAMOSE can be used both to query any SPARQL endpoint and to
query any other Web API, and thus it represents an easy generic technical
solution for service providers who wish to create an API service to access

solution generally involves a computational effort that grows exponentially

in recent years for one-dimensional systems, much less has been achieved for
interacting quantum models in higher dimensions, since they incorporate an
additional layer of complexity. In this work, we employ a variational method
that allows for an efficient and controlled computation of the dynamics of
quantum many-body systems in one and higher dimensions. The approach presented
here introduces a variational class of wavefunctions based on complex networks
of classical spins akin to artificial neural networks, which can be constructed
in a controlled fashion. We provide a detailed prescription for such
constructions and illustrate their performance by studying quantum quenches in
one- and two-dimensional models. In particular, we investigate the

  self-unrolling",,,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  KM3NeT is a research infrastructure being installed in the deep Mediterranean
Sea. It will house a neutrino telescope comprising hundreds of networked
moorings - detection units or strings equipped with optical instrumentation to
detect the Cherenkov radiation generated by charged particles from
neutrino-induced collisions in its vicinity. In comparison to moorings
typically used for oceanography, several key features of the KM3NeT string are
different: the instrumentation is contained in transparent and thus unprotected
glass spheres; two thin Dyneema ropes are used as strength members; and a thin
delicate backbone tube with fibre-optics and copper wires for data and power
transmission, respectively, runs along the full length of the mooring. Also,
compared to other neutrino telescopes such as ANTARES in the Mediterranean Sea
and GVD in Lake Baikal, the KM3NeT strings are more slender to minimise the
amount of material used for support of the optical sensors. Moreover, the rate
of deploying a large number of strings in a period of a few years is
unprecedented. For all these reasons, for the installation of the KM3NeT
strings, a custom-made, fast deployment method was designed. Despite the length
of several hundreds of metres, the slim design of the string allows it to be
compacted into a small, re-usable spherical launching vehicle instead of
deploying the mooring weight down from a surface vessel. After being lowered to
the seafloor, the string unfurls to its full length with the buoyant launching
vehicle rolling along the two ropes.The design of the vehicle, the loading with
a string, and its underwater self-unrolling are detailed in this paper.

explore the nature of the state. We find that the naive hyperbolic space

connects the bra with the ket, a bra-ket wormhole. The semiclassical Lorentzian
interpretation leads to CFT state entangled with an expanding and collapsing

  As a second case, we consider a state produced by Lorentzian $dS_2$
evolution, again followed by flat space evolution. The most naive geometry also
leads to a similar paradox. We explore several possible bra-ket wormholes. The
most obvious one leads to a badly divergent temperature. The most promising one
also leads to a divergent temperature but by making a projection onto low
energy states we find that it has features that look similar to the previous
Euclidean case. In particular, the maximum entropy of an interval in the future
is set by the de Sitter entropy.

exceeding a full Brillouin zone. As energy filters double-hemispherical or
time-of-flight (ToF) devices are in use. Here we present a new approach for
momentum mapping of the full half-space, based on a single hemispherical
analyzer (path radius 225 mm). Excitation by an unfocused He lamp yielded an
energy resolution of 7.7 meV. The performance is demonstrated by k-imaging of
quantum-well states in Au and Xe multilayers. The alpha-square-aberration term
(alpha: entrance angle in the dispersive plane) and the transit-time spread of
the electrons in the spherical field are studied in a large pass-energy (6 to
660 eV) and angular range (alpha up to about 7{\deg}). It is discussed how the
method circumvents the preconditions of previous theoretical work on the
resolution limitation due to the alpha-square-term and the transit-time spread,
being detrimental for time-resolved experiments. Thanks to k-resolved
detection, both effects can be corrected numerically. We introduce a
dispersive-plus-ToF hybrid mode of operation, with an imaging ToF analyzer
behind the exit slit of the hemisphere. This instrument captures 3D data arrays

crucial for the treatment choice and the patients' clinical outcome. We rely on
the commonly used AO system, which describes a hierarchical knowledge tree
classifying the images into types and subtypes according to the fracture's
location and complexity. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic
classification of proximal femur fractures into 3 and 7 AO classes based on a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). As it is known, CNNs need large and
representative datasets with reliable labels, which are hard to collect for the
application at hand. In this paper, we design a curriculum learning (CL)
approach that improves over the basic CNNs performance under such conditions.
Our novel formulation reunites three curriculum strategies: individually
weighting training samples, reordering the training set, and sampling subsets
of data. The core of these strategies is a scoring function ranking the
training samples. We define two novel scoring functions: one from
domain-specific prior knowledge and an original self-paced uncertainty score.
We perform experiments on a clinical dataset of proximal femur radiographs. The
curriculum improves proximal femur fracture classification up to the
performance of experienced trauma surgeons. The best curriculum method reorders
the training set based on prior knowledge resulting into a classification
improvement of 15%. Using the publicly available MNIST dataset, we further
discuss and demonstrate the benefits of our unified CL formulation for three
controlled and challenging digit recognition scenarios: with limited amounts of
data, under class-imbalance, and in the presence of label noise. The code of

  learning","32 pages, 9 figures",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG eess.SP q-bio.NC q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective. Supervised learning paradigms are often limited by the amount of
labeled data that is available. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in
clinically-relevant data, such as electroencephalography (EEG), where labeling
can be costly in terms of specialized expertise and human processing time.
Consequently, deep learning architectures designed to learn on EEG data have
yielded relatively shallow models and performances at best similar to those of
traditional feature-based approaches. However, in most situations, unlabeled
data is available in abundance. By extracting information from this unlabeled
data, it might be possible to reach competitive performance with deep neural
networks despite limited access to labels. Approach. We investigated
self-supervised learning (SSL), a promising technique for discovering structure
in unlabeled data, to learn representations of EEG signals. Specifically, we
explored two tasks based on temporal context prediction as well as contrastive
predictive coding on two clinically-relevant problems: EEG-based sleep staging
and pathology detection. We conducted experiments on two large public datasets
with thousands of recordings and performed baseline comparisons with purely
supervised and hand-engineered approaches. Main results. Linear classifiers
trained on SSL-learned features consistently outperformed purely supervised
deep neural networks in low-labeled data regimes while reaching competitive
performance when all labels were available. Additionally, the embeddings
learned with each method revealed clear latent structures related to
physiological and clinical phenomena, such as age effects. Significance. We
demonstrate the benefit of self-supervised learning approaches on EEG data. Our
results suggest that SSL may pave the way to a wider use of deep learning
models on EEG data.

This paper considers settings in which each measurement yields one sample of
one attribute for one alternative. When given a fixed number of samples to
collect, the decision-maker must determine which samples to obtain, make the
measurements, update prior beliefs about the attribute magnitudes, and then
select an alternative. This paper presents the sample allocation problem for
multiple attribute selection decisions and proposes two sequential, lookahead
procedures for the case in which discrete distributions are used to model the
uncertain attribute magnitudes. The two procedures are similar but reflect
different quality measures (and loss functions), which motivate different
decision rules: (1) select the alternative with the greatest expected utility
and (2) select the alternative that is most likely to be the truly best
alternative. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the
sequential procedures and hybrid procedures that first allocate some samples

allocating many (but not all) of the initial samples with the uniform

This adaptation can result from the establishment of a new spatial map of the

However, studies attempting to reweight the two binaural cues, interaural
differences in time and level, yielded inconclusive results. In this study we
investigated whether binaural cue reweighting can be induced by a
lateralization training in a virtual audio-visual environment. 20
normal-hearing participants, divided into two groups, completed the experiment
consisting of a seven-day lateralization training in a virtual audio-visual
environment, preceded and followed by a test measuring the binaural cue
weights. During testing, the participants task was to lateralize 500-ms
bandpass-filtered (2-4 kHz) noise bursts containing various combinations of
spatially consistent and inconsistent ITDs and ILDs. During training, the task
was extended by visual cues reinforcing ITDs in one group and ILDs in the other
group as well as manipulating the azimuthal ranges of the two cues. In both
groups, the weight given to the reinforced cue increased significantly from
pre- to posttest, suggesting that participants reweighted the binaural cues in
the expected direction. This reweighting occurred predominantly within the
first training session. The present results are relevant as binaural cue
reweighting is, for example, likely to occur when normal-hearing listeners
adapt to new acoustic environments. Similarly, binaural cue reweighting might
be a factor underlying the low contribution of ITDs to sound localization of
cochlear-implant listeners as they typically do not experience reliable ITD
cues with their clinical devices.

fluctuates largely due to the fast movement of VLC terminals. Such fluctuations
will cause possible signal clipping and quantization noise at the
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and thus aggravate signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and reliability of the communication link. To mitigate this effect, the
automatic gain control (AGC) technique is often introduced in the receiver
front-end to adaptively adjust the electrical signal strength. In this paper,
we provided a VLC front-end analysis considering AGC model. Based on the model,
some design principles of AGC are theoretically derivated: the effects of AGC
index $m$, AGC maximum gain $g_{max}$ and AGC equilibrium range $DR$. Next, an
analog AGC amplifier was carefully implemented and the effectiveness of our AGC
modeling was proved through BER experiments. Finally, realtime 25Mb/s
on-off-keying (OOK) experiments with AGC function were demonstrated in a
dynamic link with different speeds. Experimental results show that the AGC can
stabilize the BER performance and improve the system performance in the speed
of 1m/s.

tensor-product domain via function evaluations. Combining tensorized Chebyshev
interpolation with a Tucker decomposition of low multilinear rank yields
function approximations that can be computed and stored very efficiently. The
existing Chebfun3 algorithm [Hashemi and Trefethen, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 39
(2017)]uses a similar format but the construction of the approximation proceeds
indirectly, via a so called slice-Tucker decomposition. As a consequence,
Chebfun3 sometimes uses unnecessarily many function evaluations and does not
fully benefit from the potential of the Tucker decomposition to reduce,
sometimes dramatically, the computational cost. We propose a novel algorithm
Chebfun3F that utilizes univariate fibers instead of bivariate slices to
construct the Tucker decomposition. Chebfun3F reduces the cost for the
approximation in terms of the number of function evaluations for nearly all
functions considered, typically by 75%, and sometimes by over 98%.

Array (CTA) to search for thermally produced dark matter at the TeV scale, via
the associated gamma-ray signal from pair-annihilating dark matter particles in
the region around the Galactic centre. We find that CTA will open a new window
of discovery potential, significantly extending the range of robustly testable
models given a standard cuspy profile of the dark matter density distribution.
Importantly, even for a cored profile, the projected sensitivity of CTA will be
sufficient to probe various well-motivated models of thermally produced dark
matter at the TeV scale. This is due to CTA's unprecedented sensitivity,
angular and energy resolutions, and the planned observational strategy. The
survey of the inner Galaxy will cover a much larger region than corresponding
previous observational campaigns with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
CTA will map with unprecedented precision the large-scale diffuse emission in
high-energy gamma rays, constituting a background for dark matter searches for
which we adopt state-of-the-art models based on current data. Throughout our
analysis, we use up-to-date event reconstruction Monte Carlo tools developed by
the CTA consortium, and pay special attention to quantifying the level of
instrumental systematic uncertainties, as well as background template
systematic errors, required to probe thermally produced dark matter at these

free radical theory of ageing even states that damage caused by free radicals
is the main cause of aging on a cellular level. However, free radicals are
small, reactive and short lived and thus challenging to measure. We utilize a
new technique called diamond magnetometry for this purpose. We make use of
nitrogen vacancy centers in nanodiamonds. Via a quantum effect these defects
convert a magnetic resonance signal into an optical signal. While this method
is increasingly popular for its unprecedented sensitivity in physics, we use
this technique here for the first time to measure free radicals in living
cells. Our signals are equivalent to T1 signals in conventional MRI but from
nanoscale voxels from single cells with sub-cellular resolution. With this
powerful tool we are able to follow free radical generation after chemically
inducing stress. In addition, we can observe free radical reduction in presence
of an antioxidant. We were able to clearly differentiate between mutant strains
with altered metabolism. Finally, the excellent stability of our diamond
particles allowed us to follow the ageing process and differentiate between
young and old cells. We could confirm the expected increase of free radical
load in old wild type and sod1{\Delta} mutants. We further applied this new
technique to investigate tor1{\Delta} and pex19{\Delta} cells. For these
mutants an increased lifespan has been reported but the exact mechanism is
unclear. We find a decreased free radical load in, which might offer an
explanation for the increased lifespan in these cells.

prey and its conversion to viable biomass in the simplest classical Gause type
predator-prey model that has equilibrium dynamics without delay. As the delay
increases from zero, the coexistence equilibrium undergoes a supercritical Hopf
bifurcation, two saddle-node bifurcations of limit cycles, and a cascade of
period doublings, eventu1ally leading to chaos. The resulting periodic orbits
and the strange attractor resemble their counterparts for the Mackey-Glass
equation. Due to the global stability of the system without delay, these
complicated dynamics can be solely attributed to the introduction of the delay.
Since many models include predator-prey like interactions as submodels, this
study emphasizes the importance of understanding the implications of
overlooking delay in such models on the reliability of the model-based
predictions, especially since the temperature is known to have an effect on the

sources of different spatial profiles show different fringe patterns. Dividing
by a static fringe flat could hamper the scientific interpretation of sources
whose fringes do not match that of the fringe flat. We find point source
fringes measured by the MIRI Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) to be
reproducible under similar observing conditions. We want, thus, to identify the
variables, if they exist, that would allow for a parametrization of the signal
variations induced by point source fringe modulations. We do this by analyzing
MRS detector plane images acquired on the ground. We extracted the fringe
profile of multiple point source observations and studied the amplitude and
phase of the fringes as a function of field position and pixel sampling of the
point spread function of the optical chain. A systematic variation in the
amplitude and phase of the point source fringes is found over the wavelength
range covered by the test sources (4.9-5.8 $\mu$m). The variation depends on
the fraction of the point spread function seen by the detector pixel. We
identify the non-uniform pixel illumination as the root cause of the reported
systematic variation. We report an improvement after correction of 50% on the
1$\sigma$ standard deviation of the spectral continuum. A 50% improvement is
also reported in line sensitivity for a benchmark test with a spectral
continuum of 100 mJy. The improvement in the shape of weak lines is illustrated
using a T Tauri model spectrum. Consequently, we verify that fringes of
extended sources and potentially semi-extended sources and crowded fields can
be simulated by combining multiple point source fringe transmissions.

the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality and allows two users,
Alice and Bob, to generate a secret key if they observe sufficiently strong
correlations. There is, however, a mismatch between the protocol, in which only
one of Alice's measurements is used to generate the key, and the CHSH
expression, which is symmetric with respect to Alice's two measurements. We
therefore investigate the impact of using an extended family of Bell
expressions where we give different weights to Alice's measurements. Using this
family of asymmetric Bell expressions improves the robustness of the key
distribution protocol for certain experimentally-relevant correlations. As an
example, the tolerable error rate improves from 7.15% to about 7.42% for the
depolarising channel. Adding random noise to Alice's key before the
postprocessing pushes the threshold further to more than 8.34%. The main
technical result of our work is a tight bound on the von Neumann entropy of one
of Alice's measurement outcomes conditioned on a quantum eavesdropper for the

always possible in the self-driving context, and sometimes their annotation is
not feasible. Moreover, in many tasks, there is an intrinsic data imbalance

sign detection is a challenging problem in which these three issues are seen
altogether. To address these challenges, we propose a novel database generation
method that requires only (i) arbitrary natural images, i.e., requires no real
image from the target-domain, and (ii) templates of the traffic signs. The
method does not aim at overcoming the training with real data, but to be a
compatible alternative when the real data is not available. The effortlessly
generated database is shown to be effective for the training of a deep detector
on traffic signs from multiple countries. On large data sets, training with a
fully synthetic data set almost matches the performance of training with a real

multilayer perceptron was trained to predict COR with a root mean squared error

closure of the curve, a condition that can be satisfied without solving the

geometric formalism, and derive a recursion relation that maps control fields
to curvatures for Hamiltonians of arbitrary dimension. We demonstrate examples
by using the geometric method to design dynamically corrected gates for a class
of two-qubit Hamiltonians that is relevant for both superconducting transmon

with wide variations of cardinality. This happens because there can be
considerable similarity between malware samples (some are even said to belong
to the same family), and these tend to appear in bursts. Clustering algorithms
are usually applied to normalised data sets. However, the process of
normalisation aims at setting features with different range values to have a
similar contribution to the clustering. It does not favour more meaningful
features over those that are less meaningful, an effect one should perhaps
expect of the data pre-processing stage.
  In this paper we introduce a method to deal precisely with the problem above.
This is an iterative data pre-processing method capable of aiding to increase
the separation between clusters. It does so by calculating the within-cluster
degree of relevance of each feature, and then it uses these as a data rescaling
factor. By repeating this until convergence our malware data was separated in

find appropriate examples in our example library based on the similarity

sequence prediction in read demands may lead to the performance degradation. In
this paper, a novel enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) LM using the future
vector is proposed. In addition to the given history, the rest of the sequence
will be also embedded by future vectors. This future vector can be incorporated
with the LSTM LM, so it has the ability to model much longer term sequence
level information. Experiments show that, the proposed new LSTM LM gets a
better result on BLEU scores for long term sequence prediction. For the speech
recognition rescoring, although the proposed LSTM LM obtains very slight gains,
the new model seems obtain the great complementary with the conventional LSTM
LM. Rescoring using both the new and conventional LSTM LMs can achieve a very
large improvement on the word error rate.

to implementation on a Parallel Processor (Ncube Machine) as well as a regular
sequential machine. The architecture self organizes its own modules in a way to
maximize performance. Since it is completely parallel, both recall and learning

physics and precision measurement by significantly advancing the sensitivity
achievable in detecting attonewton forces, nanoparticles, magnetic fields, and
gravitational waves. A fundamental limit to sensitivity for these measurements
is energy exchange with the environment as described by the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. While the limiting sensitivity can be
increased by increasing the mass or reducing the damping of the mechanical
sensing element, these design tradeoffs lead to larger detectors or limit the
range of mechanical frequencies that can be measured, excluding the bandwidth
requirements for many real-world applications. We report on a microfabricated
optomechanical sensing platform based on a Fabry-Perot microcavity and show
that when operating as an accelerometer it can achieve nearly ideal broadband
performance at the thermodynamic limit (Brownian motion of the proof mass) with
the highest sensitivity reported to date over a wide frequency range ($314\,nm
\cdot s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ over 6.8 kHz). This approach is applicable to a range
of measurements from pressure and force sensing to seismology and gravimetry,
including searches for new physics such as non-Newtonian gravity or dark
matter.

II false negative conclusions, in the case of networks of coupled oscillators.
We demonstrate that false conclusion probabilities are influenced by local
connectivity measures such as the shortest path length and the detour degree,
which can also be estimated from the inferred network when the true underlying
network is not known a priory. These measures can then be used for
quantification of the confidence level of link conclusions, and for improving
the network reconstruction via advanced concepts of link thresholding.

measures in 88 countries of the word. To conduct the study, data on mobility
patterns, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of people, lockdown
measures, and coronavirus pandemic were collected from multiple sources (e.g.,
Google, UNDP, UN, BBC, Oxford University, Worldometer). A Structural Equation
Modeling (SEM) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects
of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening
effects of mediators. Results show that lockdown measures have significant
effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic
severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to
sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic
and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on
pandemic severity. Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment
in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of
the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., USA, UK, Italy, and Spain). Social distancing
measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic.

  Stations",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Use of aerial base stations (ABSs) is a promising approach to enhance the
agility and flexibility of future wireless networks. ABSs can improve the
coverage and/or capacity of a network by moving supply towards demand.
Deploying ABSs in a network presents several challenges such as finding an
efficient 3D-placement of ABSs that takes network objectives into account.
Another challenge is the limited wireless backhaul capacity of ABSs and
consequently, potentially higher latency incurred. Content caching is proposed
to alleviate the backhaul congestion and decrease the latency. We consider a
limited backhaul capacity for ABSs due to varying position-dependent path loss
values and define two groups of users (delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive) with
different data rate requirements. We study the problem of jointly determining
backhaul-aware 3D placement for ABSs, user-BS associations and corresponding
bandwidth allocations while minimizing total downlink transmit power. Proposed
iterative algorithm applies a decomposition method. First, the 3D locations of
ABSs are found using semi-definite relaxation and coordinate descent methods,
and then user-BS associations and bandwidth allocations are optimized. The
simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and
provide insights about the impact of traffic distribution and content caching
on transmit power and backhaul usage of ABSs.
