photonic technologies by enforcing one-way propagation of light. Most
nonreciprocal devices today are made from a special class of low-loss ferrites
that exhibit a magneto-optical response in the presence of an external static
magnetic field. While breaking transmission symmetry, ferrites fail to satisfy
the need for miniaturization of photonic circuitry due to weak character of
nonreciprocal responses at optical wavelengths and are not easy to integrate
into on-chip photonic systems. These challenges led to the emergence of
magnetic-free approaches relying on breaking time reversal symmetry, e.g. with
nonlinear effects modulating optical system in time. Here, we demonstrate an
all-optical approach to nonreciprocity based on nonlinear valley-selective
response in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This approach overcomes
the limitations of magnetic materials and it does not require an external
magnetic field. We provide experimental evidence of photoinduced nonreciprocity
in a monolayer WS2 pumped by circularly polarized light. Nonreciprocity stems
from valley-selective exciton-exciton interactions, giving rise to nonlinear
circular dichroism controlled by circularly polarized pump fields. Our
experimental results reveal a significant effect even at room temperature,
despite considerable intervalley-scattering, showing potential for practical
applications in magnetic-free nonreciprocal platforms. As an example, we
propose a device scheme to realize an optical isolator based on a pass-through
silicon nitride (SiN) ring resonator integrating the optically biased TMD
monolayer.

diagram that spans the cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus of the Macaque brain,
we provide a mesoscopic-level description of the topological architecture of
one of the most well-studied mammalian connectomes. The robust modules we
identify each comprise densely inter-connected cortical and sub-cortical areas
that play complementary roles in executing specific cognitive functions. We
find that physical proximity between areas is insufficient to explain the
modular organization, as similar mesoscopic structures can be obtained even
after factoring out the effect of distance constraints on the connectivity. We
observe that the distribution profile of brain areas, classified in terms of
their intra- and inter-modular connectivity, is conserved across the principal
cortical subdivisions, as well as, sub-cortical structures. In particular
provincial hubs, which have significantly higher number of connections with
members of their module, but relatively less well-connected to other modules,
are the only class that exhibits homophily, i.e., a discernible preference to
connect to each other. By considering a process of diffusive propagation we
demonstrate that this architecture, instead of localizing the activity,
facilitates rapid communication across the connectome. By supplementing the
topological information about the Macaque connectome with physical locations,
volumes and functions of the constituent areas and analyzing this augmented

properties is attracting deep attention in the last decades, little effort is
made to explore their interactions with other materials. This prevents the
conception of (meta-)structures that can enhance metamaterials' unorthodox
behaviours and that can be employed in real engineering applications. In this
paper, we give a first answer to this challenging problem by showing that the
relaxed micromorphic model with zero static characteristic length can be
usefully applied to describe the refractive properties of simple
meta-structures for extended frequency ranges and for any direction of
propagation of the incident wave. Thanks to the simplified model's structure,
we are able to efficiently explore different configurations and to show that a
given meta-structure can drastically change its overall refractive behaviour
when varying the elastic properties of specific meta-structural elements. In
some cases, changing the stiffness of a homogeneous material which is in
contact with a metamaterial's slab, reverses the structure's refractive
behaviour by switching it from an acoustic screen (total reflection) into an
acoustic absorber (total transmission). The present paper clearly indicates
that, while the study and enhancement of the intrinsic metamaterials'
properties is certainly of great importance, it is even more challenging to
enable the conception of meta-structures that can eventually boost the use of
metamaterials in real-case applications.

graph $G$ the chromatic index of $G$ is equal to its list chromatic index. In
1996 in a seminal paper, Kahn proved that the List Colouring Conjecture holds
asymptotically. Our main result is a local generalization of Kahn's theorem.
More precisely, we show that, for a graph $G$ with sufficiently large maximum
degree $\Delta$ and minimum degree $\delta \geq \ln^{25} \Delta$, the following
holds: for every assignment of lists of colours to the edges of $G$, such that
$|L(e)| \geq (1+o(1)) \cdot \max\left\{\rm{deg}(u),\rm{deg}(v)\right\}$ for
each edge $e=uv$, there is an $L$-edge-colouring of $G$. Furthermore, Kahn
showed that the List Colouring Conjecture holds asymptotically for linear,
$k$-uniform hypergraphs, and recently Molloy generalized Kahn's original result
to correspondence colouring as well as its hypergraph generalization. We prove
local versions of all of these generalizations by showing a weighted version

do not have access to external state. To overcome this limitation, oracles have
been introduced in various forms and for different purposes. However so far
common oracle best practices have not been dissected, classified, and studied
in their fundamental aspects. In this paper, we address this gap by studying
foundational blockchain oracle patterns in two foundational dimensions
characterising the oracles: (i) the data flow direction, i.e., inbound and
outbound data flow, from the viewpoint of the blockchain; and (ii) the
initiator of the data flow, i.e., whether it is push or pull-based

this basis we conduct a quantitative analysis, which results in the insight
that the four different patterns are characterized by distinct performance and

fundamental actions of individuals, and how values, memory, and expectations
affect their behavior. In this paper, our main interest and purpose are to find
out whether these propositions can satisfy our conception of society and
generate essential properties of it computationally. To do so, Based on Homans'
prepositions, we provide the opportunity for each agent to exchange with other
agents. That is, each agent transacts with familiar agents based on his
previous history with them and transacts with newly found agents through
exploration. One novelty of our work is the investigation of implications of
the base theory while covering its flaws with minimal intervention; flaws which
are inevitable in a non-mathematical theory. The importance of our work is that
we have scrutinized the consequences of an actual sociological theory. At the
end of our investigation, we propose another proposition to Homans theory,
which makes the theory more appealing, and we discuss other possible directions

physical coordinate systems for this problem are the ones where the gauge
freedom is completely fixed (like the longitudinal and the uniform curvature
gauges), we propose a novel gauge-invariant strategy for the comparison of
gauge-dependent results. Instead of employing the pivotal variables of a given
coordinate system, the effective anisotropic stress is solely expressed in
terms of the gravitating normal modes of the plasma and in terms of their
conformal time derivatives. The new approach is explicitly gauge-invariant and
when the wavelengths of the normal modes are either shorter or larger than the
sound horizon, the physical limits of the anisotropic stresses are determined
without relying on the specific details of the background evolution. The
relevance of the proposed strategy is discussed in the general situation where
the scalar anisotropic stress and the non-adiabatic pressure fluctuations are

past reinforcements, we construct an analytical condition to determine whether
cooperation can be favored over defection. Intuitively, this condition reveals
why and how the environment can mediate cooperative dilemmas. Under our model
architecture, we also compare this learning mechanism with two non-learning

for cooperation in weak social dilemmas, and, in sharp contrast, hinders
cooperation in strong social dilemmas. Our results suggest that in complex

deeper cosmic volumes than those covered by previous surveys. The Cartesian
power spectrum analysis of anisotropic galaxy clustering based on the Fourier
plane wave basis makes a number of assumptions, including the local
plane-parallel approximation, that will no longer be valid on very large scales
and may degrade cosmological constraints. We propose an approach that utilises
a hybrid basis: on the largest scales, clustering statistics are decomposed
into spherical Fourier modes which respect the natural geometry of both survey
observations and physical effects along the line of sight, such as
redshift-space distortions, the Alcock--Paczy\'nsky and light-cone effects; on
smaller scales with far more clustering modes, we retain the computational
benefit of the power spectrum analysis aided by fast Fourier transforms. This
approach is particularly suited to the likelihood analysis of local primordial
non-Gaussianity $f_\textrm{NL}$ through the scale-dependent halo bias, and we
demonstrate its applicability with $N$-body simulations. We also release our
public code Harmonia (https://github.com/MikeSWang/Harmonia) for galaxy
clustering likelihood inference in spherical Fourier or hybrid-basis analyses.

common across a wide range of industries. This type of retrospective visual
analysis, however, is prone to a variety of selection bias effects, especially
for high-dimensional data where only a subset of dimensions is visualized at
any given time. The risk of selection bias is even higher when analysts
dynamically apply filters or perform grouping operations during ad hoc
analyses. These bias effects threatens the validity and generalizability of
insights discovered during visual analysis as the basis for decision making.
Past work has focused on bias transparency, helping users understand when
selection bias may have occurred. However, countering the effects of selection
bias via bias mitigation is typically left for the user to accomplish as a
separate process. Dynamic reweighting (DR) is a novel computational approach to
selection bias mitigation that helps users craft bias-corrected visualizations.
This paper describes the DR workflow, introduces key DR visualization designs,
and presents statistical methods that support the DR process. Use cases from
the medical domain, as well as findings from domain expert user interviews, are

  Perplexity","25 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.CL cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural text decoding is important for generating high-quality texts using
language models. To generate high-quality text, popular decoding algorithms
like top-k, top-p (nucleus), and temperature-based sampling truncate or distort
the unreliable low probability tail of the language model. Though these methods
generate high-quality text after parameter tuning, they are ad hoc. Not much is
known about the control they provide over the statistics of the output, which
is important since recent reports show text quality is highest for a specific
range of likelihoods. Here, first we provide a theoretical analysis of
perplexity in top-k, top-p, and temperature sampling, finding that
cross-entropy behaves approximately linearly as a function of p in top-p
sampling whereas it is a nonlinear function of k in top-k sampling, under
Zipfian statistics. We use this analysis to design a feedback-based adaptive
top-k text decoding algorithm called mirostat that generates text (of any
length) with a predetermined value of perplexity, and thereby high-quality text
without any tuning. Experiments show that for low values of k and p in top-k
and top-p sampling, perplexity drops significantly with generated text length,
which is also correlated with excessive repetitions in the text (the boredom
trap). On the other hand, for large values of k and p, we find that perplexity
increases with generated text length, which is correlated with incoherence in
the text (confusion trap). Mirostat avoids both traps: experiments show that
cross-entropy has a near-linear relation with repetition in generated text.
This relation is almost independent of the sampling method but slightly
dependent on the model used. Hence, for a given language model, control over
perplexity also gives control over repetitions. Experiments with human raters
for fluency, coherence, and quality further verify our findings.

materials manifests as a non-monotonic behavior in the time-temperature

lattice model, the Arrow-Potts model, to explore the physics behind this
competition. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the model showcases non-monotonic
TTT diagrams resulting in polycrystalline structures, with two distinct regimes
limited by either crystal nucleation or growth. At high temperatures,
crystallization is limited by nucleation and results in the growth of compact
crystal grains. At low temperatures, crystal growth is influenced by glassy
dynamics, and proceeds through dynamically heterogeneous and hierarchical
relaxation pathways producing fractal and ramified crystals. To explain these
phenomena, we combine the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory with the field
theory of nucleation, a random walk theory for crystal growth, and the
dynamical facilitation theory for glassy dynamics. The unified theory yields an
analytical formula relating crystallization timescale to the nucleation and
growth rates through universal exponents governing glassy dynamics of the
model. We show that the formula with the universal exponents yields excellent
agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation data and thus, it also accounts for
the non-monotonic TTT diagrams produced by the model. Both the model and theory
can be used to understand structural ordering in various glassy systems

a period of 0.8246 days and varying amplitudes in all filters, best explained
as a signature of strong magnetic activity and spots. We fit the photometric
amplitudes in $V$, $R_c$, $I_c$ and use them to estimate spot properties, using
a grid-based method that is also propagating uncertainties. We verify the
method on a partial data set with high cadence and all five broad-band filters.
The method yields spot temperatures and fractional spot coverage with typical
uncertainties of 100K and 3-4%, respectively. V1598Cyg consistently exhibits
spots that are a few hundred degrees warmer than the photosphere, most likely
indicating that the light curve is dominated by chromospheric plage. The spot
activity varies over our observing baseline, with a typical time scale of
0.5-1yr, which we interpret as the typical spot lifetime. Combining our light
curve with archival data, we find a six year cycle in the average brightness,

with proportionally more smaller objects as determined by their size
distribution. Most of these objects would be in the horseshoe dynamical state,
which are hard to detect due to their moderate eccentricities (spending most of
their time beyond 5 AU) and longitudes relative to Jupiter being spread nearly
all over the sky. We also show that $\approx$1% of the transient asteroid
co-orbital population is on retrograde orbits with Jupiter. This population,
like the recently identified asteroid (514107) 2015 BZ$_{509}$, can spend
millions of years with $a\simeq a_J$ including tens or hundreds of thousands of
years formally in the retrograde 1:-1 co-orbital resonance. Escaping near-Earth
asteroids (NEAs) are thus likely the precursors to the handful of known
high-inclination objects with $a\simeq a_J$. We compare the production of

find that temporary direct co-orbitals are likely dominated by Centaur capture,
but we only find production of (temporary) retrograde jovian co-orbitals

under-sampled MR images, offering the potential to reduce scan times. Classical
techniques minimize a regularized least-squares cost function using an
expensive iterative optimization procedure. Recently, deep learning models have
been developed that model the iterative nature of classical techniques by
unrolling iterations in a neural network. While exhibiting superior
performance, these methods require large quantities of ground-truth images and
have shown to be non-robust to unseen data. In this paper, we explore a novel
strategy to train an unrolled reconstruction network in an unsupervised fashion
by adopting a loss function widely-used in classical optimization schemes. We
demonstrate that this strategy achieves lower loss and is computationally cheap

that fixing the covariance to a fiducial cosmology can significantly affect the

exhibits a rich phase-diagram, driven partly by the strong interactions
relative to the electronic bandwidth, its single-particle properties are unique
and likely play an important role in some of the phenomenological complexity.
Some of the salient features include an electronic bandwidth smaller than the
characteristic phonon bandwidth and a non-trivial structure of the underlying
Bloch wavefunctions. We perform a theoretical study of the cooperative effects
due to phonons and plasmons on pairing in order to disentangle the distinct
role played by these modes on superconductivity. We consider a variant of MATBG
with an enlarged number of fermion flavors, $N \gg 1$, where the study of
pairing instabilities reduces to the conventional (weak-coupling) Eliashberg
framework. In particular, we show that certain umklapp processes involving
mini-optical phonon modes, which arise physically as a result of the folding of
the original acoustic branch of graphene due to the moir\'e superlattice
structure, contribute significantly towards enhancing pairing. We also
investigate the role played by the dynamics of the screened Coulomb interaction
on pairing, which leads to an enhancement in a narrow window of fillings, and
study the effect of external screening due to a metallic gate on
superconductivity. At strong coupling the dynamical pairing interaction leaves
a spectral mark in the single particle tunneling density of states. We thus
predict such features will appear at specific frequencies of the umklapp

thermal emission spectra of sub-stellar objects. We pursue this using an
adaptation of the HyDRA atmospheric retrieval code. We propose a parametric
pressure-temperature (P-T) profile for brown dwarfs consisting of multiple
atmospheric layers, parameterised by the temperature change across each layer.
This model allows the steep temperature gradient of brown dwarf atmospheres to
be accurately retrieved while avoiding commonly-encountered numerical
artefacts. The P-T model is especially flexible in the photosphere, which can
reach a few tens of bar for T-dwarfs. We demonstrate an approach to include
model uncertainties in the retrieval, focusing on uncertainties introduced by
finite spectral and vertical resolution in the atmospheric model used for
retrieval (~8\% in the present case). We validate our retrieval framework by
applying it to a simulated data set and then apply it to the HST/WFC3 spectrum
of the T-dwarf 2MASS J2339+1352. We retrieve sub-solar abundances of H2O and
CH4 in the object at ~0.1 dex precision. Additionally, we constrain the

explained using momentum conservation for elastic collisions, with the
basketball-floor collision treated as independent from the collision between
the two balls. This textbook explanation is extended to inelastic collisions by
including a coefficient of restitution. This independent contact model (ICM),
as reviewed in this paper, is accurate for a wide variety of cases, even when
the collisions are not truly independent. However, it is easy to explore
situations that are not explained by the ICM, such as swapping the tennis ball
for a ping-pong ball. In this paper, we study the conditions that lead to a
""delayed rebound effect,"" a small first bounce followed by a higher second
bounce, using techniques accessible to an undergraduate student. The dynamical
model is based on the familiar solution of the damped harmonic oscillator. We
focus on making the equations of motion dimensionless for numerical simulation,
and reducing the number of parameters and initial conditions to emphasize
universal behavior. The delayed rebound effect is found for a range of
parameters, most commonly in cases where the first bounce is lower than the ICM
prediction.

Moreover, simulations so far yield values of fesc falling only on the lower end
of the roughly 10-20% range, the amount presumed necessary to reionize the
Universe. Analyzing a high-resolution (4 pc) cosmological radiation
hydrodynamic simulation we study how fesc changes when we include two different
products of binary stellar evolution - stars stripped of their hydrogen
envelopes and massive blue stragglers. Both produce significant amounts of
ionizing photons 10-200 Myr after each starburst. We find the relative
importance of these photons are amplified with respect to escaped ionizing
photons, because peaks in star formation rates (SFRs) and fesc are often out of
phase by this 10-200 Myr. Additionally, low mass, bursty galaxies emit Lyman
continuum radiation primarily from binary products when SFRs are low.
Observations of these galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope could provide
crucial information on the evolution of binary stars as a function of redshift.
Overall, including stripped stars and massive blue stragglers increases our
photon-weighted mean escape fraction by around 13% and 10%, respectively,
resulting in a mean fesc of 17%. Our results emphasize that using updated

parallel to the disk minor axis, and the polarization fraction was derived to

optically thick ($\tau_{\rm abs}\sim7.3$) at the dust trap with the maximum
observable grain size of $\sim100$ $\mu$m rather than an optically thin case

of the $b \to s \ell \ell$ flavour anomalies, it suffers from two conceptual
problems which are often disregarded by model-builders. Firstly, the quantum
numbers of the $S_3$ allow for a renormalisable diquark operator that would
trigger rapid proton decay unless its coupling were tuned away. Secondly, one
expects the leptoquark to have generic couplings to leptons, which require
tuning to avoid stringent experimental bounds on lepton flavour violation. By
gauging a $U(1)$ current that acts as $L_\mu - L_\tau$ on the Standard Model
(SM) fermions, and under which the leptoquark has charge $-1$, one can remedy
both these problems. The additional $U(1)$, which is spontaneously broken at
some high scale, is associated with a massive $Z^\prime$ gauge boson and a
scalar SM singlet $\Phi$, which play no direct role in mediating the anomalous
$B$ meson decays. By computing one- and two-loop mass corrections, we show that
this pair of particles can be hidden away at much higher mass scales without
destabilising either the Higgs or the leptoquark masses. The only low-energy
relic of gauging $L_\mu - L_\tau$ is thus the accidental global symmetry
structure of the lagrangian. On the other hand, we find quite generally that an

hole (BBH) formation through dynamical evolution. Here, we present a fast
semi-analytic approach to simulate hierarchical mergers in nuclear star
clusters (NSCs), globular clusters (GCs) and young star clusters (YSCs).
Hierarchical mergers are more common in NSCs than they are in both GCs and
YSCs, because of the different escape velocity. The mass distribution of
hierarchical BBHs strongly depends on the properties of first-generation BBHs,
such as their progenitor's metallicity. In our fiducial model, we form black
holes (BHs) with masses up to $\sim{}10^3$ M$_\odot$ in NSCs and up to
$\sim{}10^2$ M$_\odot$ in both GCs and YSCs. When escape velocities in excess
of 100 km~s$^{-1}$ are considered, BHs with mass $>10^3$ M$_\odot$ are allowed
to form in NSCs. Hierarchical mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the pair
instability mass gap and intermediate-mass BHs, but only in metal-poor
environments. The local BBH merger rate in our models ranges from $\sim{}10$ to
$\sim{} 60$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$; hierarchical BBHs in NSCs account for
$\sim{}10^{-2}- 0.2$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, with a strong upper limit of
$\sim{}10$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. When comparing our models with the second
gravitational-wave transient catalog, we find that multiple formation channels
are favored to reproduce the observed BBH population.

mergers (BNSMs), and in at least one event we were able to track it down in
multiple wavelengths of light, which allowed us to identify the host galaxy.
Using a catalogue of local galaxies with inferred star formation histories and
adopting a BNSM delay time distribution (DTD) model, we investigate the
dependence of BNSM rate on an array of galaxy properties. Compared to the
intrinsic property distribution of galaxies, that of BNSM host galaxies is
skewed toward galaxies with redder colour, lower specific star formation rate,
higher luminosity, and higher stellar mass, reflecting the tendency of higher
BNSM rates in more massive galaxies. We introduce a formalism to efficiently
make forecast on using host galaxy properties to constrain DTD models. We find
comparable constraints from the dependence of BNSM occurrence distribution on
galaxy colour, specific star formation rate, and stellar mass, all better than
those from dependence on $r$-band luminosity. The tightest constraints come
from using individual star formation histories of host galaxies, which reduces
the uncertainties on DTD parameters by a factor of three or more. Substantially
different DTD models can be differentiated with about 10 BNSM detections. To
constrain DTD parameters at 10\% precision level requires about one hundred
detections, achievable with GW observations on a decade time scale.

predictions for the matter distribution, including potential impacts of
baryonic physics. We constrain the feedback strength of baryons jointly with
cosmology using weak lensing and galaxy clustering observables (3$\times$2pt)
of Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 data in combination with external
information from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Planck cosmic microwave
background polarization. Our baryon modeling is informed by a set of
hydrodynamical simulations that span a variety of baryon scenarios; we span
this space via a Principal Component (PC) analysis of the summary statistics
extracted from these simulations. We show that at the level of DES Y1
constraining power, one PC is sufficient to describe the variation of baryonic
effects in the observables, and the first PC amplitude ($Q_1$) generally
reflects the strength of baryon feedback. With the upper limit of $Q_1$ prior
being bound by the Illustris feedback scenarios, we reach $\sim 20\%$
improvement in the constraint of $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.788^{+0.018}_{-0.021}$ compared to the original DES
3$\times$2pt analysis. This gain is driven by the inclusion of small-scale
cosmic shear information down to 2.5 arcmin, which was excluded in previous DES
analyses that did not model baryonic physics. We obtain
$S_8=0.781^{+0.014}_{-0.015}$ for the combined DES Y1+Planck EE+BAO analysis

Since translation invariance is obscured in the conformal basis, features of

remarkable relations between gauge theory and gravity amplitudes known as the

aspects of the perturbative regime of quantum field theory are expected to
survive a change of basis. Here we show that there exists a well-defined

quantum geometric effects become progressively more important with stronger
pairing attraction, a full understanding of 2D multi-orbital superconductivity
requires the incorporation of preformed pairs. We find it is through the
effective mass of these pairs that quantum geometry enters the theory and this
suggests that the quantum geometric effects are present in the
non-superconducting pseudogap phase as well. Increasing these geometric
contributions tends to raise $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}$ which then competes with
fluctuation effects that generally depress it. We argue that a way to
physically quantify the magnitude of these geometric terms is in terms of the
ratio of the pairing onset temperature $T^*$ to $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}$. Our paper
calls attention to an experimental study demonstrating how both temperatures
and, thus, their ratio may be currently accessible. They can be extracted from
the same voltage-current measurements which are generally used to establish BKT
physics. We use these observations to provide rough preliminary estimates of
the magnitude of the geometric contributions in, for example, magic angle
twisted bilayer graphene.

appropriate pressures and temperatures, while the latter can be fully mitigated

surveys or data loss in measurement processes, which may be more effective than
ignoring them. When the variable represents a count, the literature dealing
with this issue is scarce. Likewise, if problems of over- or under-dispersion
are observed, generalisations of the Poisson distribution are recommended for
carrying out imputation. In order to assess the performance of various
regression models in the imputation of a discrete variable compared to
classical counting models, this work presents a comprehensive simulation study
considering a variety of scenarios and real data. To do so we compared the
results of estimations using only complete data, and using imputations based on
the Poisson, negative binomial, Hermite, and COMPoisson distributions, and the
ZIP and ZINB models for excesses of zeros. The results of this work reveal that
the COMPoisson distribution provides in general better results in any
dispersion scenario, especially when the amount of missing information is
large. When the variable presenting missing values is a count, the most widely
used method is to assume that a classical Poisson model is the best alternative
to impute the missing counts; however, in real-life research this assumption is
not always correct, and it is common to find count variables exhibiting
overdispersion or underdispersion, for which the Poisson model is no longer the
best to use in imputation. In several of the scenarios considered the
performance of the methods analysed differs, something which indicates that it
is important to analyse dispersion and the possible presence of excess zeros
before deciding on the imputation method to use. The COMPoisson model performs
well as it is flexible regarding the handling of counts with characteristics of
over- and under-dispersion, as well as with equidispersion.

as MNIST and CIFAR in the past. In this work, we firstly develop an
architecture and training scheme that allows GCs to operate on a more relevant
level of complexity for practical computer vision, namely the ImageNet
challenge. Secondly, we demonstrate the immense potential of GCs for
trustworthy image classification. Explainability and some aspects of robustness
are vastly improved compared to feed-forward models, even when the GCs are just
applied naively. While not all trustworthiness problems are solved completely,
we observe that GCs are a highly promising basis for further algorithms and
modifications. We release our trained model for download in the hope that it

  Suppression","Accepted for presentation in (and publication in the proceedings of)
  The ASME 2020 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences &
  Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE)",,,,"cs.CE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aperiodic metamaterials represent a class of structural systems that are
composed of different building blocks (cells), instead of a self-repeating
chain of the same unit cells. Optimizing aperiodic cellular structural systems
thus presents high-dimensional problems that are challenging to solve using
purely high-fidelity structural optimization approaches. Specialized analytical
modeling along with metamodel based optimization can provide a more tractable
alternative solution approach. To this end, this paper presents a design
automation framework applied to a 1D metamaterial system, namely a drill
string, where vibration suppression is of utmost importance. The drill string
comprises a set of nonuniform rings attached to the outer surface of a
longitudinal rod. As such, the resultant system can now be perceived as an
aperiodic 1D metamaterial with each ring/gap representing a cell. Despite being
a 1D system, the simultaneous consideration of multiple DoF (i.e., torsional,
axial, and lateral motions) poses significant computational challenges.
Therefore, a transfer matrix method (TMM) is employed to analytically determine
the frequency response of the drill string. A suite of neural networks (ANN) is
trained on TMM samples (which present minute-scale computing costs per
evaluation), to model the frequency response. ANN-based optimization is then
performed to minimize mass subject to constraints on the gap between
consecutive resonance peaks in one case, and minimizing this gap in the second
case, leading to crucial improvements over baselines. Further novel
contribution occurs through the development of an inverse modeling approach
that can instantaneously produce the 1D metamaterial design with minimum mass
for a given desired non-resonant frequency range. This is accomplished by using
invertible neural networks, and results show promising alignment with forward
solutions.

$K$, CEDA's ultimate goal amounts to discover by data's information content via
carrying out two data-driven computational tasks: 1) establish a tree geometry
upon $K$ populations as a platform for discovering a wide spectrum of patterns
among populations; 2) evaluate each geometric pattern's reliability. In CEDA
developments, each population gives rise to a row vector of categories
proportions. Upon the data matrix's row-axis, we discuss the pros and cons of
Euclidean distance against its weighted version for building a binary
clustering tree geometry. The criterion of choice rests on degrees of
uniformness in column-blocks framed by this binary clustering tree. Each
tree-leaf (population) is then encoded with a binary code sequence, so is
tree-based pattern. For evaluating reliability, we adopt row-wise multinomial
randomness to generate an ensemble of matrix mimicries, so an ensemble of
mimicked binary trees. Reliability of any observed pattern is its recurrence
rate within the tree ensemble. A high reliability value means a deterministic
pattern. Our four applications of CEDA illuminate four significant aspects of
extreme-$K$ sample problems.

variables X and Y from a finite sample is often a crucial problem and a
challenging task. However, if we have access to observational and
interventional data, it is possible to solve that task. If X is causing Y, then
it does not matter if we observe an effect in Y by observing changes in X or by
intervening actively on X. This invariance principle creates a link between
observational and interventional distributions in a higher dimensional
probability space. We embed distributions that originate from samples of X and
Y into that higher dimensional space such that the embedded distribution is
closest to the distributions that follow the invariance principle, with respect
to the relative entropy. This allows us to calculate the best
information-theoretic approximation for a given empirical distribution, that
follows an assumed underlying causal model. We show that this
information-theoretic approximation to causal models (IACM) can be done by
solving a linear optimization problem. In particular, by approximating the
empirical distribution to a monotonic causal model, we can calculate
probabilities of causation. We can also use IACM for causal discovery problems
in the bivariate, discrete case. However, experimental results on labeled
synthetic data from additive noise models show that our causal discovery
approach is lagging behind state-of-the-art approaches because the invariance
principle encodes only a necessary condition for causal relations.
Nevertheless, for synthetic multiplicative noise data and real-world data, our
approach can compete in some cases with alternative methods.

consider the shunt elements (e.g., cable capacitances) of the network, which
are not negligible in low voltage networks with underground cables. The greedy
placement scheme is formulated such that it finds the location of minimum
required number of MDs while certain grid observability limits are satisfied.
These limits are defined as the accuracy of state-estimation results in terms
of voltage magnitudes and line currents over all nodes and lines, respectively.
The effectiveness of the proposed placement procedure has been validated on a

order to save time, resulting in an underestimation of the student populations'
transfer ability. The current analysis shows that about half of the students
had frequent brief initial assessment attempts, and significantly lower correct
rates on certain modules, which we think is likely to have originated at least
in part from students adopting a performance-avoidance strategy. We then
divided the remaining population, for which we can be certain that few students
adopted a performance-avoidance strategy, based on whether they interacted with
one of the intervention modules designed to develop basic problem solving
skills, or passed that module on their first attempt without interacting with
the instructional material. By comparing to propensity score matched

subsequent transfer performance observed in a previous study mainly came from

those skills among those who have yet to master it.

microparticles confined into horizontal monolayers in radio-frequency (rf)
plasma sheaths. This gives rise to the so-called plasma wakes beneath the
microparticles. The presence of wakes renders the interactions in such systems
non-reciprocal, a fact that can lead to a quite different behaviour from the
one expected for their reciprocal counterparts. Here we examine the buckling of
a hexagonal 2D plasma crystal, occurring as the confinement strength is
decreased, taking explicitly into account the non-reciprocity of the system via
a well-established point-particle wake model. We observe that for a finite wake
charge, the monolayer hexagonal crystal undergoes a transition first to a
bilayer hexagonal structure, unrealisable in harmonically confined reciprocal
Yukawa systems, and subsequently to a bilayer square structure. Our theoretical
results are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations for experimentally
relevant parameters, indicating the potential of their observation in
state-of-the-art experiments with 2D complex plasmas.

our method extracts the PPG signal's biometric characteristics from its

disentangled representation learning to explicitly learn independent factors in

filtering out of invariant factors while retaining the factors reflected in the
selected preference. Our experimental evaluation over five datasets shows that
the proposed framework can effectively defend against attribute inference

data scarcity in ASR technology development but also essential to many

two research problems. The first problem concerns unsupervised discovery of
basic (subword level) speech units in a given language. Under the zero-resource
condition, the speech units could be inferred only from the acoustic signals,
without requiring or involving any linguistic direction and/or constraints. The
second problem is referred to as unsupervised subword modeling. In its essence
a frame-level feature representation needs to be learned from untranscribed
speech. The learned feature representation is the basis of subword unit
discovery. It is desired to be linguistically discriminative and robust to
non-linguistic factors. Particularly extensive use of cross-lingual knowledge

ingredients for the experimental programs at the next generation of lepton
accelerators. In the context of the hadronic physics program at Jefferson Lab
(JLab), positron beams are complementary, even essential, tools for a precise
understanding of the electromagnetic structure of nucleons and nuclei, in both
the elastic and deep-inelastic regimes. For instance, elastic scattering of
polarized and unpolarized electrons and positrons from the nucleon enables a
model independent determination of its electromagnetic form factors. Also, the
deeply-virtual scattering of polarized and unpolarized electrons and positrons
allows unambiguous separation of the different contributions to the cross
section of the lepto-production of photons and of lepton-pairs, enabling an
accurate determination of the nucleons and nuclei generalized parton
distributions, and providing an access to the gravitational form factors.
Furthermore, positron beams offer the possibility of alternative tests of the
Standard Model of particle physics through the search of a dark photon, the
precise measurement of electroweak couplings, and the investigation of charged
lepton flavor violation. This document discusses the perspectives of an
experimental program with high duty-cycle positron beams at JLab.

equilibrium (i.e. there are large initial contributions from the shear stress
tensor and bulk pressure) but it is expected that on very short time scales the
dynamics converge to a universal attractor that defines hydrodynamic behavior.
Thus far, studies of this nature have only considered an idealized situation at
LHC energies (high temperatures $T$ and vanishing baryon chemical potential
$\mu_B=0$) but, in this work, we investigate for the first time how
far-from-equilibrium effects may influence experimentally driven searches for
the Quantum Chromodynamic critical point at RHIC. We find that the path to the
critical point is heavily influenced by far from equilibrium initial conditions
where viscous effects lead to dramatically different $\left\{T,\mu_B\right\}$
trajectories through the QCD phase diagram. We compare hydrodynamic equations
of motion with shear and bulk coupled together at finite $\mu_B$ for both DNMR
and phenomenological Israel-Stewart equations of motion and discuss their
influence on potential attractors at finite $\mu_B$ and their corresponding
$\left\{T,\mu_B\right\}$ trajectories.

(MDL) algorithm to expand the database for better relation extraction.
Different from other previous relation extraction researches, our method
improves system performance by expanding data. The goal of database expansion,
together with a robust deep learning classifier, is to diminish wrong labels
due to the incomplete or not found nature of relation instances in the relation
database (e.g., Freebase). The study uses a deep learning method (Piecewise
Convolutional Neural Network or PCNN) as the base classifier of our proposed
approach: the leveled adversarial attention neural networks (LATTADV-ATT). In
the database expansion process, the semantic entity identification is used to
enlarge new instances using the most similar itemsets of the most common
patterns of the data to get its pairs of entities. About the deep learning
method, the use of attention of selective sentences in PCNN can reduce noisy
sentences. Also, the use of adversarial perturbation training is useful to
improve the robustness of system performance. The performance even further is
improved using a combination of leveled strategy and database expansion. There
are two issues: 1) database expansion method: rule generation by allowing step
sizes on selected strong semantic of most similar itemsets with aims to find
entity pair for generating instances, 2) a better classifier model for relation
extraction. Experimental result has shown that the use of the database
expansion is beneficial. The MDL database expansion helps improvements in all
methods compared to the unexpanded method. The LATTADV-ATT performs as a good
classifier with high precision P@100=0.842 (at no expansion). It is even better
while implemented on the expansion data with P@100=0.891 (at expansion factor
k=7).

DeForest","Cross Sections of Coronal Loop Flux Tubes","27 pages, 9 figures, accepted by Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Coronal loops reveal crucial information about the nature of both coronal
magnetic fields and coronal heating. The shape of the corresponding flux tube
cross section and how it varies with position are especially important
properties. They are a direct indication of the expansion of the field and of
the cross-field spatial distribution of the heating. We have studied 20 loops
using high spatial resolution observations from the first flight of the Hi-C
rocket experiment, measuring the intensity and width as a function of position
along the loop axis. We find that intensity and width tend to either be
uncorrelated or to have a direct dependence, such that they increase or
decrease together. This implies that the flux tube cross sections are
approximately circular under the assumptions that the tubes have non-negligible
twist and that the plasma emissivity is approximately uniform along the
magnetic field. The shape need not be a perfect circle and the emissivity need
not be uniform within the cross section, but sub-resolution patches of emission
must be distributed quasi-uniformly within an envelope that has an aspect ratio
of order unity. This raises questions about the suggestion that flux tubes
expand with height, but primarily in the line-of-sight direction so that the
corresponding (relatively noticeable) loops appear to have roughly uniform
width, a long-standing puzzle. It also casts doubt on the idea that most loops
correspond to simple warped sheets, although we leave open the possibility of
more complex manifold structures.

statistical literature in recent years because of their flexibility in handling
longitudinal studies, including human immunodeficiency virus viral dynamics,
pharmacokinetic analyses, and studies of growth and decay. A standard
assumption in nonlinear mixed effects models for continuous responses is that
the random effects and the within-subject errors are normally distributed,
making the model sensitive to outliers. We present a novel class of asymmetric
nonlinear mixed effects models that provides efficient parameters estimation in
the analysis of longitudinal data. We assume that, marginally, the random
effects follow a multivariate scale mixtures of skew--normal distribution and
that the random errors follow a symmetric scale mixtures of normal
distribution, providing an appealing robust alternative to the usual normal
distribution. We propose an approximate method for maximum likelihood
estimation based on an EM-type algorithm that produces approximate maximum
likelihood estimates and significantly reduces the numerical difficulties
associated with the exact maximum likelihood estimation. Techniques for
prediction of future responses under this class of distributions are also
briefly discussed. The methodology is illustrated through an application to
Theophylline kinetics data and through some simulating studies.

problems at stake correspond to robust $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ and
$\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ in the face of non-parametric ""channel-model""
uncertainty and to a nominal $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ estimation problem. The
estimators considered here are defined by minimizing the worst-case squared
estimation error over the ""uncertainty set"" and by minimizing an average cost
under the constraint that the worst-case error of any admissible estimator does
not exceed a prescribed value. The main point is to explore the derivation of
estimators which may be viewed as less conservative alternatives to minimax
estimators, or in other words, that allow for trade-offs between worst-case
performance and better performance over ""large"" subsets of the uncertainty set.
The ""average costs"" over $\mathcal{H}_{2}-$signal balls are obtained as limits
of averages over sets of finite impulse responses, as their length grows
unbounded. The estimator design problems for the two types of estimators and
the three problems addressed here are recast as semi-definite programming
problems (SDPs, for short). These SDPs are solved in the case of simple
examples to illustrate the potential of the ""average cost/worst-case

but can also provide a fundamental measurement in Galactic dynamics. Over about
ten year baselines, the expected change in the line-of-sight velocity due to
the Galaxy's gravitational field for stars at $\sim$ kpc scale distances above
the Galactic mid-plane is $\sim$ few - 10 cm/s, and may be detectable by the
current generation of high precision spectrographs. Here, we provide
theoretical expectations for this measurement based on both static models of
the Milky Way and isolated Milky Way simulations, as well from controlled
dynamical simulations of the Milky Way interacting with dwarf galaxies. We
simulate a population synthesis model to analyze the contribution of planets
and binaries to the Galactic acceleration signal. We find that while low-mass,
long-period planetary companions are a contaminant to the Galactic acceleration
signal, their contribution is very small. Our analysis of $\sim$ ten years of
data from the LCES HIRES/Keck precision radial velocity (RV) survey shows that
slopes of the RV curves of standard RV stars agree with expectations of the
local Galactic acceleration near the Sun within the errors, and that the error
in the slope scales inversely as the square root of the number of observations.
Thus, we demonstrate that a survey of stars with low intrinsic stellar jitter
at kpc distances above the Galactic mid-plane for realistic sample sizes can
enable a direct determination of the dark matter density.

two key features: low-frequency emission (< 200 Hz) emanates from the gain
layer as a result of neutrino-driven convection and the SASI and high-frequency
emission (> 600 Hz) emanates from the proto-neutron star due to Ledoux
convection within it. The high-frequency emission dominates the gravitational
wave emission in our model and emanates largely from the convective layer
itself, not from the convectively stable layer above it, due to convective
overshoot. Moreover, the low-frequency emission emanates from the gain layer
itself, not from the proto-neutron star, due to accretion onto it. We provide
evidence of the SASI in our model and demonstrate that the peak of our
low-frequency gravitational wave emission spectrum corresponds to it. Given its

recommendation regarding the issue: social contact variants and social groups
of interest. The user data is varied and used as a source of associations. The
adoption of social contact variants has two approaches. The first social
variant is User-centered Knowledge, to contrast Collective Knowledge. It
improves tag recommendation by grouping historic tag data according to friend
relationships and interests. The second variant is dubbed 'social batched
personomy' and attempts to address both quality and scalability issues by
processing queries in batches instead of individually, such as done in a
conventional personomy approach. For the social group of interest, 'community
batched personomy' is proposed to provide better accuracy groups of
recommendation systems in contrast also to Collective Knowledge. By taking

services, wherein it is critical to obtain accurate position estimates by
aggregating information from individual sensors. In the recently proposed
narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) standard, which trades off bandwidth to gain wide
coverage, the location estimation is compounded by the low sampling rate
receivers and limited-capacity links. We address both of these NB-IoT drawbacks
in the framework of passive sensing devices that receive signals from the
target-of-interest. We consider the limiting case where each node receiver
employs one-bit analog-to-digital-converters and propose a novel low-complexity
nodal delay estimation method using constrained-weighted least squares
minimization. To support the low-capacity links to the fusion center (FC), the
range estimates obtained at individual sensors are then converted to one-bit
data. At the FC, we propose target localization with the aggregated one-bit
range vector using both optimal and sub-optimal techniques. The computationally
expensive former approach is based on Lasserre's method for multivariate
polynomial optimization while the latter employs our less complex iterative
joint r\textit{an}ge-\textit{tar}get location \textit{es}timation (ANTARES)
algorithm. Our overall one-bit framework not only complements the low NB-IoT
bandwidth but also supports the design goal of inexpensive NB-IoT location
sensing. Numerical experiments demonstrate feasibility of the proposed one-bit
approach with a $0.6$\% increase in the normalized localization error for the
small set of $20$-$60$ nodes over the full-precision case. When the number of
nodes is sufficiently large ($>80$), the one-bit methods yield the same

outliers due to wrong data association, or to incorrect detections from signal

formulations for outlier-robust estimation, Generalized Maximum Consensus
(G-MC) and Generalized Truncated Least Squares (G-TLS), and investigates
fundamental limits, practical algorithms, and applications. Our first
contribution is a proof that outlier-robust estimation is inapproximable: in
the worst case, it is impossible to (even approximately) find the set of
outliers, even with slower-than-polynomial-time algorithms (particularly,
algorithms running in quasi-polynomial time). As a second contribution, we
review and extend two general-purpose algorithms. The first, Adaptive Trimming
(ADAPT), is combinatorial, and is suitable for G-MC; the second, Graduated
Non-Convexity (GNC), is based on homotopy methods, and is suitable for G-TLS.
We extend ADAPT and GNC to the case where the user does not have prior
knowledge of the inlier-noise statistics (or the statistics may vary over time)
and is unable to guess a reasonable threshold to separate inliers from outliers
(as the one commonly used in RANSAC). We propose the first minimally tuned
algorithms for outlier rejection, that dynamically decide how to separate
inliers from outliers. Our third contribution is an evaluation of the proposed

detection (shape alignment), and pose graph optimization. ADAPT and GNC execute
in real-time, are deterministic, outperform RANSAC, and are robust up to 80-90%

enhancement is accomplished through accurate statistical characterization of

The key result of the work is that the environmental covariance matrix
estimation and manipulation at the heart of the statistical analysis actually
enables a highly efficient quantum implementation. The algorithm is inspired by
recent approaches to quantum machine learning, but requires significant
extensions, including previously overlooked `quantum analog--digital'

presence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose
an insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for
providing flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market
opportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable
penetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,
including renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next
operating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be
unable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a
penalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract
between a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves
some energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a
contract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing
renewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra
source of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely
arbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this
contract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis
through two case studies.

enormous size, consisting of millions or even billions of pixels. Typical
solutions include dividing input images into patches of fixed size and/or
down-sampling to meet memory constraints. Such operations incur information
loss in the field-of-view (FoV) i.e., spatial coverage and the image
resolution. The impact on segmentation performance is, however, as yet
understudied. In this work, we start with a motivational experiment which
demonstrates that the trade-off between FoV and resolution affects the
segmentation performance on ultra-high resolution images---and furthermore, its
influence also varies spatially according to the local patterns in different
areas. We then introduce foveation module, a learnable ""dataloader"" which, for
a given ultra-high resolution image, adaptively chooses the appropriate
configuration (FoV/resolution trade-off) of the input patch to feed to the
downstream segmentation model at each spatial location of the image. The
foveation module is jointly trained with the segmentation network to maximise
the task performance. We demonstrate on three publicly available
high-resolution image datasets that the foveation module consistently improves
segmentation performance over the cases trained with patches of fixed
FoV/resolution trade-off. Our approach achieves the SoTA performance on the
DeepGlobe aerial image dataset. On the Gleason2019 histopathology dataset, our
model achieves better segmentation accuracy for the two most clinically
important and ambiguous classes (Gleason Grade 3 and 4) than the top performers

presents an extensive benchmarking of global policies for long-term contingent

standard options) and with the presence of jump risk for equity. Monte Carlo
experiments demonstrate the vast superiority of non-quadratic global hedging as
it results simultaneously in downside risk metrics two to three times smaller

neural networks are able to effectively adapt their hedging decisions to
different penalties and stylized facts of risky asset dynamics only by
experiencing simulations of the financial market exhibiting these features.
Numerical results also indicate that non-quadratic global policies are
significantly more geared towards being long equity risk which entails earning

towards false positive identification, which counters the existing bias towards
false negatives. The proposed mechanism has two complementary implementations:
(a) ""explicit"" steering of the model to attend to a larger Effective Receptive
Field on the foreground areas; (b) ""implicit"" steering towards false positives,
by attending to a smaller Effective Receptive Field on the background areas. We
validated our methods on three tasks: 1) binary dense prediction between
vehicles and the background using CityScapes; 2) Enhanced Tumour Core
segmentation with multi-modal MRI scans in BRATS2018; 3) segmenting stroke
lesions using ultrasound images in ISLES2018. We compared our methods with
state-of-the-art attention mechanisms in medical imaging, including
self-attention, spatial-attention and spatial-channel mixed attention. Across
all of the three different tasks, our models consistently outperform the
baseline models in Intersection over Union (IoU) and/or Hausdorff Distance

mechanism reduces the HD of the best baseline by more than $26\%$, whilst
improving the IoU by more than $3\%$. We believe our proposed attention

faces of the force diagram represent the magnitude of the internal and external
forces in the system. For the first time, the methods of this research allow
the user to control and constrain the areas and edge lengths of the faces of
general polyhedrons that can be convex, self-intersecting, or concave. As a
result, a designer can explicitly control the force magnitudes in the force
diagram and explore the equilibrium of a variety of compression and
tension-combined funicular structural forms. In this method, a quadratic

galaxies by foreground galaxies through the analysis of the cross-correlation
function was recently demonstrated as an interesting independent alternative to
the weak-lensing shear as a cosmological probe. In the case of the proposed
observable, most of the cosmological constraints mainly depend on the largest
angular separation measurements. Therefore, we aim to study and correct the
main large-scale biases that affect foreground and background galaxy samples to
produce a robust estimation of the cross-correlation function. Then we analyse
the corrected signal to derive updated cosmological constraintsWe measured the
large-scale, bias-corrected cross-correlation functions using a background
sample of H-ATLAS galaxies with photometric redshifts > 1.2 and two different
foreground samples (GAMA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts or SDSS galaxies
with photometric ones, both in the range 0.2 < z < 0.8). These measurements are
modelled using the traditional halo model description that depends on both halo
occupation distribution and cosmological parameters. We then estimated these
parameters by performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo under multiple scenarios to
study the performance of this observable and how to improve its results. After
the large-scale bias corrections, we obtain only minor improvements with
respect to the previous magnification bias results, mainly confirming their
conclusions: a lower bound on $\Omega_m > 0.22$ at $95\%$ C.L. and an upper
bound $\sigma_8 < 0.97$ at $95\%$ C.L. (results from the $z_{spec}$ sample).
However, by combining both foreground samples into a simplified tomographic
analysis, we were able to obtain interesting constraints on the
$\Omega_m$-$\sigma_8$ plane as follows: $\Omega_m= 0.50_{- 0.20}^{+ 0.14}$ and
$\sigma_8= 0.75_{- 0.10}^{+ 0.07}$ at 68\% CL.

sets, a type of model with unordered rules, which explains each prediction with
a single rule. In order to be easy for humans to understand, these rules must
be concise. Earlier work on generating optimal decision sets first minimizes
the number of rules, and then minimizes the number of literals, but the

parity-time symmetry through tailored balanced gain and loss, introduced in the
form of complex stiffnesses and may be implemented through piezoelectric
transducers. Breaking of this symmetry caused by external perturbations leads
to a splitting of the eigenvalues, which is explored as a sentitive approach to
detection of such perturbations. Numerical simulations on one-dimensional
waveguides illustrate the presence of several exceptional points in their
vibrational spectrum, and conceptually demonstrate their sensitivity to point
mass inclusions. Second order exceptional points are shown to exhibit a
frequency shift in the spectrum with a square root dependence on the perturbed
mass, which is confirmed by a perturbation approach and by frequency response
predictions. Elastic domains supporting guided waves are then investigated,
where exceptional points are formed by the hybridization of Lamb wave modes.
After illustrating a similar sensitivity to point mass inclusions, we also show
how these concepts can be applied to surface wave modes for sensing crack-type
defects. The presented results describe fundamental vibrational properties of
PT-symmetric elastic media supporting exceptional points, whose sensitivity to
perturbations goes beyond the linear dependency commonly encountered in
Hermitian systems. The findings are thus promising for applications involving
sensing of perturbations such as added masses, stiffness discontinuities and

problem is studied for a networked control system (NCS) which consists of

Due to the unreliable uplink channels, the remote controller can only access
unreliable state information of all subsystems, while the downlink channels
from the remote controller to the local controllers are perfect. The
difficulties of the LQ control problem for such a system arise from the
different information structures of the local controllers and the remote

sufficient solvability conditions are derived, which are based on the solution
to a group of forward and backward difference equations (G-FBSDEs).
Furthermore, by proposing a new method to decouple the G-FBSDEs and introducing
new coupled Riccati equations (CREs), the optimal control strategies are
derived where we verify that the separation principle holds for the
multiplicative noise NCSs with packet dropouts. This paper can be seen as an
important contribution to the optimal control problem with asymmetric

uses a structured regularization term to incorporate upper-level forecasts into

exclusions i.e. ""voids"" that are subject to homogenous (Neumann or Dirichlet)
boundary conditions. Making use of the Bloch wave expansion, we pursue this
goal via asymptotic ansatz featuring the ""spectral distance"" from a given
wavenumber-eigenfrequency pair (within the first Brillouin zone) as the
perturbation parameter. We then introduce the effective wave motion via
projection(s) of the scalar wavefield onto the Bloch eigenfunction(s) for the
unit cell of periodicity, evaluated at the origin of a spectral neighborhood.
For generality, we account for the presence of the source term in the wave
equation and we consider -- at a given wavenumber -- generic cases of isolated,
repeated, and nearby eigenvalues. In this way we obtain a palette of effective
models, featuring both wave- and Dirac-type behaviors, whose applicability is
controlled by the local band structure and eigenfunction basis. In all spectral
regimes, we pursue the homogenized description up to at least first order of
expansion, featuring asymptotic corrections of the homogenized Bloch-wave
operator and the homogenized source term. Inherently, such framework provides a
convenient platform for the synthesis of a wide range of wave phenomena in
metamaterials and phononic crystals. The proposed homogenization framework is
illustrated by approximating asymptotically the dispersion relationships for

viewpoint of the Rabi oscillation. Within the mean-field approximation, we
simulate real-time dynamics of an excitonic insulator with a direct gap, where
the pair condensation in the initial state is of BEC nature and the
photoexcitation is introduced by electric dipole transitions. We first discuss
that in the atomic limit our model is reduced to a two-level system that
undergoes the Rabi oscillation, so that for single cycle pulses physical
quantities after the photoirradiation are essentially determined by the ratio
of the Rabi frequency to the pump-light frequency. Then, it is shown that this
picture holds even in the case of nonzero transfer integrals where each
one-particle state exhibits the Rabi oscillation leading to the enhancement of
the excitonic order. We demonstrate that effects of electron-phonon
interactions do not alter the results qualitatively. We also examine many-body
dynamics by the exact diagonalization method on small clusters, which strongly
suggests that our mechanism for the enhancement of the exctionic order survives

separated by the opened gap at CNP due to the symmetry breaking in $\hat{H}^0$.
We find that the broken $C_2$ symmetry in $\hat{H}^0$ mainly originates from
the intralayer inversion-asymmetric structural deformation in the graphene
layer adjacent to BN, which introduces spatially non-uniform modifications of
the intralayer Hamiltonian. The gapped flat bands have finite Chern numbers.
For TBG/BN with the magic twist angle, the SCHF ground states with $|\nu|$ =
1-3 are all insulating with narrow MF gaps. When the flat conduction bands are
filled, the gap at $\nu$ = 1 is smaller than that at $\nu$ = 3, suggesting that
the nontrivial topological properties associated with the flat Chern bands are
more likely to be observed at $\nu = 3$. This is similar for negative $\nu$

investigated for an idealized, simple anguilliform swimming model in 2D. The
swimmer considered here propagates forward by dynamically varying its body
curvature, similar to motion of a \textit{C. elegan}. The parameter
sensitivities were explored with respect to the fluid scale (Reynolds number,
Re), stroke (undulation) frequency, as well as a kinematic parameter
controlling the velocity and acceleration of each upstroke and downstroke. In
total, 5000 fluid-structure interaction simulations were performed, each with a
unique parameter combination selected via a Sobol sequence. Thus, global
sensitivity analysis was performed using Sobol sensitivity analysis. Results
indicate that the swimmer's performance is most sensitive to variation in its
stroke frequency. Trends in swimming performance were discovered by projecting
the performance metrics from the overall 3D parameter space onto particular 2D
subspaces and Pareto-like optimal fronts were identified for swimming
efficiency. This work is a natural extension of the parameter explorations of

time, e.g., one year, mortality is typically a rare event. When we examine the
outcome of dying or not from such portfolios, we have an imbalanced binary
response. The popular logistic and probit regression models can be
inappropriate for imbalanced binary response as model estimates may be biased,
and if not addressed properly, it can lead to serious adverse predictions. In
this paper, we propose the use of skewed link regression models (Generalized
Extreme Value, Weibull, and Fre\`chet link models) as more superior models to
handle imbalanced binary response. We adopt a fully Bayesian approach for the
generalized linear models (GLMs) under the proposed link functions to help
better explain the high skewness. To calibrate our proposed Bayesian models, we
use a real dataset of death claims experience drawn from a life insurance
company's portfolio. Bayesian estimates of parameters were obtained using the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and for Bayesian model selection and comparison,
the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) statistic has been used. For our
mortality dataset, we find that these skewed link models are more superior than
the widely used binary models with standard link functions. We evaluate the
predictive power of the different underlying models by measuring and comparing
aggregated death counts and death benefits.

important applications in photonics. A periodic structure sandwiched between
two homogeneous media is the most popular platform for observing BICs and
realizing their applications. Existing studies on BICs assume the periodic
structure has a $C_2$ rotational symmetry about the axis perpendicular to the
periodic layer. It is known that all BICs turn to resonant states with finite
quality factors if the periodic structure is perturbed by a generic
perturbation breaking the $C_2$ symmetry, and a typical BIC continues to exist
if the perturbation keeps the $C_2$ symmetry. We study how typical BICs depend
on generic structural parameters. For a class of BICs with one opening
radiation channel, we show that in the plane of two generic parameters, the
BICs exist continuously as a curve. Consequently, BICs can exist on periodic
structures without the $C_2$ symmetry, and they can be found by tuning a single
structural parameter. The result is established analytically by a perturbation
theory with two independent perturbations and validated by numerical examples.
Our study reveals a much larger family for BICs on periodic structures, and
provides new opportunities for future applications.

discrete time, along multiple independent trajectories. We introduce a
nonparametric inference approach to this inverse problem, based on a
regularized maximum likelihood estimator constrained to suitable hypothesis
spaces adaptive to data. We show that a coercivity condition enables us to
control the condition number of this problem and prove the consistency of our
estimator, and that in fact it converges at a near-optimal learning rate, equal
to the min-max rate of $1$-dimensional non-parametric regression. In
particular, this rate is independent of the dimension of the state space, which
is typically very high. We also analyze the discretization errors in the case
of discrete-time observations, showing that it is of order $1/2$ in terms of
the time gaps between observations. This term, when large, dominates the
sampling error and the approximation error, preventing convergence of the
estimator. Finally, we exhibit an efficient parallel algorithm to construct the
estimator from data, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm with
numerical tests on prototype systems including stochastic opinion dynamics and
a Lennard-Jones model.

labeling. However, labeled data may only be available abundantly in a domain
different from the desired target domain, which only has minimal or no
annotations. In this work, we propose a novel framework for domain adaptation
in semantic segmentation with image-level weak labels in the target domain. The
weak labels may be obtained based on a model prediction for unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA), or from a human annotator in a new weakly-supervised domain
adaptation (WDA) paradigm for semantic segmentation. Using weak labels is both
practical and useful, since (i) collecting image-level target annotations is
comparably cheap in WDA and incurs no cost in UDA, and (ii) it opens the
opportunity for category-wise domain alignment. Our framework uses weak labels
to enable the interplay between feature alignment and pseudo-labeling,
improving both in the process of domain adaptation. Specifically, we develop a
weak-label classification module to enforce the network to attend to certain
categories, and then use such training signals to guide the proposed
category-wise alignment method. In experiments, we show considerable
improvements with respect to the existing state-of-the-arts in UDA and present

We study multiple collisions of two spherical concentric shells in a
gravitationally bound system and calculate the center of mass energy between
the shells. We solve the equation of motions for two shells without imposing
any fine tuning of the initial parameters. In this bound system, the shells
collide many times and these motions are highly nontrivial due to chaotic
behavior of the shells. Consequently, the center of mass energy for each
collision varies nontrivially and even reach almost its theoretical upper
limit. We confirm that a significant proportion of the theoretical limit is
automatically achieved during multiple collisions without fine tuning. At the
same time, we also study shell ejection from the system after some collisions.
If the initial shell's energy is large enough, multiple collisions may cause
one shell to accumulate energy so that it escapes to infinity, even though two
shells are initially confined in the system. The ejection is caused by multiple
collisions inducing nontrivial energy transfer between the shells. The relation
between the maximum center of mass energy and the energy transfer causing the
shell ejection is also discussed.

we may raise early warning signals of outbreaks by detecting signs of changes

idea is to employ a new information-theoretic notion, which we call the
differential minimum description length change statistics (D-MDL), for
measuring the scores of change sign. We first give a fundamental theory for
D-MDL. We then demonstrate its effectiveness using synthetic datasets. We apply
it to detecting early warning signals of the COVID-19 epidemic. We empirically
demonstrate that D-MDL is able to raise early warning signals of events such as
significant increase/decrease of cases. Remarkably, for about $64\%$ of the
events of significant increase of cases in 37 studied countries, our method can
detect warning signals as early as nearly six days on average before the
events, buying considerably long time for making responses. We further relate
the warning signals to the basic reproduction number $R0$ and the timing of
social distancing. The results showed that our method can effectively monitor
the dynamics of $R0$, and confirmed the effectiveness of social distancing at
containing the epidemic in a region. We conclude that our method is a promising

Specifically, we consider here a hidden sector consisting of a light `dark

$U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. These self-interacting dark sector particles can also
interact with ordinary matter via the kinetic mixing interaction, and lead to a
signal in dark matter direct detection experiments. Indeed, keV electron
recoils can arise quite naturally in such models from dark electron scattering
off loosely bound atomic electrons. Here we examine the recently reported
XENON1T excess in the context of such a plasma dark matter model. We find that
the observed excess can be explained if kinetic mixing is in the approximate
range: $10^{-12} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 10^{-10}$. The allowed parameter
space is consistent with astrophysical and cosmological constraints and
consistent also with other direct detection experiments.

linear programming (MILP) solvers. These implementations of branch-and-bound
typically use variable branching, that is, the child nodes are obtained by
fixing some variable to an integer value $v$ in one node and to $v + 1$ in the
other node. Even though modern MILP solvers are able to solve very large-scale
instances efficiently, relatively little attention has been given to
understanding why the underlying branch-and-bound algorithm performs so well.
In this paper our goal is to theoretically analyze the performance of the
standard variable branching based branch-and-bound algorithm. In order to avoid
the exponential worst-case lower bounds, we follow the common idea of
considering random instances. More precisely, we consider random integer
programs where the entries of the coefficient matrix and the objective function
are randomly sampled.
  Our main result is that with good probability branch-and-bound with variable
branching explores only a polynomial number of nodes to solve these instances,
for a fixed number of constraints. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first known such result for a standard version of branch-and-bound. We believe
that this result provides a compelling indication of why branch-and-bound with
variable branching works so well in practice.

The clients train locally and communicate the models they learn to the server;
aggregation of local models requires frequent communication of large amounts of
information between the clients and the central server. We propose a novel,
simple and efficient way of updating the central model in
communication-constrained settings based on collecting models from clients with
informative updates and estimating local updates that were not communicated. In
particular, modeling the progression of model's weights by an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process allows us to derive an optimal sampling strategy for
selecting a subset of clients with significant weight updates. The central
server collects updated local models from only the selected clients and
combines them with estimated model updates of the clients that were not
selected for communication. We test this policy on a synthetic dataset for
logistic regression and two FL benchmarks, namely, a classification task on
EMNIST and a realistic language modeling task using the Shakespeare dataset.
The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant
reduction in communication while maintaining competitive or achieving superior
performance compared to a baseline. Our method represents a new line of
strategies for communication-efficient FL that is orthogonal to the existing
user-local methods such as quantization or sparsification, thus complementing

velocity, describing the turbulent viscosity should be smaller than 0.04 in the
circumnuclear disk, to prevent the destruction of the aggregates due to

$\tau_{GI} \simeq$ 70-80 Myr for $\alpha = 0.01-0.04$ and $M_{BH} = 10^6

high-dimensional data such as wideband signals. To overcome these challenges,
this paper focuses on the reconstruction of the third-order cumulants under the

conditions for lossless third-order statistics reconstruction via solving
simple least-squares, along with the strongest achievable compression ratio. To
reduce the computational burden, we also propose an approach to recover
diagonal cumulant slices directly from compressive measurements, which is
useful when the cumulant slices are sufficient for the inference task at hand.
All the proposed techniques are tested via extensive simulations. The developed
joint sampling and reconstruction approach to third-order statistics estimation
is able to reduce the required sampling rates significantly by exploiting the
cumulant structure resulting from signal stationarity, even in the absence of
any sparsity constraints on the signal or cumulants.

can be helpful for them in making more informed travel decisions. To achieve
this goal, travel time prediction models have been proposed in literature, but
identification of important predictors has not received much attention.
Identification of important predictors reduces dimensions of input data, which
not only lessens computational load, but also provides better understanding of
underlying relationship between important predictors and travel time. Moreover,
collection of only important predictors can lead to a significant equipment
savings in data collection. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid approach
for feature selection (identifying important predictors) along with developing
a robust freeway travel time prediction model. A framework integrating
biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and support vector regression (SVR) has
been developed. It was validated by predicting travel time at 36.1 km long

to develop a prediction model with only six predictors, which is found to have
accuracy equivalent to a stand-alone SVR prediction model developed with all

We assume the dark energy is the residual cosmological constant. The most
important channel in the reheating process is the gluon pair productions by QCD
trace anomaly. We argue dark energy decays rapidly by gluon pair emissions
during the reheating and after the big bang. The reheating temperature is
determined by the decay width of dark energy Gamma and the Planck mass M_p as
sqrt{M_P Gamma} ~ 10^6GeV. It is the consequence of Friedmann's equation and an
equilibrium condition Gamma~ H. As the Universe cools below the hadronic scale,
dark energy density is almost frozen. Nevertheless the dark energy further
decreases by emitting two photons. We have estimated the current decay rate of
dark energy from the QED trace anomaly. The consistent solution of Friedmann
equation is in an excellent agreement with the observations. The suppression
factor of dark energy scale is the product of fine structure constant alpha and
curvature perturbation P as 10^{-30}=(\alpha^2P/4\pi)^2. We argue the conformal
symmetry breaking in the both UV and IR are necessary unless dark energy is
subtracted. We also investigated lepto-genesis by adding massive right handed
neutrinos. The realistic lepto-genesis takes place during reheating process.

in-memory and on-disk footprints of large-scale data. Usual solutions are
designed broadly along two themes: reducing data precision, e.g., through
compression, or adapting data resolution, e.g., using spatial hierarchies.
Recent research suggests that combining the two approaches, i.e., adapting both
resolution and precision simultaneously, can offer significant gains over using
them individually. However, there currently exist no practical solutions to
creating and evaluating such representations at scale. In this work, we present
a new resolution-precision-adaptive representation to support hybrid data
reduction schemes and offer an interface to existing tools and algorithms.
Through novelties in spatial hierarchy, our representation, Adaptive
Multilinear Meshes (AMM), provides considerable reduction in the mesh size. AMM
creates a piecewise multilinear representation of uniformly sampled scalar data
and can selectively relax or enforce constraints on conformity, continuity, and
coverage, delivering a flexible adaptive representation. AMM also supports
representing the function using mixed-precision values to further the
achievable gains in data reduction. We describe a practical approach to
creating AMM incrementally using arbitrary orderings of data and demonstrate
AMM on six types of resolution and precision datastreams. By interfacing with
state-of-the-art rendering tools through VTK, we demonstrate the practical and
computational advantages of our representation for visualization techniques.
With an open-source release of our tool to create AMM, we make such evaluation
of data reduction accessible to the community, which we hope will foster new
opportunities and future data reduction schemes

one joint system within the theory of stochastic thermodynamics. First, a
comprehensive introduction to the subjects of stochastic processes, information
theory and the theory of stochastic thermodynamics is given, thereby
highlighting the key results.
  In the second part, systems with interacting degrees of freedom are
considered. This allows investigation of thermalization properties of
collisional baths, i.e. particles at equilibrium interacting with a localized
system via collisions. It is shown that the interactions between system and
bath must be reversible to ensure thermalization of the system. Moreover, the
role of information in thermodynamics is presented and interpreted in the
context of interacting systems. Using the concept of causal conditioning, a
framework is developed for finding entropy productions that capture the mutual
influence of coupled subsystems. This framework is applied to diverse setups
which are usually studied separately in information thermodynamics.
  The third part covers the case of important system variables being hidden
from observation. The problem is motivated by presenting a microswimmer model
and showing that its movement can be approximated by active Brownian motion.
However, its energy dissipation is massively underestimated by this procedure.
It is shown that this is a consequence of the fact that the swimming mechanism
is a hidden variable. Subsequently, different methods of effective description
are discussed and applied to a simple model system with which the impact of
hidden slow degrees of freedom on fluctuation theorems is studied. Finally, a
setting is investigated in which it is possible to give bounds for the hidden
entropy production from only partial observation of the system dynamics by
fitting an underlying hidden Markov process to the observable data.

dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) parameter estimator when the
extended regressor is generated using LTI filters. In particular, we are
interested in relating these conditions with the ones required for convergence
of the classical gradient (or least squares), namely the well-known persistent
excitation (PE) requirement on the original regressor vector, $\phi(t) \in
\mathbb{R}^q$, with $q \in \mathbb{N}$ the number of unknown parameters.
Moreover, we study the case when only interval excitation (IE) is available,
under which DREM, concurrent and composite learning schemes ensure global
convergence, being the convergence for DREM in finite time. Regarding PE we
prove that, under some mild technical assumptions, if $\phi(t)$ is PE then the
scalar regressor of DREM, $\Delta(t) \in \mathbb{R}$, is also PE, ensuring
exponential convergence. Concerning IE we prove that if $\phi(t)$ is IE then
$\Delta(t)$ is also IE. All these results are established in the almost sure
sense, namely proving that the set of filter parameters for which the claims do
not hold is of zero measure. The main technical tool used in our proof is
inspired by a study of Luenberger observers for nonautonomous nonlinear systems
recently reported in the literature.

threshold density for pion condensation in nuclear matter. Utilizing a $0^+

transfers an internal parity to a target nucleus, resulting in a unique
sensitivity to unnatural-parity states. Consequently, the selectivity for $0^-$
states is higher than in other reactions employed to date. The probe was

unprecedentedly high signal-to-noise ratio. The data also revealed new
candidates of $0^-$ states at $E_x=6.6 \pm 0.4$ and $14.8 \pm 0.3~{\rm MeV}$.

reflected from an interface between a permalloy film and a bilayer can be
controlled by changing dimensions of the bilayer. Treating the bilayer formed
by the permalloy film and a ferromagnetic stripe as a segment of a multi-mode
waveguide, we show that spin-wave Fabry-Perot resonances of one of its modes
are responsible for the high sensitivity of the phase of reflected waves to
stripe width and the stripe-film separation. Thus, the system is a unique
realization of a fully magnonic Gires-Tournois interferometer based on a
two-modes resonator, which can be treated as a magnonic counterpart of a
metasurface, since it enables manipulation of the phase of spin waves at
subwavelength distances. Knowledge gained from these calculations might be used
to design magnonic devices such as flat lenses or magnetic particle detectors.

the upper limit of Pa{\beta}/H{\alpha} in the southwest region is significantly

low Pa{\beta}/H{\alpha} ratio in the southwest region is the scattering of
H{\alpha} and Pa{\beta} photons from the center of Cen A by dust grains in the

question is about how to identify the failure region based on this

paper, we introduce a new IFR strategy, namely Search for Boundary (SB), to
identify an approximate failure region of a numeric input domain. SB attempts
to identify additional failure-causing inputs that are as close to the boundary

magnons and spin-state transition contributions to the heat capacity in
ferromagnetic (FM) Cr-doped MnTe (Tc~280K), where the magnon heat capacity is
attributed to the observed magnon-bipolar carrier-drag thermopower. The
pristine antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnTe shows only a magnon-induced peak in the
heat capacity near the Neel temperature, TN~307K. However, Cr-doped MnTe shows
a magnon-contributed heat capacity peak at ~293K with an additional peak in the
deep paramagnetic domain near 780K. Temperature-dependent magnetic
susceptibility reveals that Cr-doping initially creates low-spin (LS) states
Mn2+ ions into MnTe near and below TN due to a higher crystal field induced by
Cr ions. Above 400K, LS Mn2+ ions start converting into high-spin (HS) Mn2+
ions. The LS-to-HS transition of Mn2+ leads to an excess entropy and hence
excess heat capacity contribution in the system. Temperature-dependent X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and magnetic field-dependent susceptibility (M-H) confirmed
no presence of any structural changes and magnetic polaron, respectively. Both
XRD and M-H ensure that the peak of the heat capacity in the paramagnetic
domain is originated solely by the spin-state transition. The heat capacity
versus temperature was calculated to explain the contribution of each
component, including the ones due to the phonons, magnons, spin-transition,
Schottky anomaly, and lattice dilation. With the recent advances in
spin-caloritronics extending the spin-based effects from magnetic to
paramagnetic materials, the data from the heat capacity can play a crucial role
to probe the presence of different phenomena such as paramagnon-carrier-drag
and spin-entropy thermopowers.

paper, we seek to address this open problem by developing an unsupervised
approach, which requires minimal prior human knowledge. First, we develop an
unsupervised event detection method based on the concept of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). It works by training deep neural networks that
learn the characteristics of the normal trends in micro-PMU measurements; and
accordingly detect an event when there is any abnormality. We also propose a
two-step unsupervised clustering method, based on a novel linear mixed integer
programming formulation. It helps us categorize events based on their origin in
the first step and their similarity in the second step. The active nature of
the proposed clustering method makes it capable of identifying new clusters of
events on an ongoing basis. The proposed unsupervised event detection and
clustering methods are applied to real-world micro-PMU data. Results show that
they can outperform the prevalent methods in the literature. These methods also
facilitate our further analysis to identify important clusters of events that

shown how circularly polarized light modifies the gapless spectrum of the Kek-Y

degeneracy of the gapped spectrum of the Kek-O texture. To further explore the
electronic properties under circularly polarized radiation, the dc conductivity
is studied by using the Boltzmann approach and considering both inter-valley

the band structure of both textures is always modified in a perpendicular

systems and autonomy is proposed in this paper. Quantum teleportation is an
intrinsically quantum phenomenon, and was first introduced by teleporting an
unknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channels
in 1993. In this paper, we consider the possibility of applying this quantum
technique to autonomous mobile classical platforms for control and autonomy
purposes for the first time in this research. First, a review of how Quantum
Entanglement and Quantum Cryptography can be integrated into macroscopic
mechanical systems for controls and autonomy applications is presented, as well
as how quantum teleportation concepts may be applied to the classical domain.
In quantum teleportation, an entangled pair of photons which are correlated in
their polarizations are generated and sent to two autonomous platforms, which
we call the Alice Robot and the Bob Robot. Alice has been given a quantum
system, i.e. a photon, prepared in an unknown state, in addition to receiving
an entangled photon. Alice measures the state of her entangled photon and her
unknown state jointly and sends the information through a classical channel to
Bob. Although Alice original unknown state is collapsed in the process of
measuring the state of the entangled photon (due to the quantum non-cloning
phenomenon), Bob can construct an accurate replica of Alice state by applying a
unitary operator. This paper, and the previous investigations of the
applications of hybrid classical-quantum capabilities in control of dynamical
systems, are aimed to promote the adoption of quantum capabilities and its
advantages to the classical domain particularly for autonomy and control of
autonomous classical systems.

(CRNN) can decrease, by orders of magnitude, the time needed for the
phase-resolved prediction of waves in a spatiotemporal domain of a nonlinear
dispersive wave field. The problem of predicting such waves suffers from two
major challenges that have so far hindered analytical or direct computational
solutions in real time or faster: (i) the reconstruction problem, that is, how
one can calculate from measurable wave amplitude data the state of the wave
field (wave components, nonlinear couplings, etc.), and (ii) if such a
reconstruction is in hand, how to integrate equations fast enough to be able to
predict an upcoming rouge wave in a timely manner. Here, we demonstrate that
these two challenges can be overcome at once through advanced machine learning
techniques based on spatiotemporal patches of the time history of wave height
data in the domain. Specifically, as a benchmark here we consider equations
that govern the evolution of weakly nonlinear surface gravity waves such as
those propagating on the surface of the oceans. For the case of oceanic surface

theorize and model two fundamental processes underlying vicarious learning:
observation of actions (learning what they do) vs. belief sharing (learning
what they think). The analysis of our model points to three key insights.
First, vicarious learning through either process is beneficial even when no
agent in a system of vicarious learners begins with a knowledge advantage.
Second, vicarious learning through belief sharing is not universally better
than mutual observation of actions and outcomes. Specifically, enabling mutual
observability of actions and outcomes is superior to sharing of beliefs when
the task environment features few alternatives with large differences in their
value and there are no time pressures. Third, symmetry in vicarious learning in
fact adversely affects belief sharing but improves observational learning. All
three results are shown to be the consequence of how vicarious learning affects
self-confirming biased beliefs.

automorphism of $G$ is uniquely determined by its action on $S$. The size of a
smallest determining set for $G$ is called its determining number, $Det(G)$. A
graph $G$ is said to be $d$-distinguishable if there is a coloring of the
vertices with $d$ colors so that only the trivial automorphism preserves the
color classes. The smallest such $d$ is the distinguishing number, $Dist(G)$.
If $Dist(G) = 2$, the cost of 2-distinguishing, $\rho(G)$, is the size of a
smallest color class over all 2-distinguishing colorings of $G$. The
Mycielskian, $\mu(G)$, of a graph $G$ is constructed by adding a shadow master
vertex $w$, and for each vertex $v_i$ of $G$ adding a shadow vertex $u_i$ with
edges so that the neighborhood of $u_i$ in $\mu(G)$ is the same as the
neighborhood of $v_i$ in $G$ with the addition of $w$. That is,
$N(u_i)=N_G(v_i)\cup\{w\}$. The generalized Mycielskian $\mu^{(t)}(G)$ of a
graph $G$ is a Mycielskian graph with $t$ layers of shadow vertices, each with
edges to layers above and below, and $w$ only adjacent to the top layer of
shadow vertices. A graph is twin-free if it has no pair of vertices with the
same set of neighbors. This paper examines the determining number and, when
relevant, the cost of 2-distinguishing for Mycielskians and generalized
Mycielskians of simple graphs with no isolated vertices. In particular, if $G
\neq K_2$ is twin-free with no isolated vertices, then $Det(\mu^{(t)}(G)) =
Det(G)$. Further, if $Det(G) = k \geq 2$ and $t \ge k-1$, then
$Dist(\mu^{(t)}(G))=2$, and $Det(\mu^{(t)}(G)) = \rho(\mu^{(t)}(G))= k$. For
$G$ with twins, we develop a framework using quotient graphs with respect to
equivalence classes of twin vertices to give bounds on the determining number
of Mycielskians. Moreover, we identify classes of graphs with twins for which
$Det(\mu^{(t)}(G)) = (t{+}1) Det(G)$.

Most such approaches perform strong simulation in that they explicitly compute

observable from a physical quantum computer because quantum measurements
produce random samples from probability distributions defined by those

trend of atmospheric thermal structure with planetary equilibrium temperature.
We explore this trend and report here the first statistical detection of a
transition in the near-infrared (NIR) atmospheric emission between hot and
ultra-hot Jupiters. We measure this transition using secondary eclipse
observations and interpret this phenomenon as changes in atmospheric
properties, and more specifically in terms of transition from non-inverted to
inverted thermal profiles. We examine a sample of 78 hot Jupiters with
secondary eclipse measurements at 3.6 {\mu}m and 4.5 {\mu}m measured with
Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We measure the deviation of the data from
the blackbody, which we define as the difference between the observed 4.5
{\mu}m eclipse depth and that expected at this wavelength based on the
brightness temperature measured at 3.6 {\mu}m. We study how the deviation
between 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}m changes with theoretical predictions with
equilibrium temperature and incoming stellar irradiation. We reveal a clear
transition in the observed emission spectra of the hot Jupiter population at
1660 +/- 100 K in the zero albedo, full redistribution equilibrium temperature.
We find the hotter exoplanets have even hotter daysides at 4.5 {\mu}m compared
to 3.6 {\mu}m, which manifests as an exponential increase in the emitted power
of the planets with stellar insolation. We propose that the measured transition
is a result of seeing carbon monoxide in emission due to the formation of
temperature inversions in the atmospheres of the hottest planets. These thermal
inversions could be caused by the presence of atomic and molecular species with
high opacities in the optical and/or the lack of cooling species. We find that
the population of hot Jupiters statistically disfavors high C/O planets (C/O>=
0.85).

insurance products and the data sparsity problem, we construct an insurance
heterogeneous information network (IHIN) based on data from PingAn Jinguanjia,
the IHIN connects users, agents, insurance products and insurance product
properties together, giving us richer information. Then we employ three-level

insurance product representations. After obtaining latent features of
overlapping users, a feature mapping between the two domains is learned by
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We apply HCDIR on Jinguanjia dataset, and show
HCDIR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.

physical properties ranging from $p$-type transparent semiconductors to
high-temperature Fe-based superconductors. In this paper, we study the
electronic structure topology, spin Hall effect (SHE) and spin Nernst effect
(SNE) in these compounds based on density functional theory calculations. First
we find that the four considered compounds are Dirac semimetals with the
nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected Dirac line nodes along the Brillouin zone
boundary $A$-$M$ and $X$-$R$ and low density of states (DOS) near the Fermi
level ($E_F$). Second, the intrinsic SHE and SNE in some of these considered
compounds are found to be large. In particular, the calculated spin Hall
conductivity (SHC) of HfCuGeAs is as large as -514 ($\hbar$/e)(S/cm). The spin
Nernst conductivity (SNC) of HfCuGeAs at room temperature is also large, being
-0.73 ($\hbar$/e)(A/m-K). Moreover, both the magnitude and sign of the SHC and
SNC in these compounds can be manipulated by varying either the applied
electric field direction or spin current direction. The SHE and SNE in these
compounds can also be enhanced by tuning the Fermi level via chemical doping or
electric gating. Finally, a detailed analysis of the band-decomposed and
$k$-resolved spin Berry curvatures reveals that these large SHC and SNC as well
as their notable tunabilities originate largely from the presence of a large
number of spin-orbit coupling-gapped Dirac points near the Fermi level as well
as the gapless Dirac line-nodes, which give rise to large spin Berry
curvatures. Our findings thus suggest that the four XCuYAs compounds not only
provide a valuable platform for exploring the interplay between SHE, SNE and
band topology but also have promising applications in spintronics and spin
caloritronics.

Differently from previous work, we study the robustness of the $k$-Majority in

external agent that attempts to subvert the initial majority by altering the

in the first form of bias, the agent tries to alter the communication links by
transmitting state $\mathcal{B}$; in the second form of bias, the agent tries
to corrupt nodes directly by making them update to $\mathcal{B}$. Our main
result shows a \emph{sharp phase transition} in both forms of bias. By
considering initial configurations in which every node has probability $q \in

usually characterized via either dynamic light scattering or optical
microscopy. In both cases, speed of particles is obtained from the calculus of
the mean square displacement (MSD) and typically, the theoretical formula of
the MSD is derived from the motion equations of an active Brownian particle.
One of the most commonly reported parameters is the speed of the particle,
usually attributed to its propulsion, and is widely used to compare the motion
efficiency of catalytic motors. However, it is common to find different methods
to compute this parameter, which are not equivalent approximations and do not
possess the same physical meaning. Here, we review the standard methods of
speed analysis and focus on the errors that arise when analyzing the MSD of
self-propelled particles. We analyze the errors from the computation of the
instantaneous speed, as well as the propulsive speed and diffusion coefficient
through fittings to parabolic equations, and we propose a revised formula for
the motion analysis of catalytic particles moving with constant speed that can
improve the accuracy and the amount of information obtained from the MSD.
Moreover, we emphasize the importance of spotting the presence of different
motion dynamics, such as particles with active angular speed or that move under
the presence of drift, and how the breaking of ergodicity can completely change
the analysis by considering particles with an exponentially decaying speed. In
all cases, real data from enzymatically propelled micro-motors and simulations
are used to back up the theories. Finally, we propose several analytical
approaches and analyze limiting cases that will help to deal with these
scenarios while still obtaining accurate results.

at the La site results in the emergence of Co$^{3+}$, possibly in high spin
state, while the introduction of larger amount of Ca leads to the increase of
Ir valence. The competing magnetic interactions resulting from the mixed
valences lead to a coexistence of a magnetically ordered and an emerging spin
glass (SG) state for the doped samples. Our $\mu$SR results indicate that for
La$_{2}$CoIrO$_6$ a nearly constant fraction of a paramagnetic (PM) phase
persists down to low temperature, possibly related to the presence of a small
amount of Ir$^{3+}$ and to the anti-site disorder at Co/Ir sites. For the doped
compounds the PM phase freezes below 30 K, but there is still some dynamics
associated with the SG. The dielectric data obtained for the parent compound
and the one with 25% of Ca-doping indicate a possible magnetodielectric effect,
which is discussed in terms of the electron hopping between the TM ions, the
anti-site disorder and the distorted crystalline structure.

generating a DNS-resolution flow field from large eddy simulation (LES) data

qualitatively and quantitatively similar performance as that of the best

minibands, e.g. the 1st and 2nd minibands counted from charge neutrality, and
consequently the fundamental nature of the reconstructed higher-order miniband

higher-order minibands of precisely aligned graphene moir\'e superlattices by
transport spectroscopy. Using dual electrostatic gating, the edges of these
high-order minibands, i.e. the 3rd and 4th minibands, can be reached.
Interestingly, we have observed interband Landau level (LL) crossinginducing
gap closures in a multiband magneto-transport regime, which originates from

minibands and LL reconstruction qualitatively match our simulated results. Our
findings highlight the synergistic effect of minibands in transport, thus
presenting a new opportunity for graphene electronic devices.

from the source, conversely extended X-ray emission was clearly detected up to
a size distance compatible with a dust scattering halo produced by the source
X-ray emission before being eclipsed by its companion donor star. The diffuse
emission of the dust-scattering halo could be observed without any
contamination from the central point X-ray source, compared to a previous
XMM-Newton observation published in 2008. Our comprehensive analysis of the
2012 unpublished spectrum of the diffuse emission as well as of the 2008
re-analysed spectra extracted from three adjacent time intervals and different
extraction regions (optimized for point-like and extended emission) allowed us
to clearly disentangle the scattering halo spectrum from the residual
point-like emission during the 2008 eclipse. Moreover, the point-like emission
detected in 2008 could be separated into two components attributed to the
direct emission from the source and to scattering in the stellar wind,
respectively. From archival unpublished INTEGRAL data, we identified a very
strong (3$\times$10$^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) and fast (25 minutes

calibration of systems with little to no visual overlap between the cameras is

translation component per camera. Next, we solve for both the intrinsic

multiple indoor and outdoor scenes with multiple multi-camera systems show that
our calibration method achieves high accuracy and robustness. In particular,
our approach is more robust than the naive approach of first estimating
intrinsic parameters and pose per camera before refining the extrinsic

problem, which seeks to estimate constitutive parameters of a medium such as
phase velocity, density, and anisotropy, by fitting waveforms. Attenuation is
an additional parameter that needs to be taken into account in viscous media to
exploit the full potential of FWI. Attenuation is more easily implemented in
the frequency domain by using complex-valued velocities in the time-harmonic
wave equation. These complex velocities are frequency-dependent to guarantee
causality and account for dispersion. Since estimating a complex
frequency-dependent velocity at each grid point in space is not realistic, the
optimization is generally performed in the real domain by processing the phase
velocity (or slowness) at a reference frequency and attenuation (or quality
factor) as separate real parameters. This real parametrization requires an a
priori empirical relation (such as the nonlinear Kolsky-Futterman (KF) or
standard linear solid (SLS) attenuation models) between the complex velocity
and the two real quantities, which is prone to generate modeling errors if it
does not represent accurately the attenuation behavior of the subsurface.
Moreover, it leads to a multivariate inverse problem, which is twice larger
than the actual size of the medium and ill-posed due to the cross-talk between
the two classes of real parameters. To alleviate these issues, we present a
mono-variate algorithm that solves directly the optimization problem in the
complex domain by processing in sequence narrow bands of frequencies under the
assumption of band-wise frequency dependence of the sought complex velocities.

composed of two bands (a broad one and a narrow one) associated with the native

of servers (e.g. mini data centers). One of the key criteria for the
effectiveness of the cloud computing environment is the time staying by the
program inside the environment. This time consists of the waiting time in the
queue and the execution time on the selected physical computer installation, to
which the computational resource of the virtual infrastructure is dynamically
mapped. One of the components of this problem is the estimation of the MPI
programs execution time on a certain set of computer installations. This is
necessary to determine a proper choice of order and place for program
execution. The article proposes two new approaches to the program execution
time prediction problem. The first one is based on computer installations
grouping based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. The second one is based
on vector representations of computer installations and MPI programs, so-called
embeddings. The embedding technique is actively used in recommendation systems,
such as for goods (Amazon), for articles (Arxiv.org), for videos (YouTube,
Netflix). The article shows how the embeddings technique helps to predict the
execution time of a MPI program on a certain set of computer installations.

the complete and detailed 3D human from a single RGB-D image. Given a single
front-view RGB-D image, NormalGAN performs two steps: front-view RGB-D
rectification and back-view RGBD inference. The final model was then generated
by simply combining the front-view and back-view RGB-D information. However,
inferring backview RGB-D image with high-quality geometric details and
plausible texture is not trivial. Our key observation is: Normal maps generally
encode much more information of 3D surface details than RGB and depth images.
Therefore, learning geometric details from normal maps is superior than other
representations. In NormalGAN, an adversarial learning framework conditioned by
normal maps is introduced, which is used to not only improve the front-view
depth denoising performance, but also infer the back-view depth image with
surprisingly geometric details. Moreover, for texture recovery, we remove
shading information from the front-view RGB image based on the refined normal
map, which further improves the quality of the back-view color inference.
Results and experiments on both testing data set and real captured data
demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Given a consumer RGB-D

boundary length and thermodynamic nonequilibrium (TNE) strength are introduced
to probe the complex configurations and kinetic processes. In the simulations,
RTI always plays a major role in the later stage, while the main mechanism in
the early stage depends on the comparison of buoyancy and shear strength. It is
found that, both the total boundary length $L$ of the condensed temperature
field and the mean heat flux strength $D_{3,1}$ can be used to measure the
ratio of buoyancy to shear strength, and to quantitatively judge the main
mechanism in the early stage of the RTKHI system. Specifically, when KHI (RTI)
dominates, $L^{KHI} > L^{RTI}$ ($L^{KHI} < L^{RTI}$), $D_{3,1}^{KHI} >
D_{3,1}^{RTI}$ ($D_{3,1}^{KHI} < D_{3,1}^{RTI}$); when KHI and RTI are
balanced, $L^{KHI} = L^{RTI}$, $D_{3,1}^{KHI} = D_{3,1}^{RTI}$. A second sets
of findings are as below: For the case where the KHI dominates at earlier time
and the RTI dominates at later time, the evolution process can be roughly
divided into two stages. Before the transition point of the two stages,
$L^{RTKHI}$ initially increases exponentially, and then increases linearly.
Hence, the ending point of linear increasing $L^{RTKHI}$ can work as a
geometric criterion for discriminating the two stages. The TNE quantity, heat
flux strength $D_{3,1}^{RTKHI}$, shows similar behavior. Therefore, the ending
point of linear increasing $D_{3,1}^{RTKHI}$ can work as a physical criterion
for discriminating the two stages.

spatial network where the vertices are words, arcs indicate syntactic

the distance between linked words in a sentence. The analysis of sentences from
93 languages representing 19 linguistic families reveals that half of languages
are optimized to a 70% or more. The score indicates that distances are not
significantly reduced in a few languages and confirms two theoretical
predictions, i.e. that longer sentences are more optimized and that distances
are more likely to be longer than expected by chance in short sentences. We
present a new hierarchical ranking of languages by their degree of
optimization. The new score has implications for various fields of language
research (dependency linguistics, typology, historical linguistics, clinical
linguistics and cognitive science). Finally, the principles behind the design
of the score have implications for network science.

intellectual achievements ever conceived by the human mind. In fact, over the
last century, GR has proven to be an extremely successful theory, with a well
established experimental footing. However, the discovery of the late-time
cosmic acceleration, which represents a new imbalance in the governing
gravitational field equations, has forced theorists and experimentalists to
question whether GR is the correct relativistic theory of gravitation, and has
spurred much research in modified gravity, where extensions of the
Hilbert-Einstein action describe the gravitational field. In this review, we
perform a detailed theoretical and phenomenological analysis of two largely
explored extensions of $f(R)$ gravity, namely: (i) the hybrid metric-Palatini
theory; (ii) and modified gravity with curvature-matter couplings. Relative to
the former, it has been established that both metric and Palatini versions of
$f(R)$ gravity possess interesting features but also manifest severe drawbacks.
A hybrid combination, containing elements from both of these formalisms, turns
out to be very successful in accounting for the observed phenomenology and
avoids some drawbacks of the original approaches. Relative to the
curvature-matter coupling theories, these offer interesting extensions of
$f(R)$ gravity, where the explicit nonminimal couplings between an arbitrary
function of the scalar curvature $R$ and the Lagrangian density of matter,
induces a non-vanishing covariant derivative of the energy-momentum tensor. We
extensively explore both theories in a plethora of applications, namely, the
weak-field limit, galactic and extragalactic dynamics, cosmology, stellar-type
compact objects, irreversible matter creation processes and the quantum
cosmology of a specific curvature-matter coupling theory.

have harnessed modern theory of approximate message-passing (AMP) to obtain, in
a particular setting, exact asymptotic predictions of the type I-type II error
tradeoff for selection procedures that rely on $\ell_{p}$-regularized
estimators. In practice, effective ranking by itself is often not sufficient
because some calibration for Type I error is required. In this work we study
theoretically the power of selection procedures that similarly rank the
features by the size of an $\ell_{p}$-regularized estimator, but further use
Model-X knockoffs to control the false discovery rate in the realistic
situation where no prior information about the signal is available. In
analyzing the power of the resulting procedure, we extend existing results in
AMP theory to handle the pairing between original variables and their
knockoffs. This is used to derive exact asymptotic predictions for power. We
apply the general results to compare the power of the knockoffs versions of
Lasso and thresholded-Lasso selection, and demonstrate that in the i.i.d.
covariate setting under consideration, tuning by cross-validation on the
augmented design matrix is nearly optimal. We further demonstrate how the
techniques allow to analyze also the Type S error, and a corresponding notion
of power, when selections are supplemented with a decision on the sign of the
coefficient.

of the associated Hamiltonian system. In this paper, we study the neural
network (NN) semiglobal approximation of the stable manifold. The main
contribution includes two aspects: firstly, from the mathematical point of
view, we rigorously prove that if an approximation is sufficiently close to the
exact stable manifold of the HJB equation, then the corresponding control
derived from this approximation is near optimal. Secondly, we propose a deep
learning method to approximate the stable manifolds, and then numerically
compute optimal feedback controls. The algorithm is devised from geometric
features of the stable manifold, and relies on adaptive data generation by
finding trajectories randomly in the stable manifold. The trajectories are
found by solving two-point boundary value problems (BVP) locally near the
equilibrium and extending the local solution by initial value problems (IVP)
for the associated Hamiltonian system. A number of samples are chosen on each
trajectory. Some adaptive samples are selected near the points with large

that for an elliptic orbit, such feature appears for an arbitrary step size.
But it is not the case for a hyperbolic orbit: when the half step size is
larger than the conjugate momenta of the mean anomaly, a phase transition
happens and the new position jumps to the nonphysical counterpart of the
hyperbolic trajectory. Once it happens, the energy conservation is broken.
Instead, the kinetic energy minus the potential energy becomes a new conserved
quantity. We provide a mathematical explanation for such phenomenon. Our result
provides a deeper understanding of the TSI method, and a useful constraint of
the step size when the TSI method is used to solve the hyperbolic encounters.
This is particular important when an (Bulirsch-Stoer) extrapolation integrator

  Nanocrystal Films",,,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Silver benzeneselenolate [AgSePh] is a coordination polymer that hosts a
hybrid quantum well structure. The recent advancements in the study of its
tightly bound excitons (~300 meV) and photoconductive properties (recently
employed in UV photodetection) makes it an interesting representative of a
material platform that is an environmentally stable alternative to 2D metal
halide perovskites in terms of optoelectronic properties. To this aim, several
challenges are to be addressed, among which the lack of control over the
metal-organic reaction process in the reported synthesis of the [AgSePh]
nanocrystal film (NC). This issue contributed to cast doubts over the origin of
its intra-bandgap electronic states. In this article we study all the steps to
obtain phase pure [AgSePh] NC films, from thin silver films through its
oxidation and reaction via a chemical vapor-solid with benzeneselenol, by means
of UV-vis, XRD, SEM, and AFM. Raman and FTIR spectroscopy are also employed to
provide vibrational peaks assignment, for the first time on this polymer. Our
analysis supports an acid-base reaction scheme based on an acid attacking the
metal oxide precursor, generating water as byproduct of the polymeric
synthesis, speeding up the reaction by solvating the PhSeH. The reaction
readily goes to completion within 30 min in a supersaturated PhSeH / N2
atmosphere at 90 {\deg}C. Our analysis suggests the absence of precursor's
leftovers or oxidized species that could contribute to the intra-gap states. By
tuning the reaction parameters, we gained control on film morphology to obtain
substrate-parallel oriented micro-crystals showing different excitonic
absorption intensities. Finally, centimeters size high quality [AgSePh] NC
films could be obtained, enabling exploitation of their optoelectronic
properties, such as UV photodetection, in large-area applications.

  Conversational Recommendation","Accepted for publication at RecSys'20",,"10.1145/3383313.3412249",,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heavily pre-trained transformer models such as BERT have recently shown to be
remarkably powerful at language modelling by achieving impressive results on
numerous downstream tasks. It has also been shown that they are able to
implicitly store factual knowledge in their parameters after pre-training.
Understanding what the pre-training procedure of LMs actually learns is a
crucial step for using and improving them for Conversational Recommender
Systems (CRS). We first study how much off-the-shelf pre-trained BERT ""knows""
about recommendation items such as books, movies and music. In order to analyze
the knowledge stored in BERT's parameters, we use different probes that require
different types of knowledge to solve, namely content-based and
collaborative-based. Content-based knowledge is knowledge that requires the
model to match the titles of items with their content information, such as
textual descriptions and genres. In contrast, collaborative-based knowledge
requires the model to match items with similar ones, according to community
interactions such as ratings. We resort to BERT's Masked Language Modelling
head to probe its knowledge about the genre of items, with cloze style prompts.
In addition, we employ BERT's Next Sentence Prediction head and
representations' similarity to compare relevant and non-relevant search and
recommendation query-document inputs to explore whether BERT can, without any
fine-tuning, rank relevant items first. Finally, we study how BERT performs in
a conversational recommendation downstream task. Overall, our analyses and
experiments show that: (i) BERT has knowledge stored in its parameters about
the content of books, movies and music; (ii) it has more content-based
knowledge than collaborative-based knowledge; and (iii) fails on conversational
recommendation when faced with adversarial data.

study of fibrous filaments investigating the link between cores and
sub-filaments using hydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving-mesh
code Arepo. Our study suggests that cores form in two environments: (i) as
isolated cores, or small chains of cores, on a single sub-filament, or (ii) as
an ensemble of cores located at the junction of sub-filaments. We term these
isolated and hub cores respectively. We show that these core populations are
statistically different from each other. Hub cores have a greater mean mass
than isolated cores, and the mass distribution of hub cores is significantly
wider than isolated cores. This fragmentation is reminiscent of parsec-scale
hub-filament systems, showing that the combination of turbulence and gravity
leads to similar fragmentation signatures on multiple scales, even within
filaments. Moreover, the fact that fragmentation proceeds through sub-filaments
suggests that there exists no characteristic fragmentation length-scale between
cores. This is in opposition to earlier theoretical works studying fibre-less
filaments which suggest a strong tendency towards the formation of
quasi-periodically spaced cores, but in better agreement with observations. We
also show tentative signs that global collapse of filaments preferentially form
cores at both filament ends, which are more massive and dense than other cores.

classification accuracies on losses for deep leaning and proposal of a novel
top-k loss. Commonly-used cross entropy (CE) is not guaranteed to optimize
top-k prediction without infinite training data and model complexities. The
objective is to clarify when CE sacrifices top-k accuracies to optimize top-1
prediction, and to design loss that improve top-k accuracy under such
conditions. Our novel loss is basically CE modified by grouping temporal top-k
classes as a single class. To obtain a robust decision boundary, we introduce
an adaptive transition from normal CE to our loss, and thus call it top-k
transition loss. It is demonstrated that CE is not always the best choice to
learn top-k prediction in our experiments. First, we explore trade-offs between
top-1 and top-k (=2) accuracies on synthetic datasets, and find a failure of CE
in optimizing top-k prediction when we have complex data distribution for a
given model to represent optimal top-1 prediction. Second, we compare top-k
accuracies on CIFAR-100 dataset targeting top-5 prediction in deep learning.
While CE performs the best in top-1 accuracy, in top-5 accuracy our loss
performs better than CE except using one experimental setup. Moreover, our loss
has been found to provide better top-k accuracies compared to CE at k larger
than 10. As a result, a ResNet18 model trained with our loss reaches 99 %
accuracy with k=25 candidates, which is a smaller candidate number than that of
CE by 8.

associated to each vertex of a simplicial complex and the degrees of freedom
are given by the metric on each simplex. The lengths of the edges are thus
determined and are left invariant under arbitrary transformations of the
discrete set of coordinates, provided the metric transforms accordingly.
Invariance under coordinate transformations entails tensor calculus and our
formulation follows closely the usual formalism of the continuum theory. The
definitions of parallel transport, Christoffel symbol, covariant derivatives
and Riemann curvature tensor follow in a rather natural way. In this
correspondence Einstein action becomes Regge action with the deficit angle
$\theta$ replaced by $\sin \theta$. The correspondence with the continuum
theory can be extended to actions with higher powers of the curvature tensor,
to the vielbein formalism and to the coupling of gravity with matter fields
(scalars, fermionic fields including spin $3/2$ fields and gauge fields) which
are then determined unambiguously and discussed in the paper. An action on the
simplicial lattice for $N=1$ supergravity in $4$ dimensions is derived in this
context. Another relavant result is that Yang-mills actions on a simplicial
lattice consist, even in absence of gravity, of two plaquettes terms, unlike
the one plaquette Wilson action on the hypercubic lattice. An attempt is also
made to formulate a discrete differential calculus to include differential
forms of higher order and the gauging of free differential algebras in this
scheme. However this leads to form products that do not satisfy associativity
and distributive law with respect to the $d$ operator. A proper formulation of
theories that contain higher order differential forms in the context of Regge
Calculus is then still lacking.

Synchronized Planarity can be solved in quadratic time, and, on the other hand,
that it serves as a powerful modeling language that lets us easily formulate
several constrained planarity problems as instances of Synchronized Planarity.

intensive modeling effort, have greatly enhanced our understanding of hot giant
planets and brown dwarfs over the past ten years. Although these objects are
all fluid, hydrogen worlds with stratified atmospheres overlying convective
interiors, they exhibit an impressive diversity of atmospheric behavior. Hot
Jupiters are strongly irradiated, and a wealth of observations constrain the
day-night temperature differences, circulation, and cloudiness. The intense
stellar irradiation, presumed tidal locking and modest rotation leads to a
novel regime of strong day-night radiative forcing. Circulation models predict
large day-night temperature differences, global-scale eddies, patchy clouds,
and, in most cases, a fast eastward jet at the equator-equatorial
superrotation. The warm Jupiters may exhibit a wide range of rotation rates,
obliquities, and orbital eccentricities, which, along with the weaker
irradiation, leads to circulation patterns and observable signatures predicted
to differ substantially from hot Jupiters. Brown dwarfs are typically isolated,
rapidly rotating worlds; they radiate enormous energy fluxes into space and
convect vigorously in their interiors. Their atmospheres exhibit patchiness in
clouds and temperature on regional to global scales-the result of modulation by
large-scale atmospheric circulation. Despite the lack of irradiation, such
circulations can be driven by interaction of the interior convection with the
overlying atmosphere, as well as self-organization of patchiness due to
cloud-dynamical-radiative feedbacks. Finally, irradiated brown dwarfs help to
bridge the gap between these classes of objects, experiencing intense external
irradiation as well as vigorous interior convection. A hierarchy of modeling
approaches have yielded major new insights into the dynamics governing these
phenomena.

comparatively-weak turbulence in the free-atmosphere above a strong but thin
boundary layer. The median seeing at Dome C is estimated to be 0.23--0.36
arcsec above a boundary layer that has a typical height of 30\,m. At Dome A and
F, the only previous seeing measurements were made during daytime. Here we
report the first direct measurements of night-time seeing at Dome A, using a
Differential Image Motion Monitor. Located at a height of just 8\,m, it
recorded seeing as low as 0.13\,arcsec, and provided seeing statistics that are
comparable to those for a 20\,m height at Dome C. It indicates that the
boundary layer was below 8\,m 31\% of the time. At such times the median seeing
was 0.31\,arcsec, consistent with free-atmosphere seeing. The seeing and
boundary layer thickness are found to be strongly correlated with the
near-surface temperature gradient. The correlation confirms a median thickness
of approximately 14\,m for the boundary layer at Dome A, as found from a sonic
radar. The thinner boundary layer makes it less challenging to locate a
telescope above it, thereby giving greater access to the free-atmosphere.

main non-pharmaceutical interventions to fight the virus expansion. Previous
works have shown a connection between the structural organization of cities and
the movement patterns of their residents. This puts urban centers in the focus
of epidemic surveillance and interventions. Here we show that the organization
of urban flows has a tremendous impact on disease spreading and on the
amenability of different mitigation strategies. By studying anonymous and
aggregated intra-urban flows in a variety of cities in the United States and
other countries, and a combination of empirical analysis and analytical
methods, we demonstrate that the response of cities to epidemic spreading can
be roughly classified in two major types according to the overall organization
of those flows. Hierarchical cities, where flows are concentrated primarily
between mobility hotspots, are particularly vulnerable to the rapid spread of
epidemics. Nevertheless, mobility restrictions in such types of cities are very
effective in mitigating the spread of a virus. Conversely, in sprawled cities
which present many centers of activity, the spread of an epidemic is much
slower, but the response to mobility restrictions is much weaker and less
effective. Investing resources on early monitoring and prompt ad-hoc
interventions in more vulnerable cities may prove helpful in containing and
reducing the impact of future pandemics.

traffic between proxies and servers of game-supporting infrastructures. First,
TCP/IP headers are compressed using standard algorithms that avoid sending
repeated fields; next, a number of packets are blended into a bigger one and
finally, they are sent using a tunnel. The expected compressed header size has
been obtained using traffic traces of a real game. Next, simulations using a
traffic model of a popular MMORPG have been performed in order to estimate the
expected bandwidth savings and the reduction in packets per second. The
obtained bandwidth saving is about 60 percent. Packets per second are also
significantly reduced. In addition, the added delays are shown to be small

which three $\alpha$ particles fuse to form $^{12}$C in the excited Hoyle
state, followed by electromagnetic decay to the ground state. The Hoyle state
is above the $\alpha$ threshold, and the rate of stellar carbon production
depends on the radiative width of this state. The radiative width cannot be
measured directly, and must instead be deduced by combining three separately
measured quantities. One of these quantities is the $E0$ decay branching ratio
of the Hoyle state, and the current $10$\% uncertainty on the radiative width
stems mainly from the uncertainty on this ratio. The $E0$ branching ratio was
deduced from a series of pair conversion measurements of the $E0$ and $E2$
transitions depopulating the $0^+_2$ Hoyle state and $2^+_1$ state in $^{12}$C,
respectively. The excited states were populated by the $^{12}$C$(p,p^\prime)$
reaction at 10.5 MeV beam energy, and the pairs were detected with the
electron-positron pair spectrometer, Super-e, at the Australian National
University. The deduced branching ratio required knowledge of the proton
population of the two states, as well as the alignment of the $2^+_1$ state in
the reaction. For this purpose, proton scattering and $\gamma$-ray angular
distribution experiments were also performed. An $E0$ branching ratio of
$\Gamma^{E0}_{\pi}/\Gamma=8.2(5)\times10^{-6}$ was deduced in the current work,
and an adopted value of $\Gamma^{E0}_{\pi}/\Gamma=7.6(4)\times10^{-6}$ is
recommended based on a weighted average of previous literature values and the
new result. The new recommended value for the $E0$ branching ratio is about 14%
larger than the previous adopted value of
$\Gamma^{E0}_{\pi}/\Gamma=6.7(6)\times10^{-6}$, while the uncertainty has been
reduced from 9% to 5%.

(super-)Poynting vector vanishes are called principal. When, at a given point,
the electromagnetic field is non-null, or the gravitational field is of
Weyl-Petrov type I or D, principal observers instantaneously passing through
that point always exist. We survey characterizations of such observers and
study their relation to arbitrary observers. In the non-null electromagnetic

moves relative to the first in the direction of his Poynting vector. Replacing
Poynting by super-Poynting yields a possible gravitational analogue; we show
that this analogy indeed holds for any observer when the Petrov type is D, but
only for a one-dimensional variety of observers when the Petrov type is I. We
provide algorithms to obtain the principal observers directly from the electric

and validate its containment of a given point. The PIP algorithms, which are
working directly on the geometric entities, derive linear boundary definitions

the two-point form of the line equation to partition the space into
half-spaces. Voronoi tessellations use an alternate approach for half-space
partitioning. Instead of line equation, distance comparison between generator
points is used to accomplish the same task. Voronoi tessellations consist of
convex polygons, which are defined between generator points. Therefore, Voronoi
tessellations have become an inspiration for us to develop a new approach of
the PIP testing, specialized for convex polygons. The equations, essential to
the conversion of a convex polygon to a Voronoi polygon, are derived. As a
reference, a very standard convex PIP testing algorithm, \textit{the sign of
offset}, is selected for comparison. For generalization of the comparisons,
\textit{the ray crossing} algorithm is used as another reference. All

Equation(ODE) framework is that it seems to provide a continuous-time extension

ODE models actually depend on the specific numerical method used during
training. If the trained model is supposed to be a flow generated from an ODE,
it should be possible to choose another numerical solver with equal or smaller
numerical error without loss of performance. We observe that if training relies
on a solver with overly coarse discretization, then testing with another solver
of equal or smaller numerical error results in a sharp drop in accuracy. In
such cases, the combination of vector field and numerical method cannot be
interpreted as a flow generated from an ODE, which arguably poses a fatal
breakdown of the Neural ODE concept. We observe, however, that there exists a
critical step size beyond which the training yields a valid ODE vector field.
We propose a method that monitors the behavior of the ODE solver during
training to adapt its step size, aiming to ensure a valid ODE without
unnecessarily increasing computational cost. We verify this adaption algorithm
on two common bench mark datasets as well as a synthetic dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel synthetic dataset in which the underlying ODE directly

radiation is excited within 10$\%$ of the light cylinder. The coherence is
attributed to Langmuir mode instability in a relativistically streaming
one-dimensional plasma flow along the open magnetic field lines. In this work,
we use a hot plasma treatment to solve the hydrodynamic dispersion relation of
Langmuir mode for realistic pulsar parameters. The solution involves three
scenarios of two-stream instability viz., driven by high energy beams, due to
longitudinal drift that leads to a separation of electron-positron distribution
functions in the secondary plasma and due to cloud-cloud interaction causing
spatial overlap of two successive secondary plasma clouds. We find that
sufficient amplification can be obtained only for the latter two scenarios. Our
analysis shows that longitudinal drift is characterized by high growth rates
only for certain multi-polar surface field geometry. For these configurations,
very high growth rates are obtained starting from a few tens of km from the
neutron star surface, which then falls monotonically with increasing distance.
For cloud-cloud overlap, growth rates become high starting only after a few
hundred km from the surface, which first increases and then decreases with
increasing distance. A spatial window of up to around a 1000 km above the
neutron star surface has been found where large amplitude Langmuir waves can be
excited while the pair plasma is dense enough to account for high brightness
temperature.

unidirectional waves in a plasma that is perpendicularly structured (Magyar et

structuring modifies the upward propagating wave to have both Elsasser
variables, leading to the well-known perpendicular cascade. In this paper, we
study an analytical description of the non-linear evolution of kink waves in a
cylindrical flux tube, which are prone to uniturbulence. We show that they lead
to a non-linear cascade for both propagating and standing waves. We calculate
explicit expressions for the wave pressure and energy cascade rate. The
computed damping rate {\tau}/P depends on the density contrast of the flux tube
and the background plasma and is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the
kink wave. The dependence on the density contrast shows that it plays a role
especially in the lower solar corona. These expressions may be added in Alfven
wave driven models of the solar atmosphere (such as AWSOM, van der Holst et al.

functional data. It provides a novel way of ranking a sample of curves from the
center outwards and defining robust statistics, such as the median or trimmed
means. It has also been used as a building block for functional outlier
detection methods and classification. Several notions of depth for functional
data were introduced in the literature in the last few decades. These
functional depths can only be directly applied to samples of curves measured on
a fine and common grid. In practice, this is not always the case, and curves
are often observed at sparse and subject dependent grids. In these scenarios
the usual approach consists in estimating the trajectories on a common dense
grid, and using the estimates in the depth analysis. This approach ignores the
uncertainty associated with the curves estimation step. Our goal is to extend
the notion of depth so that it takes into account this uncertainty. Using both
functional estimates and their associated confidence intervals, we propose a
new method that allows the curve estimation uncertainty to be incorporated into
the depth analysis. We describe the new approach using the modified band depth
although any other functional depth could be used. The performance of the
proposed methodology is illustrated using simulated curves in different
settings where we control the degree of sparsity. Also a real data set
consisting of female medflies egg-laying trajectories is considered. The
results show the benefits of using uncertainty when computing depth for sparse
functional data.

the position of the D-brane, and its dynamics is encoded in a Dirac-Born-Infeld
action. On the other hand, dark matter is identified with matter on the
D-brane, that naturally couples to dark energy \textit{via} a disformal
coupling. We analyse the numerical evolution of the cosmological background,
highlighting the fact that there are two regimes of interest: one, in which the
coupling is positive throughout; and another, in which the coupling is negative
at the present. In the latter, there is the enticing possibility of having
scenarios in which the coupling is positive for a significant part of the

decline in economic activity across the globe. To fight this recession, policy
makers in central banks engaged in expansionary monetary policy. This paper
asks whether the measures adopted by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have been
effective in boosting real activity and calming financial markets. To measure
these effects at high frequencies, we propose a novel mixed frequency vector
autoregressive (MF-VAR) model. This model allows us to combine weekly and
monthly information within an unified framework. Our model combines a set of
macroeconomic aggregates such as industrial production, unemployment rates and
inflation with high frequency information from financial markets such as stock
prices, interest rate spreads and weekly information on the Feds balance sheet
size. The latter set of high frequency time series is used to dynamically
interpolate the monthly time series to obtain weekly macroeconomic measures. We
use this setup to simulate counterfactuals in absence of monetary stimulus. The
results show that the monetary expansion caused higher output growth and stock
market returns, more favorable long-term financing conditions and a
depreciation of the US dollar compared to a no-policy benchmark scenario.

regression functions. The local nature of the RF algorithm, based on intra-node
means and variances, is ideal when errors are i.i.d. For dependent error
processes like time series and spatial settings where data in all the nodes
will be correlated, operating locally ignores this dependence. Also, RF will
involve resampling of correlated data, violating the principles of bootstrap.
Theoretically, consistency of RF has been established for i.i.d. errors, but
little is known about the case of dependent errors.
  We propose RF-GLS, a novel extension of RF for dependent error processes in
the same way Generalized Least Squares (GLS) fundamentally extends Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS) for linear models under dependence. The key to this
extension is the equivalent representation of the local decision-making in a
regression tree as a global OLS optimization which is then replaced with a GLS
loss to create a GLS-style regression tree. This also synergistically addresses
the resampling issue, as the use of GLS loss amounts to resampling uncorrelated
contrasts (pre-whitened data) instead of the correlated data. For spatial
settings, RF-GLS can be used in conjunction with Gaussian Process correlated
errors to generate kriging predictions at new locations. RF becomes a special
case of RF-GLS with an identity working covariance matrix.
  We establish consistency of RF-GLS under beta- (absolutely regular) mixing
error processes and show that this general result subsumes important cases like
autoregressive time series and spatial Matern Gaussian Processes. As a
byproduct, we also establish consistency of RF for beta-mixing processes, which
to our knowledge, is the first such result for RF under dependence.
  We empirically demonstrate the improvement achieved by RF-GLS over RF for
both estimation and prediction under dependence.

remains one of the major challenges for the systematic recognition and recovery
of the macromolecule structures in cryo-ET because of imaging limits and data
quantity. Recently, deep learning has significantly improved the throughput and
accuracy of large-scale subtomogram classification. However often it is
difficult to get enough high-quality annotated subtomogram data for supervised
training due to the enormous expense of labeling. To tackle this problem, it is
beneficial to utilize another already annotated dataset to assist the training
process. However, due to the discrepancy of image intensity distribution
between source domain and target domain, the model trained on subtomograms in
source domainmay perform poorly in predicting subtomogram classes in the target
domain.
  Results: In this paper, we adapt a few shot domain adaptation method for deep
learning based cross-domain subtomogram classification. The essential idea of
our method consists of two parts: 1) take full advantage of the distribution of
plentiful unlabeled target domain data, and 2) exploit the correlation between
the whole source domain dataset and few labeled target domain data. Experiments
conducted on simulated and real datasets show that our method achieves
significant improvement on cross domain subtomogram classification compared

asymmetric dispersal can influence the spatial dynamics in three aspects: it
can determine the spatial propagation directions of solutions, influence the

Second, we give an improved proof of the spreading speed result by constructing

detected on a chest X-ray by an experienced radiologist. Due to shortage of
such experts, automated detection systems based on deep neural networks have
been developed. Nevertheless, applying such systems in practice remains a
challenge. These systems, mostly compute a single probability as output, may
not be enough for diagnosis. On the contrary, content-based medical image
retrieval (CBIR) systems, such as image search, can assist clinicians for
diagnostic purposes by enabling them to compare the case they are examining
with previous (already diagnosed) cases. However, there is a lack of study on
such attempt. In this study, we explored the use of image search to classify
pneumothorax among chest X-ray images. All chest X-ray images were first tagged
with deep pretrained features, which were obtained from existing deep learning
models. Given a query chest X-ray image, the majority voting of the top K
retrieved images was then used as a classifier, in which similar cases in the
archive of past cases are provided besides the probability output. In our
experiments, 551,383 chest X-ray images were obtained from three large recently
released public datasets. Using 10-fold cross-validation, it is shown that
image search on deep pretrained features achieved promising results compared to
those obtained by traditional classifiers trained on the same features. To the
best of knowledge, it is the first study to demonstrate that deep pretrained
features can be used for CBIR of pneumothorax in half a million chest X-ray
images.

terrestrial planets and cores of gas giants are formed through accretion of

$N$-body simulations of a disk system made up of numerous planetesimals are the
most direct way to study the accretion process. However, the use of $N$-body
simulations has been limited to idealized models (e.g. perfect accretion)
and/or narrow spatial ranges in the radial direction, due to the limited number
of simulation runs and particles available. We have developed new $N$-body
simulation code equipped with a particle-particle particle-tree (${\rm P^3T}$)
scheme for studying the planetary system formation process: GPLUM. For each
particle, GPLUM uses the fourth-order Hermite scheme to calculate gravitational
interactions with particles within cut-off radii and the Barnes-Hut tree scheme
for particles outside the cut-off radii. In existing implementations, ${\rm
P^3T}$ schemes use the same cut-off radius for all particles, making a
simulation become slower when the mass range of the planetesimal population
becomes wider. We have solved this problem by allowing each particle to have an
appropriate cut-off radius depending on its mass, its distance from the central
star, and the local velocity dispersion of planetesimals. In addition to
achieving a significant speed-up, we have also improved the scalability of the
code to reach a good strong-scaling performance up to 1024 cores in the case of

Before collapsing, the cores are supported by thermal pressure and turbulent
motions. A question of critical importance for the understanding of star
formation is how to observationally discern whether a core has already
initiated gravitational collapse or is still in hydrostatic balance. The
canonical method to identify gravitational collapse is based on the observed
density radial profile, which would change from a Bonnor-Ebert type toward
power laws as the core collapses. In practice, due to the projection effect,
the resolution limit, and other caveats, it has been difficult to directly
reveal the dynamical status of cores, particularly in massive star-forming
regions. We here propose a novel, straight-forward diagnostic, namely, the
collapsing index (CI), which can be modeled and calculated based on the radial
profile of the line width of dense gas. A meaningful measurement of CI requires
spatially and spectrally resolved images of optically thin and chemically
stable dense gas tracers. ALMA observations are making such data sets
increasingly available for massive star-forming regions. Applying our method to
one of the deepest dense-gas spectral images ever taken toward such a region,
namely, the Orion molecular cloud, we detect the dynamical status of selected
cores therein. We observationally distinguished a collapsing core in a massive
star-forming region from a hydrostatical one. Our approach would help
significantly improve our understanding of the interaction between gravity and
turbulence within molecular cloud cores in the process of star formation.

small, different behaviors can be induced by high confinement effects. Some
unexpected and curious behaviors, that we investigate in this paper, are the
crystallization and jamming of grains in liquids with velocities higher than
that for incipient fluidization, supposed to maintain the grains fluidized. In
our experiments, performed in a vertical tube of transparent material,
different grains, water velocities, resting times, and velocity decelerations
were used. An analysis of the bed evolution based on image processing shows
that, after a decreasing flow that reaches a velocity still higher than that

high compactness, where they are trapped though with small fluctuations. These
structures are initially localized and grow along time, in a similar manner as
happens in phase transitions and glass formation. After a certain time, if the
liquid velocity is slightly increased, jamming occurs, with grains being
completely blocked and their fluctuation disappearing. We show that different
lattice structures appear depending on the grain type. Our results provide new

designed to express complex properties of strategic abilities in distributed

model-checking problem is decidable when information on the control states of
the system is hierarchical among the players or components of the system,
meaning that the players or components can be totally ordered according to
their respective knowledge of the state. We show that moving from finite to
infinite systems generated by collapsible (higher-order) pushdown systems
preserves decidability, under the natural restriction that the stack content is
visible. The proof follows the same lines as in the case of finite systems, but
requires to use (collapsible) alternating pushdown tree automata. Such automata
are undecidable, but semi-alternating pushdown tree automata were introduced
and proved decidable, to study a strategic problem on pushdown systems with two
players. In order to tackle multiple players with hierarchical information, we
refine further these automata: we define direction-guided (collapsible)
pushdown tree automata, and show that they are stable under projection,
nondeterminisation and narrowing. For the latter operation, used to deal with
imperfect information, stability holds under some assumption that is satisfied
when used for systems with visible stack. We then use these automata to prove

compared to that of coherent light readout in the same system. To investigate
the quantum properties of the two-mode squeezed light in the system, we also
studied weak measurement and found, surprisingly, that tuning the

increase in the quantum efficiency of our readout relative to the optimum
setting for projective measurement. These enhancements may enable remote
entanglement with lower efficiency components in a system with qubits in both

freedom to both the front and back surfaces independently, which enables to
reproduce misalignments and manufacturing errors commonly found in X-ray
lenses. For the cases where simply tilting and transversely offsetting the
parabolic sections of a CRL is not enough, we present the possibility of
generating the figure errors by using Zernike and Legendre polynomials or
directly adding metrology data to the lenses. We present the effects of each
new degree of freedom by calculating their impact on point spread function and

that utilizes partial modeling compensation. Sliding mode control is well known
for its effectiveness as a model free control approach, however, its
effectiveness is degraded if there is a constraint on the control gain or
limitation on the switching frequency in digital implementation. This is
especially the case with systems that involve static friction. This approach
aims to enhance the effectiveness of SMC by partial model compensation.
Rigorous stability proofs are presented to validate the approach. In addition,
experiments are carried out on a piezoelectric motor driven linear stage and
the control approach is compared with the Discrete-Time Integral Sliding Mode

The results show that the proposed control approach has a superior performance

constraint solving over strings. A word equation relates two words over string
variables and constants. Its solution amounts to a function mapping variables
to constant strings that equate the left and right hand sides of the equation.
While the problem of solving word equations is decidable, the decidability of
the problem of solving a word equation with a length constraint (i.e., a
constraint relating the lengths of words in the word equation) has remained a
long-standing open problem. We focus on the subclass of quadratic word
equations, i.e., in which each variable occurs at most twice. We first show
that the length abstractions of solutions to quadratic word equations are in
general not Presburger-definable. We then describe a class of counter systems
with Presburger transition relations which capture the length abstraction of a
quadratic word equation with regular constraints. We provide an encoding of the
effect of a simple loop of the counter systems in the existential theory of
Presburger Arithmetic with divisibility (PAD). Since PAD is decidable (NP-hard
and is in NEXP), we obtain a decision procedure for quadratic words equations
with length constraints for which the associated counter system is flat (i.e.,
all nodes belong to at most one cycle). In particular, we show a decidability
result (in fact, also an NP algorithm with a PAD oracle) for a recently
proposed NP-complete fragment of word equations called regular-oriented word
equations, when augmented with length constraints. We extend this decidability
result (in fact, with a complexity upper bound of PSPACE with a PAD oracle) in
the presence of regular constraints.

and inference. A basic operation in this paradigm is the one where a device
offloads classification tasks to the edge servers. We term this remote
classification, with a potential to enable intelligent applications. Remote
classification is challenged by the finite and variable data rate of the
wireless channel, which affects the capability to transfer high-dimensional
features and thus limits the classification resolution. We introduce a set of
metrics under the name of classification capacity that are defined as the
maximum number of classes that can be discerned over a given communication
channel while meeting a target classification error probability. The objective
is to choose a subset of classes from a library that offers satisfactory
performance over a given channel. We treat two cases of subset selection.
First, a device can select the subset by pruning the class library until
arriving at a subset that meets the targeted error probability while maximizing
the classification capacity. Adopting a subspace data model, we prove the
equivalence of classification capacity maximization to Grassmannian packing.
The results show that the classification capacity grows exponentially with the
instantaneous communication rate, and super-exponentially with the dimensions
of each data cluster. This also holds for ergodic and outage capacities with
fading if the instantaneous rate is replaced with an average rate and a fixed
rate, respectively. In the second case, a device has a preference of class
subset for every communication rate, which is modeled as an instance of
uniformly sampling the library. Without class selection, the classification
capacity and its ergodic and outage counterparts are proved to scale linearly
with their corresponding communication rates instead of the exponential growth
in the last case.

prediction where spatiotemporal traffic data is aggregated into sequentially
organized matrices that are then fed into convolution-based residual neural
networks. However, the widely known modifiable areal unit problem within such
aggregation processes can lead to perturbations in the network inputs. This
issue can significantly destabilize the feature embeddings and the predictions,
rendering deep networks much less useful for the experts. This paper approaches
this challenge by leveraging unit visualization techniques that enable the
investigation of many-to-many relationships between dynamically varied
multi-scalar aggregations of urban traffic data and neural network predictions.
Through regular exchanges with a domain expert, we design and develop a visual
analytics solution that integrates 1) a Bivariate Map equipped with an advanced
bivariate colormap to simultaneously depict input traffic and prediction errors
across space, 2) a Morans I Scatterplot that provides local indicators of
spatial association analysis, and 3) a Multi-scale Attribution View that
arranges non-linear dot plots in a tree layout to promote model analysis and
comparison across scales. We evaluate our approach through a series of case
studies involving a real-world dataset of Shenzhen taxi trips, and through
interviews with domain experts. We observe that geographical scale variations
have important impact on prediction performances, and interactive visual
exploration of dynamically varying inputs and outputs benefit experts in the

spin-singlet $d+id$ pairing superconductivity is present when the filling is
around the Dirac point. If the Fermi level is doped to the Van Hove singularity

with other pairing symmetry would appear. However, the experimental perspective
was a bit disappointing. Despite extensive experimental efforts,
superconductivity was not found in monolayer graphene. Recently, unconventional

Superconductivity was also found in ABC stacked trilayer graphene and other

superconductivity in trilayer graphene. These discoveries have attracted the

point clouds for the accurate segmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel
cascaded non-local module, which consists of the neighborhood-level,
superpoint-level and global-level non-local blocks. First, in the
neighborhood-level block, we extract the local features of the centroid points
of point clouds by assigning different weights to the neighboring points. The
extracted local features of the centroid points are then used to encode the
superpoint-level block with the non-local operation. Finally, the global-level
block aggregates the non-local features of the superpoints for semantic
segmentation in an encoder-decoder framework. Benefiting from the cascaded
structure, geometric structure information of different neighborhoods with the
same label can be propagated. In addition, the cascaded structure can largely
reduce the computational cost of the original non-local operation on point
clouds. Experiments on different indoor and outdoor datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance and effectively reduces the time

Minkowski tensors, in general, and the quadratic normal tensor, in particular,

makes them suitable and robust for large-scale applications. We present a
modular algorithm for computing the quadratic normal tensor of digital

examples and apply our approach to a variety of microstructures. Strikingly,
the presented algorithm remains unaffected by inaccurate computation of the

users out of a large number of $n$ potential users need to be scheduled in
$b\ge k$ slots. What is the minimum common feedback to the users needed to
ensure that scheduling is collision-free? Instead of a naive scheme of listing
the indices of the $k$ active users in the order in which they should transmit,
at a cost of $k\log(n)$ bits, this paper shows that for the case of $b=k$, the
rate of the minimum fixed-length common feedback code scales only as $k
\log(e)$ bits, plus an additive term that scales in $n$ as $\Theta \left(\log
\log(n) \right)$ for fixed $k$. If a variable-length code can be used, assuming
uniform activity among the users, the minimum average common feedback rate
still requires $k \log(e)$ bits, but the dependence on $n$ can be reduced to
$O(1)$. When $b>k$, the number of feedback bits needed for collision-free
scheduling can be significantly further reduced. Moreover, a similar scaling on
the minimum feedback rate is derived for the case of scheduling $m$ users per
slot, when $k \le mb$. The problem of constructing a minimum collision-free
feedback scheduling code is connected to that of constructing a perfect hashing
family, which allows practical feedback scheduling codes to be constructed from
perfect hashing algorithms.

off-centered impurities, which relax symmetry selection rules. Charges on the

destroy these phases. We investigate the behavior of topological states in
quantum walks in the presence of a lossy environment. The environmental effects
in the quantum walk dynamics are addressed using the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
approach. We show that the topological phases of the quantum walks are robust
against moderate losses. The topological order in one-dimensional split-step
quantum walk persists as long as the Hamiltonian is $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric.
Although the topological nature persists in two-dimensional quantum walks as
well, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry has no role to play there. Furthermore, we
observe the noise-induced topological phase transition in two-dimensional
quantum walks.

sequentially deposited donor and acceptor layers (sq-BHJ) have recently been
promising to be highly efficient, environmentally friendly, and compatible with
large area and roll-to-toll fabrication. However, the related photophysics at
donor-acceptor interface and the vertical heterogeneity of donor-acceptor
distribution, critical for exciton dissociation and device performance, are
largely unexplored. Herein, steady-state and time-resolved optical and
electrical techniques are employed to characterize the interfacial trap states.
Correlation with the luminescent efficiency of interfacial states and its
non-radiative recombination, interfacial trap states are characterized to be
about 50% more populated in the sq-BHJ than as-cast BHJ (c-BHJ), which probably
limits the device voltage output. Cross-sectional energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy depth profiling
directly vizualize the donor-acceptor vertical stratification with a precision
of 1-2 nm. From the proposed ""needle"" model, the high exciton dissociation
efficiency is rationalized. Our study highlights the promise of sequential
deposition to fabricate efficient solar cells, and points towards improving the
voltage output and overall device performance via eliminating interfacial trap

It requires a large group diversity of opinions, but the collective error, the
difference between the average opinion and the true value, has to be small. We
consider a stochastic opinion dynamics where individuals can change their
opinion based on the opinions of others (social influence $\alpha$), but to
some degree also stick to their initial opinion (individual conviction
$\beta$). We then derive analytic expressions for the dynamics of the
collective error and the group diversity. We analyze their long-term behavior
to determine the impact of the two parameters $(\alpha,\beta)$ and the initial
opinion distribution on the wisdom of crowds. This allows us to quantify the
ambiguous role of social influence: only if the initial collective error is
large, it helps to improve the wisdom of crowds, but in most cases it
deteriorates the outcome. In these cases, individual conviction still improves
the wisdom of crowds because it mitigates the impact of social influence.

crucial task in quantum mechanics. For this reason, an eigensolver is a
fundamental algorithm for any quantum technology. In this work, we implement a
semi-autonomous algorithm to obtain an approximation of the eigenvectors of an
arbitrary Hermitian operator using the IBM quantum computer. To this end, we
only use single-shot measurements and pseudo-random changes handled by a
feedback loop, reducing the number of measures in the system. Due to the
classical feedback loop, this algorithm can be cast into the reinforcement
learning paradigm. Using this algorithm, for a single-qubit observable, we
obtain both eigenvectors with fidelities over 0.97 with around 200 single-shot
measurements. For two-qubits observables, we get fidelities over 0.91 with
around 1500 single-shot measurements for the four eigenvectors, which is a
comparatively low resource demand, suitable for current devices. This work is
useful to the development of quantum devices able to decide with partial
information, which helps to implement future technologies in quantum artificial
intelligence.

down the atomic mobility. In addition, the compression induces a rejuvenated

applications, e.g., face recognition and medical image analysis. However,
recent research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to attacks against
their training data. Membership inference is one major attack in this domain:
Given a data sample and model, an adversary aims to determine whether the
sample is part of the model's training set. Existing membership inference
attacks leverage the confidence scores returned by the model as their inputs
(score-based attacks). However, these attacks can be easily mitigated if the
model only exposes the predicted label, i.e., the final model decision.
  In this paper, we propose decision-based membership inference attacks and
demonstrate that label-only exposures are also vulnerable to membership
leakage. In particular, we develop two types of decision-based attacks, namely
transfer attack, and boundary attack. Empirical evaluation shows that our
decision-based attacks can achieve remarkable performance, and even outperform
the previous score-based attacks in some cases. We further present new insights
on the success of membership inference based on quantitative and qualitative
analysis, i.e., member samples of a model are more distant to the model's
decision boundary than non-member samples. Finally, we evaluate multiple
defense mechanisms against our decision-based attacks and show that our two
types of attacks can bypass most of these defenses.

identities) in the community, but does not completely eliminate them. The main
goal of the protocol is to be resilient to the sybils that penetrate the
community, in the sense that, in the long run, only genuine identities mint
coins. The protocol accepts that sybils penetrate the community from time to
time (by gaining enough trust within the trust-graph), yet assumes that every
sybil is eventually exposed. Since coins minted by a sybil will most probably
circulate by the time it is exposed, the protocol puts the responsibility for
introducing a sybil onto its trusting neighbours and confiscates subsequent
coins minted by them, until the coins minted by that sybil are accounted for.
In particular, the protocol confiscates two coins for each coin minted by the
sybil: one to recover what was wrongly minted and one as a fine for introducing
the sybil in the first place. We argue that this approach constitutes a
mechanism to deter the introduction of sybils into the community and to
incentivize sybil hunting (using part of the confiscated money as a reward).

rarest Standard Model processes observed in nature. Its neutrinoless
counterpart is an exotic lepton-number nonconserving process that is widely
searched for to determine if the neutrinos are Majorana fermions. In order to
connect the rate of these processes to the Standard Model and beyond the
Standard Model interactions, it is essential that the corresponding nuclear
matrix elements are constrained reliably from theory. Lattice quantum
chromodynamics (LQCD) and low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) are
expected to play an essential role in constraining the matrix element of the
two-nucleon subprocess, which could in turn provide the input into ab initio
nuclear-structure calculations in larger isotopes. Focusing on the two-neutrino
process $nn \to pp \, (ee \bar{\nu}_e\bar{\nu}_e)$, the amplitude is
constructed in this work in pionless EFT at next-to-leading order,
demonstrating the emergence of a renormalization-scale independent amplitude
and the absence of any new low-energy constant at this order beyond those
present in the single-weak process. Most importantly, it is shown how a LQCD
four-point correlation function in Euclidean and finite-volume spacetime can be
used to constrain the Minkowski infinite-volume amplitude in the EFT. The same
formalism is provided for the related single-weak process, which is an input to
the double-$\beta$ decay formalism. The LQCD-EFT matching procedure outlined
for the double-weak amplitude paves the road toward constraining the
two-nucleon matrix element entering the neutrinoless double-beta decay
amplitude with a light Majorana neutrino.

  Kinetic Ising Model",,,,,"q-fin.ST cond-mat.dis-nn physics.data-an physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A common issue when analyzing real-world complex systems is that the
interactions between the elements often change over time: this makes it
difficult to find optimal models that describe this evolution and that can be
estimated from data, particularly when the driving mechanisms are not known.
Here we offer a new perspective on the development of models for time-varying
interactions introducing a generalization of the well-known Kinetic Ising Model
(KIM), a minimalistic pairwise constant interactions model which has found
applications in multiple scientific disciplines. Keeping arbitrary choices of
dynamics to a minimum and seeking information theoretical optimality, the
Score-Driven methodology lets us significantly increase the knowledge that can
be extracted from data using the simple KIM. In particular, we first identify a
parameter whose value at a given time can be directly associated with the local
predictability of the dynamics. Then we introduce a method to dynamically learn
the value of such parameter from the data, without the need of specifying
parametrically its dynamics. Finally, we extend our framework to disentangle
different sources (e.g. endogenous vs exogenous) of predictability in real
time.
  We apply our methodology to several complex systems including financial
markets, temporal (social) networks, and neuronal populations. Our results show
that the Score-Driven KIM produces insightful descriptions of the systems,
allowing to predict forecasting accuracy in real time as well as to separate
different components of the dynamics. This provides a significant
methodological improvement for data analysis in a wide range of disciplines.

challenging scenarios in robotics, such as high-speed and high dynamic range

acquired by a stereo event-based camera rig. Our system follows a parallel
tracking-and-mapping approach, where novel solutions to each subproblem (3D
reconstruction and camera pose estimation) are developed with two objectives in
mind: being principled and efficient, for real-time operation with commodity
hardware. To this end, we seek to maximize the spatio-temporal consistency of
stereo event-based data while using a simple and efficient representation.
Specifically, the mapping module builds a semi-dense 3D map of the scene by
fusing depth estimates from multiple local viewpoints (obtained by
spatio-temporal consistency) in a probabilistic fashion. The tracking module
recovers the pose of the stereo rig by solving a registration problem that
naturally arises due to the chosen map and event data representation.
Experiments on publicly available datasets and on our own recordings
demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method in natural scenes with
general 6-DoF motion. The system successfully leverages the advantages of
event-based cameras to perform visual odometry in challenging illumination
conditions, such as low-light and high dynamic range, while running in

material standards in the pursuit of macroeconmic improvement. Second, this
article discusses four theories in distributive ethics (maximization,
egalitarianianism, prioritarianiasm, and sufficientarianism) to identify which

compared, across the growing season and from year to year. The proposed method
is evaluated both in simulation and field experiments. Field experiments were
performed at four sites, which varied in vineyard structure and vine

or process that underlies an observed relationship between an exposure variable

mediation pathways and interactions have gained an increasing amount of

scenarios where the two mediators are causally sequential or non-sequential.
Current developments in this area have primarily focused on either
decompositions without interaction components or with interactions but assuming
no causally sequential order between the mediators. We propose a new concept
called natural counterfactual interaction effect that captures the two-way and
three-way interactions for both scenarios that extend the two-way mediated
interactions in literature. We develop a unified approach for decomposing the
total effect into the effects that are due to mediation only, interaction only,
both mediation and interaction, neither mediation nor interaction within the
counterfactual framework. Finally, we illustrate the proposed decomposition

field of video surveillance, which has wide-spread applications including crowd

understanding is the most fundamental task in crowd analysis because of its
finer results for video sequences or still images than other analysis tasks.
Unfortunately, pixel-level understanding needs a large amount of labeled
training data. Annotating them is an expensive work, which causes that current
crowd datasets are small. As a result, most algorithms suffer from over-fitting
to varying degrees. In this paper, take crowd counting and segmentation as
examples from the pixel-wise crowd understanding, we attempt to remedy these
problems from two aspects, namely data and methodology. Firstly, we develop a
free data collector and labeler to generate synthetic and labeled crowd scenes
in a computer game, Grand Theft Auto V. Then we use it to construct a
large-scale, diverse synthetic crowd dataset, which is named as ""GCC Dataset"".
Secondly, we propose two simple methods to improve the performance of crowd
understanding via exploiting the synthetic data. To be specific, 1) supervised
crowd understanding: pre-train a crowd analysis model on the synthetic data,
then fine-tune it using the real data and labels, which makes the model perform
better on the real world; 2) crowd understanding via domain adaptation:
translate the synthetic data to photo-realistic images, then train the model on
translated data and labels. As a result, the trained model works well in real
crowd scenes.

employ the delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) algorithm to identify
the parameters. We adjust the algorithm to estimate parameters according to a
hydraulic fracture observation, i.e., the maximum pressure. The focus is on
uncertainties arising from different variables, including elasticity modulus,
Biot's coefficient, Biot's modulus, dynamic fluid viscosity, and Griffith's
energy release rate in the case of the isotropic hydraulic fracture while in
the anisotropic setting, we identify additional penalty-like parameters.

constraints in an ontology such as in the paradigm of Ontology-Based Data
Access (OBDA). In classical OBDA, a high-level query is answered by
transforming it into a query on data source level. The transformation requires
a rewriting step, where knowledge from an ontology is incorporated into the
query, followed by an unfolding step with respect to a set of mappings. Given
an OBDA setting it is very difficult to decide, whether and how a query can be
answered efficiently. In particular it is difficult to decide whether a query
can be answered in bounded memory, i.e., in constant space w.r.t. an infinitely
growing prefix of a data stream. This work presents criteria for bounded-memory
computability of select-project-join (SPJ) queries over streams with
application time. Deciding whether an SPJ query can be answered in constant
space is easier than for high-level queries, as neither an ontology nor a set

significant asymmetry between the number of SDSS galaxies with opposite spin

direction of observation and with the redshift. The redshift dependence shows
that the distribution of the spin direction of SDSS galaxies becomes more
asymmetric as the redshift gets higher. Fitting the distribution of the galaxy
spin directions to a quadrupole alignment provides fitness with statistical
significance >5$\sigma$, which grows to >8$\sigma$ when just galaxies with
z>0.15 are used. Similar analysis with Pan-STARRS galaxies provides dipole and
quadrupole alignments nearly identical to the analysis of SDSS galaxies,
showing that the source of the asymmetry is not necessarily a certain unknown
flaw in a specific telescope system. While these observations are clearly
provocative, there is no known error that could exhibit itself in such form.
The data analysis process is fully automatic, and uses deterministic and
symmetric algorithms with defined rules. It does not involve either manual
analysis that can lead to human perceptual bias, or machine learning that can
capture human biases or other subtle differences that are difficult to identify

Reinforcement learning by policy optimization would be a natural way to solve
this due to its ability to address stochasticity, plant-model mismatch, and
directly account for the effect of future uncertainty and its feedback in a
proper closed-loop manner; all without the need of an inner optimization loop.
One of the main reasons why reinforcement learning has not been considered for
industrial processes (or almost any engineering application) is that it lacks a
framework to deal with safety critical constraints. Present algorithms for
policy optimization use difficult-to-tune penalty parameters, fail to reliably
satisfy state constraints or present guarantees only in expectation. We propose
a chance constrained policy optimization (CCPO) algorithm which guarantees the
satisfaction of joint chance constraints with a high probability - which is
crucial for safety critical tasks. This is achieved by the introduction of
constraint tightening (backoffs), which are computed simultaneously with the
feedback policy. Backoffs are adjusted with Bayesian optimization using the
empirical cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic constraints,
and are therefore self-tuned. This results in a general methodology that can be
imbued into present policy optimization algorithms to enable them to satisfy
joint chance constraints with high probability. We present case studies that
analyze the performance of the proposed approach.

report our results for the MIMIC-III dataset, which outperform previous work
among models of the same families, as well as the state of the art. Compared to
MIMIC-III, the Brazilian Portuguese dataset contains far fewer words per

challenging. Long periods of transient flow and steep potential gradients occur
due to the extreme conductivity contrast between matrix and fracture. Detailed
near-well/near-fracture models are necessary to provide sufficient resolution,
but they are computationally impractical for field cases with multiple fracture
stages. Previous works in the literature of unconventional simulations mainly
focus on gridding level that adapts to wells and fractures. Limited research
has been conducted on nonlinear strategies that exploit locality across
timesteps and nonlinear iterations. To perform localized computations, an
a-priori strategy is essential to first determine the active subset of
simulation cells for the subsequent iteration. The active set flags the cells
that will be updated, and then the corresponding localized linear system is
solved. This work develops localization methods that are readily applicable to
complex fracture networks and flow physics in unconventional reservoirs. By
utilizing the diffusive nature of pressure updates, an adaptive algorithm is
proposed to make adequate estimates for the active domains. In addition, we
develop a localized solver based on nonlinear domain decomposition (DD).
Comparing to a standard DD method, domain partitions are dynamically
constructed. The new solver provides effective partitioning that adapts to flow
dynamics and Newton updates. We evaluate the developed methods using several
complex problems with discrete fracture networks. The results show that large
degrees of solution locality present across timesteps and iterations. Comparing
to a standard Newton solver, the new solvers enable superior computational
performance. Moreover, Newton convergence behavior is preserved, without any
impact on solution accuracy.

based on audio-based classification. This thesis aims to design and evaluate a

is that a well designed text-based approach poses a strong competition against
the state-of-the-art audio based approaches. Dutch natural language models are
being limited by the scarcity of pre-trained monolingual NLP models, as a
result Dutch natural language models have a low capture of long range semantic
dependencies over sentences. For this issue, this thesis presents belabBERT, a
new Dutch language model extending the RoBERTa[15] architecture. belabBERT is
trained on a large Dutch corpus (+32GB) of web crawled texts. After this thesis
evaluates the strength of text-based classification, a brief exploration is
done, extending the framework to a hybrid text- and audio-based classification.
The goal of this hybrid framework is to show the principle of hybridisation
with a very basic audio-classification network. The overall goal is to create
the foundations for a hybrid psychiatric illness classification, by proving
that the new text-based classification is already a strong stand-alone
solution.

the development of intelligent systems and agents will reshape vital areas in
our society. Nevertheless, if such an advance is not made prudently and
critically, reflexively, it can result in negative outcomes for humanity. For
this reason, several researchers in the area have developed a robust,
beneficial, and safe concept of AI for the preservation of humanity and the
environment. Currently, several of the open problems in the field of AI
research arise from the difficulty of avoiding unwanted behaviors of
intelligent agents and systems, and at the same time specifying what we really
want such systems to do, especially when we look for the possibility of
intelligent agents acting in several domains over the long term. It is of
utmost importance that artificial intelligent agents have their values aligned
with human values, given the fact that we cannot expect an AI to develop human
moral values simply because of its intelligence, as discussed in the
Orthogonality Thesis. Perhaps this difficulty comes from the way we are
addressing the problem of expressing objectives, values, and ends, using
representational cognitive methods. A solution to this problem would be the
dynamic approach proposed by Dreyfus, whose phenomenological philosophy shows
that the human experience of being-in-the-world in several aspects is not well
represented by the symbolic or connectionist cognitive method, especially in
regards to the question of learning values. A possible approach to this problem
would be to use theoretical models such as SED (situated embodied dynamics) to
address the values learning problem in AI.

Wave (BAW) resonator through the photoelastic properties of the crystal, via
the coupling to a microwave cavity enhanced by a photonic lambda scheme. This
is achieved by imbedding a single crystal BAW resonator between the post and
the adjacent wall of a microwave reentrant cavity resonator. This 3D photonic
lumped LC resonator at the same time acts as the electrodes of a BAW phonon
resonator, and allows the direct readout of coherent phonons via the linear
piezoelectric response of the quartz. A microwave pump, $\omega_p$ is tuned to
the cavity resonance $\omega_0$, while a probe frequency, $\omega_{probe}$, is
detuned and varied around the red and blue detuned values with respect to the
BAW phonon frequency, $\Omega_m$. The pump and probe power dependence of the
generated phonons unequivocally determines the process to be electrostrictive,
with the phonons produced at the difference frequency between pump and probe,
with no back action effects involved. Thus, the phonons are created without
threshold and can be considered analogous to a Coherent Population Trapped
(CPT) maser scheme.
