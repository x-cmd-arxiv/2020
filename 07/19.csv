in open Floquet systems, where dissipation enables the system to reach a
well-defined Floquet steady state of finite entropy, and all observables are
synchronized with the drive. We provide a detailed description of how to
combine Keldysh and Floquet formalisms to account for the critical fluctuations
in the weakly and rapidly driven regime. A key insight is that a reduction to
the time-averaged, static sector, is not possible close to the critical point.
This guides the design of a perturbative dynamic RG approach, which treats the
time-dependent, dynamic sector associated to higher harmonics of the drive, on
an equal footing with the time-averaged sector. Within this framework, we
develop a weak drive expansion scheme, which enables to systematically truncate
the RG flow equations in powers of the inverse drive frequency $\Omega^{-1}$.
This allows us to show how a periodic drive inhibits scale invariance and
critical fluctuations of second order phase transitions in rapidly driven open
systems: Although criticality emerges in the limit $\Omega^{-1}=0$, any finite
drive frequency produces a scale that remains finite all through the phase
transition. This is a universal mechanism that relies on the competition of the
critical fluctuations within the static and dynamic sectors of the problem.

retrieval, due to the multi-dimensional and multi-modal context of the
underlying content. Traditional models often fail to take the intrinsic
characteristics of data into consideration, and have thus achieved limited
accuracy when applied to medical images. The Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) is a
technique that can be used to effectively represent intrinsic image features in
vector space, so that applications like image classification and similar-image
search can be optimized. In this paper, we present a MedIR approach based on
the BoVW model for content-based medical image retrieval. As medical images as
multi-dimensional, they exhibit underlying cluster and manifold information
which enhances semantic relevance and allows for label uniformity. Hence, the
BoVW features extracted for each image are used to train a supervised machine
learning classifier based on positive and negative training images, for
extending content based image retrieval. During experimental validation, the
proposed model performed very well, achieving a Mean Average Precision of
88.89% during top-3 image retrieval experiments.

with the human brain to facilitate recording, stimulation, and inhibition of

shifted towards miniaturization of devices that can be seamlessly embedded into
the brain and can target single neuron or small population sensing and control.
We present a motivating example highlighting vulnerabilities of two promising
micron-scale BCI technologies, demonstrating the lack of security and privacy
principles in existing solutions. This situation opens the door to a novel
family of cyberattacks, called neuronal cyberattacks, affecting neuronal
signaling. This paper defines the first two neural cyberattacks, Neuronal
Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal Scanning (SCA), where each threat can affect the
natural activity of neurons. This work implements these attacks in a neuronal
simulator to determine their impact over the spontaneous neuronal behavior,
defining three metrics: number of spikes, percentage of shifts, and dispersion
of spikes. Several experiments demonstrate that both cyberattacks produce a
reduction of spikes compared to spontaneous behavior, generating a rise in
temporal shifts and a dispersion increase. Mainly, SCA presents a higher impact
than FLO in the metrics focused on the number of spikes and dispersion, where
FLO is slightly more damaging, considering the percentage of shifts.
Nevertheless, the intrinsic behavior of each attack generates a differentiation
on how they alter neuronal signaling. FLO is adequate to generate an immediate
impact on the neuronal activity, whereas SCA presents higher effectiveness for
damages to the neural signaling in the long-term.

as encoded in outgoing Hawking radiation. The present approach goes beyond the

galaxies and the stability of differentially rotating, self-gravitating flows.
Donald introduced the ideas of `violent relaxation' and `the gravothermal
catastrophe' in pioneering work on the thermodynamics of galaxies and negative
heat capacities. He shared the inaugural Kavli Prize in Astrophysics in 2008
for his contributions to our understanding of quasars. His prediction that dead
quasars or supermassive black holes may reside in the nuclei of nearby galaxies
has been confirmed by multiple pieces of independent evidence. His work on
accretion discs led to new insights into their workings, as well as the
realisation that the infrared excess in T Tauri stars was caused by
protostellar discs around these young stars. He introduced the influential idea
of monolithic collapse of a gas cloud as a formation mechanism for the Milky
Way Galaxy. As this gave way to modern ideas of merging and accretion as
drivers of galaxy formation, Donald was the first to realise the importance of
tidal streams as measures of the past history and present day gravity field of
the Galaxy. Though primarily a theorist, Donald participated in one of the
first observational programs to measure the large-scale streaming of nearby
galaxies. This led to the discovery of the `Great Attractor'. The depth and
versatility of his contributions mark Donald out as one of the most influential

  Spotting","Accepted by ECCV 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent end-to-end trainable methods for scene text spotting, integrating
detection and recognition, showed much progress. However, most of the current
arbitrary-shape scene text spotters use region proposal networks (RPN) to
produce proposals. RPN relies heavily on manually designed anchors and its
proposals are represented with axis-aligned rectangles. The former presents
difficulties in handling text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular
shapes, and the latter often includes multiple neighboring instances into a
single proposal, in cases of densely oriented text. To tackle these problems,
we propose Mask TextSpotter v3, an end-to-end trainable scene text spotter that
adopts a Segmentation Proposal Network (SPN) instead of an RPN. Our SPN is
anchor-free and gives accurate representations of arbitrary-shape proposals. It
is therefore superior to RPN in detecting text instances of extreme aspect
ratios or irregular shapes. Furthermore, the accurate proposals produced by SPN
allow masked RoI features to be used for decoupling neighboring text instances.
As a result, our Mask TextSpotter v3 can handle text instances of extreme
aspect ratios or irregular shapes, and its recognition accuracy won't be
affected by nearby text or background noise. Specifically, we outperform
state-of-the-art methods by 21.9 percent on the Rotated ICDAR 2013 dataset
(rotation robustness), 5.9 percent on the Total-Text dataset (shape
robustness), and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MSRA-TD500 dataset
(aspect ratio robustness). Code is available at:

significant performance benefits of 18-68% (metric and dataset dependent) over
the commonly used Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, and the multi-head

mixture of dark and baryonic matter, using the framework of Kinetic Field
Theory (KFT) -- a statistical field theory for classical particle dynamics. So
far, KFT has only been able to describe a single type of particles, sufficient
to consider structure growth due to the gravitational interactions between dark
matter. However, the influence of baryonic gas dynamics becomes increasingly
relevant when describing smaller scales. In this paper, we thus demonstrate how
to extend the KFT formalism as well as a previously presented resummation
scheme towards describing such mixtures of two particle species. Thereby, the
gas dynamics of baryons are accounted for using the recently developed model of
Mesoscopic Particle Hydrodynamics. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM Universe and a
simplified model for the thermal gas evolution, we demonstrate the validity of
this approach by computing the linear evolution of the individual and total
matter power spectra between the epoch of recombination and today. Our results
correctly reproduce the expected behaviour, showing a suppression of both
baryonic and dark matter structure growth on scales smaller than the baryonic
Jeans length, in good agreement with results from the numerical Boltzmann
solver CLASS. Nonlinear corrections within this approach will be investigated
in upcoming works.

majority of these approaches have focused on English, while resource-lean

introduce new methods for sentiment analysis which have been applied on

networks which benefits from word embedding vectors. Both approaches takes
advantage of local discourse information and external knowledge bases, and also
cover several language issues such as negation and intensification,
andaddresses different granularity levels, namely word, aspect, sentence,
phrase and document-levels. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
approach, a Persian dataset is collected from Persian hotel reviews referred as

absorbing phase transition whose universality class has long been disputed.
Multiple studies have indicated that an explicit account of particle pair
degrees of freedom may be required to properly capture this system's effective
long-time, large-scale behavior. We introduce a two-species representation in
which single particles B and pairs A are coupled according to the stochastic
reactions B + B -> A, A -> A + B, A -> 0, and A -> B + B. Mean-field analysis
reveals that the phase transition is driven by competition and balance between
both species. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that this model
captures the pertinent PCPD features. In the inactive phase, A particles
rapidly go extinct, leaving the B species to undergo pure pair annihilation
kinetics. At criticality, both A and B densities decay with the same exponents
as the PCPD order parameters, and display mean-field scaling above the critical
dimension 2. In one dimension, the critical exponents for the B species
obtained from seed simulations agree well with previously reported exponent
values. We demonstrate that the scaling properties of consecutive particle
pairs in the PCPD are identical with that of the A species in the coupled
model. This two-species picture resolves the conceptual difficulty for seed
simulations in the original PCPD and naturally introduces multiple length and
time scales, which cause strong corrections to scaling. The extracted moment
ratios from our simulations indicate that our model displays the same temporal
crossover behavior as the PCPD, which further corroborates its full dynamical
equivalence with our coupled model.

dimension of $G$. A vertex $w\in V(G)$ strongly resolves two distinct vertices
$u,v \in V(G)$ if $u$ belongs to a shortest $v-w$ path or $v$ belongs to a
shortest $u-w$ path. An ordered set $W=\{w_{1},\ldots, w_{t}\}\subseteq V(G)$
is a strong resolving set for $G$ if for every two distinct vertices $u$ and
$v$ of $G$ there exists a vertex $w\in W$ which strongly resolves $u$ and $v$.
A strong metric basis of $G$ is a strong resolving set of minimal cardinality.
The cardinality of a strong metric basis is called strong metric dimension of
$G$. In this paper, we determine the partition dimension and strong metric
dimension of a chain cycle constructed by even cycles and a chain cycle
constructed by odd cycles.

three-dimensional domino is a 2x2x1 rectangular cuboid. We are particularly
interested in regions of the form $R_N = D \times [0,N]$ where $D$ is a fixed
quadriculated disk. In dimension 3, the twist associates to each tiling $t$ an
integer $Tw(t)$. We prove that, when $N$ goes to infinity, the twist follows a
normal distribution.
  A flip is a local move: two neighboring parallel dominoes are removed and
placed back in a different position. The twist is invariant under flips. A
quadriculated disk $D$ is regular if, whenever two tilings $t_0$ and $t_1$ of
$R_N$ satisfy $Tw(t_0) = Tw(t_1)$, $t_0$ and $t_1$ can be joined by a sequence
of flips provided some extra vertical space is allowed. Many large disks are
regular, including rectangles $D = [0,L] \times [0,M]$ with $LM$ even and $L,M
\ge 3$. For regular disks, we describe the larger connected components under
flips of the set of tilings of the region $R_N = D \times [0,N]$. As a
corollary, let $p_N$ be the probability that two random tilings $T_0$ and $T_1$
of $D \times [0,N]$ can be joined by a sequence of flips conditional to their
twists being equal. Then $p_N$ tends to 1 if and only if $D$ is regular.
  Under a suitable equivalence relation, the set of tilings has a group
structure, the domino group. These results illustrate the fact that the domino
group dictates many properties of the space of tilings of the cylinder $R_N = D
\times [0,N]$, particularly for large $N$.

MIX'EM generates representations that by themselves are sufficient to drive a
general-purpose clustering algorithm to deliver high-quality classification.
This is accomplished by building a mixture of embeddings module into a
contrastive visual representation learning framework in order to disentangle
representations at the category level. It first generates a set of embedding
and mixing coefficients from a given visual representation, and then combines
them into a single embedding. We introduce three techniques to successfully
train MIX'EM and avoid degenerate solutions; (i) diversify mixture components
by maximizing entropy, (ii) minimize instance conditioned component entropy to
enforce a clustered embedding space, and (iii) use an associative embedding
loss to enforce semantic separability. By applying (i) and (ii), semantic
categories emerge through the mixture coefficients, making it possible to apply
(iii). Subsequently, we run K-means on the representations to acquire semantic
classification. We conduct extensive experiments and analyses on STL10,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100-20 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art classification
accuracy of 78\%, 82\%, and 44\%, respectively. To achieve robust and high
accuracy, it is essential to use the mixture components to initialize K-means.
Finally, we report competitive baselines (70\% on STL10) obtained by applying
K-means to the ""normalized"" representations learned using the contrastive loss.

jointly model detection, counting, and tracking of multiple targets as a

focused on a ""star"" topology where nodes/devices are each connected to a

between the end devices and the server. Specifically, we develop multi-stage
hybrid federated learning (MH-FL), a hybrid of intra- and inter-layer model
learning that considers the network as a multi-layer cluster-based structure.
MH-FL considers the topology structures among the nodes in the clusters,
including local networks formed via device-to-device (D2D) communications, and
presumes a semi-decentralized architecture for federated learning. It
orchestrates the devices at different network layers in a
collaborative/cooperative manner (i.e., using D2D interactions) to form local
consensus on the model parameters and combines it with multi-stage parameter
relaying between layers of the tree-shaped hierarchy. We derive the upper bound
of convergence for MH-FL with respect to parameters of the network topology
(e.g., the spectral radius) and the learning algorithm (e.g., the number of D2D
rounds in different clusters). We obtain a set of policies for the D2D rounds
at different clusters to guarantee either a finite optimality gap or
convergence to the global optimum. We then develop a distributed control
algorithm for MH-FL to tune the D2D rounds in each cluster over time to meet
specific convergence criteria. Our experiments on real-world datasets verify

on engaging with them to learn their intent. We model cyber deception as a
sequential decision-making problem in a two-agent context. We introduce
factored finitely nested interactive POMDPs (I-POMDPx) and use this framework
to model the problem with multiple attacker types. Our approach models cyber
attacks on a single honeypot host across multiple phases from the attacker's
initial entry to reaching its adversarial objective. The defending
I-POMDPx-based agent uses decoys to engage with the attacker at multiple phases
to form increasingly accurate predictions of the attacker's behavior and
intent. The use of I-POMDPs also enables us to model the adversary's mental
state and investigate how deception affects their beliefs. Our experiments in
both simulation and on a real host show that the I-POMDPx-based agent performs
significantly better at intent recognition than commonly used deception
strategies on honeypots.

sample of molecular clouds from the simulation to investigate the supernova
energy injection and the resulting properties of molecular clouds. We find that
molecular clouds have a lifetime of a few dynamical times, less then half of
them contract to the point of becoming gravitationally bound, and the dispersal
time of bound clouds, of order one dynamical time, is a factor of two shorter
than that of unbound clouds. We stress the importance of internal supernovae,
that is massive stars that explode inside their parent cloud, in setting the
cloud dispersal time, and their huge overdensity compared to models where the
supernovae are randomly distributed. We also quantify the energy injection
efficiency of supernovae as a function of supernova distance to the clouds. We
conclude that intermittent driving by supernovae can maintain molecular-cloud
turbulence and may be the main process of cloud dispersal. The role of
supernovae in the evolution of molecular clouds cannot be fully accounted for
without a self-consistent implementation of their feedback.

Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity, by using the ""Complexity-Volume"" proposal.
Specifically, we calculate the growth rate of complexity for an eternal charged
AdS-dilaton black holes with fixed and dynamical boundaries respectively. The
dynamical boundary is achieved by introducing a moving self-graviting brane on
which the induced metric has an exact FLRW form. In case of fixed AdS boundary,
there exists a bound for evolution of growth rate on late time, while this
bound will become larger as the dilaton coupling constant $\alpha$ increases.
In large $\alpha$ limit, we analytically prove that this bound is a finite
value which is proportional to the black hole mass. In case of dynamical
boundary, namely the brane-bulk system, the growth rate decreases monotonously
on late time, after reaching a maximum value at a certain time. We find that
the evolution of growth rate for brane-bulk system on late time is dominated by
the velocity of the moving brane. We guess this result is model-independent.

An observer in uniform circular motion experiences a similar Unruh-type

read-out is obtained via AC-coupling. The truly innovative feature of RSD is
that the signal generated by an impinging particle is shared isotropically
among multiple read-out pads without the need for floating electrodes or an
external magnetic field. Careful tuning of the coupling oxide thickness and the
$n^+$ doping profile is at the basis of the successful functioning of this

additional noise. It is thus imperative to reduce noise measurements and boost

years and has particularly boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fast growth
is not without its challenge. In 2016, due to low concentrations of memberships
and far distance from the depot, certain minority neighborhoods were excluded
from receiving Amazon's SDD service, raising concerns about fairness. In this
paper, we study the problem of offering fair SDD-service to customers. The
service area is partitioned into different regions. Over the course of a day,
customers request for SDD service, and the timing of requests and delivery
locations are not known in advance. The dispatcher dynamically assigns vehicles
to make deliveries to accepted customers before their delivery deadline. In
addition to the overall service rate (utility), we maximize the minimal
regional service rate across all regions (fairness). We model the problem as a
multi-objective Markov decision process and develop a deep Q-learning solution
approach. We introduce a novel transformation of learning from rates to actual
services, which creates a stable and efficient learning process. Computational
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in alleviating unfairness
both spatially and temporally in different customer geographies. We also show
this effectiveness is valid with different depot locations, providing
businesses with an opportunity to achieve better fairness from any location.
Further, we consider the impact of ignoring fairness in service, and results
show that our policies eventually outperform the utility-driven baseline when
customers have a high expectation on service level.

survival analysis can predict the probability of progression to late AMD using
3,298 participants (over 80,000 images) from the Age-Related Eye Disease

validated against an independent test dataset of 601 participants, our model
achieved high prognostic accuracy (five-year C-statistic 86.4 (95% confidence

using two existing clinical standards (81.3 (81.1-81.5) and 82.0 (81.8-82.3),

existing clinical standards in AMD prognosis (e.g., risk ascertainment above

data from 82 US retinal specialty clinics. Indeed, during external validation
through training on AREDS and testing on AREDS2 as an independent cohort, our

$\lambda_1(\mathcal{L}) \geq \Omega(\sqrt{n}) \cdot \det(\mathcal{L})^{1/n}$,
so that our algorithm finds vectors that are as short as possible relative to
the determinant (up to a polylogarithmic factor).
  The main technical contribution behind this result is new analysis of (a
simpler variant of) an algorithm from arXiv:1412.7994, which was only
previously known to solve less useful problems. To achieve this, we rely
crucially on the ``reverse Minkowski theorem'' (conjectured by Dadush

partial converse to the fact that $\lambda_1(\mathcal{L}) \leq \sqrt{n}

  Previously, the fastest known algorithm for finding such a vector was the

\lambda_1(\mathcal{L})$. Though we do not show how to find lattice vectors with
this length in time $2^{n/2+o(n)}$, we do show that our algorithm suffices for
the most important application of such algorithms: basis reduction. In
particular, we show a modified version of Gama and Nguyen's slide-reduction

layers. Though it is parameter-efficient in design, it leads to inconsistent
accuracy variations at different resolutions, for which we provide a detailed
analysis from the aspect of the train-test recognition discrepancy. A
multi-resolution ensemble distillation is further designed, where a teacher is
learnt on the fly as a weighted ensemble over resolutions. Thanks to the

considerably in the past decade. However, no equivalent understanding of dreams
has emerged. Contemporary neuroscientific theories generally view dreams as
epiphenomena, and the few proposals for their biological function are
contradicted by the phenomenology of dreams themselves. Now, the recent advent
of deep neural networks (DNNs) has finally provided the novel conceptual
framework within which to understand the evolved function of dreams. Notably,
all DNNs face the issue of overfitting as they learn, which is when performance
on one data set increases but the network's performance fails to generalize
(often measured by the divergence of performance on training vs. testing data
sets). This ubiquitous problem in DNNs is often solved by modelers via ""noise
injections"" in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs. The goal of this paper is
to argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of overfitting, and that
nightly dreams evolved to combat the brain's overfitting during its daily
learning. That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for increasing
generalizability via the creation of corrupted sensory inputs from stochastic
activity across the hierarchy of neural structures. Sleep loss, specifically
dream loss, leads to an overfitted brain that can still memorize and learn but
fails to generalize appropriately. Herein this ""overfitted brain hypothesis"" is
explicitly developed and then compared and contrasted with existing
contemporary neuroscientific theories of dreams. Existing evidence for the
hypothesis is surveyed within both neuroscience and deep learning, and a set of
testable predictions are put forward that can be pursued both in vivo and in
silico.

analyze how the leader influences the formation of followers' opinions in

evolution mechanism of trust/distrust level based on opinion difference, in
which the trust/distrust level between neighboring agents is portrayed as a
nonlinear weight function of their opinion difference, and each agent interacts
with the neighbors to update the trust/distrust level and opinion at the times
determined by its own will. Based on the related properties of sub-stochastic

paper, we present a learning model based control strategy for the cup-and-ball
game, where a Universal Robots UR5e manipulator arm learns to catch a ball in
one of the cups on a Kendama. Our control problem is divided into two
sub-tasks, namely $(i)$ swinging the ball up in a constrained motion, and
$(ii)$ catching the free-falling ball. The swing-up trajectory is computed
offline, and applied in open-loop to the arm. Subsequently, a convex
optimization problem is solved online during the ball's free-fall to control
the manipulator and catch the ball. The controller utilizes noisy position
feedback of the ball from an Intel RealSense D435 depth camera. We propose a
novel iterative framework, where data is used to learn the support of the
camera noise distribution iteratively in order to update the control policy.
The probability of a catch with a fixed policy is computed empirically with a
user specified number of roll-outs. Our design guarantees that probability of
the catch increases in the limit, as the learned support nears the true support
of the camera noise distribution. High-fidelity Mujoco simulations and

characterized as an energy shift of band induced by a tunable uniaxial strain.
We found that the temperature-dependence of the nematic susceptibility is
strongly momentum dependent. As the temperature approaches the nematic
transition temperature from the high temperature side, the nematic
susceptibility remains weak at the Brillouin zone center while showing
divergent behavior at the Brillouin zone corner. Our results highlight the

pairing mechanism of superconductivity, still remains controversial.
Comprehensive characterization of how the electronic state reconstructs in the
nematic phase is thus crucial. However, most experiments focus only on the
reconstruction of band dispersions. Another important characteristic of
electronic state, the spectral weight, has not been studied in details so far.
Here, we studied the spectral weight transfer in the nematic phase of
FeSe$_{0.9}$S$_{0.1}$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
in-situ detwinning technique. There are two elliptical electron pockets
overlapping with each other orthogonally at the Brillouin zone corner. We found
that, upon cooling, one electron pocket loses spectral weight and fades away,
while the other electron pocket gains spectral weight and becomes pronounced.
Our results show that the symmetry breaking of electronic state is manifested
by not only the anisotropic band dispersion but also the band-selective
modulation of spectral weight. Our observation completes our understanding of
the nematic electronic state, and put strong constraints on the theoretical
models. It further provide crucial clues to understand the gap anisotropy and
orbital-selective pairing in iron-selenide superconductors.

impulse perturbations. These horizontal and vertical perturbations are added at
different phase values over a period, in order to develop a linear

stratified permuted blocks are often applied in clinical trials to balance
treatment assignments across prognostic factors. The existing theoretical
developments on inference after covariate-adaptive randomization are mostly
limited to situations where a correct model between the response and covariates
can be specified or the randomization method has well-understood properties.
Based on stratification with covariate levels utilized in randomization and a
further adjusting for covariates not used in randomization, in this article we
propose several estimators for model free inference on average treatment effect
defined as the difference between response means under two treatments. We
establish asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators under all popular
covariate-adaptive randomization schemes including the minimization whose
theoretical property is unclear, and we show that the asymptotic distributions
are invariant with respect to covariate-adaptive randomization methods.
Consistent variance estimators are constructed for asymptotic inference.
Asymptotic relative efficiencies and finite sample properties of estimators are
also studied. We recommend using one of our proposed estimators for valid and

combining the local estimators of time series models delivered from worker

explore some potential factors that may affect the forecasting performance of

rotated objects by reducing the overlap with background areas. Existing OBB
approaches are mostly built on horizontal bounding box detectors by introducing
an additional angle dimension optimized by a distance loss. However, as the
distance loss only minimizes the angle error of the OBB and that it loosely
correlates to the IoU, it is insensitive to objects with high aspect ratios.
Therefore, a novel loss, Pixels-IoU (PIoU) Loss, is formulated to exploit both
the angle and IoU for accurate OBB regression. The PIoU loss is derived from
IoU metric with a pixel-wise form, which is simple and suitable for both
horizontal and oriented bounding box. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
evaluate the PIoU loss on both anchor-based and anchor-free frameworks. The
experimental results show that PIoU loss can dramatically improve the
performance of OBB detectors, particularly on objects with high aspect ratios
and complex backgrounds. Besides, previous evaluation datasets did not include
scenarios where the objects have high aspect ratios, hence a new dataset,

that short-term off-river energy storage and distributed energy storage are

sources; interconnection of electricity grids over large areas; response from

constraints and thus require a lightweight authentication mechanism. We propose
PUF-RLA, a PUF-based lightweight, highly reliable authentication scheme

of PUF as well as alleviates the resource constraints by employing error
correction in the server instead of the device without compromising the

authentication scheme inside the device which authenticates the server before
the underlying PUF can be invoked. This prevents an adversary from brute
forcing the device's PUF to acquire CRPs essentially locking out the device
from unauthorized model generation. Additionally, we also introduce a
lightweight CRP obfuscation mechanism involving XOR and shuffle operations.
Results and security analysis verify that the PUF-RLA is secure against brute
force, replay, and modeling attacks, and provides ~99% reliable authentication.
In addition, PUF-RLA provides a reduction of 63% and 74% for look-up tables

augmentation problem for VQA and none of the existing image based augmentation

errors of quantum machine learning models for organic molecules trained on
energy and force labels, two common data types in molecular simulations. When
training and predicting on different geometries corresponding to the same
single molecule, we find that the inclusion of atomic forces in the training
data increases the accuracy of the predicted energies and forces 7-fold,
compared to models trained on energy only. Surprisingly, for models trained on
sets of organic molecules of varying size and composition in non-equilibrium
conformations, inclusion of forces in the training does not improve the
predicted energies of unseen molecules in new conformations. Predicted forces,
however, also improve about 7-fold. For the systems studied, we find that force
labels and energy labels contribute equally per label to the convergence of the
prediction errors. Choosing to include derivatives such as atomic forces in the
training set or not should thus depend on, not only on the computational cost

proposes to use an autonomous tethered aerial visual assistant to replace the
secondary robot and its operating crew. Along with a pre-established theory of

on those theories, a novel high level path planning algorithm is developed to
enable risk-aware planning, which balances the tradeoff between viewpoint
quality and motion risk in order to provide safe and trustworthy visual

However, the general gradient-based optimization in high capacity models, if

shift/exchange in a phantom with isotropic magnetic susceptibility. To generate
a chemical shift/exchange-corrected quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)
result.
  Theory and Methods: Magnetic susceptibility and chemical shift/exchange are
the properties of a material. Both are known to induce the resonance frequency
shift in MRI. In current QSM, the susceptibility is reconstructed from the
frequency shift, ignoring the contribution of the chemical shift/exchange. In
this work, a simple geometric approach, which averages the frequency shift maps
from three orthogonal B0 directions to generate a chemical shift/exchange map,
is developed using the fact that the average nullifies the (isotropic)
susceptibility effects. The resulting chemical shift/exchange map is subtracted
from the total frequency shift, producing a frequency shift map solely from
susceptibility. Finally, this frequency shift map is reconstructed to a
susceptibility map using a QSM algorithm. The proposed method is validated in
numerical simulations and applied to phantom experiments with olive oil, bovine
serum albumin, ferritin, and iron oxide solutions.
  Results: Both simulations and experiments confirm that the method
successfully separates the contributions of the susceptibility and chemical
shift/exchange, reporting the susceptibility and chemical shift/exchange of
olive oil (susceptibility: 0.62 ppm, chemical shift: -3.60 ppm), bovine serum
albumin (susceptibility: -0.059 ppm, chemical shift: 0.008 ppm), ferritin
(susceptibility: 0.125 ppm, chemical shift: -0.005 ppm), and iron oxide
(susceptibility: 0.30 ppm, chemical shift: -0.039 ppm) solutions.
  Conclusion: The proposed method successfully separates the susceptibility and
chemical shift/exchange in phantoms with isotropic magnetic susceptibility.

decreasingly-minimal (dec-min) elements of a set of integral vectors, where a
vector is dec-min if its largest component is as small as possible, within
this, the next largest component is as small as possible, and so on. This
discrete notion, along with its fractional counterpart, showed up earlier in
the literature under various names.
  The domain we consider is an M-convex set, that is, the set of integral
elements of an integral base-polyhedron. A fundamental difference between the
fractional and the discrete case is that a base-polyhedron has always a unique
dec-min element, while the set of dec-min elements of an M-convex set admits a
rich structure, described here with the help of a ""canonical chain"". As a
consequence, we prove that this set arises from a matroid by translating the
characteristic vectors of its bases with an integral vector.
  By relying on these characterizations, we prove that an element is dec-min if
and only if the square-sum of its components is minimum, a property resulting
in a new type of min-max theorems. The characterizations also give rise, as
shown in the companion paper, to a strongly polynomial algorithm, and to
several applications in the areas of resource allocation, network flow,
matroid, and graph orientation problems, which actually provided a major
motivation to the present investigations. In particular, we prove a conjecture
on graph orientation.

transmission, we propose an advanced frame structure design to reduce the
access latency. Moreover, by considering the cooperation of all access points
(APs), we investigate two processing paradigms at the receiver for massive
access: cloud computing and edge computing. For cloud computing, all APs are
connected to a centralized processing unit (CPU), and the signals received at
all APs are centrally processed at the CPU. While for edge computing, the
central processing is offloaded to part of APs equipped with distributed
processing units, so that the AUD and CE can be performed in a distributed
processing strategy. Furthermore, by leveraging the structured sparsity of the
channel matrix, we develop a structured sparsity-based generalized approximated
message passing (SS-GAMP) algorithm for reliable joint AUD and CE, where the
quantization accuracy of the processed signals is taken into account. Based on
the SS-GAMP algorithm, a successive interference cancellation-based AUD and CE
scheme is further developed under two paradigms for reduced access latency.
Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed approach over the
state-of-the-art baseline schemes. Besides, the results reveal that the edge
computing can achieve the similar massive access performance as the cloud
computing, and the edge computing is capable of alleviating the burden on CPU,
having a faster access response, and supporting more flexible AP cooperation.

networks. However, whenever Internet service providers attempt to productize
""tailorability"" and sell it explicitly to end customers as a premium service
over best effort connectivity, they either fail to overcome net neutrality
concerns or struggle to gain market traction. For this article, we focus only
on those networking protocols, technologies, or standards whose goal is to
offer tailored connectivity to paying customers on a public network and refer
to them as differentiated QoS (D-QoS) standards. This article makes two
contributions. First, it explores the techno-economic market trajectory of
D-QoS standards to understand the factors that determine success. In doing
this, we acknowledge that while there is wide variation and dissimilarity in
their underlying technical properties, the expectation and goal for all D-QoS
standards is that they will be used to provide guaranteed connection for which
customers could be prepared to pay. As such, we consider Layer 2/3 technologies
(e.g., ATM, frame relay, MPLS), signaling technologies (e.g., RSVP), data
packet markers (e.g., IP ToS, DiffServ, WME, QCI), and end-to-end separation
solutions (e.g., leased lines, network slicing) as a single cohort and analyze
them together. Second, by exploring the parallels with 5G network slicing, we
argue that despite its inherent technical differences with other D-QoS
standards, the commercial performance of network slicing may end up resembling
that of previous D-QoS standards. Consequently, we seek to learn lessons from
previous D-QoS attempts and suggest that enterprise-focused 5G slices, running
within a single service provider's domain and with binding service level
agreements, will have the highest chance of success in the short/medium term.

causing complex diseases requiring to be modeled using a large number of types
(e.g., infective stage, clinical state, risk factor class). We show that
recording each infected individual's infection age, i.e., the time elapsed
since infection, has three benefits.
  First, regardless of the number of types, the age distribution of the
population can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial
differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. The
frequency of type $i$ is simply obtained by integrating the probability of
being in state $i$ at a given age against the age distribution. This
representation induces a simple methodology based on the additional assumption
of Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the epidemic. We illustrate this
technique using French data from the COVID-19 epidemic.
  Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard compartmental models
using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to
account for disease complexity. We show that such models can always be
rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet equivalent
representation of these complex models.
  Third, beyond the simplicity of the approach, we show that our population
model naturally appears as a universal scaling limit of a large class of fully
stochastic individual-based epidemic models, where the initial condition of the
PDE emerges as the limiting age structure of an exponentially growing
population starting from a single individual.

shear stress reciprocity. By analyzing the displacement field for shear wave
and the motion equation of material element, it is found that the displacement
field is related to local rigid body rotation, and the local rigid body
rotation cannot be balanced by the stress state assumed in classical continuum
mechanics. It is also found that the displacement field caused by shear
deformation, which is neither divergence nor rotation, is replaced with that
caused by local rigid body rotation during the derivation of wave equation.
This indicates that the definition of shear wave is beyond the basic assumption
of continuum mechanics. The study modified the constitutive relation and
elastic tensor based on that the traditionally defined shear wave is objective.
The motion equation corresponding to shear wave is also derived. It is
concluded from the definition of traditional shear wave that the local rigid

includes a pilot allocation strategy to minimize its overhead. The key ideas
are to exploit the coherence bandwidth of mmWave systems and to approximate the
actual PN spectrum with its dominant components, resulting in a non-iterative
solution by using linear minimum mean squared-error estimation. The proposed
method obtains a reduction of more than 2.5x in total complexity, as compared
to the existing methods. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for
normalized mean squared-errors (NMSEs) as a function of critical system
parameters, which help in understanding the NMSE behavior in low and high

the character regions. Based on the insight, we construct a tightly coupled
single pipeline model. This architecture is formed by utilizing detection
outputs in the recognizer and propagating the recognition loss through the
detection stage. The use of character score map helps the recognizer attend
better to the character center points, and the recognition loss propagation to
the detector module enhances the localization of the character regions. Also, a
strengthened sharing stage allows feature rectification and boundary
localization of arbitrary-shaped text regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in publicly available straight and
curved benchmark dataset.

particularly in what concerns their intensity in regions far below the surface.
In this work, we propose that gravity-dominated mixed modes of high absolute
radial order and low angular degree can be used to probe the magnetic field in
their radiative cores. Using two poloidal, axisymmetric configurations for the
field in the core and the classical perturbative approach, we derive an
analytical expression for the magnetic frequency splitting of these oscillation
modes. Considering three distinct red giant models, with masses of
1.3\(M_\odot\), 1.6\(M_\odot\) and 2.0\(M_\odot\), we find that a field
strength of $10^5$ G is necessary in the core of these stars to induce a
frequency splitting of the order of a $\mu$Hz in dipole and quadrupole
oscillation modes. Moreover, taking into account observational limits, we
estimate that magnetic fields in the cores of red giants that do not present
observable magnetic splittings cannot exceed $10^4$ G. Given the general
absence of observable splittings in the oscillation spectra of these stars, and
assuming that present mode suppression mechanisms are not biased towards
certain azimuthal orders and retain all peaks in each multiplet, our results
lead us to conclude that internal fields with the considered configurations and
strengths above $10^4$ G are not prevalent in red giants.

proposes a motion planning algorithm for heterogeneous unmanned system under

respectively. For the perception part, we propose the Grid Map Generation
Network (GMGN), which is used to perceive scenes from UAV's perspective and

the Motion Command Generation Network (MCGN). Due to the addition of memory

algorithms. The results show that our method effectively plans the motion of
heterogeneous unmanned systems and achieves a relatively high success rate.

an important task in multi-criteria decision making. The regret-minimizing set
(RMS) problem is recently proposed for representative discovery from databases.
Specifically, for a set of tuples (points) in $d$ dimensions, an RMS problem
finds the smallest subset such that, for any possible ranking function, the
relative difference in scores between the top-ranked point in the subset and
the top-ranked point in the entire database is within a parameter $\varepsilon
\in (0,1)$. Although RMS and its variations have been extensively investigated
in the literature, existing approaches only consider the class of nonnegative
(monotonic) linear functions for ranking, which have limitations in modeling
user preferences and decision-making processes.
  To address this issue, we define the generalized regret-minimizing
representative (GRMR) problem that extends RMS by taking into account all
linear functions including non-monotonic ones with negative weights. For
two-dimensional databases, we propose an optimal algorithm for GRMR via a
transformation into the shortest cycle problem in a directed graph. Since GRMR
is proven to be NP-hard even in three dimensions, we further develop a
polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for GRMR on databases in arbitrary
dimensions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real and synthetic
datasets to confirm the efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of our

jointly models the conditional mean and conditional heteroscedasticity
characterized by asymmetric effects. A sufficient condition is established for
the existence of a strictly stationary solution. With a quasi-maximum
likelihood estimation (QMLE) procedure introduced, a Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) and its modified version are proposed for model selection. To
detect asymmetric effects in the volatility, the Wald, Lagrange multiplier and
quasi-likelihood ratio test statistics are put forward, and their limiting
distributions are established under both null and local alternative hypotheses.
Moreover, a mixed portmanteau test is constructed to check the adequacy of the
fitted model. All asymptotic properties of inference tools including QMLE,
BICs, asymmetric tests and the mixed portmanteau test, are established without
any moment condition on the data process, which makes the new model and its
inference tools applicable for heavy-tailed data. Simulation studies indicate
that the proposed methods perform well in finite samples, and an empirical
application to S\&P500 Index illustrates the usefulness of the new model.

the properties of minor bodies, and can be exploited as tools to derive very
precise asteroid astrometry relative to the target star. With the availability
of stellar astrometry thanks to the ESA mission Gaia, the frequency of good
predictions and the quality of the astrometry have been strongly enhanced.
  Aims: Our goal is to evaluate the astrometric performance of a systematic
exploitation of stellar occultations, with a homogeneous data set and a given
instrument setup. As a reference instrument, we adopt the example of a robotic
50 cm telescope, which is under construction at the Observatoire de la C\^ote d
Azur. We focus in particular on single chord occultations.
  Methods: We created a data set of simulated light curves, that are modelled
by a Bayesian approach. To build the final statistics, we considered a list of
predicted events over a long time span, and stellar astrometry from Gaia data
release 2.
  Results: We derive an acceptable range of observability of the events, with
clear indications of the expected errors in terms of timing uncertainties. By
converting the distribution of such errors to astrometric uncertainties, we
show that the precision on a single chord can reach levels equivalent to the
performance of Gaia (sub milli arcseconds). The errors on the asteroid position
are dominated by the uncertainty on the position of the occultation chord with
respect to the barycentre of the object.
  Conclusions: The limiting factor in the use of occultation astrometry is not
the light curve uncertainty, but our knowledge of the shape and size of the
asteroid. This conclusion is valid in a wide range of flux drops and magnitudes
of the occulted star. The currently increasing knowledge of the shape, spin
properties, and size, must be used to mitigate this source of error.

The estimation uses the velocity at the separation edge with the Bernoulli
equation to compute the base pressure. The assumption is that this is the base
pressure that will be approached when velocity fluctuations in the flow field
are reduced. A constant velocity along the separating free streamline - as in
two-dimensional bluff body wakes with a splitter plate - is a requirement to
permit the application of the method. The suggested method is applied to a
bluff body in a two-dimensional flow setup with and without a splitter plate.
By reducing the velocity fluctuations, there are estimated increases in the
base pressure of up to 58 % for the bluff body in two-dimensional flow without
a splitter plate and up to 42 % with a splitter plate. The estimated base
pressure of the two-dimensional flow without a splitter plate is compared to a
case with active flow control. In this case, the velocity fluctuations caused
by the K\'arm\'an vortex street are reduced. The comparison shows that the
estimation of the base pressure can be achieved.

better understanding of human biology and pathology. Computational approaches
helped to mitigate experimental constraints by exploring machine learning (ML)
methods and the correlation of essentiality with biological information,
especially protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, to predict essential
genes. Nonetheless, their performance is still limited, as network-based
centralities are not exclusive proxies of essentiality, and traditional ML
methods are unable to learn from non-Euclidean domains such as graphs. Given
these limitations, we proposed EPGAT, an approach for essentiality prediction
based on Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which are attention-based Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) that operate on graph-structured data. Our model
directly learns patterns of gene essentiality from PPI networks, integrating
additional evidence from multiomics data encoded as node attributes. We
benchmarked EPGAT for four organisms, including humans, accurately predicting
gene essentiality with AUC score ranging from 0.78 to 0.97. Our model
significantly outperformed network-based and shallow ML-based methods and
achieved a very competitive performance against the state-of-the-art node2vec
embedding method. Notably, EPGAT was the most robust approach in scenarios with
limited and imbalanced training data. Thus, the proposed approach offers a
powerful and effective way to identify essential genes and proteins.

handling dynamic factor models where the relations between variables underlying
the processes of interest change in a manner that may be difficult to specify

conclusively. In the previous observations, the silhouette against the low

the LSR velocity of the radio recombination line toward it was found to be as

well as the TiO continuum emission, for the first time, the non-LTE
semi-empirical atmospheric models for the PBPs are computed. The attractive
characteristic is the temperature enhancement in the lower photosphere. The
temperature enhancement is about 200 -- 500 K at the same column mass density
as in the atmospheric model of the quiet-Sun. The total excess radiative energy
of a typical PBP is estimated to be 1$\times$10$^{27}$ - 2$\times$10$^{27}$
ergs, which can be regarded as the lower limit energy of the PBPs. The
radiation flux in the visible continuum for the PBPs is about
5.5$\times$10$^{10}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Our result also indicates that
the temperature in the atmosphere above PBPs is close to that of a plage. It
gives a clear evidence that PBPs may contribute significantly to the heating of
the plage atmosphere. Using our semi-empirical atmospheric models, we estimate
self-consistently the average magnetic flux density $B$ in the PBPs. It is
shown that the maximum value is about one kilo-Gauss, and it decreases towards

Additionally, messages linking to government sources, and to news with

methods are data hungry, to address this, Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN) have been proposed. However, vanilla PINN models solve one fixed heat
equation at a time, so the models have to be retrained for heat equations with
different source terms. Additionally, issues related to multi-objective
optimization have to be resolved while using PINN to minimize the PDE residual,
satisfy boundary conditions and fit the observed data etc. Therefore, this
paper investigates an unsupervised learning approach for solving heat transfer
equations on chip without using solution data and generalizing the trained

Specifically, a hybrid framework of Auto Encoder (AE) and Image Gradient (IG)
based network is designed. The AE is used to encode different source terms of
the heat equations. The IG based network implements a second order central
difference algorithm for structured grids and minimizes the PDE residual. The
effectiveness of the designed network is evaluated by solving heat equations
for various use cases. It is proved that with limited number of source terms to
train the AE network, the framework can not only solve the given heat transfer
problems with a single training process, but also make reasonable predictions
for unseen cases (heat equations with new source terms) without retraining.

Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) contagion model, which takes
into account the effects of social distancing. Furthermore, the adapted SIRD
model includes time-varying auto-regressive contagion parameters, which
dynamically converge according to the stage of the pandemic. This new model is
identified through a three-layered procedures, with analytical regressions,
Least-Squares optimization runs and auto-regressive model fits. The data-driven
model is validated and shown to adequately describe the contagion curves over
large forecast horizons. In this model, control input is defined as finitely
parametrized values for social distancing guidelines, which directly affect the
transmission and infection rates of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The NMPC strategy
generates piece-wise constant quarantine guidelines which can be
relaxed/strengthen as each week passes. The implementation of the method is
pursued through a search mechanism, since the control is finitely parametrized
and, thus, there exist a finite number of possible control sequences.
Simulation essays are shown to illustrate the results obtained with the
proposed closed-loop NMPC strategy, which is able to mitigate the number of
infections and progressively loosen social distancing measures. With respect to
an ""open-loop""/no control condition, the number of deaths still could be
reduced in up to 30 %. The forecast preview an infection peak to September 2nd,
2020, which could lead to over 1.5 million deaths if no coordinate health

experiments on intact Lanh\'elin granite under triaxial conditions. We quantify
the change in elastic moduli around the fault from time-resolved 3D $P$-wave

microfracture damage after failure. From the tomography, we observe a localised
maximum 25\% drop in $P$-wave velocity around the shear failure interface for
both quasi-static and dynamic failure. Microfracture density data reveals a
damage zone width of around 10 mm after quasi-static failure, and 20 mm after
dynamic failure. Microfracture densities obtained from $P$-wave velocity
tomography models using an effective medium approach are in good agreement with
the measured off-fault microfracture damage. $\Gamma_\mathrm{off}$ obtained
from off-fault microfracture measurements is around 3 kJm$^{2}$ for
quasi-static rupture, and 5.5 kJm$^{2}$ for dynamic rupture. We argue that
rupture velocity determines damage zone width for slip up to a few mm, and that
shear fracture energy $\Gamma$ increases with increasing rupture velocity.

contextual information in a local or global manner with dilated convolutions,
pyramid pooling or self-attention mechanism. In order to avoid potential
misleading contextual information aggregation in previous works, we propose a
class-wise dynamic graph convolution (CDGC) module to adaptively propagate
information. The graph reasoning is performed among pixels in the same class.
Based on the proposed CDGC module, we further introduce the Class-wise Dynamic
Graph Convolution Network(CDGCNet), which consists of two main parts including
the CDGC module and a basic segmentation network, forming a coarse-to-fine
paradigm. Specifically, the CDGC module takes the coarse segmentation result as
class mask to extract node features for graph construction and performs dynamic
graph convolutions on the constructed graph to learn the feature aggregation
and weight allocation. Then the refined feature and the original feature are
fused to get the final prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on three
popular semantic segmentation benchmarks including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012
and COCO Stuff, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all three
benchmarks.

the issue of accurate uncertainty estimation in the small-data regime, we

identify the most important demographic and clinical features to estimate
Kerma-Area Product (KAP) radiation dose in coronary angiographies (CA) and
percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The study was retrospective using
clinical patient data from 838 CA and PCI procedures. A total of 59 features
were extracted from the patient data and 9 different filter-based feature
selection methods were used to select the most informative features in terms of
the KAP radiation dose from the treatments. The selected features were then
used in a support vector regression (SVR) model to evaluate their performance
in estimating the radiation dose. The ten highest-ranking features were: 1)
FN1AC (CA), 2) FN2BA (PCI), 3) weight, 4) post-stenosis 0%, 5) multi-vessel
disease, 6) number of procedures 3, 7) pre-stenosis 100%, 8) American Heart
Association (AHA) score C, 9) pre-stenosis 85% and 10) gender. The performance
of the SVR model increased (mean squared error ~ 450) with the number of
features approximately up to 30 features. The identification of the most
informative features for CA and PCI KAP is an important step in determining
suitable complexity models for clinical practice. The highest-ranking features
can be used as individual predictors of IC procedure KAP or can be incorporated
into combined complexity score or different estimation models in the future.

classification in machine learning community. Attention mechanism applied on

Typically, it helps to identify a neighbor node which plays more important role
to determine the label of the node under consideration. But in real world
scenarios, a particular subset of nodes together, but not the individual pairs
in the subset, may be important to determine the label of the graph. To address
this problem, we introduce the concept of subgraph attention for graphs. On the
other hand, hierarchical graph pooling has been shown to be promising in recent
literature. But due to noisy hierarchical structure of real world graphs, not
all the hierarchies of a graph play equal role for graph classification.
Towards this end, we propose a graph classification algorithm called
SubGattPool which jointly learns the subgraph attention and employs two
different types of hierarchical attention mechanisms to find the important
nodes in a hierarchy and the importance of individual hierarchies in a graph.
Experimental evaluation with different types of graph classification algorithms
shows that SubGattPool is able to improve the state-of-the-art or remains
competitive on multiple publicly available graph classification datasets. We
conduct further experiments on both synthetic and real world graph datasets to
justify the usefulness of different components of SubGattPool and to show its
consistent performance on other downstream tasks.

bio sciences and applied sciences research, a new class of Weighted Power
function distribution (WPFD) has been proposed with its various properties and
different modifications to be more applicable in real life. We have provided
the mathematical derivations for the new distribution including moments,
incomplete moments, conditional moments, inverse moments, mean residual
function, vitality function, order statistics, mills ratio, information
function, Shannon entropy, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves and quantile function.
We have also characterized the WPFD, based on doubly truncated mean. The aim of
the study is to increase the application of the Power function distribution.
The main feature of the proposed distribution is that there is no induction of
parameters as compare to the other generalization of the distributions, which
are complexed having many parameters. We have used R programming to estimate
the parameters of the new class of WPFD using Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM),
Percentile Estimators (P.E) and their modified estimators. After analyzing the
data, we conclude that the proposed model WPFD performs better in the data sets
while compared to different competitor models.

  Arithmetic Dynamical Systems and Non-Archimedean Value Distribution Theory","53 pages",,,,"math.GM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Let $q$ be an odd prime, and let $T_{q}:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ be
the Shortened $qx+1$ map, defined by $T_{q}\left(n\right)=n/2$ if $n$ is even
and $T_{q}\left(n\right)=\left(qn+1\right)/2$ if $n$ is odd. The study of the
dynamics of these maps is infamous for its difficulty, with the
characterization of the dynamics of $T_{3}$ being an alternative formulation of
the famous Collatz Conjecture. This series of papers presents a new paradigm
for studying such arithmetic dynamical systems by way of a neglected area of
ultrametric analysis which we have termed $\left(p,q\right)$-adic analysis, the
study of functions from the $p$-adics to the $q$-adics, where $p$ and $q$ are
distinct primes. In this, the first paper, working with the $T_{q}$ maps as a
toy model for the more general theory, for each odd prime $q$, we construct a
function $\chi_{q}:\mathbb{Z}_{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{q}$ (the Numen of
$T_{q}$) and prove the Correspondence Principle (CP):
$x\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash\left\{ 0\right\}$ is a periodic point of $T_{q}$ if
and only there is a $\mathfrak{z}\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}\backslash\left\{
0,1,2,\ldots\right\}$ so that $\chi_{q}\left(\mathfrak{z}\right)=x$.
Additionally, if $\mathfrak{z}\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ makes
$\chi_{q}\left(\mathfrak{z}\right)\in\mathbb{Z}$, then the iterates of
$\chi_{q}\left(\mathfrak{z}\right)$ under $T_{q}$ tend to $+\infty$ or
$-\infty$.

the trajectory of human civilization. In order to reap the benefits and avoid
pitfalls of such powerful technology it is important to be able to control it.
However, possibility of controlling artificial general intelligence and its
more advanced version, superintelligence, has not been formally established. In
this paper, we present arguments as well as supporting evidence from multiple
domains indicating that advanced AI can't be fully controlled. Consequences of
uncontrollability of AI are discussed with respect to future of humanity and
research on AI, and AI safety and security.

"2008.07321","Heather Roff","Heather M. Roff","Expected Utilitarianism",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We want artificial intelligence (AI) to be beneficial. This is the grounding
assumption of most of the attitudes towards AI research. We want AI to be
""good"" for humanity. We want it to help, not hinder, humans. Yet what exactly
this entails in theory and in practice is not immediately apparent.
Theoretically, this declarative statement subtly implies a commitment to a
consequentialist ethics. Practically, some of the more promising machine
learning techniques to create a robust AI, and perhaps even an artificial
general intelligence (AGI) also commit one to a form of utilitarianism. In both
dimensions, the logic of the beneficial AI movement may not in fact create
""beneficial AI"" in either narrow applications or in the form of AGI if the
ethical assumptions are not made explicit and clear.
  Additionally, as it is likely that reinforcement learning (RL) will be an
important technique for machine learning in this area, it is also important to
interrogate how RL smuggles in a particular type of consequentialist reasoning
into the AI: particularly, a brute form of hedonistic act utilitarianism. Since
the mathematical logic commits one to a maximization function, the result is
that an AI will inevitably be seeking more and more rewards. We have two
conclusions that arise from this. First, is that if one believes that a
beneficial AI is an ethical AI, then one is committed to a framework that
posits 'benefit' is tantamount to the greatest good for the greatest number.
Second, if the AI relies on RL, then the way it reasons about itself, the
environment, and other agents, will be through an act utilitarian morality.
This proposition may, or may not, in fact be actually beneficial for humanity.
