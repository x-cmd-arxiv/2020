  hypergraphs",,,,,"cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce efficient algorithms for approximate sampling from symmetric
Gibbs distributions on the sparse random (hyper)graph. The examples we consider
include (but are not restricted to) important distributions on spin systems and
spin-glasses such as the q state antiferromagnetic Potts model for $q\geq 2$,
including the colourings, the uniform distributions over the Not-All-Equal
solutions of random k-CNF formulas. Finally, we present an algorithm for
sampling from the spin-glass distribution called the k-spin model. To our
knowledge this is the first, rigorously analysed, efficient algorithm for
spin-glasses which operates in a non trivial range of the parameters.
  Our approach builds on the one that was introduced in [Efthymiou: SODA 2012].
For a symmetric Gibbs distribution $\mu$ on a random (hyper)graph whose
parameters are within an certain range, our algorithm has the following
properties: with probability $1-o(1)$ over the input instances, it generates a
configuration which is distributed within total variation distance
$n^{-\Omega(1)}$ from $\mu$. The time complexity is $O((n\log n)^2)$.
  The algorithm requires a range of the parameters which, for the graph case,
coincide with the tree-uniqueness region, parametrised w.r.t. the expected
degree d. For the hypergraph case, where uniqueness is less restrictive, we go
beyond uniqueness. Our approach utilises in a novel way the notion of
contiguity between Gibbs distributions and the so-called teacher-student model.

challenge here is setting optimal system parameters such as number of serving

developing a tool, multibeam satellite traffic simulator, that helps addressing
these fundamental challenges, and more importantly, provides an understanding
to the spatial-temporal traffic pattern of satellite networks in large-scale
environments. Specifically, traffic demand distribution is investigated by
processing credible datasets included three major input categories of
information: (i) population distribution for broadband Fixed Satellite Services
(FSS), (ii) aeronautical satellite communications, and (iii) vessel
distribution for maritime services. This traffic simulator combines this
three-dimensional information in addition to time, locations of terminals, and
traffic demand. Moreover, realistic satellite beam patterns have been
considered in this work, and thus, an algorithm has been proposed to delimit
the coverage boundaries of each satellite beam, and then compute the
heterogeneous traffic demand at the footprint of each beam. Furthermore,
another algorithm has been developed to capture the inherent attributes of
satellite channels and the effects of multibeam interference. Data-driven
modeling for satellite traffic is crucial nowadays to design innovative
communication systems, e.g., precoding and beam hopping, and to devise
efficient resource management algorithms.

Earlier observations have found that dense cores exhibit subsonic non-thermal

aim to study the ammonia ($\rm NH_3$) molecular line profiles with exquisite
sensitivity towards the coherent cores in L1688 in order to study their
kinematical properties in unprecedented detail. Methods : We used $\rm NH_3$
(1,1) and (2,2) data from the first data release (DR1) in the Green Bank
Ammonia Survey (GAS). We first smoothed the data to a larger beam of 1' to
obtain substantially more extended maps of velocity dispersion and kinetic
temperature, compared to the DR1 maps. We then identified the coherent cores in
the cloud and analysed the averaged line profiles towards the cores. Results :
For the first time, we detected a faint (mean $\rm NH_3$(1,1) peak brightness
$<$0.25 K in $T_{MB}$), supersonic component towards all the coherent cores in
L1688. We fitted two components, one broad and one narrow, and derived the
kinetic temperature and velocity dispersion of each component. The broad
components towards all cores have supersonic linewidths ($\mathcal{M}_S \ge
1$). This component biases the estimate of the narrow dense core component's
velocity dispersion by $\approx$28% and the kinetic temperature by
$\approx$10%, on average, as compared to the results from single-component
fits. Conclusions : Neglecting this ubiquitous presence of a broad component
towards all coherent cores causes the typical single-component fit to
overestimate the temperature and velocity dispersion. This affects the derived
detailed physical structure and stability of the cores estimated from $\rm
NH_3$ observations.

translate into sharp effects on the resonance characteristics of the filters.

also a decay in relation to the initial datum defined in a Sobolev space

  COVID-19","Comments are welcome",,,,"q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Countries highly exposed to incoming traffic from China were expected to be
at the highest risk of COVID-19 spread. However, COVID-19 case numbers
(infection levels) are negatively correlated with incoming traffic-level.
Moreover, infection levels are positively correlated with population-size,
while the latter should only affect infection-level once herd immunity is
reached. These could be explained if a low-virulence strain (LVS) began
spreading a few months earlier from China, providing immunity from the later
emerging known SARS-CoV-2 high-virulence strain (HVS). We find that the
dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic depend on the LVS and HVS spread
doubling-times and the delay between their initial onsets. We find that LVS
doubling-time to be $T_L\sim1.59\pm0.17$ times slower than the HVS ($T_H$), but
its earlier onset allowed its global wide-spread to the levels required for
herd-immunity. In countries exposed earlier to the LVS and/or having smaller
population-size, the LVS achieved herd-immunity earlier, allowing less time for
the spread of the HVS, and giving rise to lower HVS-infection levels. Such
model accurately predicts a country's infection-level ({\rm R^{2}=0.74};
p-value of {\rm 5.2\times10^{-13}}), given only its population-size and
incoming-traffic from China. It explains the negative correlation with
incoming-traffic ($c_{exp}$), the positive correlation with the population size
(n_{pop}) and their specific relations (${\rm N}_{{\rm cases}}\propto
n_{pop}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}}}}\times c_{exp}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}-1}}}$).
We find that most countries should have already achieved herd-immunity. Further
COVID-19-spread in these countries is limited and is not expected to rise by
more than a factor of 2-3. We suggest tests/predictions to further verify the
model and biologically identify the LVS, and discuss the implications.

and is useful in many applications, such as simplification of social networks,
least squares problems, numerical solution of symmetric positive definite
linear systems and etc. In this paper, inspired by the well-known sparse signal
recovery algorithm called orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), we introduce a
deterministic, greedy edge selection algorithm called universal greedy approach
(UGA) for graph sparsification. For a general spectral sparsification problem,
e.g., positive subset selection problem from a set of $m$ vectors from
$\mathbb{R}^n$, we propose a nonnegative UGA algorithm which needs $O(mn^2+
n^3/\epsilon^2)$ time to find a
$\frac{1+\epsilon/\beta}{1-\epsilon/\beta}$-spectral sparsifier with positive
coefficients with sparsity $\le\lceil\frac{n}{\epsilon^2}\rceil$, where $\beta$
is the ratio between the smallest length and largest length of the vectors. The
convergence of the nonnegative UGA algorithm will be established. For the graph
sparsification problem, another UGA algorithm will be proposed which can output
a $\frac{1+O(\epsilon)}{1-O(\epsilon)}$-spectral sparsifier with
$\lceil\frac{n}{\epsilon^2}\rceil$ edges in $O(m+n^2/\epsilon^2)$ time from a
graph with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices under some mild assumptions. This is a
linear time algorithm in terms of the number of edges that the community of
graph sparsification is looking for. The best result in the literature to the
knowledge of the authors is the existence of a deterministic algorithm which is
almost linear, i.e. $O(m^{1+o(1)})$ for some
$o(1)=O(\frac{(\log\log(m))^{2/3}}{\log^{1/3}(m)})$. Finally, extensive
experimental results, including applications to graph clustering and least
squares regression, show the effectiveness of proposed approaches.

exacerbated by vision-based control tasks in diverse real-world environments,

resource allocation policy to maximize the model accuracy within a given total

reciprocal of the training performance loss, in terms of the number of training
rounds and the number of scheduled devices per round, is derived. Based on the
bound, the accuracy maximization problem is solved by decoupling it into two
sub-problems. First, given the scheduled devices, the optimal bandwidth
allocation suggests allocating more bandwidth to the devices with worse channel
conditions or weaker computation capabilities. Then, a greedy device scheduling
algorithm is introduced, which in each step selects the device consuming the
least updating time obtained by the optimal bandwidth allocation, until the
lower bound begins to increase, meaning that scheduling more devices will
degrade the model accuracy. Experiments show that the proposed policy
outperforms state-of-the-art scheduling policies under extensive settings of

robust approach is more useful in these scenarios where a system is inherently

regular square coupled MRRs array without the interstitial rings. Then, the
eigen modes' field distribution are calculated for each of the four eigen wave

perfect field we show that there exists a canonical abelian variety over the
field, namely the second algebraic representative, whose rational Tate modules

variety, one obtains canonical identifications between the integral Tate
modules of the second algebraic representative and the third l-adic cohomology
groups of the variety, and if the variety is a geometrically stably rational
threefold, these identifications are induced by an integral correspondence. Our
overall strategy consists in studying -- for arbitrary smooth projective
varieties -- the image of the second ell-adic Bloch map restricted to the Tate

lines of incorporating the uncertainty in our prediction system to ensure
better judgment in such a crucial task. We propose to use a sparse Gaussian
classification method to work with the large data-set and use the concept of
pseudo or inducing inputs. We perform the same with different sets of kernels
and the different number of inducing data points to show the best accuracy was
obtained with the selection of RBF kernel with a higher number of inducing
points. Our approach was able to work over large financial data given the
stochastic nature of our method employed and also good test accuracy with low
variance over the prediction suggesting confidence and robustness in our model.
Using the methodologies of Bayesian learning techniques with the incorporated
inducing points phenomenon, are successfully able to obtain a healthy accuracy
and a high confidence score.

between the solar wind magnetic field and solid material trailing in the orbit
of the parent body. Based on optical photometry, the radius (in meters) and
mass (in kilograms) of an equal-area sphere are found to be r_n =
250(0.1/p_R)**0.5 and M_n = 1e11(0.1/p_R)**1.5, respectively, where p_R is the
red geometric albedo and density 1500 kg/m3 is assumed. The measured colors are
intermediate between those of C-type (primitive) and S-type (metamorphosed)
asteroids but, with correction for the likely effects of phase-reddening, are
more consistent with a C-type classification than with S-type. No evidence for
co-moving companions larger than about 40(0.1/p_R) meter in radius is found,
and no dust particle trail is detected, setting a limit to the trail optical
depth 2e-9. Consideration of the size distribution produced by impact
pulverization makes it difficult to generate the mass of nanodust (minimum 1e5
kg to 1e6 kg) required to account for IFEs, unless the size distribution is
unusually steep. Furthermore, impact pulverization timescales for source
objects of the required size are much longer than the dynamical timescale.
While the new optical data do not definitively refute the hypothesis that
boulder pulverization is the source of IFEs, neither do they provide any
support for it.

relatively small number of steps, significantly slow down. The loss may even
appear to stagnate over the period of a large number of epochs, only to then
suddenly start to decrease fast again for no apparent reason. This so-called
plateau phenomenon manifests itself in many learning tasks.
  The present work aims to identify and quantify the root causes of plateau
phenomenon. No assumptions are made on the number of neurons relative to the
number of training data, and our results hold for both the lazy and adaptive
regimes. The main findings are: plateaux correspond to periods during which
activation patterns remain constant, where activation pattern refers to the
number of data points that activate a given neuron; quantification of
convergence of the gradient flow dynamics; and, characterization of stationary
points in terms solutions of local least squares regression lines over subsets
of the training data. Based on these conclusions, we propose a new iterative
training method, the Active Neuron Least Squares (ANLS), characterised by the
explicit adjustment of the activation pattern at each step, which is designed
to enable a quick exit from a plateau. Illustrative numerical examples are
included throughout.

secretary problem, a sequence of arbitrary awards arrive online, in a random
order, and a single decision maker makes an immediate and irrevocable decision
whether to accept each award upon its arrival. The requirement to make
immediate decisions arises in many cases due to an implicit assumption
regarding competition. Namely, if the decision maker does not take the offered
award immediately, it will be taken by someone else. The novelty in this paper
is in introducing a multi-agent model in which the competition is endogenous.
In our model, multiple agents compete over the arriving awards, but the
decisions need not be immediate; instead, agents may select previous awards as
long as they are available (i.e., not taken by another agent). If an award is
selected by multiple agents, ties are broken either randomly or according to a
global ranking. This induces a multi-agent game in which the time of selection
is not enforced by the rules of the games, rather it is an important component
of the agent's strategy. We study the structure and performance of equilibria
in this game. For random tie breaking, we characterize the equilibria of the
game, and show that the expected social welfare in equilibrium is nearly
optimal, despite competition among the agents. For ranked tie breaking, we give
a full characterization of equilibria in the 3-agent game, and show that as the
number of agents grows, the winning probability of every agent under
non-immediate selections approaches her winning probability under immediate
selections.

players' actions are completely unaffected by the injected disturbance. We
provide necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee this property for

continuous games, finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) dynamic games, and

used to enhance certain pathologies or organs. Many existing cross-domain
image-to-image translation models have been shown to improve cross-domain
segmentation of large organs. However, such models lack the ability to preserve
fine structures during the translation process, which is significant for many
clinical applications, such as segmenting small calcified plaques in the aorta
and pelvic arteries. In order to preserve fine structures during medical image
translation, we propose a patch-based model using shared latent variables from
a Gaussian mixture model. We compare our image translation framework to several
state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain image translation and show our model
does a better job preserving fine structures. The superior performance of our
model is verified by performing two tasks with the translated images -
detection and segmentation of aortic plaques and pancreas segmentation. We
expect the utility of our framework will extend to other problems beyond
segmentation due to the improved quality of the generated images and enhanced

scattering. Experimental data reveal gapped dispersive spin wave excitations in
the 3D long-range ordered magnetic state (TC = 16 K), and gapless magnetic
excitations above the TC. Simulated magnetic excitations, by using the linear
spin wave theory, for a model of coupled trimer spin-chains provide a good
description of the observed experimental data. The analysis reveals both
ferromagnetic J1 and J2 interactions within the chains, and an
antiferromagnetic interchain interaction J3 between chains. The strengths of
the J1 and J2 are found to be closer (J2/J1 ~ 0.81), and J3 is determined to be
weaker (J3/ J1 ~ 0.69), which is consistent with the spin chain type crystal
structure. Presence of a weak single-ion-anisotropy (D/J=0.19) is also
revealed. The strengths and signs of exchange interactions explain why the 1/3
magnetization is absent in the studied spin-1 compound CaNi3P4O14 in contrast
to its S= 5/2 counterpart Mn based isostructural compound. The signs of the
exchange interactions are in agreement with that obtained from the reported DFT
calculations, whereas, their strengths are found to be significantly different.
The relatively strong value of the J3 in CaNi3P4O14 gives a conventional 3D
type magnetic ordering below the TC, however, retains its 1D character above
the TC. The present experimental study also reveals a sharp change of
single-ion anisotropy across the TC indicating that the stability of the 3D
magnetic ordering in CaNi3P4O14 is ascribed to the local magnetic anisotropy in
addition to interchain interactions. The present study divulges the importance
of full knowledge of the exchange interactions in trimer spin chain compounds
to understand their exotic magnetic properties, such as 1/3 magnetization
plateau.

(de)-convolution and up/down-sampling layers, where each layer operates locally
and lacks the ability to capture the long-term structural dependency required
by texture synthesis. Thus, they often simply enlarge the input texture, rather
than perform reasonable synthesis. As a compromise, many recent methods
sacrifice generalizability by training and testing on the same single (or fixed
set of) texture image(s), resulting in huge re-training time costs for unseen
images. In this work, based on the discovery that the assembling/stitching
operation in traditional texture synthesis is analogous to a transposed
convolution operation, we propose a novel way of using transposed convolution
operation. Specifically, we directly treat the whole encoded feature map of the
input texture as transposed convolution filters and the features'
self-similarity map, which captures the auto-correlation information, as input
to the transposed convolution. Such a design allows our framework, once
trained, to be generalizable to perform synthesis of unseen textures with a
single forward pass in nearly real-time. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
texture synthesis quality based on various metrics. While self-similarity helps
preserve the input textures' regular structural patterns, our framework can
also take random noise maps for irregular input textures instead of
self-similarity maps as transposed convolution inputs. It allows to get more
diverse results as well as generate arbitrarily large texture outputs by
directly sampling large noise maps in a single pass as well.

2x10-4 S/m at 323 K which strongly enhances with increasing temperature and

characterize many-body systems. In strongly correlated quantum materials, such
as the doped 2D Fermi-Hubbard system, these may no longer be sufficient because
higher-order correlations are crucial to understanding the character of the
many-body system and can be numerically dominant. Experimentally, such
higher-order correlations have recently become accessible in ultracold atom
systems. Here we reveal strong non-Gaussian correlations in doped quantum
anti-ferromagnets and show that higher order correlations dominate over
lower-order terms. We study a single mobile hole in the $t-J$ model using DMRG,
and reveal genuine fifth-order correlations which are directly related to the
mobility of the dopant. We contrast our results to predictions using models
based on doped quantum spin liquids which feature significantly reduced
higher-order correlations. Our predictions can be tested at the lowest
currently accessible temperatures in quantum simulators of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard
model. Finally, we propose to experimentally study the same fifth-order
spin-charge correlations as a function of doping. This will help to reveal the
microscopic nature of charge carriers in the most debated regime of the Hubbard
model, relevant for understanding high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

binary systems, they also shape the stars' evolution by modifying the orbit. In
this paper, we use hydrodynamic simulations to study the emergence of
nearly-isothermal winds from identical-twin binaries. We vary the degree to
which model stars fill their Roche lobes and the temperature of the wind.
Initialized at rest on the stellar surfaces, winds accelerate away from the
binary components through a sonic surface to supersonic outward velocities. In
cases where the binary fills its Roche lobe, a shared subsonic region surrounds
both components. We find that mass loss rates from close twin-star binaries are
enhanced relative to the expectation from two single-object winds. This binary
enhancement is best modeled as a function of the ratio of wind velocity to
orbital velocity. Similarly, we find that the specific angular momentum with
which winds emerge can vary between that of the binary components and that of
the outer Lagrange points depending on the ratio of wind velocity to orbital
velocity. Given that mass and angular momentum loss can be modeled as simple
functions of wind velocity, our results may be broadly applicable to the
evolution of close, equal-mass binaries. One particularly important potential
application is to massive, close binaries which may be progenitors of binary
black hole mergers through the chemically-homogeneous evolution channel.

vector most likely yielded from a survey will systematically fall below its

accounting for it in weak lensing is challenging, as a direct transfer of the
CMB results is quantitatively incorrect. While a previous study (Sellentin et
al. 2018) focused on the magnitude of this bias, we here focus on the frequency
of this bias, its scaling with redshift, and its impact on the signal-to-noise
of a survey. Filtering weak lensing data with COSEBIs, we show that weak
lensing likelihoods are skewed up until $\ell \approx 100$, whereas
CMB-likelihoods Gaussianize already at $\ell \approx 20$. While
COSEBI-compressed data on KiDS- and DES-like redshift- and angular ranges
follow Gaussian distributions, we detect skewness at 6$\sigma$ significance for
half of a Euclid- or LSST-like data set, caused by the wider coverage and
deeper reach of these surveys. Computing the signal-to-noise ratio per data
point, we show that precisely the data points of highest signal-to-noise are
the most biased. Over all redshifts, this bias affects at least 10% of a
survey's total signal-to-noise, at high redshifts up to 25%. The bias is
accordingly expected to impact parameter inference. The bias can be handled by
developing non-Gaussian likelihoods. Otherwise, it could be reduced by removing
the data points of highest signal-to-noise.

southern Orion cloud complex. We used the parallaxes and proper motions of YSOs
from Gaia DR2 as a proxy for gas distance and proper motion, and the gas radial
velocities from archival CO data, to compute the space motions of the different
star-forming clouds in the complex, including subregions in Orion A, Orion B,
and two outlying cometary clouds. From the analysis of the clouds' orbits in
space and time, we find that they were closest about 6 Myr ago and are moving
radially away from roughly the same region in space. This coherent 100-pc scale
radial motion supports a scenario where the entire complex is reacting to a
major feedback event, which we name the Orion-BB (big blast) event. This event,
which we tentatively associate with the recently discovered Orion X stellar
population, shaped the distribution and kinematics of the gas we observe today,
although it is unlikely to have been the sole major feedback event in the
region. We argue that the dynamics of most of the YSOs carry the memory of the
feedback-driven star formation history in Orion and that the majority of the
young stars in this complex are a product of large-scale triggering, which can
raise the star formation rate by at least an order of magnitude, as for the
head of Orion A (the Integral Shape Filament). Our results imply that a
feedback, compression, and triggering process lies at the genesis of the Orion
Nebula Cluster and NGC2023/2024 in Orion B, thus confirming broadly the
classical feedback-driven scenario proposed in Elmegreen & Lada (1977). The
space motions of the well-known young compact clusters, $\sigma$ Orionis and
NGC 1977, are consistent with this scenario. A momentum estimate suggests that
the energy of a few to several supernovae is needed to power the coherent 3D
gas motion we measure in this paper.

the method can be easily generalized to more complex confined excitations (e.g.

excitations has recently attracted considerable attention. However, in solid
state materials other spin interactions are present, and among such additional
interactions, the off-diagonal symmetric Gamma interaction, another type of
bond-dependent term, has been particularly challenging to fully understand. A
minimal Kitaev-Gamma (KG) model has been investigated by various numerical
techniques under a magnetic field, but definite conclusions about field-induced
spin liquids remain elusive and one reason may lie in the limited sizes of the
two-dimensional geometry it is possible to access numerically. We therefore
focus on the KG model defined on a two-leg ladder which is much more amenable
to a complete study, and determine the entire phase diagram in the presence of
a magnetic field along [111]-direction. Due to the competition between the
interactions and the field, an extremely rich phase diagram emerges with
fifteen distinct phases. Focusing near the antiferromagnetic Kitaev region, we
identify nine different phases solely within this region: several
incommensurate magnetically ordered phases, spin nematic, and two chiral phases
with enhanced entanglement. Of particular interest is a highly entangled phase
with staggered chirality with zero-net flux occurring at intermediate field,
which along with its companion phases outline a heart-shaped region of high
entanglement, the heart of entanglement. We compare our results for the ladder
with a C3 symmetric cluster of the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, and offer
insights into possible spin liquids in the two-dimensional limit.

  We focused on the high-resolution XMM-Newton RGS spectra and divided the
observation into pre-flare, flare, and post-flare phases. We modeled the

with the self-consistent photoionization models calculated via CLOUDY and XSTAR
in the pre-flare phase, where strong emission lines due to resonant transitions
of highly ionized ions are seen.
  In the spectra, we find emission lines corresponding to K-shell transitions
in highly charged ions of oxygen, neon, magnesium, and silicon as well as
radiative recombination continua (RRC) of oxygen. Additionally, we observe
potential absorption lines of magnesium at a lower ionization stage and
features identified as iron L lines. The CLOUDY and XSTAR photoionization

non-commuting Hermitian operators naturally emerges from classical mechanics by
applying the inverse Wigner-Weyl transform to the phase space probability
distribution and observables. In this language, the Schr\""odinger equation
follows from the Liouville equation, with $\hbar$ now a free parameter.
Classical stationary distributions can be represented as sums over stationary
states with discrete (quantized) energies, where these states directly
correspond to quantum eigenstates. Interestingly, it is now classical mechanics
which allows for apparent negative probabilities to occupy eigenstates, dual to
the negative probabilities in Wigner's quasiprobability distribution. These
negative probabilities are shown to disappear when allowing sufficient
uncertainty in the classical distributions. We show that this correspondence is
particularly pronounced for canonical Gibbs ensembles, where classical
eigenstates satisfy an integral eigenvalue equation that reduces to the
Schr\""odinger equation in a saddle-point approximation controlled by the
inverse temperature. We illustrate this correspondence by showing that some
paradigmatic examples such as tunneling, band structures, Berry phases, Landau
levels, level statistics and quantum eigenstates in chaotic potentials can be
reproduced to a surprising precision from a classical Gibbs ensemble, without
any reference to quantum mechanics and with all parameters (including $\hbar$)

modulations of their flux on extremely short ($t_{\rm r}\sim 10\mu$s) time
scales, compared to pulse durations ($t_{\rm FRB}\sim1$ms). Light-curve
variability timescales, the small ratio of rise time of the flux to pulse
duration, and the spectro-temporal correlations in the data constrain the
compactness of the source and the mechanism responsible for the powerful radio
emission. The constraints are strongest when radiation is produced far
($\gtrsim 10^{10}$cm) from the compact object. We describe different physical
set-ups that can account for the observed $t_{\rm r}/t_{\rm FRB}\ll 1$ despite
having large emission radii. The result is either a significant reduction in
the radio production efficiency or distinct light-curves features that could be
searched for in observed data. For the same class of models, we also show that
due to high-latitude emission, if a flux $f_1(\nu_1)$ is observed at $t_1$ then
at a lower frequency $\nu_2<\nu_1$ the flux should be at least
$(\nu_2/\nu_1)^2f_1$ at a slightly later time ($t_2=t_1\nu_1/\nu_2$)
independent of the duration and spectrum of the emission in the comoving frame.
These features can be tested, once light-curve modulations due to scintillation
are accounted for. We provide the timescales and coherence bandwidths of the
latter for a range of possibilities regarding the physical screens and the
scintillation regime. Finally, if future highly resolved FRB light-curves are
shown to have intrinsic variability extending down to $\sim \mu$s timescales,
this will provide strong evidence in favor of magnetospheric models.

theoretical toolbox for quantum feedback control of multicomponent
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) using backaction-limited weak measurements in
conjunction with spatially resolved feedback. Feedback in the form of a
single-particle potential can introduce effective interactions that enter into
the stochastic equation governing system dynamics. The effective interactions
are tunable and can be made analogous to Feshbach resonances --
spin-independent and spin-dependent -- but without changing atomic scattering
parameters. Feedback cooling prevents runaway heating due to measurement
backaction and we present an analytical model to explain its effectiveness. We
showcase our toolbox by studying a two-component BEC using a stochastic
mean-field theory, where feedback induces a phase transition between easy-axis
ferromagnet and spin-disordered paramagnet phases. We present the steady-state
phase diagram as a function of intrinsic and effective spin-dependent
interaction strengths. Our result demonstrates that closed-loop quantum control
of Bose-Einstein condensates is a powerful new tool for quantum engineering in
cold-atom systems.

they have been traditionally subdivided as radio-loud and radio-quiet sources.
Whether such division is a misleading effect from a highly heterogeneous single
population of objects, or real has yet to be answered. Such dichotomy has been
evidenced by observations of the flux ratio between the optical and radio
emissions (usually $B$-band and 5 GHz). Evidence of two populations in quasars
and samples of a wide diversity of AGNs has been accumulated over the years.
Other quantities beyond radio loudness also seem to show the signature of the
existence of two different populations of AGN. To verify the existence of a
dichotomy through different parameters, we employed a soft clustering scheme,
based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to classify these objects
simultaneously using the following parameters: black hole mass, colour and $R$
loudness index, as well as the usual radio and $B$-band luminosity. To
investigate whether different kinds of AGNs manifest any population dichotomy,
we applied GMM to four independent catalogues composed of both optical and
radio information. Our results indicate the persistence of a dichotomy in all
datasets, although the discriminating power differs for different choices of
parameters. Although the Radio Loudness parameter alone does not seem to be
enough to display the dichotomy, the evidence of two populations of AGNs could
persist even if we consider other parameters. Our research suggests that the
dichotomy is not a misleading effect but real.

optical/UV outburst the power-law component, produced in the X-ray corona,
disappeared, and the spectrum of 1ES 1927+65 instead became dominated by a
blackbody component ($kT\sim 80-120$ eV). This implies that the X-ray corona,
ubiquitously found in AGN, was destroyed in the event. Our dense $\sim 450$ day
long X-ray monitoring shows that the source is extremely variable in the X-ray
band. On long time scales the source varies up to $\sim 4$ dex in $\sim 100$
days, while on short timescales up to $\sim2$ dex in $\sim 8$ hours. The
luminosity of the source is found to first show a strong dip down to $\sim
10^{40}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$, and then a constant increase in luminosity to levels
exceeding the pre-outburst level $\gtrsim $300 days after the optical event
detection, rising up asymptotically to $\sim 2\times10^{44}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$.
As the X-ray luminosity of the source increases, the X-ray corona is recreated,
and a very steep power-law component ($\Gamma\simeq 3$) reappears, and
dominates the emission for 0.3-2 keV luminosities $\gtrsim
10^{43.7}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$, $\sim 300$ days after the beginning of the event.
We discuss possible origins of this event, and speculate that our observations
could be explained by the interaction between the accretion flow and debris
from a tidally disrupted star. Our results show that changing-look events can
be associated with dramatic and rapid transformations of the innermost regions

thought to be due to a thermal-viscous instability in their accretion disk.
These eruptions provide constraints on angular momentum transport mechanisms.
We explore the idea that angular momentum transport could be controlled by the
dynamical evolution of the large scale magnetic field. We study the impact of
different prescriptions for the magnetic field evolution on the dynamics of the
disk. This is a first step in confronting the theory of magnetic field
transport with observations. We develop a version of the disk instability model
that evolves the density, the temperature and the large scale vertical magnetic
flux together. We take into account the accretion driven by turbulence or by a
magnetized outflow. To evolve the magnetic flux, we use a toy model with
physically motivated prescriptions depending mainly on the local magnetization.
We find that allowing magnetic flux to be advected inwards provides the best
agreement with DNe lightcurves. This leads to a hybrid configuration with an
inner magnetized disk, driven by angular momentum losses to an MHD outflow,
sharply transiting to an outer weakly-magnetized turbulent disk, where the
eruptions are triggered. The dynamical impact is equivalent to truncating a
viscous disk so that it does not extend down to the compact object, with the
truncation radius dependent on the magnetic flux and evolving as
$\dot{M}^{-2/3}$. Models of DNe and LMXBs lightcurves typically require the
outer, viscous disk to be truncated in order to match observations. There is no
generic explanation for this truncation. We propose that it is a natural
outcome of the presence of large-scale magnetic fields in both DNe and LMXBs,
the magnetic flux accumulating towards the center to produce a magnetized disk
with a fast accretion timescale.

temperature and polarization anisotropy from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope,
using data taken from 2013-2016 at 98 and 150 GHz. The maps cover more than
17,000 deg$^2$, the deepest 600 deg$^2$ with noise levels below 10
$\mu$K-arcmin. We use the power spectrum derived from almost 6,000 deg$^2$ of
these maps to constrain cosmology. The ACT data enable a measurement of the
angular scale of features in both the divergence-like polarization and the
temperature anisotropy, tracing both the velocity and density at
last-scattering. From these one can derive the distance to the last-scattering
surface and thus infer the local expansion rate, $H_0$. By combining ACT data
with large-scale information from WMAP we measure $H_0 = 67.6 \pm 1.1$
km/s/Mpc, at 68% confidence, in excellent agreement with the
independently-measured Planck satellite estimate (from ACT alone we find $H_0 =
67.9 \pm 1.5$ km/s/Mpc). The $\Lambda$CDM model provides a good fit to the ACT
data, and we find no evidence for deviations: both the spatial curvature, and
the departure from the standard lensing signal in the spectrum, are zero to
within 1$\sigma$; the number of relativistic species, the primordial Helium
fraction, and the running of the spectral index are consistent with
$\Lambda$CDM predictions to within $1.5 - 2.2\sigma$. We compare ACT, WMAP, and
Planck at the parameter level and find good consistency; we investigate how the
constraints on the correlated spectral index and baryon density parameters
readjust when adding CMB large-scale information that ACT does not measure. The
DR4 products presented here will be publicly released on the NASA Legacy

related to this, show numerous checks for systematic error done before
unblinding. Using the likelihood for the cosmological analysis we constrain
secondary sources of anisotropy and foreground emission, and derive a

foreground emission at 150 GHz is $\sim$1% of TT and EE within our selected

obtain the cosmological parameters for $\Lambda$CDM for the ACT data alone with
a prior on the optical depth of $\tau=0.065\pm0.015$. $\Lambda$CDM is a good
fit. The best-fit model has a reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.07 (PTE=0.07) with

with disparate sky coverage, angular resolution and spatially varying
anisotropic noise into a single map of the sky. We use this to merge hundreds
of individual maps covering the 2008-2018 ACT observing seasons, resulting in
by far the deepest ACT maps released so far. We also combine the maps with the
full Planck maps, resulting in maps that have the best features of both Planck
and ACT: Planck's nearly white noise on intermediate and large angular scales
and ACT's high-resolution and sensitivity on small angular scales. The maps
cover over 18,000 square degrees, nearly half the full sky, at 100, 150 and 220
GHz. They reveal 4,000 optically-confirmed clusters through the Sunyaev
Zel'dovich effect (SZ) and 18,500 point source candidates at $> 5\sigma$, the
largest single collection of SZ clusters and millimeter wave sources to date.
The multi-frequency maps provide millimeter images of nearby galaxies and
individual Milky Way nebulae, and even clear detections of several nearby
stars. Other anticipated uses of these maps include, for example, thermal SZ
and kinematic SZ cluster stacking, CMB cluster lensing and galactic dust
science. The method itself has negligible bias. However, due to the preliminary
nature of some of the component data sets, we caution that these maps should
not be used for precision cosmological analysis. The maps are part of ACT DR5,

  for stellar systems","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa3807",,"astro-ph.GA physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The unshielded nature of gravity means that stellar systems are inherently
inhomogeneous. As a result, stars do not move in straight lines. This obvious
fact severely complicates the kinetic theory of stellar systems because
position and velocity turn out to be poor coordinates with which to describe
stellar orbits - instead, one must use angle-action variables. Moreover, the
slow relaxation of star clusters and galaxies can be enhanced or suppressed by
collective interactions ('polarisation' effects) involving many stars
simultaneously. These collective effects are also present in plasmas; in that
case, they are accounted for by the Balescu-Lenard (BL) equation, which is a
kinetic equation in velocity space. Recently several authors have shown how to
account for both inhomogeneity and collective effects in the kinetic theory of
stellar systems by deriving an angle-action generalisation of the BL equation.
Unfortunately their derivations are long and complicated, involving multiple
coordinate transforms, contour integrals in the complex plane, and so on. On
the other hand, Rostoker's superposition principle allows one to pretend that a
long-range interacting $N$-body system, such as a plasma or star cluster,
consists merely of uncorrelated particles that are 'dressed' by polarisation
clouds. In this paper we use Rostoker's principle to provide a simple,
intuitive derivation of the BL equation for stellar systems which is much
shorter than others in the literature. It also allows us to straightforwardly
connect the BL picture of self-gravitating kinetics to the classical 'two-body
relaxation' theory of uncorrelated flybys pioneered by Chandrasekhar.

learner aims to identify the arms whose expected rewards deviate significantly
from most of the other arms. Different from existing work, we target the
generic outlier arms or outlier arm groups whose expected rewards can be
larger, smaller, or even in between those of normal arms. To this end, we start
by providing a comprehensive definition of such generic outlier arms and
outlier arm groups. Then we propose a novel pulling algorithm named GOLD to
identify such generic outlier arms. It builds a real-time neighborhood graph
based on upper confidence bounds and catches the behavior pattern of outliers
from normal arms. We also analyze its performance from various aspects. In the
experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world data sets, the proposed

However, we show in this paper that the generalization ability of the joint

to the weight divergence phenomenon. Hence, we propose a novel boosting
algorithm for FL to address both the generalization and gradient leakage
issues, as well as achieve faster convergence in gradient-based optimization.
In addition, a secure gradient sharing protocol using Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) and Differential Privacy (DP) is introduced to defend against gradient

demonstrate the proposed Federated Boosting (FedBoosting) method achieves
noticeable improvements in both prediction accuracy and run-time efficiency in

of certain structural information regarding the reward distributions and would
like to minimize their regret by exploiting this information, where the regret
is its performance difference against a benchmark policy that knows the best
action ahead of time. In the absence of structural information, the classical
upper confidence bound (UCB) and Thomson sampling algorithms are well known to
suffer only minimal regret. As recently pointed out, neither algorithms are,
however, capable of exploiting structural information that is commonly
available in practice. We propose a novel learning algorithm that we call DUSA
whose worst-case regret matches the information-theoretic regret lower bound up
to a constant factor and can handle a wide range of structural information. Our
algorithm DUSA solves a dual counterpart of the regret lower bound at the
empirical reward distribution and follows its suggested play. Our proposed
algorithm is the first computationally viable learning policy for structured
bandit problems that has asymptotic minimal regret.

appearance. For example, a tomato may be red or green, sliced or chopped, fresh

tomatoes in all these different states is challenging. On the other hand,
contextual cues (e.g., the presence of a knife, a cutting board, a strainer or
a pan) are often strongly indicative of how the object appears in the scene.
Recognizing such contextual cues is useful not only to improve the accuracy of
object detection or to determine the state of the object, but also to
understand its functional properties and to infer ongoing or upcoming
human-object interactions. A fully-supervised approach to recognizing object
states and their contexts in the real-world is unfortunately marred by the
long-tailed, open-ended distribution of the data, which would effectively
require massive amounts of annotations to capture the appearance of objects in
all their different forms. Instead of relying on manually-labeled data for this

leverage the semantic and compositional structure of language by training a

show that our detector learns to predict a rich variety of contextual object

past decade for the distinction between volume- and surface-mediated
photoexcitation and electron emission from such systems has underscored the
need for direct mechanistic insight and quantification of these two processes.
Toward this end, we use angle-resolved photoelectron velocity mapping to
directly distinguish volume and surface contributions to nanoplasmonic hot
electron emission from gold nanorods as a function of aspect ratio, down to the
spherical limit. Nanorods excited along their longitudinal surface plasmon axis
exhibit surprising transverse photoemission distributions due to the dominant
volume excitation mechanisms, as reproduced via ballistic Monte Carlo
modelling. We further demonstrate a screening-induced transition from volume
(transverse) to surface (longitudinal) photoemission with red detuning of the
excitation laser and determine the relative cross-sections of the two
mechanisms via combined volume and surface multiphoton photoemission modelling.
Based on these results, we are able to identify geometry- and material-specific
contributions to the photoemission cross-sections and offer general principles
for designing nanoplasmonic systems to control hot electron excitation and

of magnetic energy in decaying, nonhelical, magnetically dominated,
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in 3-dimensions (3D). We suggest that magnetic
reconnection is the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this inverse
transfer. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, the inverse transfer is easily
inferred to be due to smaller magnetic islands merging to form larger ones via
reconnection. We find that the scaling behaviour is similar between the 2D and
the 3D cases, i.e., the magnetic energy evolves as $t^{-1}$, and the magnetic
power spectrum follows a slope of $k^{-2}$. We show that on normalizing time by
the magnetic reconnection timescale, the evolution curves of the magnetic field
in systems with different Lundquist numbers collapse onto one another.
Furthermore, transfer function plots show signatures of magnetic reconnection
driving the inverse transfer. We also discuss the conserved quantities in the
system and show that the behaviour of these quantities is similar between the
2D and 3D simulations, thus making the case that the dynamics in 3D could be
approximately explained by what we understand in 2D. Lastly, we also conduct
simulations where the magnetic field is subdominant to the flow. Here, too, we
find an inverse transfer of magnetic energy in 3D. In these simulations, the
magnetic energy evolves as $ t^{-1.4}$ and, interestingly, a dynamo effect is
observed.

universal decoding algorithm for linear error correcting codes. Since GRAND
does not depend on the structure of the code, it can be used for any code
encountered in contemporary communication standards or may even be used for
random linear network coding. This property makes this new algorithm
particularly appealing. Instead of trying to decode the received vector, GRAND
attempts to identify the noise that corrupted the codeword. To that end, GRAND
relies on the generation of test error patterns that are successively applied
to the received vector. In this paper, we propose the first hardware
architecture for the GRAND algorithm. Considering GRAND with ABandonment
(GRANDAB) that limits the number of test patterns, the proposed architecture
only needs $2+\sum_{i=2}^{n} \left\lfloor\frac{i}{2}\right\rfloor$ time steps
to perform the $\sum_{i=1}^3 \binom{n}{i}$ queries required when $\text{AB}=3$.
For a code length of $128$, our proposed hardware architecture demonstrates
only a fraction ($1.2\%$) of the total number of performed queries as time
steps. Synthesis result using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology shows that average
throughputs of $32$ Gbps to $64$ Gbps can be achieved at an SNR of $10$ dB for
a code length of $128$ and code rates rate higher than $0.75$, transmitted over
an AWGN channel. Comparisons with a decoder tailored for a $(79,64)$ BCH code
show that the proposed architecture can achieve a slightly higher average
throughput at high SNRs, while obtaining the same decoding performance.

here the efficiency of the electrical power generation through an ultrathin
nanoporous membrane by means of streaming current (electrical current induced
by ionic flow in the vicinity of the liquid/solid interface) or electroosmosis
(flow rate induced by an electrical potential). Upscaling from one unique pore
to a nanoporous membrane is not straightforward when we consider low aspect
ratio nanopore because of 3D entrance effects, which lead to interactions
between the pores. Whereas these interactions have already been considered for
direct transport (hydrodynamic permeability of the membrane, ionic
conductance), specific effects appear when coupled transports are considered.
We obtain here the expression of the electroosmotic mobility for a nanoporous
membrane including surface conduction, and by a numerical evaluation of our
results, we show that (i) it depends mainly of the distance between the pores
and (ii) it is sublinear with the number of pores. Varying the pore spatial
organization (square, hexagonal, disordered structure) reveals that these
transport properties are only dependent on one parameter, the porosity of the
membrane (if other parameters such as membrane material/thickness are kept
constant). Finally, when considering energy conversion yield, it is shown that
increasing the number of pores is deleterious, and a nonmonotonic behavior with
salt concentration is reported.

agreement between gyrokinetic simulations of microtearing modes (MTMs) and two
magnetic frequency bands with corresponding toroidal mode numbers n=4 and 8.
Such disparate fluctuation scales, with substantial gaps between toroidal mode
numbers, are commonly observed in pedestal fluctuations. Here we provide a
clear explanation, namely the alignment of the relevant rational surfaces (and
not others) with the peak in the omega star profile, which is localized in the
steep gradient region of the pedestal. We demonstrate that a global treatment
is required to capture this effect. Nonlinear simulations suggest that the MTM
fluctuations produce experimentally-relevant transport levels and saturate by
relaxing the background electron temperature gradient, slightly downshifting
the fluctuation frequencies from the linear predictions. Scans in
collisionality are compared with simple MTM dispersion relations. At the
experimental points considered, MTM growth rates can either increase or
decrease with collision frequency depending on the parameters thus defying any
simple characterization of collisionality dependence.

externally-provided rewards. Previously, it was shown that maximizing mutual
information between agent actuators and future states, known as the empowerment
principle, enables unsupervised stabilization of dynamical systems at upright
positions, which is a prototypical intrinsically motivated behavior for upright
standing and walking. This follows from the coincidence between the objective
of stabilization and the objective of empowerment. Unfortunately, sample-based
estimation of this kind of mutual information is challenging. Recently, various
variational lower bounds (VLBs) on empowerment have been proposed as solutions;
however, they are often biased, unstable in training, and have high sample
complexity. In this work, we propose an alternative solution based on a
trainable representation of a dynamical system as a Gaussian channel, which
allows us to efficiently calculate an unbiased estimator of empowerment by
convex optimization. We demonstrate our solution for sample-based unsupervised
stabilization on different dynamical control systems and show the advantages of
our method by comparing it to the existing VLB approaches. Specifically, we
show that our method has a lower sample complexity, is more stable in training,
possesses the essential properties of the empowerment function, and allows
estimation of empowerment from images. Consequently, our method opens a path to
wider and easier adoption of empowerment for various applications.

design a novel permutation-equivariant neural architecture that takes contexts
from not only features of each transition (local) but also those of others

Experience Replay Sampler (NERS), on multiple benchmark tasks for both

improve the performance of various off-policy RL methods. Further analysis
confirms that the improvements of the sample efficiency indeed are due to
sampling diverse and meaningful transitions by NERS that considers both local

assumption: individual leg-times follow log-normal distributions. Moreover, our
key idea is to utilize Fenton-Wilkinson approximations of changeover-times
alongside an estimator for the total number of teams as in the notorious German

correctly predicts the existence of a small number of elite teams that
significantly outperform the rest of the teams. Our model also describes how
place increases linearly with changeover-time at the inflection point of the
log-normal distribution function. With real-world data from Jukola 2019, a
massive orienteering relay race, the model is shown to be highly accurate even
when the size of the training set is only 5% of the whole data set. Numerical

transition mechanisms in a solitary wave boundary layer developing over
randomly organized wave-like bottom topography. The boundary layer flow shows a
selective response to broadband perturbations from the bottom, and develops
streamwise-elongated streaks. When the streaks reach high amplitudes, they
indirectly amplify streamwise-elongated vortices through modulating small-scale
fluctuations and pressure fields. These stronger vortices in turn stir the
boundary layer more effectively and further intensify streaks via the lift-up
mechanism. This nonlinear feedback loop increases the sensitivity of the
boundary layer to the roughness level and yields dramatic variations among
cases sharing the same Reynolds number with differing roughness height. Three
different local breakdown scenarios are observed depending on the amplitude of
the streaks: (i) two-dimensional wave instabilities in the regions with weak
streaks; (ii) inner shear-layer instabilities in the regions with
moderate-amplitude streaks; (iii) rapidly growing outer shear-layer
instabilities in the regions with highly elevated high-amplitude streaks. Inner

bullets of ionized gas exposed to the central source. Furthermore, it is
suggestive that the same geometrical dichotomy between the cones seen in NGC

intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era has led to an intense activity in
establishing finer boundaries between classical and quantum computing. In this
paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to formulate a systematic
procedure for translating any sequence of $d$ quantum gates acting on $n$
q-bits into a Boltzmann machine (BM) having $n+g(d)$ classical spins or p-bits
with two values ""0"" and ""1"", but with a complex energy function $E$. Using this
procedure we emulate Shor's algorithm with up to $36$ q-bits using $90$ p-bits,
on an ordinary laptop computer in less than a day, while a naive
Schr\""{o}dinger implementation would require multiplying matrices with $\approx
10^{21}$ elements. Even larger problems should be accessible on dedicated Ising
Machines. However, we also identify clear limitations of the probabilistic
approach by introducing a quantitative metric $S_{\text{Total}}$ for its
inefficiency relative to a quantum computer. For example, a straightforward
probabilistic implementation of Shor's algorithm with $n$ q-bits leads to an
$S_{\text{Total}} \sim \exp{(-n/2)}$, making the computation time for the
probabilistic Shor's algorithm scale exponentially as $2^{n/2}$ instead of the
polynomial scaling expected for true quantum computers. This is a manifestation
of the well-known sign problem in QMC and it may be possible to ""tame"" it with
appropriate transformations. Finally, we present an example featuring a
standard optimization algorithm based on a purely real energy function to which
we add an imaginary part $\Im{(E)}$, thereby augmenting the statistical
suppression of Feynman paths with quantum-like phase cancellation. This example
illustrates how the sign problem encountered in classical annealers can

time-window allowed to an experiment to faithfully achieve such desired states.
This is of particular significance in critical systems, where the vanishing
energy gap challenges an adiabatic ground state preparation. We show that a
bang-bang protocol, consisting of a time evolution under two different values
of an externally tunable parameter, allows for a high-fidelity ground state
preparation in evolution times no longer than those required by the application
of standard optimal control techniques, such as the chopped-random basis
quantum optimization. In addition, owing to their reduced number of variables,
such bang-bang protocols are very well suited to optimization purposes,
reducing the increasing computational cost of other optimal control protocols.
We benchmark the performance of such approach through two paradigmatic models,
namely the Landau-Zener and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Remarkably, the
critical ground state of the latter model can be prepared with a high fidelity
in a total evolution time that scales slower than the inverse of the vanishing

that the three-point coupling $\langle \mathcal{O}_L\mathcal{O}_L
[T^m]\rangle$, where $\mathcal{O}_L$ is any light primary operator, is
independent of the purely gravitational action. Next, we consider corrections
to this coupling due to additional interactions in AdS effective field theory
and the corresponding dual CFT. When the CFT contains a non-zero three-point
coupling $\langle TT \mathcal{O}_L\rangle$, the three-point coupling $\langle
\mathcal{O}_L\mathcal{O}_L [T^2]\rangle$ is modified at large $C_T$ if $\langle
TT\mathcal{O}_L \rangle \sim \sqrt{C_T}$. This scaling is obeyed by the
dilaton, by Kaluza-Klein modes of prototypical supergravity compactifications,
and by scalars in stress tensor multiplets of supersymmetric CFTs. Quartic
derivative interactions involving the graviton and the light probe field dual
to $\mathcal{O}_L$ can also modify the minimal-twist couplings; these local
interactions may be generated by integrating out a spin-$\ell \geq 2$ bulk

applications. As machine learning increases in ubiquity as a backend for
automated systems, concerns about fairness arise. Much of the current
literature on fairness deals with discrimination against protected classes in
supervised learning (group fairness). We define a different notion of fair
clustering wherein the probability that two points (or a community of points)
become separated is bounded by an increasing function of their pairwise
distance (or community diameter). We capture the situation where data points
represent people who gain some benefit from being clustered together.
Unfairness arises when certain points are deterministically separated, either
arbitrarily or by someone who intends to harm them as in the case of
gerrymandering election districts. In response, we formally define two new
types of fairness in the clustering setting, pairwise fairness and community
preservation. To explore the practicality of our fairness goals, we devise an
approach for extending existing $k$-center algorithms to satisfy these fairness
constraints. Analysis of this approach proves that reasonable approximations
can be achieved while maintaining fairness. In experiments, we compare the
effectiveness of our approach to classical $k$-center algorithms/heuristics and
explore the tradeoff between optimal clustering and fairness.

their origins given that planet-disk interactions are thought to be essential
to maintain such a high degree of coplanarity, yet these same interactions
invariably cause planets to migrate into chains of mean motion resonances. Here
we mine a large dataset of dynamical simulations of super-Earth formation by
migration. These simulations match the observed period ratio distribution as
long as the vast majority of planet pairs in resonance become dynamically
unstable. When instabilities take place resonances are broken during a late
phase of giant impacts, and typical surviving systems have planet pairs with
significant mutual orbital inclinations. However, a subset of our unstable
simulations matches the Kepler-11 system in terms of coplanarity, compactness,
planet-multiplicity and non-resonant state. This subset have dynamical
instability phases typically much shorter than ordinary systems. Unstable
systems may keep a high degree of coplanarity post-instability if planets
collide at very low orbital inclinations ($\lesssim1^\circ$) or if collisions
promote efficient damping of orbital inclinations. If planetary scattering
during the instability takes place at low orbital inclinations
($\text{i}\lesssim1^\circ$), orbital inclinations are barely increased by
encounters before planets collide.When planetary scattering pumps orbital
inclinations to higher values ($\gtrsim 1^\circ$) planets tend to collide at
higher mutual orbital inclinations, but depending on the geometry of collisions
mergers' orbital inclinations may be efficiently damped. Each of these

quantum computer. We compile circuits for several variants of quantum
accelerated simulated annealing including those using qubitization or Szegedy
walks to quantize classical Markov chains and those simulating spectral gap
amplified Hamiltonians encoding a Gibbs state. We also optimize fault-tolerant
realizations of the adiabatic algorithm, quantum enhanced population transfer,
the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and other approaches. Many of
these methods are bottlenecked by calls to the same subroutines; thus,
optimized circuits for those primitives should be of interest regardless of
which heuristic is most effective in practice. We compile these bottlenecks for
several families of optimization problems and report for how long and for what
size systems one can perform these heuristics in the surface code given a range
of resource budgets. Our results discourage the notion that any quantum
optimization heuristic realizing only a quadratic speedup will achieve an
advantage over classical algorithms on modest superconducting qubit surface
code processors without significant improvements in the implementation of the
surface code. For instance, under quantum-favorable assumptions (e.g., that the
quantum algorithm requires exactly quadratically fewer steps), our analysis
suggests that quantum accelerated simulated annealing would require roughly a
day and a million physical qubits to optimize spin glasses that could be solved
by classical simulated annealing in about four CPU-minutes.

large-scale discontinuous structures such as strong shock waves without obvious
non-physical oscillations while resolving sharp contact, material interface and
shear layer. Secondly, the numerical dissipation property of PnTm-BVD-CD can be
effectively controlled between n+1 order upwind-biased scheme and
non-dissipative n+2 order central scheme through a simple tunable parameter
$\lambda$. Thirdly, with $\lambda=0.5$ the scheme can recover to n+2 order
non-dissipative central interpolation for smooth solution over all wavenumber,
which is preferable for solving small-scale structures in DNS as well as
resolvable-scale in explicit LES. Finally, the under-resolved small-scale can
be solved with dissipation controllable algorithm through so-called implicit

catastrophic forgetting: a model trained on tasks in sequence will suffer
significant performance drops on earlier tasks. Despite the ubiquity of
catastrophic forgetting, there is limited understanding of the underlying
process and its causes. In this paper, we address this important knowledge gap,
investigating how forgetting affects representations in neural network models.
Through representational analysis techniques, we find that deeper layers are
disproportionately the source of forgetting. Supporting this, a study of
methods to mitigate forgetting illustrates that they act to stabilize deeper
layers. These insights enable the development of an analytic argument and
empirical picture relating the degree of forgetting to representational
similarity between tasks. Consistent with this picture, we observe maximal
forgetting occurs for task sequences with intermediate similarity. We perform
empirical studies on the standard split CIFAR-10 setup and also introduce a
novel CIFAR-100 based task approximating realistic input distribution shift.

automated methods of transforming them into digital datasets need to be
employed. Frequently, this process is based on computer vision algorithms.
However, low conversion accuracy for low quality and visually complex maps and
setting optimal parameters are the two challenges of using those algorithms. In
this paper, we employed the standard paradigm of using deep convolutional

automatically identifying road intersections in scanned historical USGS maps of

some specified nodes of a given graph, such that the number of edges between
each node of the tree and its root respects a given hop limit. This NP-hard
problem has many variants, often modeled as integer linear programs. Two of the
models are so-called assignment and partial-ordering based models, which yield
(up to our knowledge) the best two state-of-the-art formulations for the
variant Steiner tree problem with revenues, budgets, and hop constraints
(STPRBH). The solution of the HSTP and its variants such as the STPRBH and the
hop-constrained minimum spanning tree problem (HMSTP) is a hop-constrained
tree, a rooted tree whose depth is bounded by a given hop limit. This paper
provides some theoretical results that show the polyhedral advantages of the
partial-ordering model over the assignment model for this class of problems.
Computational results in this paper and the literature for the HSTP, STPRBH,

impervious surface, population density, and street intersection points. All
data are circa 2010 and we calculated their RGD spectra in six urbanized areas

numbers rather than statistical moments which leads to a clear interpretation
of generalized dimensions and to spatial visualization of pattern's
multifractality. The results show that patterns of different urban modalities

have different morphologies. In our six examples, we found that morphologies of
patterns of land cover and impervious surface tend to be monofractal, patterns
of street intersection points tend to be moderately multifractal, and patterns
of population density tend to be strongly multi-fractal. Spatial visualization
supporting this numerical finding is provided. Thus, when studying the
multifractality of urban morphology, it is important to choose a modality that
is appropriate to the goal of the investigation. Urban areas may have similar

demonstrate a periodically-poled thin film lithium niobate microring resonator
(PPLNMR) that reaches 5,000,000%/W second harmonic conversion
efficiency---almost 20-fold enhancement over the state-of-the-art---by
accessing its largest $\chi^{(2)}$ tensor component $d_{33}$ via quasi-phase
matching. The corresponding single photon coupling rate $g/2\pi$ is estimated
to be 1.2 MHz, which is an important milestone as it approaches the dissipation
rate $\kappa/2\pi$ of best available lithium niobate microresonators developed
in the community. Using a figure of merit defined as $g/\kappa$, our devices
reach a single photon nonlinearity approaching 1%. We show that, by further
scaling of the device, it is possible to improve the single photon nonlinearity
to a regime where photon-blockade effect can be manifested.

the tracks of different drifters quickly diverged after deployment. We explain
the clustering of drifter types using a recent Maxey-Riley theory for surface
ocean inertial particle dynamics applied on multidata-based mesoscale ocean
currents and winds from reanalysis. Simulated trajectories of objects at the
air-sea interface are significantly improved when represented as inertial
(accounting for buoyancy and size), rather than as perfectly Lagrangian (fluid
following) particles. Separation distances between simulated and observed
trajectories were substantially smaller for debris-like drifters than for
\emph{Sargassum}-like drifters, suggesting that additional consideration of its
physical properties relative to fluid velocities may be useful. Our findings
can be applied to model variability in movements and distribution of diverse
objects floating at the ocean surface.

However, there is an increasing amount of evidence that the strain diversity of
pathogens, and their interplay with the host immune system, can play a large
role in shaping the dynamics of epidemics. Here, we introduce a disease model
with an underlying genotype network to account for two important mechanisms.
One, the disease can mutate along network pathways as it spreads in a host
population. Two, the genotype network allows us to define a genetic distance
across strains and therefore to model the transcendence of immunity often
observed in real world pathogens. We study the emergence of epidemics in this
model, through its epidemic phase transitions, and highlight the role of the
genotype network in driving cyclicity of diseases, large scale fluctuations,
sequential epidemic transitions, as well as localization around specific
strains of the associated pathogen. More generally, our model illustrates the
richness of behaviours that are possible even in well-mixed host populations

Near a dozen star-forming galaxies have been detected in gamma-rays
by the Fermi observatory in the last decade. A remarkable property of this
sample is the quasi-linear relation between the gamma-ray luminosity and the
star formation rate, obtained assuming that the latter is well traced by the
infra-red luminosity of the galaxies. The non-linearity of this relation has
not been fully explained yet.
  Aims. We aim at determining the biases derived from the use of the infrared
luminosity as a proxy for the star formation rate, and shed light onto the more
fundamental relation between the latter and the gamma-ray luminosity. We expect
to quantify and explain some trends observed in this relation.
  Methods. We compile from the literature a near-homogeneous set of distances,
ultraviolet, optical, infra-red, and gamma-ray fluxes for all known gamma-ray
emitting star-forming galaxies. From these data we compute the infra-red and
gamma-ray luminosities, and star formation rates. We determine the best-fitting
relation between the latter two, and describe the trend using simple,
population-oriented models for cosmic-ray transport and cooling.
  Results. We find that the gamma-ray luminosity-star formation rate relation
obtained from infra-red luminosities is biased to shallower slopes. The actual
relation is steeper than previous estimates, having a power-law index of 1.35
+- 0.05, in contrast to 1.23 +- 0.06.
  Conclusions. The unbiased gamma-ray luminosity-star formation rate relation
can be explained at high star formation rates by assuming that the cosmic ray
cooling region is kiloparsec-sized, and pervaded by mild to fast winds.
Combined with previous results about the scaling of wind velocity with star
formation rate, our work provides support to advection as the dominant cosmic
ray escape mechanism in low-star formation rate galaxies.

image in a given domain to an analogous image in a different domain, without
explicit supervision of the mapping. Few-shot unsupervised image-to-image
translation further attempts to generalize the model to an unseen domain by
leveraging example images of the unseen domain provided at inference time.
While remarkably successful, existing few-shot image-to-image translation
models find it difficult to preserve the structure of the input image while
emulating the appearance of the unseen domain, which we refer to as the content
loss problem. This is particularly severe when the poses of the objects in the
input and example images are very different. To address the issue, we propose a
new few-shot image translation model, COCO-FUNIT, which computes the style
embedding of the example images conditioned on the input image and a new module
called the constant style bias. Through extensive experimental validations with
comparison to the state-of-the-art, our model shows effectiveness in addressing
the content loss problem. For code and pretrained models, please check out

  Local Error Bound Condition",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ""Inertial Forward-Backward algorithm"" (IFB) is a powerful tool for convex
nonsmooth minimization problems, it gives the well known ""fast iterative
shrinkage-thresholding algorithm "" (FISTA), which enjoys $O\left(
{\frac{1}{{{k^2}}}} \right)$ global convergence rate of function values,
however, no convergence of iterates has been proved; by do a small
modification, an accelerated IFB called ""FISTA\_CD"" improves the convergence
rate of function values to $o\left( {\frac{1}{{{k^2}}}} \right)$ and shows the
weak convergence of iterates. The local error bound condition is extremely
useful in analyzing the convergence rates of a host of iterative methods for
solving optimization problems, and in practical application, a large number of
problems with special structure often satisfy the error bound condition.
Naturally, using local error bound condition to derive or improve the
convergence rate of IFB is a common means. In this paper, based on the local
error bound condition, we exploit an new assumption condition for the important
parameter $t_k$ in IFB, and establish the improved convergence rate of function
values and strong convergence of the iterates generated by the IFB algorithms
with six $t_k$ satisfying the above assumption condition in Hilbert space. It
is remarkable that, under the local error bound condition, we establish the
strong convergence of the iterates generated by the original FISTA, and prove
that the convergence rates of function values for FISTA\_CD is actually related
to the value of parameter $a,$ and show that the IFB algorithms with some $t_k$
mentioned above can achieve sublinear convergence rate $o\left(
{\frac{1}{{{k^p}}}} \right)$ for any positive integer $p>1$. Some numerical
experiments are conducted to illustrate our results.

cone is rank-one generated (ROG) if all of its extreme rays are generated by
rank-one matrices. The ROG property of $\mathcal{S}$ is closely related to the
exactness of SDP relaxations of nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic
programs (QCQPs) related to $\mathcal{S}$. We consider the case where
$\mathcal{S}$ is obtained as the intersection of the PSD cone with finitely
many homogeneous linear matrix inequalities and conic constraints and identify
sufficient conditions that guarantee that $\mathcal{S}$ is ROG. Our general
framework allows us to recover a number of well-known results from the
literature. In the case of two linear matrix inequalities, we also establish
the necessity of our sufficient conditions. This extends one of the few
settings from the literature -- the case of one linear matrix inequality and
the S-lemma -- where an explicit characterization for the ROG property exists.
Finally, we show how our ROG results on cones can be translated into
inhomogeneous SDP exactness results and convex hull descriptions in the
original space of a QCQP. We close with a few applications of these results;
specifically, we recover the well-known perspective reformulation of a simple
mixed-binary set via the ROG toolkit.

to model linear damping in dissipative systems such as resistive circuits and a
spring-mass ensambles was extended to a quantum mechanical formalism. Three
important associated 1 dimensional problems were solved: the free particle
case, the infinite potential well, and the harmonic potential. The wave
equations generated reproduced the same type of 2-order ODE observed in
classical dissipative systems, and produced quantized energy levels. In the
infinite potential well, a zero-point energy emerges, which can be fitted to
the rest energy of the particle described by special relativity, given by
relationship $E_r=mc^2$. In the harmonic potential, new fractional creation and
destruction operators were introduced to solve the problem in the energy basis.
The energy eigenvalues found are different to the ones reported by earlier
approaches to the quantum damped oscillator problem reported by other authors.
In this case, a direct relationship between the relativistic rest energy of the
particle and the expected value of the fractionary kinetic energy in the base
state was obtained. We conclude that there exists a relationship between
fractional kinetic energy and special relativity energies, that remains unclear
and needs further exploration, but also conclude that the current form of
transforming fractionary momentum operators to the position basis will yield
non-observable imaginary momentum quantities, and thus a correction to the way
of transforming them needs to be explored further.

distinguish two types of periodic conditions: those imposing the periodicity
requirement on the function and all its derivatives (to infinite order), and
those imposing periodicity on the function and its derivatives up to a finite

Kinetic Inviscid Flux (KIF) method and Flux Reconstruction (FR) framework. The
KIF aims to find a balance between the excellent merits of Gas-Kinetic Scheme
(GKS) and the lower computational costs. The idea of KIF can be viewed as an
inviscid-viscous splitting version of the gas-kinetic scheme, and Shu and
Ohwada have made the fundamental contribution. The combination of Totally
Thermalized Transport (TTT) scheme and Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting (KFVS)
method are achieved in KIF. Using a coefficient which is related to time step
$\delta t$ and averaged collision time $\tau$, KIF can adjust the weights of
TTT and KFVS flux in the simulation adaptively. By doing the inviscid-viscous
splitting, KIF is very suitable and easy to integrate into the existing
framework. The well understood FR framework is used widely for the advantages
of robustness, economical costs and compactness. The combination of KIF and FR
is originated by three motivations. The first purpose is to develop a high
order method based on the gas kinetic theory. The second reason is to keep the
advantages of GKS. The last aim is that the designed method should be more
efficient. In present work, we use the KIF method to replace the Riemann flux
solver applied in the interfaces of elements. The common solution at the
interface is computed according to the gas kinetic theory, which makes the
combination of KIF and FR scheme more reasonable and available. The accuracy
and performance of present method are validated by several numerical cases. The
Taylor-Green vortex problem has been used to verify its potential to simulate
turbulent flows.

the system can automatically identify the same person appearing at different

is the cross-modality gap of features under different modalities. To solve this
challenge, we proposed a Teacher-Student GAN model (TS-GAN) to adopt different
domains and guide the ReID backbone to learn better ReID information. (1) In
order to get corresponding RGB-IR image pairs, the RGB-IR Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) was used to generate IR images. (2) To kick-start the
training of identities, a ReID Teacher module was trained under IR modality
person images, which is then used to guide its Student counterpart in training.
(3) Likewise, to better adapt different domain features and enhance model ReID
performance, three Teacher-Student loss functions were used. Unlike other GAN
based models, the proposed model only needs the backbone module at the test
stage, making it more efficient and resource-saving. To showcase our model's

geoparsing system, known as a geoparser, takes some texts as the input and

2019, a geoparsing competition, Toponym Resolution in Scientific Papers, was
held as one of the SemEval 2019 tasks. The winning teams developed neural
network based geoparsers that achieved outstanding performances (over 90%

brings the question ""are we there yet?"", namely have we achieved high enough
performances to possibly consider the problem of geoparsing as solved? One
limitation of this competition is that the developed geoparsers were tested on
only one dataset which has 45 research articles collected from the particular

different performances on different datasets. Thus, this work performs a
systematic evaluation of these state-of-the-art geoparsers using our recently

  Sample Complexity","Addressed minor comments from NeurIPS",,,,"cs.LG cs.GT cs.MA math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model-based reinforcement learning (RL), which finds an optimal policy using
an empirical model, has long been recognized as one of the corner stones of RL.
It is especially suitable for multi-agent RL (MARL), as it naturally decouples
the learning and the planning phases, and avoids the non-stationarity problem
when all agents are improving their policies simultaneously using samples.
Though intuitive and widely-used, the sample complexity of model-based MARL
algorithms has not been fully investigated. In this paper, our goal is to
address the fundamental question about its sample complexity. We study arguably
the most basic MARL setting: two-player discounted zero-sum Markov games, given
only access to a generative model. We show that model-based MARL achieves a
sample complexity of $\tilde O(|S||A||B|(1-\gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2})$ for
finding the Nash equilibrium (NE) value up to some $\epsilon$ error, and the
$\epsilon$-NE policies with a smooth planning oracle, where $\gamma$ is the
discount factor, and $S,A,B$ denote the state space, and the action spaces for
the two agents. We further show that such a sample bound is minimax-optimal (up
to logarithmic factors) if the algorithm is reward-agnostic, where the
algorithm queries state transition samples without reward knowledge, by
establishing a matching lower bound. This is in contrast to the usual
reward-aware setting, with a
$\tilde\Omega(|S|(|A|+|B|)(1-\gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound, where
this model-based approach is near-optimal with only a gap on the $|A|,|B|$
dependence. Our results not only demonstrate the sample-efficiency of this
basic model-based approach in MARL, but also elaborate on the fundamental
tradeoff between its power (easily handling the more challenging
reward-agnostic case) and limitation (less adaptive and suboptimal in
$|A|,|B|$), particularly arises in the multi-agent context.

and, despite the recent success of learning-based approaches, there is still
need for model-based solutions. This is especially the case when the amount of
data available for training is not sufficiently large, a common situation in
several applied areas, or when computational resources are limited. In this
context, here we propose a method for texture descriptors that combines the
representation power of complex objects by cellular automata with the known
effectiveness of local descriptors in texture analysis. The method formulates a
new transition function for the automaton inspired on local binary descriptors.
It counterbalances the new state of each cell with the previous state, in this
way introducing an idea of ""controlled deterministic chaos"". The descriptors
are obtained from the distribution of cell states. The proposed descriptors are
applied to the classification of texture images both on benchmark data sets and
a real-world problem, i.e., that of identifying plant species based on the
texture of their leaf surfaces. Our proposal outperforms other classical and

stable rationality of smooth projective varieties in positive characteristic.
Recently Voisin constructed two new obstructions to stable rationality for
rationally connected complex projective threefolds by giving necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of a cohomological decomposition of the
diagonal. In this paper, we show how to extend these obstructions to rationally
chain connected threefolds in positive characteristic via ell-adic
cohomological decomposition of the diagonal. This requires extending results in
Hodge theory regarding intermediate Jacobians and Abel--Jacobi maps to the
setting of algebraic representatives. For instance, we show that the algebraic
representative for codimension-two cycle classes on a geometrically stably
rational threefold admits a canonical auto-duality, which in characteristic
zero agrees with the principal polarization on the intermediate Jacobian coming
from Hodge theory. As an application, we extend a result of Voisin, and show
that in characteristic greater than two, a desingularization of a very general

infections as of middle June 2020. Recently, Brazil has become a new epicentre
of COVID-19, while India and African region are potential epicentres. This
study aims to predict the inflection point and outbreak size of these
new/potential epicentres at the early phase of the epidemics by borrowing
information from more `mature' curves from other countries. We modeled the
cumulative cases to the well-known sigmoid growth curves to describe the
epidemic trends under the mixed-effect models and using the four-parameter
logistic model after power transformations. African region is predicted to have
the largest total outbreak size of 3.9 million cases (2.2 to 6 million), and
the inflection will come around September 13, 2020. Brazil and India are
predicted to have a similar final outbreak size of around 2.5 million cases
(1.1 to 4.3 million), with the inflection points arriving June 23 and July 26,
respectively. We conclude in Brazil, India, and African the epidemics of COVI19
have not yet passed the inflection points; these regions potentially can take

nonparametric quantile regression with the goal of generalizing existing risk
bounds known for the usual trend filtering estimators which perform mean
regression. We study both the penalized and the constrained version (of order
$r \geq 1$) of univariate quantile trend filtering. Our results show that both
the constrained and the penalized version (of order $r \geq 1$) attain the
minimax rate up to log factors, when the $(r-1)$th discrete derivative of the
true vector of quantiles belongs to the class of bounded variation signals.
Moreover we also show that if the true vector of quantiles is a discrete spline
with a few polynomial pieces then both versions attain a near parametric rate
of convergence. Corresponding results for the usual trend filtering estimators
are known to hold only when the errors are sub-Gaussian. In contrast, our risk
bounds are shown to hold under minimal assumptions on the error variables. In
particular, no moment assumptions are needed and our results hold under
heavy-tailed errors. Our proof techniques are general and thus can potentially
be used to study other nonparametric quantile regression methods. To illustrate
this generality we also employ our proof techniques to obtain new results for
multivariate quantile total variation denoising and high dimensional quantile
linear regression.

Plotting this average for model systems of chaotic spectra reveals what has
been termed a dip-ramp-plateau shape. Generalising earlier work of Br\'ezin and
Hikami for the Gaussian unitary ensemble, it is shown how the average in the
case of the Laguerre unitary ensemble can be reduced to an expression involving
the spectral density of the Jacobi unitary ensemble. This facilitates studying
the large $N$ limit, and so quantifying the dip-ramp-plateau effect. When the
parameter $a$ in the Laguerre weight $x^a e^{-x}$ scales with $N$, quantitative

scalaron becomes light in the low-density region while it becomes heavy in the
high-density region of matter. Then it is found that the scalaron can be
regarded as a dark matter (DM) candidate since the scalaron mass is found to be
quite close to the mass of ultralight axions, a prime DM candidate. Thus the

commuters often face the transit first mile/last mile (FMLM) problem. To deal
with this, they either drive to a park-and-ride location to take transit, use
carpooling, or drive directly to their destination to avoid inconvenience.
Ridesharing, an emerging mode of transportation, can solve the transit first
mile/last mile problem. In this setup, a driver can drive a ride-seeker to a
transit station, from where the rider can take transit to her respective
destination. The problem requires solving a ridesharing matching problem with
the routing of riders in a multimodal transportation network. We develop a
transit-based ridesharing matching algorithm to solve this problem. The method
leverages the schedule-based transit shortest path to generate feasible matches
and then solves a matching optimization program to find an optimal match
between riders and drivers. The proposed method not only assigns an optimal
driver to the rider but also assigns an optimal transit stop and a transit
vehicle trip departing from that stop for the rest of the rider's itinerary. We
also introduce the application of space-time prism (STP) (the geographical area
which can be reached by a traveler given the time constraints) in the context
of ridesharing to reduce the computational time by reducing the network search.
An algorithm to solve this problem dynamically using a rolling horizon approach

travel demand model of Twin Cities, MN to show that the transit-based
ridesharing can solve the FMLM problem and save a significant number of

emitters (QD) and plasmonic nanoantennas open up new perspectives in the
control of light. However, precise positioning of any active medium at the
nanoscale constitutes a challenge. Here, we report on the optimal overlap of
antenna's near-field and active medium whose spatial distribution is controlled
via a plasmon-triggered 2-photon polymerization of a photosensitive formulation
containing QDs. Au nanoparticles of various geometries are considered. The
response of these hybrid nano-emitters is shown to be highly sensitive to the
light polarization. Different light emission states are evidenced by
photoluminescence measurements. These states correspond to
polarization-sensitive nanoscale overlap between the exciting local field and
the active medium distribution. The decrease of the QD concentration within the
monomer formulation allows trapping of a single quantum dot in the vicinity of
the Au particle. The latter objects show polarization-dependent switching in
the single-photon regime.

find that multivariate transfer entropy captures key properties of all networks

channels. The noisy permutation channel model constitutes a standard discrete
memoryless channel (DMC) followed by an independent random permutation that
reorders the output codeword of the DMC. While coding theoretic aspects of this
model have been studied extensively, particularly in the context of reliable
communication in network settings where packets undergo transpositions, and
closely related models of DNA based storage systems have also been analyzed
recently, we initiate an information theoretic study of this model by defining
an appropriate notion of noisy permutation channel capacity. Specifically, on
the achievability front, we prove a lower bound on the noisy permutation
channel capacity of any DMC in terms of the rank of the stochastic matrix of
the DMC. On the converse front, we establish two upper bounds on the noisy
permutation channel capacity of any DMC whose stochastic matrix is strictly
positive (entry-wise). Together, these bounds yield coding theorems that
characterize the noisy permutation channel capacities of every strictly
positive and ""full rank"" DMC, and our achievability proof yields a conceptually
simple, computationally efficient, and capacity achieving coding scheme for
such DMCs. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the relation between the output
degradation preorder over channels and noisy permutation channel capacity. In
fact, the proof of one of our converse bounds exploits a degradation result
that constructs a symmetric channel for any DMC such that the DMC is a degraded
version of the symmetric channel. Finally, we illustrate some examples such as
the special cases of binary symmetric channels and (general) erasure channels.
Somewhat surprisingly, our results suggest that noisy permutation channel
capacities are generally quite agnostic to the parameters that define the DMCs.

motor proteins, by polymerization of the cytoskeleton, or due to the

mathematical modeling of the associated membrane mechanics and have provided
insights into the force-displacement relationships of membrane tubes. Recent
advances in quantitative biophysical measurements of membrane-protein

manipulators. For large engineering manipulators, the main challenge is to
accurately recognize the posture of all arm segments. In classical sensing
methods, the accuracy of an inclinometer is easily affected by the elastic
deformation in the manipulator's arms. This results in big error accumulations
when sensing the angle of joints between arms one by one. In addition, the
sensing method based on machine vision is not suitable for such kind of outdoor
working situation yet. In this paper, we propose a novel posture positioning
method for multi-joint manipulators based on wireless sensor network
localization. The posture sensing problem is formulated as a
Nearest-Euclidean-Distance-Matrix (NEDM) model. The resulting approach is
referred to as EDM-based posture positioning approach (EPP) and it satisfies
the following guiding principles: (i) The posture of each arm segment on a
multi-joint manipulator must be estimated as accurately as possible; (ii) The
approach must be computationally fast; (iii) The designed approach should not
be susceptible to obstructions. To further improve accuracy, we explore the
inherent structure of manipulators, i.e., fixed-arm length. This is naturally
presented as linear constraints in the NEDM model. For concrete pumps, a
typical multi-joint manipulator, the mechanical property that all arm segments
always lie in a 2D plane is used for dimension-reduction operation. Simulation
and experimental results show that the proposed method provides efficient
solutions for posture sensing problem and can obtain preferable localization
performance with faster speed than applying the existing localization methods.

the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we perform supervised learning between
superconducting gap functions and electron-boson spectral functions. For simple
spectral functions, the neural network can easily capture the correspondence
and predict perfectly. For complex spectral functions, an autoencoder is
utilized to reduce the complexity of the spectral functions to be compatible to
that of the gap functions. After this complexity-reduction process, relevant
information of the spectral function is extracted and good performance
restores. Our proposed method can extract relevant information from data and

training domain invariant generic machine learning models. This research is
conducted to apply domain adaptation to the ironmaking industry, and
particularly for the creation of a domain invariant dataset by gathering data
from different blast furnaces. The blast furnace data is characterized by
multivariate time series. Domain adaptation for multivariate time series data
hasn't been covered extensively in the literature. We propose MTS-CycleGAN, an

of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based AutoEncoder (AE) for the generator and
a stacked LSTM-based discriminator, together with dedicated extended features
extraction mechanisms. MTS-CycleGAN is validated using two artificial datasets
embedding the complex temporal relations between variables reflecting the blast
furnace process. MTS-CycleGAN is successfully learning the mapping between both

equal amplitudes until its position is determined by measurement. When the two
output modes are observed by a single photon detector, the generated clicks can
be interpreted as ones and zeros - and a raw random bit stream is obtained.
Here we implement such a random bit generator based on single photons from a

bias are discussed. A number of ways to suppress such unwanted effects, and an

to be investigated before the instrumental noise becomes significant at a
spacecraft frame frequency of $f_{sc}\approx 3$Hz, whereas calibrated
spacecraft potential allows a measurement up to $f_{sc}\approx 40$Hz. In this
work, we give a detailed description of density estimation in the solar wind
using the spacecraft potential measurement from the SDP instrument on MMS.
Several intervals of solar wind plasma have been processed using the
methodology described which are made available. One of the intervals is
investigated in more detail and the power spectral density of the compressive
fluctuations is measured from the inertial range to the sub-ion range. The
morphology of the density spectra can be explained by either a cascade of
Alfv\'en waves and slow waves at large scales and kinetic Alfv\'en waves at
sub-ion scales, or more generally by the Hall effect. Using electric field
measurements the two hypotheses are discussed.

impressive results for scene text recognition, and many variants have emerged
with improvements in recognition quality. However, it performs poorly on
contextless texts (e.g., random character sequences) which is unacceptable in
most of real application scenarios. In this paper, we first deeply investigate
the decoding process of the decoder. We empirically find that a representative
character-level sequence decoder utilizes not only context information but also
positional information. Contextual information, which the existing approaches
heavily rely on, causes the problem of attention drift. To suppress such
side-effect, we propose a novel position enhancement branch, and dynamically
fuse its outputs with those of the decoder attention module for scene text
recognition. Specifically, it contains a position aware module to enable the
encoder to output feature vectors encoding their own spatial positions, and an
attention module to estimate glimpses using the positional clue (i.e., the
current decoding time step) only. The dynamic fusion is conducted for more
robust feature via an element-wise gate mechanism. Theoretically, our proposed
method, dubbed \emph{RobustScanner}, decodes individual characters with dynamic
ratio between context and positional clues, and utilizes more positional ones
when the decoding sequences with scarce context, and thus is robust and
practical. Empirically, it has achieved new state-of-the-art results on popular
regular and irregular text recognition benchmarks while without much
performance drop on contextless benchmarks, validating its robustness in both

sparse linear sums drawn from a smaller collection of basic building blocks. In
application domains where such techniques are deployed, we frequently encounter
datasets where some form of symmetry or invariance is present. Motivated by
this observation, we develop a framework for learning dictionaries for data
under the constraint that the collection of basic building blocks remains
invariant under such symmetries. Our procedure for learning such dictionaries
relies on representing the symmetry as the action of a matrix group acting on
the data, and subsequently introducing a convex penalty function so as to
induce sparsity with respect to the collection of matrix group elements. Our
framework specializes to the convolutional dictionary learning problem when we
consider integer shifts. Using properties of positive semidefinite Hermitian
Toeplitz matrices, we develop an extension that learns dictionaries that are
invariant under continuous shifts. Our numerical experiments on synthetic data
and ECG data show that the incorporation of such symmetries as priors are most
valuable when the dataset has few data-points, or when the full range of
symmetries is inadequately expressed in the dataset.

by modifying its electromagnetic environment using a nanocavity mode. In
particular, we consider the photorelaxation of the RNA nucleobase uracil, which
is the natural mechanism to prevent photodamage. In our theoretical work, we
identify the operative conditions in which strong coupling with the cavity mode
can open an efficient photoprotective channel, resulting in a relaxation
dynamics twice as fast than the natural one. We rely on a state-of-the-art
chemically-detailed molecular model and a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian propagation
approach to perform full-quantum simulations of the system dissipative
dynamics. By focusing on the photon decay, our analysis unveils the active role
played by cavity-induced dissipative processes in modifying chemical reaction
rates, in the context of molecular polaritonics. Remarkably, we find that the
photorelaxation efficiency is maximized when an optimal trade-off between
light-matter coupling strength and photon decay rate is satisfied. This result
is in contrast with the common intuition that increasing the quality factor of
nanocavities and plasmonic devices improves their performance. Finally, we use
a detailed model of a metal nanoparticle to show that the speedup of the uracil
relaxation could be observed via coupling with a nanosphere pseudomode, without
requiring the implementation of complex nanophotonic structures.

(MWPDP) problem. Consider a positively weighted undirected/directed connected
graph $G = (V, E, c)$ and a subset $P$ of pairs of vertices, also called demand
pairs. A subgraph $G'$ is a distance preserver with respect to $P$ if and only
if every pair $(u, w) \in P$ satisfies $dist_{G'} (u, w) = dist_{G}(u, w)$. In
MWPDP problem, we aim to find the minimum-weight subgraph $G^*$ that is a
distance preserver with respect to $P$. Taking a shortest path between each
pair in $P$ gives us a trivial solution with the weight of at most
$U=\sum_{(u,v) \in P} dist_{G} (u, w)$. Subsequently, we ask how much
improvement we can make upon $U$. In other words, we opt to find a distance
preserver $G^*$ that maximizes $U-c(G^*)$. Denote this problem as Cost Sharing
Pairwise Distance Preservers (CSPDP), which has several applications in the
planning and operations of transportation systems.
  The only known work that can provide a nontrivial solution for CSPDP is that
of Chlamt\'a\v{c} et al. (SODA, 2017). This algorithm works for unweighted

extremely sparse with respect to the trivial solution. We address this issue by
proposing an $O(|E|^{1/2+\epsilon})$-approximation algorithm for CSPDP in
weighted graphs that runs in $O((|P||E|)^{2.38} (1/\epsilon))$ time. Moreover,
we prove CSPDP is at least as hard as $\text{LABEL-COVER}_{\max}$. This implies
that CSPDP cannot be approximated within $O(|E|^{1/6-\epsilon})$ factor in
polynomial time, unless there is an improvement in the notoriously difficult
$\text{LABEL-COVER}_{\max}$.

instability in turbulent flows from measurement data of the limit-cycle
oscillations. For this purpose, the flow dynamics are separated in
deterministic contributions representing the global mode and a stochastic
contribution representing the intrinsic turbulent forcing. Stochastic models
are developed that account for the interaction between the two and that allow
determining the dynamic properties of the flow from stationary data. The
deterministic contributions are modelled by an amplitude equation, which
describes the oscillatory dynamics of the instability, and in a second approach
by a mean-field model, which additionally captures the interaction between the
instability and the mean-flow corrections. The stochastic contributions are
considered as coloured noise forcing, representing the spectral characteristics
of the stochastic turbulent perturbations. The methodology is applied to a
turbulent swirling jet with a dominant global mode. PIV measurements are
conducted to ensure that the mode is the most dominant coherent structure and
further pressure measurements provide long time series for the model
calibration. The supercritical Hopf bifurcation is identified from the linear
growthrate of the global mode and the excellent agreement between measured and
estimated statistics suggest that the model captures the relevant dynamics.
This work demonstrates that the sole observation of limit-cycle oscillations is
not sufficient to determine the stability of turbulent flows since the
stochastic perturbations obscure the actual bifurcation point. However, the
proposed separation of deterministic and stochastic contributions in the
dynamical model allows identifying the flow sate from stationary measurements.

of how these lasers interact with matter is highly nonlinear, relativistic, and
can involve lowest-order quantum effects. The current tool of choice for
modeling these interactions is the particle-in-cell (PIC) method. In strong
fields, the motion of charged particles and their spin is affected by radiation
reaction. Standard PIC codes usually use Boris or its variants to advance the
particles, which requires very small time steps in the strong-field regime to
obtain accurate results. In addition, some problems require tracking the spin
of particles, which creates a 9D particle phase space (x, u, s). Therefore,
numerical algorithms that enable high-fidelity modeling of the 9D phase space
in the strong-field regime are desired. We present a new 9D phase space
particle pusher based on analytical solutions to the position, momentum and
spin advance from the Lorentz force, together with the semi-classical form of
RR in the Landau-Lifshitz equation and spin evolution given by the
Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation. These analytical solutions are obtained by
assuming a locally uniform and constant electromagnetic field during a time
step. The solutions provide the 9D phase space advance in terms of a particle's
proper time, and a mapping is used to determine the proper time step for each
particle from the simulation time step. Due to the analytical integration, the
constraint on the time step needed to resolve trajectories in ultra-high fields
can be greatly reduced. We present single-particle simulations and full PIC
simulations to show that the proposed particle pusher can greatly improve the
accuracy of particle trajectories in 9D phase space for given laser fields. A
discussion on the numerical efficiency of the proposed pusher is also provided.

its use. However, despite the constant improvement of algorithms, most methods
exploit only colorimetric information. Consequently, robustness to events to
which the modality is not sensitive to, like specularity or transparency, is
neglected. In response to this phenomenon, we propose using polarimetry as an
input for a self-supervised monodepth network. Therefore, we propose exploiting
polarization cues to encourage accurate reconstruction of scenes. Furthermore,
we include a term of polarimetric regularization to state-of-the-art method to
take specific advantage of the data. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively
and quantitatively demonstrating that the contribution of this new information
as well as an enhanced loss function improves depth estimation results,
especially for specular areas.

acknowledged as a prominent approach. In recent years, RC has gained even more
popularity in the context of Description Logics (DLs), the logic underpinning
the semantic web standard ontology language OWL 2, whose main ingredients are
classes and roles. In this work, we show how to integrate RC within the triple
language RDFS, which together with OWL2 are the two major standard semantic web
ontology languages. To do so, we start from $\rho df$, which is the logic
behind RDFS, and then extend it to $\rho df_\bot$, allowing to state that two
entities are incompatible. Eventually, we propose defeasible $\rho df_\bot$ via
a typical RC construction. The main features of our approach are: (i) unlike
most other approaches that add an extra non-monotone rule layer on top of
monotone RDFS, defeasible $\rho df_\bot$ remains syntactically a triple
language and is a simple extension of $\rho df_\bot$ by introducing some new
predicate symbols with specific semantics. In particular, any RDFS
reasoner/store may handle them as ordinary terms if it does not want to take
account for the extra semantics of the new predicate symbols; (ii) the
defeasible $\rho df_\bot$ entailment decision procedure is build on top of the
$\rho df_\bot$ entailment decision procedure, which in turn is an extension of
the one for $\rho df$ via some additional inference rules favouring an
potential implementation; and (iii) defeasible $\rho df_\bot$ entailment can be
decided in polynomial time.

largest number of pairwise non-reachable vertices. Computing the width dates
back to Dilworth's and Fulkerson's results in the 1950s, and is doable in
quadratic time in the worst case. Since $k$ can be small in practical
applications, research has also studied algorithms whose complexity is
parameterized on $k$. Despite these efforts, it is still open whether there
exists a linear-time $O(f(k)(|V| + |E|))$ parameterized algorithm computing the
width. We answer this question affirmatively by presenting an $O(k^24^k|V| +
k2^k|E|)$ time algorithm, based on a new notion of frontier antichains. As we
process the vertices in a topological order, all frontier antichains can be
maintained with the help of several combinatorial properties, paying only
$f(k)$ along the way. The fact that the width can be computed by a single
$f(k)$-sweep of the DAG is a new surprising insight into this classical
problem. Our algorithm also allows deciding whether the DAG has width at most

remarkable shortcoming have been found, but a general theory of
compositionality was missing until Petric, in 2003, introduced the concept of
g-dinatural transformations, that is, dinatural transformations together with
an appropriate graph: he showed how acyclicity of the composite graph of two
arbitrary dinatural transformations is a sufficient and essentially necessary
condition for the composite transformation to be in turn dinatural. Here we
propose an alternative, semantic rather than syntactic, proof of Petric's
theorem, which the authors independently rediscovered with no knowledge of its
prior existence; we then use it to define a generalised functor category, whose
objects are functors of mixed variance in many variables, and whose morphisms
are transformations that happen to be dinatural only in some of their
variables. We also define a notion of horizontal composition for dinatural
transformations, extending the well known version for natural transformations,
and prove it is associative and unitary. Horizontal composition embodies
substitution of functors into transformations and vice-versa, and is
intuitively reflected from the string-diagram point of view by substitution of

potential drawback of using pseudo labels is that errors may accumulate and it
is challenging to estimate the number of pseudo IDs. We introduce a different
unsupervised method that allows us to learn pedestrian embeddings from raw
videos, without resorting to pseudo labels. The goal is to construct a
self-supervised pretext task that matches the person re-ID objective. Inspired
by the \emph{data association} concept in multi-object tracking, we propose the
\textbf{Cyc}le \textbf{As}sociation (\textbf{CycAs}) task: after performing
data association between a pair of video frames forward and then backward, a
pedestrian instance is supposed to be associated to itself. To fulfill this
goal, the model must learn a meaningful representation that can well describe
correspondences between instances in frame pairs. We adapt the discrete
association process to a differentiable form, such that end-to-end training
becomes feasible. Experiments are conducted in two aspects: We first compare
our method with existing unsupervised re-ID methods on seven benchmarks and
demonstrate CycAs' superiority. Then, to further validate the practical value
of CycAs in real-world applications, we perform training on self-collected
videos and report promising performance on standard test sets.

manifolds. Since closed formulae don't exist in general, practitioners often
have to resort to numerical schemes. Ladder methods are a popular class of
algorithms that rely on iterative constructions of geodesic parallelograms. And
yet, the literature lacks a clear analysis of their convergence performance. In
this work, we give Taylor approximations of the elementary constructions of
Schild's ladder and the pole ladder with respect to the Riemann curvature of
the underlying space. We then prove that these methods can be iterated to
converge with quadratic speed, even when geodesics are approximated by
numerical schemes. We also contribute a new link between Schild's ladder and
the Fanning Scheme which explains why the latter naturally converges only
linearly. The extra computational cost of ladder methods is thus easily
compensated by a drastic reduction of the number of steps needed to achieve the
requested accuracy. Illustrations on the 2-sphere, the space of symmetric
positive definite matrices and the special Euclidean group show that the
theoretical errors we have established are measured with a high accuracy in
practice. The special Euclidean group with an anisotropic left-invariant metric
is of particular interest as it is a tractable example of a non-symmetric space
in general , which reduces to a Riemannian symmetric space in a particular

loss that is incurred when a hyperparameter is not tuned, but set to a default
value. Because our methods require the notion of a default parameter, we
present a simple procedure that can be used to determine reasonable default
parameters. We apply our methods in a benchmark study using 59 datasets from
OpenML. Our results show that leaving particular hyperparameters at their
default value is non-inferior to tuning these hyperparameters. In some cases,
leaving the hyperparameter at its default value even outperforms tuning it
using a search procedure with a limited number of iterations.

2015 for imaging and spectroscopy of the stripes in the southwestern region of
the SNR. Comparing images obtained at different epochs, we find that time
variability of synchrotron X-rays is not limited to two structures previously
reported but is more common in the region. Spectral analysis of nine bright
stripes reveals not only their time variabilities but also a strong
anti-correlation between the surface brightness and photon indices. The spectra
of the nine stripes have photon indices of \Gamma = 2.1--2.6 and are
significantly harder than those of the outer rim of the SNR in the same region

the overall excited-state potential energy surfaces obtained from TDTAO-DFT are
generally improved and better agree with results from the equation-of-motion

This is motivated by a reverse engineering principle. If we understand a

study its invariances to understand how that model solves a problem. To this
end we propose a supervised form of variational auto-encoders (VAEs).
Crucially, only a subset of the dimensions in the latent space contributes to
the supervised task, allowing the remaining dimensions to act as nuisance

unchanged, revealing the invariances of the model. Our experimental results
show the capability of our proposed model both in terms of classification, and

application domains like smart logistics, social network analysis, and medical
applications, due to their data model variety and scalability. The broad data
variety and sheer size of datasets pose unique challenges for the system design
and runtime (incl. power consumption). While CPU performance scaling becomes
increasingly more difficult, we argue that NRDS can benefit from adding field
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) as accelerators. However, FPGA-accelerated
NRDS have not been systematically studied, yet.
  To facilitate understanding of this emerging domain, we explore the fit of
FPGA acceleration for NRDS with a focus on data model variety. We define the
term NRDS class as a group of non-relational database systems supporting the
same data model. This survey describes and categorizes the inherent differences
and non-trivial trade-offs of relevant NRDS classes as well as their
commonalities in the context of common design decisions when building such a
system with FPGAs. For example, we found in the literature that for key-value
stores the FPGA should be placed into the system as a smart network interface
card (SmartNIC) to benefit from direct access of the FPGA to the network.
However, more complex data models and processing of other classes (e.g., graph
and document) commonly require more elaborate near-data or socket accelerator
placements where the FPGA respectively has the only or shared access to main
memory. Across the different classes, FPGAs can be used as communication layer
or for acceleration of operators and data access. We close with open research
and engineering challenges to outline the future of FPGA-accelerated NRDS.

molecular states, a state near $ \Sigma_bB$ threshold with spin parity
$J^P=1/2^-$, a state near $\Sigma^*_bB$ threshold with $3/2^-$, two states near
$\Sigma_bB^*$ threshold with $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$, and three states near

suggest that three states near $\Sigma_b^* B^*$ threshold and two states near
$\Sigma_b B^*$ threshold are very close, respectively, which may be difficult
to distinguish in experiment without partial wave analysis. Compared with the
hidden-charm pentaquark, the $P_b$ states are relatively narrow with widths at
an order of magnitude of 1 MeV or smaller. The importance of each channel
considered is also discussed, and it is found that the $\Lambda_b B^*$ channel

unreliable. The results in the current work are helpful for searching for

communication perspective. An end-to-end system model which considers the
pathogen-laden cough/sneeze droplets as the input and the infection state of

velocity and buoyancy for the propagation of droplets and a receiver model
which considers the central part of the human face as the reception interface

is derived by modeling the number of propagating droplets as a random process.
The numerical results reveal that exposure time and sex of the human affect the
probability of infection. In addition, the social distance for a horizontal
cough should be at least 1.7 m and the safe coughing angle of a coughing human
to infect less people should be less than -25$^\circ$.

in many branches of the sciences. For the stochastic process of L\'evy walks, a
specific range of optimal efficiencies was suggested under variation of search
intrinsic and extrinsic environmental parameters. In this article, we study
fractional Brownian motion as a search process, which under parameter variation
generates all three basic types of diffusion, from sub- to normal to
superdiffusion. In contrast to L\'evy walks, fractional Brownian motion defines
a Gaussian stochastic process with power law memory yielding anti-persistent,
respectively persistent motion. Computer simulations of search by time-discrete
fractional Brownian motion in a uniformly random distribution of targets show
that maximising search efficiencies sensitively depends on the definition of
efficiency, the variation of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, the
perception of targets, the type of targets, whether to detect only one or many
of them, and the choice of boundary conditions. In our simulations we find that
different search scenarios favour different modes of motion for optimising
search success, defying a universality across all search situations. Some of
our numerical results are explained by a simple analytical model. Having
demonstrated that search by fractional Brownian motion is a truly complex
process, we propose an over-arching conceptual framework based on classifying
different search scenarios. This approach incorporates search optimisation by
L\'evy walks as a special case.

the basic design of the CCD camera (Soft X-ray Imager: SXI) is almost the same
as that of the lost Hitomi (ASTRO-H) observatory, we are planning to reduce the
""light leakages"" that is one of the largest problems recognized in Hitomi data.
We adopted a double-layer optical blocking layer on the XRISM CCDs and also
added an extra aluminum layer on the backside of them. We develop a newly
designed test sample CCD and irradiate it with optical light to evaluate the
optical blocking performance. As a result, light leakages are effectively
reduced compared with that of the Hitomi CCDs. We thus conclude that the issue
is solved by the new design and that the XRISM CCDs satisfy the mission
requirement for the SXI.

  via walk equivalence of vertices",,,"10.1016/j.laa.2021.04.004",,"math.CO quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Originating from spectral graph theory, cospectrality is a powerful
generalization of exchange symmetry and can be applied to all real-valued
symmetric matrices. Two vertices of an undirected graph with real edge weights
are cospectral iff the underlying weighted adjacency matrix $M$ fulfills
$[M^k]_{u,u} = [M^k]_{v,v}$ for all non-negative integer $k$, and as a result
any eigenvector $\phi$ of $M$ has (or, in the presence of degeneracies, can be
chosen to have) definite parity on $u$ and $v$. We here show that the powers of
a matrix with cospectral vertices induce further local relations on its
eigenvectors, and also can be used to design cospectrality preserving
modifications. To this end, we introduce the concept of \emph{walk equivalence}
of cospectral vertices with respect to \emph{walk multiplets} which are special
vertex subsets of a graph. Walk multiplets allow for systematic and flexible
modifications of a graph with a given cospectral pair while preserving this
cospectrality. The set of modifications includes the addition and removal of
both vertices and edges, such that the underlying topology of the graph can be
altered. In particular, we prove that any new vertex connected to a walk
multiplet by suitable connection weights becomes a so-called unrestricted
substitution point (USP), meaning that any arbitrary graph may be connected to
it without breaking cospectrality. Also, suitable interconnections between walk
multiplets within a graph are shown to preserve the associated cospectrality.
Importantly, we demonstrate that the walk equivalence of cospectral vertices
$u,v$ imposes a local structure on every eigenvector $\phi$ obeying $\phi_{u} =
\pm \phi_{v} \ne 0$ (in the case of degeneracies, a specific choice of the
eigenvector basis is needed). Our work paves the way for flexibly exploiting
hidden structural symmetries in the design of generic complex network-like
systems.

including human societies, economies and health. Various human activities are
responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions, including data centres
and other sources of large-scale computation. Although many important
scientific milestones have been achieved thanks to the development of
high-performance computing, the resultant environmental impact has been
underappreciated. In this paper, we present a methodological framework to
estimate the carbon footprint of any computational task in a standardised and
reliable way, based on the processing time, type of computing cores, memory
available and the efficiency and location of the computing facility. Metrics to
interpret and contextualise greenhouse gas emissions are defined, including the
equivalent distance travelled by car or plane as well as the number of
tree-months necessary for carbon sequestration. We develop a freely available
online tool, Green Algorithms (www.green-algorithms.org), which enables a user
to estimate and report the carbon footprint of their computation. The Green
Algorithms tool easily integrates with computational processes as it requires
minimal information and does not interfere with existing code, while also
accounting for a broad range of CPUs, GPUs, cloud computing, local servers and
desktop computers. Finally, by applying Green Algorithms, we quantify the
greenhouse gas emissions of algorithms used for particle physics simulations,
weather forecasts and natural language processing. Taken together, this study
develops a simple generalisable framework and freely available tool to quantify
the carbon footprint of nearly any computation. Combined with a series of
recommendations to minimise unnecessary CO2 emissions, we hope to raise

that single-layer CrX$_3$ (X=Cl, Br, I) might be the prototypes of topological
magnetic insulators (TMI). In this work, by using first-principles calculations
combined with atomistic spin dynamics we provide a complete picture of the
magnetic interactions and magnetic excitations in CrX$_3$. The focus is here on
the two most important aspects for the actual realization of TMI, namely the
relativistic magnetic interactions and the finite-size (edge) effects. We
compute the full interaction tensor, which includes both Kitaev and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms, which are considered as the most likely mechanisms
for stabilizing topological magnons. First, we instigate the properties of bulk
CrI$_3$ and compare the simulated magnon spectrum with the experimental data
[Phys. Rev. X 8, 041028 (2018)]. Our results suggest that a large size of
topological gap, seen in experiment ($\approx$ 4 meV), can not be explained by
considering pair-wise spin interactions only. We identify several possible
reasons for this disagreement and suggest that a pronounced magneto-elastic
coupling should be expected in this class of materials. The magnetic
interactions in the monolayers of CrX$_3$ are also investigated. The strength
of the anisotropic interactions is shown to scale with the position of halide
atom in the Periodic Table, the heavier the element the larger is the
anisotropy. Comparing the magnons for the bulk and single-layer CrI$_3$, we
find that the size of the topological gap becomes smaller in the latter case.
Finally, we investigate finite-size effects in monolayers and demonstrate that
the anisotropic couplings between Cr atoms close to the edges are much stronger
than those in ideal periodic structure. This should have impact on the dynamics
of the magnon edge modes in this class of materials.

becoming a popular research topic, due to the expensive labeling cost in many

the testing (query) image and training (support) image by simply concatenating
the features of two images and feeding it into the neural network. However,
with few labeled data in each class, the neural network has difficulty in
learning or comparing the local features of two images. Such simple image-level
comparison may cause serious mis-classification. To solve this problem, we
propose Augmented Bi-path Network (ABNet) for learning to compare both global
and local features on multi-scales. Specifically, the salient patches are
extracted and embedded as the local features for every image. Then, the model
learns to augment the features for better robustness. Finally, the model learns
to compare global and local features separately, i.e., in two paths, before
merging the similarities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed ABNet
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Both quantitative and visual ablation

catastrophic forgetting problem but at the expense of expanding the capacity of
the model. Regularization-based methods maintain a fixed model capacity;
however, previous studies showed the huge performance degradation of these
methods when the task identity is not available during inference (e.g. class
incremental learning scenario). In this work, we propose a novel
architectural-based method referred as SpaceNet for class incremental learning
scenario where we utilize the available fixed capacity of the model
intelligently. SpaceNet trains sparse deep neural networks from scratch in an
adaptive way that compresses the sparse connections of each task in a compact
number of neurons. The adaptive training of the sparse connections results in
sparse representations that reduce the interference between the tasks.
Experimental results show the robustness of our proposed method against
catastrophic forgetting old tasks and the efficiency of SpaceNet in utilizing
the available capacity of the model, leaving space for more tasks to be
learned. In particular, when SpaceNet is tested on the well-known benchmarks
for CL: split MNIST, split Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10/100, it outperforms
regularization-based methods by a big performance gap. Moreover, it achieves
better performance than architectural-based methods without model expansion and
achieved comparable results with rehearsal-based methods, while offering a huge
memory reduction.

numerical simulations on cases with a multi-step potential demonstrate that

about 1 deg2 of the AEGIS field with 56 narrow-band filters and 4 ugri

extended (galaxies) and point-like (e.g. stars) objects, a necessary step for
the subsequent scientific analyses. We aim at developing an ML classifier that
is complementary to traditional tools based on explicit modeling. In order to
train and test our classifiers, we crossmatched the miniJPAS dataset with SDSS
and HSC-SSP data. We trained and tested 6 different ML algorithms on the two
crossmatched catalogs. As input for the ML algorithms we use the magnitudes
from the 60 filters together with their errors, with and without the
morphological parameters. We also use the mean PSF in the r detection band for
each pointing. We find that the RF and ERT algorithms perform best in all
scenarios. When analyzing the full magnitude range of 15<r<23.5 we find
AUC=0.957 with RF when using only photometric information, and AUC=0.986 with
ERT when using photometric and morphological information. Regarding feature
importance, when using morphological parameters, FWHM is the most important
feature. When using photometric information only, we observe that broad bands
are not necessarily more important than narrow bands, and errors are as
important as the measurements. ML algorithms can compete with traditional
star/galaxy classifiers, outperforming the latter at fainter magnitudes (r>21).

properties for a general class of time series models defined conditional on an
exogenous covariates process. The dynamic of these models is given by an
autoregressive latent process which forms a Markov chain in random
environments. Contrarily to existing contributions in the field of Markov
chains in random environments, the state space is not discrete and we do not
use small set type assumptions or uniform contraction conditions for the random
Markov kernels. Our assumptions are quite general and allows to deal with
models that are not fully contractive, such as threshold autoregressive
processes. Using a coupling approach, we study the existence of a limit, in
Wasserstein metric, for the backward iterations of the chain. We also derive
ergodic properties for the corresponding skew-product Markov chain. Our results
are illustrated with many examples of autoregressive processes widely used in
statistics or in econometrics, including GARCH type processes, count
autoregressions and categorical time series.

the mean-field description of the glass transition, and remains a useful
concept when studying three-dimensional glass-forming liquids. In liquids,
however, the overlap involves a tolerance, typically of a fraction $a/\sigma$
of the inter-particle distance, associated with how precisely similar two
configurations must be for belonging to the same physically relevant ""state"".
Here, we systematically investigate the dependence of the overlap fluctuations
and of the resulting phase diagram when the tolerance is varied over a large
range. We show that while the location of the dynamical and thermodynamic glass
transitions (if present) is independent of $a/\sigma$, that of the critical
point associated with a transition between a low- and a high-overlap phases in
the presence of an applied source nontrivially depends on the value of
$a/\sigma$. We rationalize our findings by using liquid-state theory and the
hypernetted chain (HNC) approximation for correlation functions. In addition,
we confirm the theoretical trends by studying a three-dimensional glass-former
by computer simulations. We show in particular that \rev{a range of $a/\sigma$
below what is commonly considered maximizes the temperature of the critical
point, pushing it up in a liquid region where viscosity is low and computer
investigations are easier due to a significantly faster equilibration.

may result in repeated and redundant information utilization, especially in the
spatial semantics extraction process, hence neglecting the critical variations

1) Design a sequential channel filtering mechanism, i.e., Progressive

from different frames step by step, and thus avoid repeated information
extraction. 2) Create a Temporal Diversity Loss (TD Loss) to force the kernels

achieves robustness via sparsity optimization at the cost of computational
speed. In this paper, we propose a new method for robust registration with fast
convergence. First, we show that the classical point-to-point ICP can be
treated as a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, and propose an Anderson
acceleration approach to speed up its convergence. In addition, we introduce a
robust error metric based on the Welsch's function, which is minimized
efficiently using the MM algorithm with Anderson acceleration. On challenging
datasets with noises and partial overlaps, we achieve similar or better
accuracy than Sparse ICP while being at least an order of magnitude faster.
Finally, we extend the robust formulation to point-to-plane ICP, and solve the
resulting problem using a similar Anderson-accelerated MM strategy. Our robust
ICP methods improve the registration accuracy on benchmark datasets while being
competitive in computational time.

challenging radio resource management problems in wireless networks. However,
the neural network architectures adopted by existing works suffer from poor
scalability, generalization, and lack of interpretability. A long-standing
approach to improve scalability and generalization is to incorporate the
structures of the target task into the neural network architecture. In this
paper, we propose to apply graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve large-scale
radio resource management problems, supported by effective neural network
architecture design and theoretical analysis. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that radio resource management problems can be formulated as graph
optimization problems that enjoy a universal permutation equivariance property.
We then identify a class of neural networks, named \emph{message passing graph
neural networks} (MPGNNs). It is demonstrated that they not only satisfy the
permutation equivariance property, but also can generalize to large-scale
problems while enjoying a high computational efficiency. For interpretablity
and theoretical guarantees, we prove the equivalence between MPGNNs and a class
of distributed optimization algorithms, which is then used to analyze the
performance and generalization of MPGNN-based methods. Extensive simulations,
with power control and beamforming as two examples, will demonstrate that the
proposed method, trained in an unsupervised manner with unlabeled samples,
matches or even outperforms classic optimization-based algorithms without
domain-specific knowledge. Remarkably, the proposed method is highly scalable
and can solve the beamforming problem in an interference channel with $1000$
transceiver pairs within $6$ milliseconds on a single GPU.

a resource-limited and time-varying cost-sensitive network, communication delay
is inevitable and primarily influenced by, first, the control systems deploying
intermittent sensor sampling to reduce the communication cost by restricting
non-urgent transmissions, and second, the network performing resource
management to minimize excessive traffic and eventually data loss. In a
heterogeneous scenario, where control systems may tolerate only specific levels
of sensor-to-controller latency, delay sensitivities need to be considered in
the design of control and network policies to achieve the desired performance
guarantees. We propose a cross-layer optimal co-design of control, sampling and
resource management policies for an NCS consisting of multiple stochastic
linear time-invariant systems which close their sensor-to-controller loops over
a shared network. Aligned with advanced communication technology, we assume
that the network offers a range of latency-varying transmission services for
given prices. Local samplers decide either to pay higher cost to access a
low-latency channel, or to delay sending a state sample at a reduced price. A
resource manager residing in the network data-link layer arbitrates channel
access and re-allocates resources if link capacities are exceeded. The
performance of the local closed-loop systems is measured by a combination of
linear-quadratic Gaussian cost and a suitable communication cost, and the
overall objective is to minimize a defined social cost by all three policy
makers. We derive optimal control, sampling and resource allocation policies
under different cross-layer awareness models, including constant and
time-varying parameters, and show that higher awareness generally leads to
performance enhancement at the expense of higher computational complexity.

and duration of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have shown differing results, and
were typically limited to univariate analyses of tracts in isolation. In this
study we apply a multivariate measure (the Mahalanobis distance), to capture
the distinct ways white matter may differ in individual patients, and relate
this to epilepsy duration.
  Diffusion MRI, from a cohort of 94 subjects (28 healthy controls, 33 left-TLE
and 33 right-TLE), was used to assess associations between tract fractional
anisotropy (FA) and epilepsy duration. Using ten white matter tracts, we
analysed associations using traditional univariate analyses (z-scores) and a
complementary multivariate approach (Mahalanobis distance), incorporating
multiple white matter tracts into a single unified analysis.
  In patients with right-TLE, FA was not significantly associated with epilepsy
duration for any tract studied in isolation. In patients with left-TLE, the FA
of two limbic tracts (ipsilateral fornix, contralateral cingulum gyrus) was
significantly negatively associated with epilepsy duration (Bonferonni
corrected p<0.05). Using a multivariate approach we found significant
ipsilateral positive associations with duration in both left, and right-TLE
cohorts (left-TLE: Spearman's rho=0.487, right-TLE: Spearman's rho=0.422).
Extrapolating our multivariate results to duration equals zero (i.e. at onset)
we found no significant difference between patients and controls. Associations
using the multivariate approach were more robust than univariate methods.

domains are modeled as distributions. This enables better handling of
prediction uncertainty on unseen domains. To deal with domain shift, we learn
domain-invariant representations by the proposed principle of meta variational
information bottleneck, we call MetaVIB. MetaVIB is derived from novel
variational bounds of mutual information, by leveraging the meta-learning
setting of domain generalization. Through episodic training, MetaVIB learns to
gradually narrow domain gaps to establish domain-invariant representations,
while simultaneously maximizing prediction accuracy. We conduct experiments on
three benchmarks for cross-domain visual recognition. Comprehensive ablation

periodic and uniform structures with generic anisotropic media. The method
takes advantage of the ability of full-wave commercial simulators to deal with
finite structures having anisotropic media. In particular, the proposed method
extends the possibilities of commercial eigenmode solvers in the following
ways: (i) anisotropic materials with non-diagonal permittivity and permeability
tensors can be analyzed; (ii) the attenuation constant can easily be computed
in both propagating and stopband regions and lossy materials can be included in
the simulation; and (iii) unbounded and radiating structures such as leaky-wave
antennas can be treated. The latter feature may be considered the most
remarkable, since the structures must be forcefully bounded with
electric/magnetic walls in the eigensolvers of most commercial simulators. In
this work, the proposed method is particularized for the study of liquid
crystals (LCs) in microwave and antenna devices. Thus, the dispersion
properties of a great variety of LC-based configurations are analyzed, from
canonical structures, such as waveguide and microstrip, to complex
reconfigurable phase shifters in ridge gap-waveguide technology and leaky-wave
antennas. Our results have been validated with previously reported works in the

couplings, i.e., $ZZZ$, $ZZ\gamma$, $Z\gamma\gamma$, are studied in
$ZZ/Z\gamma$ ($2lq\bar{q}/2l\gamma$) production at an $e^+e^-$ collider with
and without beam polarization. Some of these anomalous couplings are also
studied in $ZZ$ ($4l$) production at the LHC. In the charge sector the
anomalous gauge boson couplings, i.e., $WWZ$, $WW\gamma$ have been studied at
an $e^+e^-$ collider in $W^+W^-$ ($l^-\bar{\nu_l}q^\prime\bar{q}$) production.
The $WWZ$ anomalous couplings are also studied in $ZW^\pm$ production at LHC in
$3l$ + missing $E_T$ channel. All the analyses at an $e^+$-$e^-$ collider have
been performed for center-of-mass (CM) energy of $500$ GeV and integrated
luminosity of $100$ fb$^{-1}$. The analyses at the LHC are performed at $13$
TeV CM energy of $pp$ collisions. The cross sections and polarization
asymmetries, along with other asymmetries (forward-backward, azimuthal), are
used to obtain simultaneous limits on the anomalous couplings using
Markov-Chain--Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method in each process. The polarization
asymmetries can distinguish between $CP$-even and $CP$-odd couplings and help
to put tighter constraints on the couplings. The polarization of the initial
$e^-$ and $e^+$ beam, in case of $e^+e^-$ collider, are used to increase the
signal to background ratio, putting tighter constraints on the anomalous
couplings. The polarization asymmetries are instrumental in the measurement of
anomalous couplings should a deviation from the SM be observed.

supervenience principle (sometimes referred to as the principle of
separability). This principle asserts that the complete state of the world
supervenes on the intrinsic properties of its most fundamental components and
their spatiotemporal relations (the so-called Humean mosaic). There are
well-known arguments in the literature purporting to show that in quantum
mechanics the Humean supervenience principle is violated, due to the existence
of entangled states. Recently, however, arguments have been presented to the
effect that the supervenience principle can be defended in Bohmian mechanics.
The key element of this strategy lies in the observation that according to
Bohmian mechanics the fundamental facts about particles are facts about their
spatial locations, and moreover, for any proper subsystem of the world its
state may non-trivially depend on the spatial configuration of the rest of the
universe. Thus quantum-mechanical states of subsystems do not represent their
intrinsic properties but rather characterize their relations with the
environment. In this paper we point out the worry that this Bohmian strategy
--known as Bohumianism-- saves the letter but not the spirit of the Humean
doctrine of supervenience, since it prima facie violates another seemingly
important Humean principle, which we call Strong Supervenience and whose denial
implies the existence of necessary connections among distinct individuals. We
argue that the best defense for Bohumians is to question the fundamental
existence of complex physical systems and their states by treating any
reference to them as a convenient description of the underlying collection of
Bohmian particles. We consider several pros and cons of this strategy.

sufficiently strong cooling of the fluid the effect is overlaid by clustering
instability of the homogeneous cooling state with different scaling behavior.
We are able to identify different quench regimes. In each regime correlations
exhibit remarkably universal position dependence. In simulations performed with
side walls we find confinement effects for temperature and pressure in
steady-state simulations, and an additional transient wall pressure
contribution upon changing the shaking amplitude. The transient contribution is
ascribed to enhanced relaxation of the fluid in the presence of walls. From

(mostly) non-linear equations of motion which may exhibit chaos very much in
the spirit of classical particle chaos, i.e. by an exponential separation of
trajectories in Hilbert space with a rate given by a positive Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda$. The question now is whether $\lambda$ imprints itself onto
measurable observables of the underlying quantum many-body system even at
finite particle numbers. Using a Bose-Einstein condensate expanding in a
shallow potential landscape as a paradigmatic example for a bosonic quantum
many-body system, we show, that the number of non-condensed particles is
subject to an exponentially fast increase, i.e. depletion. Furthermore, we show
that the rate of exponential depletion is given by the Lyapunov exponent
associated with the chaotic mean-field dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that
this chaos-induced depletion is accessible experimentally through the
visibility of interference fringes in the total density after time of flight,
thus opening the possibility to measure $\lambda$, and with it, the interplay
between chaos and non-equilibrium quantum matter, in a real experiment.

higher-dimensional quantum lattice systems with Hamiltonians that can be
written as the sum of an unperturbed gapped operator, consisting of a sum of
on-site terms, and a perturbation consisting of bounded interaction potentials
of short range mutltiplied by a real coupling constant t. Our goal is to prove
that the spectral gap above the ground-state energy of such Hamiltonians
persists for sufficiently small values of |t|, independently of the size of the
lattice. New ideas and concepts are necessary to extend our method to systems
in dimension d > 1: As in our earlier work, a sequence of local
block-diagonalization steps based on judiciously chosen unitary conjugations of
the original Hamiltonian is introduced. The supports of effective interaction
potentials generated in the course of these block-diagonalization steps can be
identified with what we call minimal rectangles contained in the lattice, a
concept that serves to tackle combinatorial problems that arise in the course
of iterating the block-diagonalization steps. For a given minimal rectangle,
control of the effective interaction potentials generated in each
block-diagonalization step with support in the given rectangle is achieved by
exploiting a variety of rather subtle mechanisms which include, for example,
the use of weighted sums of paths consisting of overlapping rectangles and of
large denominators, expressed in terms of sums of orthogonal projections, that
serve to control analogous sums of projections in the numerators resulting from
the unitary conjugations of the interaction potential terms involved in the
local block-diagonalization step.

Existing neutron skin data mostly from hadronic observables suffer from large

high-precision neutron skin data for $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca from the
parity-violating electron scattering experiments (PREX-II and CREX at JLab as
well as MREX at MESA), within the Bayesian statistical framework using the
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model we infer the posterior probability distribution
functions (PDFs) of the slope parameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy at
$\rho_0$ from imagined $\Delta r_{np}(^{208}$Pb$)=0.15$, 0.20, and 0.30 fm as

$1\sigma$ error bars. The results are compared with the PDFs of $L$ inferred
using the same approach from the available $\Delta r_{np}$ data for Sn isotopes
from hadronic probes. They are also compared with results from a recent
Bayesian analysis of the radius and tidal deformability data of canonical
neutron stars from GW170817 and NICER. The neutron skin data for Sn isotopes
gives $L=45.5^{+26.5}_{-21.6}$ MeV surrounding its mean value or
$L=53.4^{+18.6}_{-29.5}$ MeV surrounding its maximum {\it a posteriori} value,
respectively, with the latter smaller than but consistent with the

Optical spectra show strong H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and Fe II emission lines

Several methods of time series analysis (ICCF, DCF, von Neumann, Bartels,

center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, the first
observation of the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay $D^+\to K^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$
is reported. After removing decays that contain narrow intermediate resonances,
including $D^+\to K^+\eta$, $D^+\to K^+\omega$, and $D^+\to K^+\phi$, the
branching fraction of the decay $D^+\to K^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ is measured to be
$(1.13 \pm 0.08_{\rm stat} \pm 0.03_{\rm syst})\times 10^{-3}$. The ratio of
branching fractions of $D^+\to K^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ over $D^+\to
K^-\pi^+\pi^+\pi^0$ is found to be $(1.81\pm0.15)$\%, which corresponds to
$(6.28\pm0.52)\tan^4\theta_C$, where $\theta_C$ is the Cabibbo mixing angle.
This ratio is significantly larger than the corresponding ratios for other
doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decays. The asymmetry of the branching fractions of
charge-conjugated decays $D^\pm\to K^\pm\pi^\pm\pi^\mp\pi^0$ is also
determined, and no evidence of $CP$ violation is found. In addition, the first
evidence of the $D^+\to K^+\omega$ decay, with a statistical significance of
3.3$\sigma$, is presented and its decay branching fraction is determined to be
$({5.7^{+2.5}_{-2.1}}_{\rm stat}\pm0.2_{\rm syst})\times10^{-5}$.

scheme conveys information by selecting both polarization state and the phase
of radiated electromagnetic wave. We also analyse the performance of 3D
Polarized Modulation (PMod) for different constellation sizes and we obtain a
curve of rate adaptation. Finally, we compare the proposed 3D PMod with other
existing schemes such as single polarization Phase Shift Keying (PSK) and
double polarization Vertical Bell Laboratories Layer Space-Time (V-BLAST), both
carrying the same number of information bits. The results show that 3D PMod

Therefore, we can conclude that 3D PMod is an excellent candidate for medium

the surface defect detection, enabling the network to learn from a relatively

which reduce the amount of training time and improve the results on the surface
defect detection tasks. To enable end-to-end training we carefully balance the
contributions of both the segmentation and the classification loss throughout
the learning. We adjust the gradient flow from the classification into the
segmentation network in order to prevent the unstable features from corrupting
the learning. As an additional extension to the learning, we propose
frequency-of-use sampling scheme of negative samples to address the issue of
over- and under-sampling of images during the training, while we employ the
distance transform algorithm on the region-based segmentation masks as weights
for positive pixels, giving greater importance to areas with higher probability
of presence of defect without requiring a detailed annotation. We demonstrate
the performance of the end-to-end training scheme and the proposed extensions
on three defect detection datasets - DAGM, KolektorSDD and Severstal Steel

common operation in many areas such as data science and machine learning. When
the rescaled perturbation $\eta \vec{\delta}$ is added to a starting point
$\vec{x} \in D$ (where $D$ is the data domain, e.g. $D = [0, 1]^n$), the
resulting vector $\vec{v} = \vec{x} + \eta \vec{\delta}$ will in general not be
in $D$. To enforce that the perturbed vector $v$ is in $D$, the values of
$\vec{v}$ can be clipped to $D$. This subsequent element-wise clipping to the
data domain does however reduce the effective perturbation size and thus
interferes with the rescaling of $\vec{\delta}$. The optimal rescaling $\eta$
to obtain a perturbation with the desired norm after the clipping can be
iteratively approximated using a binary search. However, such an iterative
approach is slow and non-differentiable. Here we show that the optimal
rescaling can be found analytically using a fast and differentiable algorithm.
Our algorithm works for any p-norm and can be used to train neural networks on
inputs with normalized perturbations. We provide native implementations for
PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, and NumPy based on EagerPy.

measurements. Designing efficient approaches that could handle noisy 1-bit
measurements is important in a variety of applications. In this paper we use
the approximate message passing (AMP) to achieve this goal due to its high
computational efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. In AMP the signal of
interest is assumed to follow some prior distribution, and its posterior
distribution can be computed and used to recover the signal. In practice, the
parameters of the prior distributions are often unknown and need to be
estimated. Previous works tried to find the parameters that maximize either the
measurement likelihood via expectation maximization, which becomes increasingly
difficult to solve in cases of complicated probability models. Here we propose
to treat the parameters as unknown variables and compute their posteriors via
AMP as well, so that the parameters and the signal can be recovered jointly.
Compared to previous methods, the proposed approach leads to a simple and
elegant parameter estimation scheme, allowing us to directly work with 1-bit
quantization noise model. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
generally perform much better than the other state-of-the-art methods in the
zero-noise and moderate-noise regimes, and outperforms them in most of the
cases in the high-noise regime.

study the proximity between the phase space density of light nuclei ratios and
their hadronic constituents e.g $\bar{d}/d$ and $(\bar{p}\bar{n}/pn)$. I have
found that with the exclusion of the decay feed-down from the hadronic yields
in the thermal model, the hadronic representations have good agreement with the
light nuclei ratios. I have performed a similar analysis with the ratio of
$\Lambda$-hypernuclei and $^3 He$, which is related to the ratio $\Lambda/p$.
In this context, the strangeness population factor $S_3$ has been studied also.
These results indicate that the nuclei and hypernuclei formation may occur near
the standard chemical freeze-out and before the decay of the hadronic
resonances. This method will serve as a guideline to discuss the light nuclei
formation and the inclusion of decay into their hadronic constituents.

  We show that the problem is undecidable, even for the instantiation of

that one weighted automaton is big-O of another, the problem of finding or
approximating the associated constant is also undecidable.
  Our positive results show that the big-O problem is polynomial-time solvable
for unambiguous automata, coNP-complete for unlabelled weighted automata (i.e.,
when the alphabet is a single character) and decidable, subject to Schanuel's
conjecture, when the language is bounded (i.e., a subset of $w_1^*\dots w_m^*$
for some finite words $w_1,\dots,w_m$) or when the automaton has finite
ambiguity.
  On labelled Markov chains, the problem can be restated as a ratio total
variation distance, which, instead of finding the maximum difference between
the probabilities of any two events, finds the maximum ratio between the
probabilities of any two events. The problem is related to
$\varepsilon$-differential privacy, for which the optimal constant of the big-O

adopt SSL principles (e.g., the cluster assumption) as their learning
ingredients. However, they tend to overlook the very domain-shift nature of
UDA. In this work, we take a step further to study the proper extensions of SSL
techniques for UDA. Taking the algorithm of label propagation (LP) as an
example, we analyze the challenges of adopting LP to UDA and theoretically
analyze the conditions of affinity graph/matrix construction in order to
achieve better propagation of true labels to unlabeled instances. Our analysis
suggests a new algorithm of Label Propagation with Augmented Anchors (A$^2$LP),
which could potentially improve LP via generation of unlabeled virtual
instances (i.e., the augmented anchors) with high-confidence label predictions.
To make the proposed A$^2$LP useful for UDA, we propose empirical schemes to
generate such virtual instances. The proposed schemes also tackle the
domain-shift challenge of UDA by alternating between pseudo labeling via
A$^2$LP and domain-invariant feature learning. Experiments show that such a
simple SSL extension improves over representative UDA methods of
domain-invariant feature learning, and could empower two state-of-the-art
methods on benchmark UDA datasets. Our results show the value of further
investigation on SSL techniques for UDA problems.

non-texture regions in these scenes. These areas could overwhelm the
optimization process in the commonly used unsupervised depth estimation
framework proposed for outdoor environments. However, even when those regions

argue that the poor performance suffers from the non-discriminative point-based

local gradients and adopt patches centered at each point as its representation.
Multiview consistency loss is then defined over patches. This operation
significantly improves the robustness of the network training. Furthermore,
because those textureless regions in indoor scenes (e.g., wall, floor, roof,

as a plane prior. We enforce the predicted depth to be well fitted by a plane

approximately 450 km in altitude, have the potential to provide significant
benefits to spacecraft over those that operate in higher altitude orbits. This
paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of these benefits to
spacecraft operations in VLEO, with parametric investigation of those which
apply specifically to Earth observation missions. The most significant benefit
for optical imaging systems is that a reduction in orbital altitude improves
spatial resolution for a similar payload specification. Alternatively mass and
volume savings can be made whilst maintaining a given performance. Similarly,
for radar and lidar systems, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved.
Additional benefits include improved geospatial position accuracy, improvements
in communications link-budgets, and greater launch vehicle insertion
capability. The collision risk with orbital debris and radiation environment
can be shown to be improved in lower altitude orbits, whilst compliance with
IADC guidelines for spacecraft post-mission lifetime and deorbit is also
assisted. Finally, VLEO offers opportunities to exploit novel
atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion systems and aerodynamic attitude and
orbit control methods.
  However, key challenges associated with our understanding of the lower
thermosphere, aerodynamic drag, the requirement to provide a meaningful orbital
lifetime whilst minimising spacecraft mass and complexity, and atomic oxygen
erosion still require further research. Given the scope for significant
commercial, societal, and environmental impact which can be realised with
higher performing Earth observation platforms, renewed research efforts to
address the challenges associated with VLEO operations are required.

investigate the dependence of the estimated transmission spectrum on deviations
of the orbital parameters of the star-planet system that are due to the
limb-darkening effects of the host star. We describe how the uncertainty on the
orbital parameters translates into an uncertainty on the planetary spectral
slope. We created synthetic transit light curves in seven different wavelength
bands, from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and fit them with
transit models parameterized by fixed deviating values of the impact parameter
$b$. Our simulations show a wavelength-dependent offset that is more pronounced
at the blue wavelengths where the limb-darkening effect is stronger. This
offset introduces a slope in the planetary transmission spectrum that becomes
steeper with increasing $b$ values. Variations of $b$ by positive or negative
values within its uncertainty interval introduce positive or negative slopes,
thus the formation of an error envelope. The amplitude from blue optical to
near-infrared wavelength for a typical uncertainty on $b$ corresponds to one
atmospheric pressure scale height and more. This impact parameter degeneracy is
confirmed for different host types; K stars present prominently steeper slopes,
while M stars indicate features at the blue wavelengths. We demonstrate that
transmission spectra can be hard to interpret, basically because of the
limitations in defining a precise impact parameter value for a transiting
exoplanet. This consequently limits a characterization of its atmosphere.

a partial co-lexicographic order of the states and proving, as in the total
order case, that states reached by a given string form one interval on the
partial order, thus enabling indexing. We provide a lower bound stating that
such an interval requires $O(p)$ words to be represented, $p$ being the order's
width (i.e. the size of its largest antichain). Indeed, we show that $p$
determines the complexity of several fundamental problems on finite automata:
(i) Letting $\sigma$ be the alphabet size, we provide an encoding for NFAs

similarity between probability distributions that has exciting applications in
machine learning. For discrete distributions, the problem of computing this
distance can be expressed in terms of finding a minimum-cost perfect matching
on a complete bipartite graph given by two multisets of points $A,B \subset
\mathbb{R}^2$, with $|A|=|B|=n$, where the ground distance between any two
points is the squared Euclidean distance between them. Although there is a
near-linear time relative $\varepsilon$-approximation algorithm for the case
where the ground distance is Euclidean (Sharathkumar and Agarwal, JACM 2020),
all existing relative $\varepsilon$-approximation algorithms for the RMS
distance take $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ time. This is primarily because, unlike
Euclidean distance, squared Euclidean distance is not a metric. In this paper,
for the RMS distance, we present a new $\varepsilon$-approximation algorithm
that runs in $O(n^{5/4}\mathrm{poly}\{\log n,1/\varepsilon\})$ time.
  Our algorithm is inspired by a recent approach for finding a minimum-cost
perfect matching in bipartite planar graphs (Asathulla et al., TALG 2020).
Their algorithm depends heavily on the existence of sub-linear sized vertex
separators as well as shortest path data structures that require planarity.
Surprisingly, we are able to design a similar algorithm for a complete
geometric graph that is far from planar and does not have any vertex
separators. Central components of our algorithm include a quadtree-based
distance that approximates the squared Euclidean distance and a data structure
that supports both Hungarian search and augmentation in sub-linear time.

which considers specific aspects, or features, of the input is desired. For
example, in the presence of bias, a solution that disregards the biased feature

the maximum NS mass, excludes a large number of equations of state (EOSs).
Further EOS constraints, complementary to other methods, are likely to come
from the measurement of the moment of inertia (MOI) of binary pulsars in
relativistic orbits. The Double Pulsar, PSR J0737$-$3039A/B, is the most
promising system for the first measurement of the MOI via pulsar timing.
Reviewing this method, based in particular on the first MeerKAT observations of

interference device (SQUID) magnetometers are currently unmatched. The measured
moment values are, however, prone to deviations from their actual value due to
geometric effects, namely sample size, shape, and radial offset. This is well
known, and a knowledgeable operator will correct measured moment values taking
these effects into account.
  The current procedure for the Magnetic Property Measurement 3 (MPMS3)
magnetometer is based on an available simulation tool, valid for both Vibrating
Sample Magnetometer (VSM) and Direct Current (DC) methods. Still, determining
the correction factor requires samples with well-defined geometric shapes
together with accurate sample dimensions and the usually difficult to determine
radial offset. Additionally, at the moment, there is not a proper solution to
correct geometry effects of irregular shaped samples.
  In this work, we find a systematic relation between the difference between
the VSM and DC measurements and their corresponding correction factors for
MPMS3 SQUID-VSM device. This relation follows a clear trend, independent of
sample size, shape or radial offset, for a given pair of DC scan length and VSM
amplitude values. Exploiting this trend, a geometry-independent correction
method is here presented and validated by measurements of metallic Fe powder
using a far from optimal sample mounting.

equations (MV-FBSDEs) arise naturally from large population optimization
problems. Judging the quality of given numerical solutions for MV-FBSDEs, which
usually require Picard iterations and approximations of nested conditional
expectations, is typically difficult. This paper proposes an a posteriori error
estimator to quantify the $L^2$-approximation error of an arbitrarily generated
approximation on a time grid. We establish that the error estimator is
equivalent to the global approximation error between the given numerical
solution and the solution of a forward Euler discretized MV-FBSDE. A crucial
and challenging step in the analysis is the proof of stability of this Euler
approximation to the MV-FBSDE, which is of independent interest. We further
demonstrate that, for sufficiently fine time grids, the accuracy of numerical
solutions for solving the continuous MV-FBSDE can also be measured by the error
estimator. The error estimates justify the use of residual-based algorithms for
solving MV-FBSDEs. Numerical experiments for MV-FBSDEs arising from mean field
control and games confirm the effectiveness and practical applicability of the
error estimator.

represented as bits sequences coming from Information Sources. Previously, we
studied relations between Information Transmission Rates (ITR) carried out by
the spikes, their correlations, and frequencies. Here, we concentrate on the
problem of how spikes fluctuations affect ITR. The Information Theory Method
developed by Shannon is applied. Information Sources are modeled as stationary
stochastic processes. We assume such sources as two states Markov processes. As
a spike-trains' fluctuation measure, we consider the Standard Deviation SD,
which, in fact, measures average fluctuation of spikes around the average spike
frequency. We found that character of ITR and signal fluctuations relation
strongly depends on parameter s which is a sum of transitions probabilities
from no spike state to spike state and vice versa. It turned out that for
smaller s (s<1) the quotient ITR/SD has a maximum and can tend to zero
depending on transition probabilities. While for s large enough 1<s the ITR/SD
is separated from 0 for each s. Similar behavior was observed when we replaced
Shannon entropy terms in Markov entropy formula by their approximation with
polynomials. We also show that the ITR quotient by Variance behaves in a
completely different way. We show that for large transition parameter s the
Information Transmission Rate by SD will never decrease to 0. Specifically, for
1<s<1.7 the ITR will be always, independently on transition probabilities which
form this s, above the level of fluctuations, i.e. we have SD<ITR. We conclude
that in a more noisy environment, to get appropriate reliability and efficiency
of transmission, Information Sources with higher tendency of transition from
the state no spike to spike state and vice versa should be applied.

ability to accelerate responses and generate pulses. Though functions of IFFLs
are well studied, most previous computational analysis of IFFLs used ordinary
differential equation (ODE) models where retroactivity, the effect downstream
binding sites exert on the dynamics of an upstream transcription factor (TF),
was not considered. It remains an open question to understand the behavior of
IFFLs in contexts with high levels of retroactivity, e.g., in cells
transformed/transfected with high-copy plasmids, or in eukaryotic cells where a
TF binds to numerous high-affinity binding sites in addition to one or more
functional target sites. Here we study the behavior of IFFLs by simulating and
comparing ODE models with different levels of retroactivity. We find that
increasing retroactivity in an IFFL can increase, decrease, or keep the
network's response time and pulse amplitude constant. This suggests that
increasing retroactivity, traditionally considered as an impediment to
designing robust synthetic systems, could be exploited to improve the
performance of IFFLs. We compare the behaviors of IFFLs to negative
autoregulatory loops, another sign-sensitive response-accelerating network
motif, and find that increasing retroactivity in a negative autoregulated
circuit can only slow the response. The inability of a negative autoregulatory
loop to flexibly handle retroactivity may have contributed to its lower
abundance in eukaryotic relative to bacterial regulatory networks, a sharp
contrast to the significant abundance of IFFLs in both cell types.

applications in the design of algorithms for undirected graphs. An analogous
version of the Grid Theorem in digraphs was conjectured by Johnson et al.
[JCTB, 2001], and proved by Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer [STOC, 2015]. Namely,
they showed that there is a function $f(k)$ such that every digraph of directed
tree-width at least $f(k)$ contains a cylindrical grid of size $k$ as a
butterfly minor and stated that their proof can be turned into an XP algorithm,
with parameter $k$, that either constructs a decomposition of the appropriate
width, or finds the claimed large cylindrical grid as a butterfly minor. In
this paper, we adapt some of the steps of the proof of Kawarabayashi and
Kreutzer to improve this XP algorithm into an FPT algorithm. Towards this, our
main technical contributions are two FPT algorithms with parameter $k$. The
first one either produces an arboreal decomposition of width $3k-2$ or finds a
haven of order $k$ in a digraph $D$, improving on the original result for
arboreal decompositions by Johnson et al. The second algorithm finds a
well-linked set of order $k$ in a digraph $D$ of large directed tree-width. As
tools to prove these results, we show how to solve a generalized version of the

onto thin wall films is investigated experimentally. Despite similar liquid
properties and impact conditions, differences in the splashing limit, the crown
extension and the duration of the ascending phase are observed. These
differences are related to the interfacial tension of the droplet/wall-film
liquid pairs, which is linked to their miscibility and wettability. More
precisely, by calculating the crown surface energy, we show that the energy
stored in the interface between droplet and wall-film (if any) is not
negligible and leads to smaller crown extensions and the need of more kinetic
energy to initiate splashing. Similarly, by calculating a modified capillary
time taking into account all surface and interfacial tensions, we show that the
interfacial tension acts as a non-negligible recoiling force, which reduces the
duration of the ascending phase. The dynamics of this ascending phase is well
captured for different wall-film thicknesses if accounting for the variations
of the liquid masses in movement. Overall, droplet/wall-film interactions can
be seen as inertio-capillary systems where the interfacial tension between
droplet and wall film plays a significant role in the storage of energy and in
the crown kinetics during the impact process. Besides, this analysis highlights
that viscous losses have already a significant effect during the crown
extension phase, by dissipating almost half of the initial energies for droplet
impact onto thin wall films, and most likely by influencing the capillary time
scale through damping.

allows us to make three observations. First, we find that the chaotic behavior
is stronger with the increases of the minimal length effects, which manifests
that the maximum Lyapunov characteristic exponents mostly grow, and the KAM
curves on Poincar\'{e} surfaces of section tend to disintegrate into chaotic
layers. Second, in the presence of the minimal length effects, it can take a
finite amount of Rindler time for a particle to cross the Rindler horizon,
which implies a shorter scrambling time of black holes. Finally, it shows that
some Lyapunov characteristic exponents can be greater than the surface gravity
of the horizon, violating the recently conjectured universal upper bound. In
short, our results reveal that quantum gravity effects may make black holes

have been heavily influenced by constructivist learning theories (National
Research Council, 2000). These learning theories place the learner as the sole
constructor of knowledge and emphasize the importance of the learner's inquiry
process (Yilmaz, 2008). In constructivist inquiry-based science education, lab
experiences frequently play an important role in instruction as they provide
students with opportunities to observe and make sense of the world around them
(National Research Council, 2000), which raises the question of how
inquiry-based science instruction can be translated to online environments.
There are several models for lab experiences in online science courses,
including hands-on labs where students directly manipulate materials, remote
labs where students manipulate materials through a computer, and virtual labs
and simulations where students work with simulated materials (Powell, et al.,
2010). Hands-on labs play an important role, especially given constructivist
views that students construct meaning by making observations of the world
around them, but there is evidence that simulated and virtual labs can play an
important role and may even be better suited to some instructional goals than
hands-on labs. Constructivist instruction also requires students to make their
process visible and teachers to be responsive to student thinking, both of
which are more challenging in online environments (Crippen, et al., 2013).
However, with intentional design, these features can be incorporated into
online science courses (Jaber, et al., 2018; Jang, 2009).

models of certain systems. The mathematical descriptions of some systems, such

and this limits the utility of span categories as a formal framework. Given
categories $\mathscr{C}$ and $\mathscr{C}^\prime$ and a functor $\mathcal F$

$\mathcal F$ pullback of a cospan in $\mathscr{C}$, as well as the notion of
span tightness of $\mathcal F$. If $\mathcal F$ is span tight, then we can form
a generalized span category ${\rm Span}(\mathscr{C},\mathcal F)$ and circumvent
the technical difficulty of $\mathscr{C}$ failing to have pullbacks.
Composition in ${\rm Span}(\mathscr{C},\mathcal F)$ uses $\mathcal F$-pullbacks
rather than pullbacks and in this way differs from the category ${\rm

direct consequence of the ability of the model to capture the several modes of
the underlying data distribution. To address these issues, we propose a new

the first observation of Penrose superradiance as the over-reflection of water

Penrose superradiance arises naturally in the field of nonlinear optics. In

in the core of the pump vortex, as predicted by Penrose, which in turn provides
a gain mechanism for the signal beam. Our results elucidate a new regime of

was introduced by Kamp, Rao, Vadhan and Zuckerman (STOC'06), and falls into a
line of research initiated by Trevisan and Vadhan (FOCS'00) on extracting
randomness from weak sources that are sampled by computationally bounded
algorithms. Our main results are the following.
  1. We obtain near-optimal extractors for small-space sources in the
polynomial error regime. For space $s$ sources over $n$ bits, our extractors
require just $k\geq s\cdot$polylog$(n)$ entropy. This is an exponential
improvement over the previous best result, which required $k\geq
s^{1.1}\cdot2^{\log^{0.51} n}$ (Chattopadhyay and Li, STOC'16).
  2. We obtain improved extractors for small-space sources in the negligible
error regime. For space $s$ sources over $n$ bits, our extractors require
entropy $k\geq n^{1/2+\delta}\cdot s^{1/2-\delta}$, whereas the previous best
result required $k\geq n^{2/3+\delta}\cdot s^{1/3-\delta}$ (Chattopadhyay,
Goodman, Goyal and Li, STOC'20).
  To obtain our first result, the key ingredient is a new reduction from
small-space sources to affine sources, allowing us to simply apply a good
affine extractor.
  To obtain our second result, we must develop some new machinery, since we do
not have low-error affine extractors that work for low entropy. Our main tool
is a significantly improved extractor for adversarial sources, which is built
via a simple framework that makes novel use of a certain kind of
leakage-resilient extractors (known as cylinder intersection extractors), by
combining them with a general type of extremal designs. Our key ingredient is
the first derandomization of these designs, which we obtain using new
connections to coding theory and additive combinatorics.

extended over the boundary and as such completely decoupled from the shape of

attracted attention as the first known material that hosts magnetic
antiskyrmions, which differ from the so far known skyrmions by their internal
structure. The latter have been found in a number of magnets with the chiral
crystal structure. In previous works, the existence of antiskyrmions in
Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn was unambiguously demonstrated in real space by means of Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy on thin-plate samples ($\sim$100~nm thick). In
the present study, we used small-angle neutron scattering and magnetic force
microscopy to perform reciprocal- and real-space imaging of the magnetic
texture of bulk Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn single-crystals at different temperatures and in
applied magnetic field. We found that the magnetic texture in the bulk differs
significantly from that of thin-plate samples. Instead of spin helices or an
antiskyrmion lattice, we observe an anisotropic fractal magnetic pattern of
closure domains in zero field above the spin-reorientation transition
temperature, which transforms into a set of bubble domains in high field. Below
the spin-reorientation transition temperature the strong in-plane anisotropy as
well as the fractal self-affinity in zero field is gradually lost, while the
formation of bubble domains in high field remains robust. The results of our
study highlight the importance of dipole-dipole interactions in thin-plate
samples for the stabilization of antiskyrmions and identify criteria which
should guide the search for potential (anti)skyrmion host materials. Moreover,
they provide consistent interpretations of the previously reported
magnetotransport anomalies of the bulk crystals.

statistics to provide accurate inference. We show that estimates using data
sketched by random projections will behave `as if' the errors were
homoskedastic. Estimation by random sampling would not have this property. The
result arises because the sketched estimates in the case of random projections
can be expressed as degenerate $U$-statistics, and under certain conditions,
these statistics are asymptotically normal with homoskedastic variance. We
verify that the conditions hold not only in the case of least squares
regression when the covariates are exogenous, but also in instrumental
variables estimation when the covariates are endogenous. The result implies
that inference, including first-stage F tests for instrument relevance, can be
simpler than the full sample case if the sketching scheme is appropriately
chosen.

pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Many existing computational
drug repurposing methods rely on preclinical data (e.g., chemical structures,
drug targets), resulting in translational problems for clinical trials. In this
study, we propose a clinical connectivity map framework for drug repurposing by
leveraging laboratory tests to analyze complementarity between drugs and
diseases. We establish clinical drug effect vectors (i.e., drug-laboratory test
associations) by applying a continuous self-controlled case series model on a
longitudinal electronic health record data. We establish clinical disease sign
vectors (i.e., disease-laboratory test associations) by applying a Wilcoxon
rank sum test on a large-scale national survey data. Finally, we compute a
repurposing possibility score for each drug-disease pair by applying a dot
product-based scoring function on clinical disease sign vectors and clinical
drug effect vectors. We comprehensively evaluate 392 drugs for 6 important
chronic diseases (e.g., asthma, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, etc.).
We discover not only known associations between diseases and drugs but also
many hidden drug-disease associations. Moreover, we are able to explain the
predicted drug-disease associations via the corresponding complementarity
between laboratory tests of drug effect vectors and disease sign vectors. The
proposed clinical connectivity map framework uses laboratory tests from
electronic clinical information to bridge drugs and diseases, which is
explainable and has better translational power than existing computational
methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework and suggest that our method could help identify drug repurposing
opportunities, which will benefit patients by offering more effective and safer
treatments.

deconfining phase at $T_0=1.32\,T_c$ where $T_c$ denotes the critical
temperature for the onset of the deconfining-preconfining phase transition.
Such a region possesses of a finite energy density and represents the
self-intersection of a figure-eight shaped center-vortex loop if a BPS monopole
of core radius $\sim \frac{r_0}{52.4}$, isolated from its antimonopole by
repulsion externally invoked through a transient shift of (anti)caloron
holonomy (pair creation), is trapped therein. The entire soliton (vortex line
plus region of self-intersection of mass $m_0$ containing the monopole) can be
considered an excitation of the pressureless and energyless ground state of the
confining phase. Correcting an earlier estimate of $r_0$, we show that the
vortex-loop self-intersection region associates with the {\sl central part} of
a(n) (anti)caloron and that this region carries one unit of electric U(1)
charge via the (electric-magnetic dually interpreted) charge of the monopole.
The monopole core quantum vibrates at a thermodynamically determined frequency
$\omega_0$ and is unresolved. For a deconfining-phase plasma oscillation about
the zero-pressure background at $T=T_0$ we compute the lowest frequency
$\Omega_0$ within a {\sl neutral} and homogeneous spatial ball (no trapped
monopole) in dependence of its radius $R_0$. For $R_0=r_0$ a comparison of
$\Omega_0$ with $\omega_0$ reveals that the neutral plasma oscillates much

appear to surpass humans' performance. However, these models require an
avalanche of expensive human labeled training data and many iterations to train
their large number of parameters. This severely limits their scalability to the
real-world long-tail distributed categories, some of which are with a large
number of instances, but with only a few manually annotated. Learning from such
extremely limited labeled examples is known as Few-shot learning (FSL).
Different to prior arts that leverage meta-learning or data augmentation
strategies to alleviate this extremely data-scarce problem, this paper presents
a statistical approach, dubbed Instance Credibility Inference (ICI) to exploit
the support of unlabeled instances for few-shot visual recognition. Typically,
we repurpose the self-taught learning paradigm to predict pseudo-labels of
unlabeled instances with an initial classifier trained from the few shot and
then select the most confident ones to augment the training set to re-train the
classifier. This is achieved by constructing a (Generalized) Linear Model
(LM/GLM) with incidental parameters to model the mapping from (un-)labeled
features to their (pseudo-)labels, in which the sparsity of the incidental
parameters indicates the credibility of the corresponding pseudo-labeled
instance. We rank the credibility of pseudo-labeled instances along the
regularization path of their corresponding incidental parameters, and the most
trustworthy pseudo-labeled examples are preserved as the augmented labeled
instances. Theoretically, under mild conditions of restricted eigenvalue,
irrepresentability, and large error, our approach is guaranteed to collect all
the correctly-predicted instances from the noisy pseudo-labeled set.

backbones and datacenters. The SRv6 standardization, implementation and
research are actively progressing and SRv6 has already been adopted in a number
of large scale network deployments. Effective Performance Monitoring (PM)
solutions for SRv6 networks are strongly needed. The design, implementation and
deployment of such PM solutions span the different planes of a networking
architecture: Performance Measurements data (packet loss and delay) needs to be
measured (in the Data Plane), the monitored nodes needs to be controlled (in
the Control Plane), the measured data needs to be collected (in the
Control/Management Planes), then the Data must be processed and stored, using
Big-Data processing solutions.
  We focus on Loss Monitoring, by considering a solution capable of tracking
single packet loss events in near-real time (e.g. with a delay in the order of
20 seconds).
  We describe SRv6-PM, a solution for Performance Monitoring of SRv6 networks.
SRv6-PM features a cloud-native architecture for the SDN-based control of Linux
routers and for ingestion, processing, storage and visualization of PM data. In
the Data Plane, SRv6-PM includes efficient building blocks for packet loss
evaluation (e.g. the packet counting components) in a Linux router.
  SRv6-PM is released as open source. Not only we provide a reproducible
environment for PM experiments, but we also offer a re-usable and extensible
cloud-native platform that can be automatically deployed in different
environments, from a single host to multiple servers on private/public clouds.

steadily pushed forward by the relentless developments of computer
architectures and algorithms. This explosion in the number and extent (in size

methods to rationalise the raw data and make quantitative sense out of them.
Recently, an algorithmic approach was developed by some of us to identify the
subset of a protein's atoms, or mapping, that enables the most informative
description of it. This method relies on the computation, for a given reduced
representation, of the associated mapping entropy, that is, a measure of the
information loss due to the simplification. Albeit relatively straightforward,
this calculation can be time consuming. Here, we describe the implementation of
a deep learning approach aimed at accelerating the calculation of the mapping
entropy. The method relies on deep graph networks, which provide extreme
flexibility in the input format. We show that deep graph networks are accurate
and remarkably efficient, with a speedup factor as large as $10^5$ with respect
to the algorithmic computation of the mapping entropy. Applications of this
method, which entails a great potential in the study of biomolecules when used
to reconstruct its mapping entropy landscape, reach much farther than this,
being the scheme easily transferable to the computation of arbitrary functions

probit models requires evaluation of a multidimensional integral. Quasi-Monte
Carlo (QMC) methods such as shuffled and scrambled Halton sequences and
modified Latin hypercube sampling (MLHS) are workhorse methods for integral
approximation. A few earlier studies explored the potential of sparse grid
quadrature (SGQ), but this approximation suffers from negative weights. As an
alternative to QMC and SGQ, we looked into the recently developed designed
quadrature (DQ) method. DQ requires fewer nodes to get the same level of
accuracy as of QMC and SGQ, is as easy to implement, ensures positivity of
weights, and can be created on any general polynomial spaces. We benchmarked DQ
against QMC in a Monte Carlo study under different data generating processes
with a varying number of random parameters (3, 5, and 10) and
variance-covariance structures (diagonal and full). Whereas DQ significantly
outperformed QMC in the diagonal variance-covariance scenario, it could also
achieve a better model fit and recover true parameters with fewer nodes (i.e.,
relatively lower computation time) in the full variance-covariance scenario.
Finally, we evaluated the performance of DQ in a case study to understand
preferences for mobility-on-demand services in New York City. In estimating
MMNL with five random parameters, DQ achieved better fit and statistical
significance of parameters with just 200 nodes as compared to 1000 QMC draws,
making DQ around five times faster than QMC methods.

compute-intensive, such that an individual UE can hardly afford by itself in
real time. However the resources in each individual edge server are typically
limited. Therefore, any resource optimization involving edge servers is by
nature a resource-constrained optimization problem and needs to be tackled in
such realistic context. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the
optimization problem of DNN partitioning (an emerging DNN offloading scheme) in
a realistic multi-user resource-constrained condition that rarely considered in
previous works. Despite the extremely large solution space, we reveal several
properties of this specific optimization problem of joint multi-UE DNN

particularly challenging as the first user of those models, is the expert in
the process with often decades of experience. It is necessary to expose to the
process engineer, not solely the model predictions, but also their
interpretability. To that end, several approaches have been proposed in the
literature. The Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method
has gained a lot of interest from the research community recently. The
principle of this method is to train a linear model that is locally
approximating the black-box model, by generating randomly artificial data
points locally. Model-agnostic local interpretability solutions based on LIME
have recently emerged to improve the original method. We present in this paper
a novel approach, VAE-LIME, for local interpretability of data-driven models

ironmaking process data is characterized by multivariate time series with high
inter-correlation representing the underlying process in a blast furnace. Our
contribution is to use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn the complex
blast furnace process characteristics from the data. The VAE is aiming at
generating optimal artificial samples to train a local interpretable model
better representing the black-box model in the neighborhood of the input sample
processed by the black-box model to make a prediction. In comparison with LIME,
VAE-LIME is showing a significantly improved local fidelity of the local
interpretable linear model with the black-box model resulting in robust model
interpretability.

too has their computational cost. There are many effective techniques for
reducing a network's computational footprint (quantisation, pruning, knowledge
distillation), but these lead to models whose computational cost is the same
regardless of their input. Our human reaction times vary with the complexity of
the tasks we perform: easier tasks (e.g. telling apart dogs from boat) are
executed much faster than harder ones (e.g. telling apart two similar looking
breeds of dogs). Driven by this observation, we develop a method for adaptive
network complexity by attaching a small classification layer, which we call
SideNet, to a large pretrained network, which we call MainNet. Given an input,
the SideNet returns a classification if its confidence level, obtained via
softmax, surpasses a user determined threshold, and only passes it along to the
large MainNet for further processing if its confidence is too low. This allows
us to flexibly trade off the network's performance with its computational cost.
Experimental results show that simple single hidden layer perceptron SideNets
added onto pretrained ResNet and BERT MainNets allow for substantial decreases
in compute with minimal drops in performance on image and text classification
tasks. We also highlight three other desirable properties of our method, namely
that the classifications obtained by SideNets are calibrated, complementary to
other compute reduction techniques, and that they enable the easy exploration
of compute accuracy space.

detection researches where accurate bounding box estimation is the key to the
success of these methods. However, even the bounding box has the highest
confidence score, it is still far from perfect at localization. To this end, we
propose a box reorganization method(DDBNet), which can dive deeper into the box
for more accurate localization. At the first step, drifted boxes are filtered
out because the contents in these boxes are inconsistent with target semantics.
Next, the selected boxes are broken into boundaries, and the well-aligned
boundaries are searched and grouped into a sort of optimal boxes toward
tightening instances more precisely. Experimental results show that our method
is effective which leads to state-of-the-art performance for object detection.

higher. Hyponatremia is the deficiency of sodium electrolyte in the human

longer hospital stay or mortality, if it wasnt actively treated and managed.
This work predicts the futuristic sodium levels of patients based on their
history of health problems using multilayer perceptron and multivariate linear
regression algorithm. This work analyses the patients age, information about
other disease such as diabetes, pneumonia, liver-disease, malignancy,
pulmonary, sepsis, SIADH, and sodium level of the patient during admission to
the hospital. The results of the proposed MLP algorithm is compared with MLR
algorithm based results. The MLP prediction results generates 23-72 of higher
prediction results than MLR algorithm. Thus, proposed MLR algorithm has
produced 57.1 of reduced mean squared error rate than the MLR results on
predicting future sodium ranges of patients. Further, proposed MLR algorithm
produces 27-50 of higher prediction precision rate.

diagnosis. This task is very challenging because the complex structure and
texture information are mixed in a retinal image, and distinguishing the
information is difficult. Existing methods handle texture and structure
jointly, which may lead biased models toward recognizing textures and thus
results in inferior segmentation performance. To address it, we propose a
segmentation strategy that seeks to separate structure and texture components
and significantly improve the performance. To this end, we design a
structure-texture demixing network (STD-Net) that can process structures and
textures differently and better. Extensive experiments on two retinal image
segmentation tasks (i.e., blood vessel segmentation, optic disc and cup
segmentation) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

assessment and demands the precise depth estimation of the food surface and
table plane. Existing methods based on computer vision require either
multi-image input or additional depth maps, reducing convenience of
implementation and practical significance. Despite the recent advances in
unsupervised depth estimation from a single image, the achieved performance in
the case of large texture-less areas needs to be improved. In this paper, we
propose a network architecture that jointly performs geometric understanding
(i.e., depth prediction and 3D plane estimation) and semantic prediction on a
single food image, enabling a robust and accurate food volume estimation
regardless of the texture characteristics of the target plane. For the training
of the network, only monocular videos with semantic ground truth are required,
while the depth map and 3D plane ground truth are no longer needed.
Experimental results on two separate food image databases demonstrate that our
method performs robustly on texture-less scenarios and is superior to
unsupervised networks and structure from motion based approaches, while it
achieves comparable performance to fully-supervised methods.

techniques when using the same label and the same photonic biosensor platform

with silicon nanoparticles as high-contrast reporters. In the practical
realization of this detection scheme, detection specificity and signal

enzymes such as CRISPR Cas12a and Cas13 after binding to a target DNA/RNA

Linear Imaging Self-Scanning System - IV (LISS IV) with 5.8 m spatial
resolution and Carto DEM are used for generating the 3D view using the Arc
environment and then converted into virtual reality modeling language (VRML)
format. In order to reduce the volume of the VRML dataset a quadratic edge
collapse decimation method is applied which reduces the number of faces in the
mesh while preserving the boundary and/or normal. A granitic terrain in the
south-west part of Hyderabad comprising of dyke intrusion is considered for the
generation of 3D VR dataset, as it has high elevation differences thus
rendering it most suitable for the present study. Further, the enhanced
geomorphological features such as hills and valleys, geological structures such
as fractures, intrusive (dykes) are studied and found suitable for better

  Embedding: A Case on MovieLens",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Information technology has spread widely, and extraordinarily large amounts
of data have been made accessible to users, which has made it challenging to
select data that are in accordance with user needs. For the resolution of the
above issue, recommender systems have emerged, which much help users go through
the process of decision-making and selecting relevant data. A recommender
system predicts users behavior to be capable of detecting their interests and
needs, and it often uses the classification technique for this purpose. It may
not be sufficiently accurate to employ individual classification, where not all
cases can be examined, which makes the method inappropriate to specific
problems. In this research, group classification and the ensemble learning
technique were used for increasing prediction accuracy in recommender systems.
Another issue that is raised here concerns user analysis. Given the large size
of the data and a large number of users, the process of user needs analysis and
prediction (using a graph in most cases, representing the relations between
users and their selected items) is complicated and cumbersome in recommender
systems. Graph embedding was also proposed for resolution of this issue, where
all or part of user behavior can be simulated through the generation of several
vectors, resolving the problem of user behavior analysis to a large extent
while maintaining high efficiency. In this research, individuals most similar
to the target user were classified using ensemble learning, fuzzy rules, and
the decision tree, and relevant recommendations were then made to each user
with a heterogeneous knowledge graph and embedding vectors. This study was
performed on the MovieLens datasets, and the obtained results indicated the
high efficiency of the presented method.

Poisson process parameter to be a mixed random variable, we capture the
heterogeneity of foreseeable and unforeseeable risks. To illustrate, we
estimate the weights for the two risk streams for a real dataset from a
Portuguese insurer. To calculate the premium, we set the frequency and severity
as distributions that belong to the linear exponential family. Under a Bayesian
setup , we show that when working with a finite mixture of conjugate priors,
the premium can be estimated by a mixture of posterior means, with updated
parameters, depending on claim histories. We emphasise the riskiness of the
unforeseeable trend, by choosing heavy-tailed distributions. After estimating
distribution parameters involved using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm,
we found that Bayesian premiums derived are more reactive to claim trends than
traditional ones.

physical mechanisms in tribology. Based on the frustrated total internal
reflection, a new apparatus is designed to measure the real contact area. For
brass samples with various surface topographies, the relation between normal
load and real contact area is measured. Our experiments verify the linear
relationship between load and real contact area during loading process. More
importantly, the unloading process is firstly considered to distinguish the
contribution of elasticity and plasticity in contact of rough surfaces. It is
found that both elasticity and plasticity are involved throughout the
continuous loading process, different from some present understanding and
assumptions that they play at different loading stages. A quantitative
parameter is proposed to indicate the contribution of plasticity. The present
work not only provides an experimental method to measure real contact area but
