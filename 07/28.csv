  Forests","53 pages, 19 figures",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building off recent work of Garg and Peng, we continue the investigation into
classical and consecutive pattern avoidance in rooted forests, resolving some
of their conjectures and questions and proving generalizations whenever
possible. Through extensions of the forest Simion-Schmidt bijection introduced
by Anders and Archer, we demonstrate a new family of forest-Wilf equivalences,
completing the classification of forest-Wilf equivalence classes for sets
consisting of a pattern of length 3 and a pattern of length at most $5$. We
also find a new family of nontrivial c-forest-Wilf equivalences between single
patterns using the forest analogue of the Goulden-Jackson cluster method,
showing that a $(1-o(1))^n$-fraction of patterns of length $n$ satisfy a
nontrivial c-forest-Wilf equivalence and that there are c-forest-Wilf
equivalence classes of patterns of length $n$ of exponential size.
Additionally, we consider a forest analogue of super-strong-c-Wilf equivalence,
introduced for permutations by Dwyer and Elizalde, showing that
super-strong-c-forest-Wilf equivalences are trivial by enumerating linear
extensions of forest cluster posets. Finally, we prove a forest analogue of the
Stanley-Wilf conjecture for avoiding a single pattern as well as certain other
sets of patterns. Our techniques are analytic, easily generalizing to different
types of pattern avoidance and allowing for computations of convergent lower
bounds of the forest Stanley-Wilf limit in the cases covered by our result. We
end with several open questions and directions for future research, including
some on the limit distributions of certain statistics of pattern-avoiding
forests.

limit is quantitatively assessed. A very strong effect on the cooling limit is
found from the internal cavity decay rate which even being small compared with
the detection rate may drastically push that limit up, questioning the
possibility of the ground state cooling. Specifically, the internal loss can
only be neglected if the ratio of the internal decay rate to the detection rate
is much smaller than the ratio of the cooling limit predicted by the protocol
to the common dispersive-coupling assisted sideband cooling limit. More over,
we establish that the condition of applicability of theory of that protocol is
the requirement that the latter ratio is much smaller than one. A detailed
comparison of the cooling protocol in question with the

Universe is a well studied phenomenon. Based on quantum gravity arguments, it
has been conjectured that the early Universe might have undergone a lower
dimensional phase before relaxing to the current $(3 + 1)$ dimensional state.
In this article we combine the above phenomena: we calculate the pair creation
rates of black holes nucleated in an expanding Universe, by assuming a
dimensional evolution, we term ``oxidation'', from $(1 + 1)$ to $(2 + 1)$ and
finally to $(3 + 1)$ dimensions. Our investigation is based on the no boundary
proposal that allows for the construction of the required gravitational
instantons. If, on the one hand, the existence of a dilaton non-minimally
coupled to the metric is necessary for black holes to exist in the $(1 + 1)$
phase, it becomes, on the other hand, trivial in $(2 + 1)$ dimensions.
Nevertheless, the dilaton might survive the oxidation and be incorporated in a
modified theory of gravity in $(3 + 1)$ dimensions: by assuming that our
Universe, in its current state, originates from a lower-dimensional oxidation,
one might be led to consider the pair creation rate in a sub-class of the
Horndeski action. Our findings for this case show that, for specific values of
the Galileon coupling to the metric, the rate can be unsuppressed. This would
imply the possibility of compelling parameter bounds for non-Einstein theories
of gravity by using the spontaneous black hole creation.

where loosely speaking, the goal is to provide privacy per item or training
example. However, recently many practical applications such as federated
learning require preserving privacy for all items of a single user, which is
much harder to achieve. Therefore understanding the theoretical limit of
user-level privacy becomes crucial.
  We study the fundamental problem of learning discrete distributions over $k$
symbols with user-level differential privacy. If each user has $m$ samples, we
show that straightforward applications of Laplace or Gaussian mechanisms
require the number of users to be $\mathcal{O}(k/(m\alpha^2) +
k/\epsilon\alpha)$ to achieve an $\ell_1$ distance of $\alpha$ between the true
and estimated distributions, with the privacy-induced penalty
$k/\epsilon\alpha$ independent of the number of samples per user $m$. Moreover,
we show that any mechanism that only operates on the final aggregate counts
should require a user complexity of the same order. We then propose a mechanism
such that the number of users scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k/(m\alpha^2) +
k/\sqrt{m}\epsilon\alpha)$ and hence the privacy penalty is
$\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{m})$ times smaller compared to the standard mechanisms in
certain settings of interest. We further show that the proposed mechanism is
nearly-optimal under certain regimes.

differentially private estimators and a lower bound on the total variation
between binomial distributions, both of which might be of independent interest.

extends available free memory space by coalescing redundant lines in hybrid

obtain high data access performance, we also design a set of acceleration

rely on relatively high-resolution input images; however, high-resolution
visual content is not always available in several practical scenarios such as
video surveillance and sports broadcasting. Low-resolution images in real
scenarios can vary in a wide range of sizes, and a model trained in one
resolution does not typically degrade gracefully across resolutions. Two common
approaches to solve the problem of low-resolution input are applying
super-resolution techniques to the input images which may result in visual
artifacts, or simply training one model for each resolution, which is
impractical in many realistic applications. To address the above issues, this
paper proposes a novel algorithm called RSC-Net, which consists of a
Resolution-aware network, a Self-supervision loss, and a Contrastive learning
scheme. The proposed network is able to learn the 3D body shape and pose across
different resolutions with a single model. The self-supervision loss encourages
scale-consistency of the output, and the contrastive learning scheme enforces
scale-consistency of the deep features. We show that both these new training

closure. Supporting an extended range of reverse and forward body-bias, UTBB

In this work we propose a methodology to maximize energy efficiency at run-time
exploiting body biasing on a ULP platform operating near-threshold. The
proposed method relies on on-line performance measurements by means of Process

We correlate the measurement performed by the PMBs to the maximum achievable
frequency of the system, deriving a predictive model able to estimate it with
an error of 9.7% at 0.7V. To minimize the effect of process variations we
propose a calibration procedure that allows to use a PMB model affected by only
the temperature-induced error, which reduces the frequency estimation error by
2.4x (from 9.7% to 4%). We finally propose a controller architecture relying on
the derived models to automatically regulate at run-time the body bias voltage.

Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+y}, with the average atomic positions perturbed beyond the
unit cell, offers an ideal test ground for studying the interplay between
superconductivity and the long-range incommensurate lattice fluctuations. Here
we report Scanning nano X-ray Diffraction (SnXRD) imaging of incommensurate
lattice modulations in Bi_{2.1}Sr_{1.9}CaCu_{2.0}O_{8+{\delta}} Van der Waals
heterostructures of thicknesses down to two-unit cells. Using SnXRD, we probe
that the long-range and short-range incommensurate lattice modulations in bulk
sample surface with spatial resolution below 100 nm. We find that puddle-like
domains of ILM of size uniformly evolving with dimensionality. In the 2-unit
cell thin sample, it is observed that the wavevectors of the long- and
short-range orders become anti-correlated with emerging spatial patterns having
a directional gradient. The emerging patterns, originated by tiny tuning of
lattice strain, induce static mesoscopic charge density waves. Our findings
thus demonstrate that the strain can be used to tune and control the
electromagnetic properties of two-dimensional high-temperature superconductors.

its cooling rate. Probably the most significant of those is the crystallization
of its core, a phase transition that occurs once the C/O interior has cooled
down below a critical temperature. This transition releases latent heat as well
as gravitational energy due to the redistribution of the C and O ions during
solidification, thereby slowing down the evolution of the white dwarf. The
unambiguous observational signature of core crystallization - a pile-up of
objects in the cooling sequence - was recently reported. However, existing
evolution models struggle to quantitatively reproduce this signature, casting
doubt on their accuracy when used to measure the ages of stellar populations.
The timing and amount of the energy released during crystallization depend on
the exact form of the C/O phase diagram. Using the advanced Gibbs-Duhem
integration method and state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations of the solid
and liquid phases, we have obtained a very accurate version of this phase
diagram, allowing a precise modeling of the phase transition. Despite this
improvement, the magnitude of the crystallization pile-up remains
underestimated by current evolution models. We conclude that latent heat
release and O sedimentation alone are not sufficient to explain the
observations and that other unaccounted physical mechanisms, possibly $^{22}$Ne
phase separation, play an important role.

rapidly-accreting white dwarf models at lower mass, we find that the H-shell
ashes are the main site of n-capture nucleosynthesis. We find high neutron
densities up to several 10^15 cm^-3 in the most massive WDs. Through the
recurrence of the H-shell ashes these intermediate neutron densities can be
sustained effectively for a long time leading to high neutron exposures with a
strong production up to Pb. Both the neutron density and the neutron exposure

scale the solution to a truly massive access scenario, a first-order algorithm

to run effectively in complex distributed systems, the algorithms ought to
compensate for communication asynchrony, and network node failures and delays

of the network, which may vary through time, thus hindering the optimization
process. In this paper, we propose a new distributed unconstrained optimization
algorithm for minimizing a strongly convex function which is adaptable to a
parameter server network. In particular, the network worker nodes solve their
local optimization problems, allowing the computation of their local coded
gradients, and send them to different server nodes. Then each server node
aggregates its communicated local gradients, allowing convergence to the
desired optimizer. This algorithm is robust to network worker node failures or
disconnection, or delays known as stragglers. One way to overcome the straggler
problem is to allow coding over the network. We further extend this coding

MAMe dataset, an image classification dataset with remarkable high resolution
and variable shape properties. The goal of MAMe is to provide a tool for
studying the impact of such properties in image classification, while
motivating research in the field. The MAMe dataset contains thousands of
artworks from three different museums, and proposes a classification task
consisting on differentiating between 29 mediums (i.e. materials and
techniques) supervised by art experts. After reviewing the singularity of MAMe
in the context of current image classification tasks, a thorough description of
the task is provided, together with dataset statistics. Experiments are
conducted to evaluate the impact of using high resolution images, variable
shape inputs and both properties at the same time. Results illustrate the
positive impact in performance when using high resolution images, while
highlighting the lack of solutions to exploit variable shapes. An additional
experiment exposes the distinctiveness between the MAMe dataset and the
prototypical ImageNet dataset. Finally, the baselines are inspected using
explainability methods and expert knowledge, to gain insights on the challenges
that remain ahead.

challenging; their performance highly depends on the nature of the surrounding

tall buildings might block undesired interference signals from ground BSs,
thereby improving the connectivity between the UAVs and their serving BSs. To
address the connectivity of UAVs in such environments, this paper proposes a RL
algorithm to dynamically optimise the height of a UAV as it moves through the
environment, with the goal of increasing the throughput or spectrum efficiency
that it experiences. The proposed solution is evaluated in two settings: using
a series of generated environments where we vary the number of BS and building
densities, and in a scenario using real-world data obtained from an experiment
in Dublin, Ireland. Results show that our proposed RL-based solution improves
UAVs QoS by 6% to 41%, depending on the scenario. We also conclude that, when
flying at heights higher than the buildings, building density variation has no
impact on UAV QoS. On the other hand, BS density can negatively impact UAV QoS,
with higher numbers of BSs generating more interference and deteriorating UAV
performance.

Vibro-Acoustic Modulation method, which does not require monitoring of relative
Modulation Index change, unlike conventional approach. It was hypothesized that
the nonlinear mechanisms (and respective nonlinear response) of a structure are
different for undamaged and damaged material. For example: material without
damage or at early stages of fatigue have classic elastic or
hysteretic/dissipative nonlinearity while damaged (cracked) material may
exhibit contact bi-linear or Hertzian nonlinear mechanisms. These mechanisms
yield different power law dependencies of Modulation Index (MI) as function of
applied vibration frequency input amplitude, B: MI ~ B^b Thus, quadratic
nonlinearity yields linear dependence, b =1, and Hertzian nonlinearity results
in b<1. Other nonlinear mechanisms yield different power laws. Therefore,
measuring power damage coefficient b instead of MI may offer testing without
established reference value. It is also offer some insights into the nonlinear
mechanisms transformation during damage evolution. This approach was
experimentally investigated and validated.

research on using autonomous vehicle technologies for routing and matching. The
future of urban mobility for passengers and goods relies on leveraging new
methods that minimize operational costs and environmental footprints of
transportation systems.
  This paper considers combining passenger transportation with goods delivery
to improve vehicle-based transportation. Even though the problem has been
studied with a defined dynamics model of the transportation system environment,
this paper considers a model-free approach that has been demonstrated to be
adaptable to new or erratic environment dynamics. We propose FlexPool, a
distributed model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that jointly
serves passengers & goods workloads by learning optimal dispatch policies from
its interaction with the environment. The proposed algorithm pools passengers
for a ride-sharing service and delivers goods using a multi-hop transit method.
These flexibilities decrease the fleet's operational cost and environmental
footprint while maintaining service levels for passengers and goods. Through
simulations on a realistic multi-agent urban mobility platform, we demonstrate
that FlexPool outperforms other model-free settings in serving the demands from
passengers & goods. FlexPool achieves 30% higher fleet utilization and 35%
higher fuel efficiency in comparison to (i) model-free approaches where
vehicles transport a combination of passengers & goods without the use of
multi-hop transit, and (ii) model-free approaches where vehicles exclusively

we propose two algorithms that solve FSO resource allocation problems. We first
present the Stochastic Dual Gradient (SDG) algorithm that is shown to solve the

implemented without knowledge of system models. A wide set of numerical

real-time reliable and accurate prediction feasible without using a training

powerful tools to solve complex robotic tasks (e.g., actuation, manipulation,

one of its most important limitations. The use of simulators is one way to
address this issue, yet knowledge acquired in simulations does not work
directly in the real-world, which is known as the sim-to-real transfer problem.
While previous works focus on the nature of the images used as observations
(e.g., textures and lighting), which has proven useful for a sim-to-sim
transfer, they neglect other concerns regarding said observations, such as
precise geometrical meanings, failing at robot-to-robot, and thus in
sim-to-real transfers. We propose a method that learns on an observation space

robots and simulators to achieve sim-to-real, while also addressing partial

scenarios produced by robot-to-robot transfer, outperforms image-based
baselines in robot-randomized experiments, and presents high performances in
sim-to-sim conditions. Finally, we perform several experiments to validate the
sim-to-real transfer to a physical domestic robot platform, confirming the

during the formation of super-Earths and their atmospheres. We perform unified
simulations of super-Earth formation and atmospheric evolution in evolving
disks that consider both photoevaporative winds and magnetically driven disk
winds. For the growth mode of planetary cores, we consider two cases in which
planetary embryos grow with and without pebble accretion. Our main findings are
summarized as follows. (i) The time span of atmospheric accretion is shortened
by rapid disk dissipation due to photoevaporation, which prevents super-Earth
cores from accreting massive atmospheres. (ii) Even if planetary cores grow
rapidly by embryo accretion in the case without pebble accretion, the onset of
runaway gas accretion is delayed because the isolation mass for embryo
accretion is small. Together with rapid disk clearing, the accretion of massive
atmospheres can be avoided. (iii) After rapid disk clearing, a number of
high-eccentricity embryos can remain in outer orbits. Thereafter, such embryos
may collide with the super-Earths, leading to efficient impact erosion of
accreted atmospheres. We, therefore, find that super-Earths with low-mass
H$_2$/He atmospheres are naturally produced by N-body simulations that consider
realistic disk evolution.

leptonic dark sector fields. This choice relaxes the dark matter (DM) search
constraints on the quintessential scalar singlet DM as well as presents new
opportunities for its detection in the lab. The mixing produces an arbitrary
mass difference between the two components of the extra doublet in a
gauge-invariant way, without introducing any new scale of electroweak symmetry
breaking in the theory. It also provides a useful handle to distinguish between
the dark sector particles of different isospins, which is a challenging task
otherwise. As the dark leptons coannihilate non-trivially, the mixing
effectively enhances the viable parameter space for the relic density
constraint. In low DM mass regime, our analysis shows that with a non-zero
mixing, it is possible to relax the existing indirect search bounds on the
upper limit of the DM-Standard Model coupling. From the analysis of the $3\tau
+ E^{miss}_T$ and $\ell\,\tau + E^{miss}_T$ channels for LHC at $\sqrt{s} = 13$
TeV, we show that one ensures the presence of the mixing parameter between the
dark sector particles of the theory by looking at the peak and tail positions
of the kinematic distributions. Even with a tweak in the values of other free
parameters within the viable parameter region, the distinct peak and tail
positions of the kinematic distributions remains a constant feature of the
model. While both the channels present us the opportunity to detect the mixing
signature at the LHC/HL-LHC, the former gives better results in terms of a
larger region of mixing parameter. From the fiducial cross section, the
projected statistical significance for the integrated luminosity, ${\mathscr L}
= 3~\text{ab}^{-1}$, are shown for a combined parameter region obeying all the

surrounding the maxima. We first demonstrate the performance in a mock analysis
of the KiDS+VIKING-450 data: we extract the Betti functions from a suite of

that provides rapid model predictions; we next run a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
analysis on independent mock data to infer the cosmological parameters and
their uncertainty. When comparing our results, we recover the input cosmology

$\sigma(1),\sigma(2),\ldots,\sigma(n)$ of a uniformly random permutation
$\sigma$ of $[n]=\{1,\dots,n\}$ into a binary search tree data structure.
Devroye (1986) proved that the height of such trees is asymptotically of order
$c^*\log n$, where $c^*=4.311\ldots$ is the unique solution of $c
\log((2e)/c)=1$ with $c \geq 2$. In this paper, we study the structure of
binary search trees $T_{n,q}$ built from Mallows permutations. A
$\textrm{Mallows}(q)$ permutation is a random permutation of
$[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ whose probability is proportional to
$q^{\textrm{Inv}(\sigma)}$, where $\textrm{Inv}(\sigma) = \#\{i < j: \sigma(i)
> \sigma(j)\}$. This model generalizes random binary search trees, since
$\textrm{Mallows}(q)$ permutations with $q=1$ are uniformly distributed. The
laws of $T_{n,q}$ and $T_{n,q^{-1}}$ are related by a simple symmetry
(switching the roles of the left and right children), so it suffices to
restrict our attention to $q\leq1$.
  We show that, for $q\in[0,1]$, the height of $T_{n,q}$ is asymptotically
$(1+o(1))(c^* \log n + n(1-q))$ in probability. This yields three regimes of
behaviour for the height of $T_{n,q}$, depending on whether $n(1-q)/\log n$
tends to zero, tends to infinity, or remains bounded away from zero and
infinity. In particular, when $n(1-q)/\log n$ tends to zero, the height of
$T_{n,q}$ is asymptotically of order $c^*\log n$, like it is for random binary
search trees. Finally, when $n(1-q)/\log n$ tends to infinity, we prove
stronger tail bounds and distributional limit theorems for the height of

how this high-energy irradiation varies with time by combining an empirical
relation describing stellar X-ray emission with a second relation describing
the ratio of Solar X-ray to extreme-ultraviolet emission. In contrast to
assumptions commonly made when modelling atmospheric escape, we find that the
decline in stellar extreme-ultraviolet emission is much slower than in X-rays,
and that the total extreme-ultraviolet irradiation of planetary atmospheres is
dominated by emission after the saturated phase of high energy emission (which
lasts around 100 Myr after the formation of the star). The extreme-ultraviolet
spectrum also becomes much softer during this slow decline. Furthermore, we
find that the total combined X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet emission of stars
also occurs mostly after this saturated phase. Our results suggest that models
of atmospheric escape that focus on the saturated phase of high-energy emission
are over-simplified, and when considering the evolution of planetary
atmospheres it is necessary to follow EUV-driven escape on Gyr timescales. This
may make it more difficult to use stellar age to separate the effects of
photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss when considering the origin the

are likely to introduce noise to the images. It is therefore imperative to
reduce the noise while preserving the geometric details of the anatomical

has been often used in brain image processing and analysis. However, the direct
application of Gaussian kernel smoothing tend to cause various numerical issues
in irregular domains with boundaries. For example, if one uses large bandwidth
in kernel smoothing in a cortical bounded region, the smoothing will blur
signals across boundaries. So in kernel smoothing and regression literature,
various ad-hoc procedures were introduce to remedy the boundary effect.
Diffusion equations have been widely used in brain imaging as a form of noise
reduction. The most natural straightforward way to smooth images in irregular
domains with boundaries is to formulate the problem as boundary value problems
using partial differential equations. Numerous diffusion-based techniques have
been developed in image processing. In this paper, we will overview the basics

at their interface under the assumption of weak mixing. The shape of the

to the SMM1 outflow cavity width for a physically reasonable set of parameters:
a ratio of wind to infall mass-flux $\simeq 4\%$, a wind speed $v_{\rm w}

entrainment efficiency consistent with laboratory experiments. The inferred
ratio of ejection to disk accretion rate, $\simeq 6-20\%$, is in agreement with

these divergences we introduce the notion of Landau diagrams in AdS. As in flat

deeper than any other previous studies. Color magnitude diagrams show a
significant population of old red giant branch (RGB) stars in all fields out to

construct the density profiles of the young, intermediate-aged, and old stellar

another up-bending (Type III) at $R\sim8.3$ kpc. Moreover, the old RGB stars
exhibit a negative radial color gradient with an up-bending at $R\sim8$~kpc,

with continuous non-Abelian symmetries are ubiquitous in physics, arising in
diverse settings ranging from hot nuclear matter to cold atomic gases and

the low energy theory is a set of coupled noisy diffusion equations.
Independence of the physics on the choice of canonical or microcanonical
ensemble is manifest in our hydrodynamic expansion, even though the ensemble
choice causes an apparent shift in quasinormal mode spectra. We use our
formalism to explain why flavor symmetry is qualitatively different from
hydrodynamics with other non-Abelian conservation laws, including angular
momentum and charge multipoles. As a significant application of our framework,
we study spin and energy diffusion in classical one-dimensional SU(2)-invariant
spin chains, including the Heisenberg model along with multiple
generalizations. We argue based on both numerical simulations and our effective
field theory framework that non-integrable spin chains on a lattice exhibit
conventional spin diffusion, in contrast to some recent predictions that
diffusion constants grow logarithmically at late times. We show that the

produced by planets. Simulations of planet-disk interaction aimed at
interpreting these observations often treat the disk thermodynamics in an
overly simplified manner, which does not properly capture the dynamics of
planet-driven density waves driving gap formation. Here we explore substructure
formation in disks using analytical calculations and hydrodynamical simulations
that include a physically-motivated prescription for radiative effects
associated with the planet-induced density waves. For the first time, our
treatment accounts not only for cooling from the disk surface, but also for
radiation transport along the disk midplane. We show that this in-plane
cooling, with a characteristic timescale typically an order of magnitude
shorter than the one due to surface cooling, plays a critical role in density
wave propagation and dissipation (we provide a simple estimate of this
timescale). We also show that viscosity, at the levels expected in
protoplanetary disks ($\alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$), has a negligible effect on
density wave dynamics. Using synthetic maps of dust continuum emission, we find
that the multiplicity and shape of the gaps produced by planets are sensitive
to the physical parameters---disk temperature, mass, and opacity---that
determine the damping of density waves. Planets orbiting at $\lesssim 20$ au
produce the most diverse variety of gap/ring structures, although significant
variation is also found for planets at $\gtrsim 50$ au. By improving the

change in the thermodynamic potentials with respect to the scattering length
and the dipole length to a generalized Tan contact parameter and a new dipolar
contact, which involves an integral of a short-distance regularized pair
distribution function. These two quantities determine the scale anomaly in the
difference between pressure and energy density and also the internal energy in
the presence of a harmonic confinement. For a weak transverse confinement,
configurations with attractive interactions appear, which lead to a
density-wave instability beyond a critical strength of the dipolar interaction.
We show that this instability essentially coincides with the onset of a roton
minimum in the excitation spectrum and may be understood in terms of a quantum
analog of the Hansen-Verlet criterion for freezing of a classical fluid.

very variable, even on time scales of a few hours. Several epochs are
characterised by P-Cyg (as well as flat-top and asymmetric) profiles in the

presence of an accretion disc wind, which is likely hot and dense. The wind's

red-shifted absorptions, taking the form of inverted P-Cyg profiles. We argue
that these profiles can be explained by the presence of infalling material at

accretion-related structure (e.g. the gas stream) in a high inclination system.

so, fitting models of planetary gaps to observed protoplanetary disk gaps can
reveal the presence of hidden planets. However, future surveys are expected to
produce an ever-increasing number of protoplanetary disks with gaps. In this
case, performing a customized fitting for each target becomes impractical owing
to the complexity of disk-planet interaction. To this end, we introduce DPNNet
(Disk Planet Neural Network), an efficient model of planetary gaps by
exploiting the power of machine learning. We train a deep neural network with a
large number of dusty disk-planet hydrodynamic simulations across a range of
planet masses, disk temperatures, disk viscosities, disk surface density
profiles, particle Stokes numbers, and dust abundances. The network can then be
deployed to extract the planet mass for a given gap morphology. In this work,
first in a series, we focus on the basic concepts of our machine learning
framework. We demonstrate its utility by applying it to the dust gaps observed
in the protoplanetary disk around HL Tau at $10$ au, $30$ au, and $80$ au. Our
network predict planet masses of $80 \, M_{\rm Earth}$, $63 \, M_{\rm Earth}$,
and $70 \, M_{\rm Earth}$, respectively, which are comparable to other studies
based on specialized simulations. We discuss the key advantages of our DPNNet

model parameters makes it unclear whether dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies
indeed have cored dark matter density profiles at the centers. In this work, we
revisit this problem using non-spherical mass models, which have the advantage
of being able to alleviate the degeneracy. Applying our mass models to the
currently available kinematic data of the eight classical dSphs, we find that
within finite uncertainties, most of these dSphs favor cusped central profiles
rather than cored ones. In particular, Draco has a cusped dark matter halo with
high probability even considering a prior bias. We also find the diversity of
the inner slopes in their dark matter halos. To clarify the origin of this
diversity, we investigate the relation between the inner dark matter density
slope and stellar-to-halo mass ratio for the sample dSphs and find this
relation is generally in agreement with the predictions from recent
$\Lambda$CDM and hydrodynamical simulations. We also find that the simulated
subhalos have anti-correlation between the dark matter density at 150 pc and
pericenter distance, which is consistent with the observed one. We estimate
their astrophysical factors for dark matter indirect searches and circular
velocity profiles, associated with huge uncertainties. To more precisely
estimate their dark matter profiles, wide-field spectroscopic surveys for the

But this is just the `tip of the iceberg': Driving more general couplings
allows one to activate the entire universal spectrum of critical exponents.

host the sequence of exponents including the subleading ones in the asymptotic

muon radiography of the Wudalianchi volcano in northeast China for imaging its
internal density structures. The muon detector used in this study is made of
plastic scintillator and silicon photomultiplier. After about one and a half
month observation for the Laoheishan volcano cone in the Wudalianchi volcano,
from September 23rd to November 10th, 2019, more than 3 million muon tracks
passing the data selection criteria are obtained. Based on the muon
observations and the high-resoluiton topography from aerial photogrammetry by
unmanned aerial vehicle, the relative density image of the Laoheishan volcano
cone is obtained. The experiment in this study is the first muon radiography of
volcano performed in China, and the results suggest the feasibility of
radiography technique based on plastic scintillator muon detector. As a new

had a bright flash of blue and ultraviolet light after exploding, followed by a
rise similar to other SNe Ia. Although SN 2019yvq displayed several other rare
characteristics such as persistent high ejecta velocity near peak brightness,
it was not especially peculiar and if the early ""excess"" emission were not
observed, it would likely be included in cosmological samples. The excess flux
can be explained by several different physical models linked to the details of
the progenitor system and explosion mechanism. Each has unique predictions for
the optically thin emission at late times. In our nebular spectra, we detect
strong [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291, 7324 and Ca NIR triplet emission,
consistent with a double-detonation explosion. We do not detect H, He, or [O I]
emission, predictions for some single-degenerate progenitor systems and violent
white dwarf mergers. The amount of swept-up H or He is <2.8 x 10^-4 and 2.4 x
10^-4 Msun, respectively. Aside from strong Ca emission, the SN 2019yvq nebular
spectrum is similar to those of typical SNe Ia with the same light-curve shape.
Comparing to double-detonation models, we find that the Ca emission is
consistent with a model with a total progenitor mass of 1.15 Msun. However, we
note that a lower progenitor mass better explains the early light-curve and
peak luminosity. The unique properties of SN 2019yvq suggest that thick
He-shell double-detonations only account for $1.1^{+2.1}_{-1.1}\%$ of the total
""normal"" SN Ia rate. SN 2019yvq is one of the best examples yet that multiple
progenitor channels appear necessary to reproduce the full diversity of
""normal"" SNe Ia.

  Our proof employs a nonlinear energy method built from the natural energy
dissipation structure of the problem. Numerous difficulties arise due to the
dissipative-conservative structure of the problem. Indeed, the dissipation
fails to be coercive over the energy, which itself is weakly coupled in the
sense that, while it provides estimates for the fluid velocity and
microstructure angular velocity, it only provides control of two of the six
components of the microinertia tensor. To overcome these problems, our method
relies on a delicate combination of two distinct tiers of energy-dissipation
estimates, together with transport-like advection-rotation estimates for the
microinertia. When combined with a quantitative rigidity result for the
microinertia, these allow us to deduce the existence of global-in-time decaying

symmetries and conserved quantities. In this paper, we investigate the
connection between memory effects, symmetries, and conserved quantities in

associated with this extra polarization (the so-called ""breathing"" mode). This
breathing mode produces a uniform expansion (or contraction) of a ring of
freely falling observers. After these breathing gravitational waves pass by the
observers' locations, there are two additional memory effects that depend on
their initial displacements and relative velocities. Neither of these
additional memory effects seems to be related to asymptotic symmetries or

training processes, and thus we can perform offline parallel-decoding and MWER
training for each subset iteratively. Experimental results show that this
proposed semi-on-the-fly method can speed up the on-the-fly method by 6 times
and result in a similar WER improvement (3.6%) over a baseline RNN-T model. The
proposed MWER training can also effectively reduce high-deletion errors (9.2%
WER-reduction) introduced by RNN-T models when EOS is added for endpointer.
Further improvement can be achieved if we use a proposed RNN-T rescoring method
to re-rank hypotheses and use external RNN-LM to perform additional rescoring.

urethane-anesthetized rat cortex have revealed scaling relations that indicate
a phase transition at a specific level of cortical firing rate variability. The
scaling relations point to critical exponents whose values differ from those of
a branching process, which has been the canonical model employed to understand
brain criticality. This suggested that a different model, with a different
phase transition, might be required to explain the data. Here we show that this
is not necessarily the case. By employing two different models belonging to the
same universality class as the branching process (mean-field directed
percolation) and treating the simulation data exactly like experimental data,
we reproduce most of the experimental results. We find that subsampling the
model and adjusting the time bin used to define avalanches (as done with
experimental data) are sufficient ingredients to change the apparent exponents
of the critical point. Moreover, experimental data is only reproduced within a
very narrow range in parameter space around the phase transition.

far, it is believed that they must be as common as they are in the Solar
System. Co-orbital systems have been widely studied, and there are several
works on stability and even on formation. However, for the size and location of
the stable regions, authors usually describe their results but do not provide a
way to find them without numerical simulations, and, in most cases, the mass
ratio value range is small. In the current work, we study the structure of
co-orbital stable regions for a wide range of mass ratio systems and built
empirical equations to describe them. It allows estimating the size and
location of co-orbital stable regions from a few system's parameters. Thousands
of massless particles were distributed in the co-orbital region of a massive
secondary body and numerically simulated for a wide range of mass ratios
($\mu$) adopting the planar circular restricted three-body problem. The results
show that the horseshoe regions upper limit is between $9.539 \times 10^{-4} <
\mu < 1.192 \times 10^{-3}$, which correspond to a minimum angular distance
from the secondary to the separatrix between $27.239^{o} $ and $27.802^{o} $.
We also found that the limit to exist stability in the co-orbital region is
about $\mu = 2.3313 \times 10^{-2}$, much smaller than the value predicted by
the linear theory. Polynomial functions to describe the stable region
parameters were found, and they represent estimates of the angular and radial
widths of the co-orbital stable regions for any system with $9.547 \times

peaks, objects, or particles, there is a large probability that spurious
signals with seemingly high significance will be found. This is known as the
look-elsewhere effect and is prevalent throughout cosmology, (astro)particle
physics, and beyond. To avoid making false claims of detection, one must
account for this effect when assigning the statistical significance of an
anomaly. This is typically accomplished by considering the trials factor, which
is generally computed numerically via potentially expensive simulations. In
this paper we develop a continuous generalization of the Bonferroni and Sidak
corrections by applying the Laplace approximation to evaluate the Bayes factor,
and in turn relating the trials factor to the prior-to-posterior volume ratio.
We use this to define a test statistic whose frequentist properties have a
simple interpretation in terms of the global $p$-value, or statistical
significance. We apply this method to various physics-based examples and show
it to work well for the full range of $p$-values, i.e. in both the asymptotic
and non-asymptotic regimes. We also show that this method naturally accounts
for other model complexities such as additional degrees of freedom,
generalizing Wilks' theorem. This provides a fast way to quantify statistical
significance in light of the look-elsewhere effect, without resorting to
expensive simulations.

Existing methods for solving this task usually focus on unsupervised learning

Here, we propose a deep attentive neural network (DANN) that classifies

importance of retraining word embedding models to maximize the vocabulary

word vectors with TFIDF outperforms character and sentence level embedding
models. We discuss imbalanced samples and overlapping categories and suggest
possible strategies for mitigation. We also determine the subject category

data, where an algorithm may measure the depth of a prescribed limited number

and dynamically to maximally reduce overall depth estimation error. This
setting is realized in daytime or nighttime depth completion for autonomous
vehicles with a programmable LiDAR. Our method uses an ensemble of predictors
to define a sampling probability over pixels. This probability is proportional
to the variance of the predictions of ensemble members, thus highlighting
pixels that are difficult to predict. By additionally proceeding in several
prediction phases, we effectively reduce redundant sampling of similar pixels.
Our ensemble-based method may be implemented using any depth-completion
learning algorithm, such as a state-of-the-art neural network, treated as a
black box. In particular, we also present a simple and effective Random
Forest-based algorithm, and similarly use its internal ensemble in our design.
We conduct experiments on the KITTI dataset, using the neural network algorithm

The accuracy of both implementations exceeds the state of the art. Compared
with a random or grid sampling pattern, our method allows a reduction by a
factor of 4-10 in the number of measurements required to attain the same

leading $1/d$ correction of Parisi's U(1) lattice gauge theory in a $d$

of the sparse SYK model show emergent random matrix statistics that for fixed

random matrix statistics is restricted to short range correlations, no more

success of deep neural networks that are able to encode high-level semantics.
Yet, while humans have the innate capability in leveraging their knowledge to
decide where to look (e.g. people pay more attention to familiar faces such as
celebrities), saliency prediction models have only been trained with large
eye-tracking datasets. This work proposes to bridge this gap by explicitly
incorporating external knowledge for saliency models as humans do. We develop
networks that learn to highlight regions by incorporating prior knowledge of
semantic relationships, be it general or domain-specific, depending on the task
of interest. At the core of the method is a new Graph Semantic Saliency Network
(GraSSNet) that constructs a graph that encodes semantic relationships learned
from external knowledge. A Spatial Graph Attention Network is then developed to
update saliency features based on the learned graph. Experiments show that the
proposed model learns to predict saliency from the external knowledge and
outperforms the state-of-the-art on four saliency benchmarks.

efficiently by sharing information about personal health data between the
healthcare providers for medical consultation. Furthermore, retaining the
confidentiality of data and patients' identity is a another challenging task.
This paper presents the concept of an access control-based (AC) privacy
preservation model for the mutual authentication of users and data owners in
the proposed digital system. The proposed model offers a high-security
guarantee and high efficiency. The proposed digital system consists of four
different entities, user, data owner, cloud server, and key generation center
(KGC). This approach makes the system more robust and highly secure, which has
been verified with multiple scenarios. Besides, the proposed model consisted of
the setup phase, key generation phase, encryption phase, validation phase,
access control phase, and data sharing phase. The setup phases are run by the
data owner, which takes input as a security parameter and generates the system
master key and security parameter. Then, in the key generation phase, the
private key is generated by KGC and is stored in the cloud server. After that,
the generated private key is encrypted. Then, the session key is generated by
KGC and granted to the user and cloud server for storing, and then, the results
are verified in the validation phase using validation messages. Finally, the
data is shared with the user and decrypted at the user-end. The proposed model
outperforms other methods with a maximal genuine data rate of 0.91.

to strategies in which feedback consists of a combination of P and I terms. The
latter quantum PI feedback constitutes the analog of the widely used

the resulting formalism to two canonical quantum feedback control problems,

stabilization of a harmonic oscillator under thermal noise under conditions of
arbitrary measurement efficiency. These two problems allow analysis of the
relative benefits of P, I, and PI feedback control. We find that for the

Accurately modelling the chromosphere is important, even if the transition
region and corona are the areas of interest, due to the flow of energy, mass,
and radiation through the interconnected layers. We present a solar flare
arcade model, that aims to bridge the gap between 1D and 3D modelling. Our
approach is limited to the synthesis of optically thin emission. Using observed
active region loop structures in a 3D domain we graft simulated 1D flare
atmospheres onto each loop, synthesise the emission and then project that
emission onto to the 2D observational plane. Emission from SDO/AIA, GOES/XRS,
and IRIS/SG Fe XXI 1354.1A was forward modelled. We analyse the temperatures,
durations, mass flows, and line widths associated with the flare, finding
qualitative agreement but certain quantitative differences. Compared to
observations, the Doppler shifts are of similar magnitude but decay too
quickly. They are not as ordered, containing a larger amount of scatter
compared to observations. The duration of gradual phase emission from GOES and
AIA emission is also too short. Fe XXI lines are broadened, but not
sufficiently. These findings suggest that additional physics is required in our
model. The arcade model that we show here as a proof-of-concept can be extended
to investigate other lines and global aspects of solar flares, providing a
means to better test the coronal response to models of flare energy injection.

stellar masses of $M_\ast<2\times10^{11}M_\odot$. These stellar mass limits are

are consistent with those predicted for the UV stellar populations of
$z\simeq6$ host galaxies, but likely in the presence of significant dust
($\langle A_{\mathrm{UV}}\rangle\simeq 2.6$ mag). We also detect a total of up
to 9 potential $z\simeq6$ quasar companion galaxies surrounding five of the six
quasars, separated from the quasars by 1.4''-3.2'', or 8.4-19.4 kpc, which may

absolute magnitudes of -22.1 to -19.9 mag, and UV spectral slopes $\beta$ of
-2.0 to -0.2, consistent with luminous star-forming galaxies at $z\simeq6$.
These results suggest that the quasars are in dense environments typical of
luminous $z\simeq6$ galaxies. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that

evaluation of methods on various datasets. However, in order to further advance
in the field, we claim that robust visual localization algorithms should be
evaluated on multiple datasets covering a broad domain variety. To facilitate
this, we introduce kapture, a new, flexible, unified data format and toolbox
for visual localization and structure-from-motion (SFM). It enables easy usage
of different datasets as well as efficient and reusable data processing. To
demonstrate this, we present a versatile pipeline for visual localization that
facilitates the use of different local and global features, 3D data (e.g. depth
maps), non-vision sensor data (e.g. IMU, GPS, WiFi), and various processing
algorithms. Using multiple configurations of the pipeline, we show the great
versatility of kapture in our experiments. Furthermore, we evaluate our methods
on eight public datasets where they rank top on all and first on many of them.
To foster future research, we release code, models, and all datasets used in
this paper in the kapture format open source under a permissive BSD license.

mathematical model describing the functional dependence of the dependent

fitting algorithms, extract the parameters used in the modeling. Particularly
challenging are real systems, characterized by several additional influencing
factors related to specific components, like electronics or optical parts. In
such cases, to make the model reproduce the data, empirically determined terms
are built-in the models to compensate for the impossibility of modeling things
that are, by construction, impossible to model. A new approach to solve this
issue is to use neural networks, particularly feed-forward architectures with a
sufficient number of hidden layers and an appropriate number of output neurons,
each responsible for predicting the desired variables. Unfortunately,
feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) usually perform less efficiently when
applied to multi-dimensional regression problems, that is when they are
required to predict simultaneously multiple variables that depend from the
input dataset in fundamentally different ways. To address this problem, we
propose multi-task learning (MTL) architectures. These are characterized by
multiple branches of task-specific layers, which have as input the output of a
common set of layers. To demonstrate the power of this approach for
multi-dimensional regression, the method is applied to luminescence sensing.
Here the MTL architecture allows predicting multiple parameters, the oxygen

then analyze 12 methods coming from 4 commonly used classes of line chart

subsampling. The results show that while no method is ideal for all situations,
certain methods, such as Gaussian filters and Topology-based subsampling,
perform well in general. Other methods, such as low-pass cutoff filters and
Douglas-Peucker subsampling, perform well for specific visual analytics tasks.

expressions for understanding why a TM model makes a specific prediction (local
interpretability). Additionally, the expressions capture the most important
features of the model overall (global interpretability). We further introduce
expressions for measuring the importance of feature value ranges for continuous

pair-wise matchers that rely on metric learning, e.g., Siamese networks for
person ReID, the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) objective should consist
in aligning pair-wise dissimilarity between domains, rather than aligning
feature representations. Moreover, dissimilarity representations are more
suitable for designing open-set ReID systems, where identities differ in the
source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel
Dissimilarity-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (D-MMD) loss for aligning
pair-wise distances that can be optimized via gradient descent. From a person
ReID perspective, the evaluation of D-MMD loss is straightforward since the
tracklet information allows to label a distance vector as being either
within-class or between-class. This allows approximating the underlying
distribution of target pair-wise distances for D-MMD loss optimization, and
accordingly align source and target distance distributions. Empirical results
with three challenging benchmark datasets show that the proposed D-MMD loss
decreases as source and domain distributions become more similar. Extensive
experimental evaluation also indicates that UDA methods that rely on the D-MMD
loss can significantly outperform baseline and state-of-the-art UDA methods for
person ReID without the common requirement for data augmentation and/or complex
networks.

increasing attention from practitioners and researchers. For instance,
organizations such as the Python Software Foundation and the OpenStack

top positions in the communities. Although the general underrepresentation of
women (a.k.a. horizontal segregation) in open source communities has been
explored in a number of research studies, little is known about the vertical
segregation in open source communities -- which occurs when there are fewer
women in high-level positions. To address this research gap, in this paper we
present the results of a mixed-methods study on gender diversity and work
practices of core developers contributing to open-source communities. In the
first study, we used mining-software repositories procedures to identify the
core developers of 711 open source projects, in order to understand how common
are women core developers in open source communities and characterize their
work practices. In the second study, we surveyed the women core developers we
identified in the first study to collect their perceptions of gender diversity
and gender bias they might have observed while contributing to open source
systems. Our findings show that open source communities present both horizontal
and vertical segregation (only 2.3% of the core developers are women).
Nevertheless, differently from previous studies, most of the women core
developers (65.7%) report never having experienced gender discrimination when
contributing to an open source project. Finally, we did not note substantial
differences between the work practices among women and men core developers. We
reflect on these findings and present some ideas that might increase the
participation of women in open source communities.

efforts to protect technological systems in space and on the ground.
Particularly in the thermosphere, the subsequent extreme magnetic storms can
pose serious threats to low-Earth orbit (LEO) spacecraft by intensifying errors
in orbit predictions. Extreme magnetic storms (minimum Dst $\leq$ --250 nT) are
extremely rare: only 7 events occurred during the era of spacecraft with
high-level accelerometers such as CHAMP (CHAllenge Mini-satellite Payload) and
GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate experiment), and none with minimum Dst
$\leq$ --500 nT, here termed magnetic superstorms. Therefore, current knowledge
of thermospheric mass density response to superstorms is very limited. Thus, in
order to advance this knowledge, four known magnetic superstorms in history,
i.e., events occurring before CHAMP's and GRACE's commission times, with
complete datasets, are used to empirically estimate density enhancements and
subsequent orbital drag. The November 2003 magnetic storm (minimum Dst = --422
nT), the most extreme event observed by both satellites, is used as the
benchmark event. Results show that, as expected, orbital degradation is more
severe for the most intense storms. Additionally, results clearly point out
that the time duration of the storm is strongly associated with storm-time
orbital drag effects, being as important as or even more important than storm
intensity itself. The most extreme storm-time decays during CHAMP/GRACE-like
sample satellite orbits estimated for the March 1989 magnetic superstorm show
that long-lasting superstorms can have highly detrimental consequences for the
orbital dynamics of satellites in LEO.

multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. To extend DNN's superior inference
capabilities to energy constrained devices, architectures and circuits that
minimize energy-per-MAC must be developed. In this respect, analog delay-based
MAC is advantageous due to reasons both extrinsic and intrinsic to the MAC
implementation - (1) lower fixed-point precision requirement for a DNN's
evaluation, (2) better dynamic range than charge-based accumulation, for
smaller technology nodes, and (3) simpler analog-digital interfacing.
Implementing DNNs using delay-based MAC requires mixed-signal delay multipliers
that accept digitally stored weights and analog voltages as arguments. To this
end, a novel, linearly tune-able delay-cell is proposed, wherein, the delay is
realized using an inverted MOS capacitor's (C*) steady discharge from a
linearly input-voltage dependent initial charge. The cell is analytically
modeled, constraints for its functional validity are determined, and
jitter-models are developed. Multiple cells with scaled delays, corresponding
to each bit of the digital argument, must be cascaded to form the multiplier.
To realize such bit-wise delay-scaling of the cells, a biasing circuit is
proposed that generates sub-threshold gate-voltages to scale C*'s discharging
rate, and thus area-expensive transistor width-scaling is avoided. For 130nm
CMOS technology, the theoretical constraints and limits on jitter are used to
find the optimal design-point and quantify the jitter versus
bits-per-multiplier trade-off. Schematic-level simulations show a worst-case
energy-consumption close to the state-of-art, and thus, feasibility of the

framework consists of removable modular function blocks ensuring its
applicability to different MH-MR scenarios. A new workload transition function
block ensures smooth transition without the workload change having adverse

Yet immigrants currently lack access to personalized information that would
help them identify optimal destinations. Instead, they often rely on
availability heuristics, which can lead to the selection of sub-optimal landing
locations, lower earnings, elevated outmigration rates, and concentration in
the most well-known locations. To address this issue and counteract the effects

provides personalized location recommendations that reflect immigrants'

Simulations across various scenarios suggest that providing location
recommendations to incoming economic immigrants can increase their initial
earnings and lead to a mild shift away from the most populous landing
destinations. Our approach can be implemented within existing institutional
structures at minimal cost, and offers governments an opportunity to harness

bistable threshold on large balls. Moreover, solutions starting from
sufficiently large initial data converge to this steady state as $t \to
\infty$. For compactly supported initial data, the asymptotic speed of this
propagation agrees with the unique speed $c_*$ of the one-dimensional traveling
wave. We furthermore construct a traveling wave in the half-plane of speed
$c_*$.
  In parallel, we show analogous results for ignition reactions under both
Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions. Using our ignition construction, we
obtain stronger results for monostable reactions with the same boundary
conditions. For such reactions, we show in general that there is a unique
nonzero bounded steady state. Furthermore, monostable reactions exhibit the
hair-trigger effect: every solution with nontrivial initial data converges to
this steady state as $t \to \infty$. Given compactly supported initial data,
this disturbance propagates at a speed $c_*$ equal to the minimal speed of
one-dimensional traveling waves. We also construct monostable traveling waves
in the Dirichlet or Robin half-plane with any speed $c \geq c_*$.

difficult to establish when recording from large populations in behaving
organisms. Many previous approaches have attempted to estimate functional
connectivity between neurons using statistical modeling of observational data,
but these approaches rely heavily on parametric assumptions and are purely
correlational. Recently, however, holographic photostimulation techniques have
made it possible to precisely target selected ensembles of neurons, offering
the possibility of establishing direct causal links. Here, we propose a method
based on noisy group testing that drastically increases the efficiency of this
process in sparse networks. By stimulating small ensembles of neurons, we show
that it is possible to recover binarized network connectivity with a number of
tests that grows only logarithmically with population size under minimal
statistical assumptions. Moreover, we prove that our approach, which reduces to
an efficiently solvable convex optimization problem, can be related to
Variational Bayesian inference on the binary connection weights, and we derive
rigorous bounds on the posterior marginals. This allows us to extend our method
to the streaming setting, where continuously updated posteriors allow for
optional stopping, and we demonstrate the feasibility of inferring connectivity
for networks of up to tens of thousands of neurons online. Finally, we show how
our work can be theoretically linked to compressed sensing approaches, and
compare results for connectivity inference in different settings.

propose novel closed-form expressions for the EC in a two-user NOMA network and
show that in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, the 'strong' NOMA
user, referred to as U2, has a limited EC, assuming the same delay constraint
as the 'weak' user, referred to as U1. We demonstrate that for the weak userU1,
OMA and NOMA have comparable performance at low transmit SNRs, while NOMA
outperforms OMA in terms of EC at high SNRs. On the other hand, for the strong
user U2, NOMA achieves higher EC than OMA at small SNRs, while OMA becomes more
beneficial at high SNRs. Furthermore, we show that at high transmit SNRs,
irrespective of whether the application is delay tolerant, or not, the
performance gains of NOMA over OMA for U1, and OMA over NOMA for U2 remain
unchanged. When the delay QoS of one user is fixed, the performance gap between
NOMA and OMA in terms of total EC increases with decreasing statistical delay
QoS constraints for the other user. Next, by introducing pairing, we show that
NOMA with user-pairing outperforms OMA, in terms of total uplink EC. The best
pairing strategies are given in the cases of four and six users NOMA, raising

transportation and provide stationary energy storage for electrical grids, and
as such their development has garnered much attention. However, their
deployment is still relatively limited, and their broader adoption will depend
on their potential for cost reduction and performance improvement.
Understanding this potential can inform critical climate change mitigation
strategies, including public policies and technology development efforts.
However, many existing models of past cost decline, which often serve as
starting points for forecasting models, rely on limited data series and
measures of technological progress. Here we systematically collect, harmonize,
and combine various data series of price, market size, research and
development, and performance of lithium-ion technologies. We then develop
representative series for these measures and employ performance curve models to
estimate improvement rates. We also develop a method to incorporate additional
performance characteristics into these models, including energy density and
specific energy performance metrics. When energy density is incorporated into
the definition of service provided by a lithium-ion cell, estimated
technological improvement rates increase considerably, suggesting that
previously reported improvement rates might underestimate the rate of
lithium-ion technologies' change. Moreover, our estimates suggest the degree to
which lithium-ion technologies' price decline might have been limited by
performance requirements other than cost per energy capacity. These rates also
suggest that battery technologies developed for stationary applications, where
restrictions on volume and mass are relaxed, might achieve faster cost
declines, though engineering-based mechanistic cost modeling is required to
further characterize this potential.

provides a fine spatial resolution (30 m), was used for the estimation. The
results obtained from the METRIC model were compared with ground-based
measurements from an independent Eddy-Covariance (EC) station. Besides ET, the
estimated surface temperatures (Ts) from the remote sensing model were also
compared with ground-based measurements for model validation. The results
obtained from the remote sensing model were close to the ground-based
measurements which establish the accuracy of the model. Root mean square error
(RMSE) for hourly and daily ET was obtained as 0.06 mm/hr and 1.24 mm/day while
mean bias error (MBE) for hourly and daily ET was observed as 0.03 mm/hr and
0.29 mm/day, respectively. Further, we analyzed the variations of ET with
elevation for six different months and found that ET was inversely related to
elevation, in general, over the regions of Nepal. This was established as an
effect of Ts and vegetation distribution over different elevations. To the best
of our knowledge, our study is a first that has investigated ET estimation over
a topographically diverse region of Nepal with fine spatial resolution afforded
by Landsat 8. Such large-scale ET estimation in Nepal has several applications.
This can be leveraged for agricultural planning and forecasting in a country

probability is small and its accurate estimation is challenging. To tackle this
difficulty, we blend theoretical results from large deviation theory (LDT) with
numerical tools from PDE-constrained optimization. Our methods first compute
parameters that minimize the LDT-rate function over the set of parameters
leading to extreme events, using adjoint methods to compute the gradient of
this rate function. The minimizers give information about the mechanism of the
extreme events as well as estimates of their probability. We then propose a
series of methods to refine these estimates, either via importance sampling or
geometric approximation of the extreme event sets. Results are formulated for
general parameter distributions and detailed expressions are provided when
Gaussian distributions. We give theoretical and numerical arguments showing
that the performance of our methods is insensitive to the extremeness of the
events we are interested in. We illustrate the application of our approach to
quantify the probability of extreme tsunami events on shore. Tsunamis are
typically caused by a sudden, unpredictable change of the ocean floor elevation
during an earthquake. We model this change as a random process, which takes
into account the underlying physics. We use the one-dimensional shallow water

Specifically, we focus on a setting with $n$ heterogeneous items, where each

one-sided markets, e.g. where a seller owns multiple heterogeneous items but
also is the mechanism designer, are well-understood. In addition,
single-dimensional settings in two-sided markets, e.g. where a buyer and seller

two-sided markets, however, encapsulate the major challenges of both lines of
work: optimizing the sale of heterogeneous items, ensuring
incentive-compatibility among both sides of the market, and enforcing budget

is the minimum probability over all items that a buyer's value for the item

provides an unconditional $O(\log n)$-approximation to the second-best gains

losing another $O(\log n)$-factor en-route.

Brou\'e proved that the ratio of the codegrees of $\psi$ and $I(\psi)$ is a

interplay between strong magnetic fields and supersonic (turbulent) velocity

causing it too to fluctuate. Using numerical simulations, we explore the nature
of such magnetic field fluctuations, $\vec{\delta B}$, over a wide range of
turbulent Mach numbers, $\mathcal{M} = 2 - 20$ (i.e., from weak to strong
compressibility), and Alfv\'en Mach numbers, $\mathcal{M}_{\text{A}0} = 0.1 -
100$ (i.e., from strong to weak magnetic mean fields, $B_0$). We derive a
compressible quasi-static fluctuation model from the magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) equations and show that velocity gradients parallel to the mean magnetic
field give rise to compressible modes in sub-Alfv\'enic flows, which prevents
the flow from becoming two-dimensional, as is the case in incompressible MHD
turbulence. We then generalise an analytical model for the magnitude of the
magnetic fluctuations to include $\mathcal{M}$, and find $|\vec{\delta B}| =
\delta B = c_s\sqrt{\pi\rho_0}\mathcal{M}\mathcal{M}_{\text{A}0}$, where $c_s$
is the sound speed and $\rho_0$ is the mean density of gas. This new relation
fits well in the strong $B$-field regime. We go on to study the anisotropy
between the perpendicular ($ B_{\perp}$) and parallel ($ B_{\parallel}$)
fluctuations and the mean-normalised fluctuations, which we find follow
universal scaling relations, invariant of $\mathcal{M}$. We provide a detailed
analysis of the morphology for the $\delta B_{\perp}$ and $\delta
B_{\parallel}$ probability density functions and find that eddies aligned with
$B_0$ cause parallel fluctuations that reduce $B_{\parallel}$ in the most
anisotropic simulations. We discuss broadly the implications of our fluctuation

by PSR J2021$+$3651. In the model, the spin-down power of the pulsar is
transferred to high-energy particles and magnetic field in the nebula. As the
particles with an energy distribution of either a broken power-law or a
power-law continually injected into the nebula, the multiband nonthermal
emission is produced via synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering.
The spectral energy distribution of the nebula from the model with the
reasonable parameters is generally consistent with the detected radio, X-ray
and TeV $\gamma$-ray fluxes. Our study supports that the PWN has the ability to
produce the TeV $\gamma$-rays of eHWC J2019+368, and the most energetic
particles in the nebula have energies up to about $0.4$ PeV.

Accepted by IEEE TWC",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted
Guassian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel (WTC), and focus
on enhancing its secrecy rate. Due to MIMO setting, all the existing solutions
for enhancing the secrecy rate over multiple-input single-output WTC completely
fall to this work. Furthermore, all the existing studies are simply based on an
ideal assumption that full channel state information (CSI) of eavesdropper (Ev)
is available. Therefore, we propose numerical solutions to enhance the secrecy
rate of this channel under both full and no Ev's CSI cases. For the full CSI
case, we propose a barrier method and one-by-one (OBO) optimization combined
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit
covariance R at transmitter (Tx) and phase shift coefficient Q at IRS. For the
case of no Ev's CSI, we develop an artificial noise (AN) aided joint
transmission scheme to enhance the secrecy rate. In this scheme, a bisection
search (BS) and OBO optimization combined AO algorithm is proposed to jointly
optimize R and Q. Such scheme is also applied to enhance the secrecy rate under
a special scenario in which the direct link between Tx and receiver/Ev is
blocked due to obstacles. In particular, we propose a BS and
minorization-maximization (MM) combined AO algorithm with slightly faster
convergence to optimize R and Q for this scenario. Simulation results have
validated the monotonic convergence of the proposed algorithms, and it is shown
that the proposed algorithms for the IRS-assisted design achieve significantly
larger secrecy rate than the other benchmark schemes under full CSI. When Ev's
CSI is unknown, the secrecy performance of this channel also can be enhanced by
the proposed AN aided scheme, and there is a trade-off between increasing the
quality of service at Rx and enhancing the secrecy rate.

(BSs), termed as `Massive MIMO', has been a key enabler for meeting the
ever-increasing capacity requirement for 5G communication systems and beyond.
Despite their promising performance, fully-digital massive MIMO systems require
a vast amount of hardware components including radio frequency chains, power
amplifiers, digital-to-analog converters (DACs), etc., resulting in a huge
increase in terms of the total power consumption and hardware costs for
cellular BSs. Towards both spectrally-efficient and energy-efficient massive
MIMO deployment, a number of hardware limited architectures have been proposed,
including hybrid analog-digital structures, constant-envelope transmission, and
use of low-resolution DACs. In this paper, we overview the recent interest in
improving the error-rate performance of massive MIMO systems deployed with
1-bit DACs through precoding at the symbol level. This line of research goes
beyond traditional interference suppression or cancellation techniques by
managing interference on a symbol-by-symbol basis. This provides unique
opportunities for interference-aware precoding tailored for practical massive
MIMO systems. Firstly, we characterize constructive interference (CI) and
elaborate on how CI can benefit the 1-bit signal design by exploiting the
traditionally undesired multi-user interference as well as the interference
from imperfect hardware components. Subsequently, we overview several solutions
for 1-bit signal design to illustrate the gains achievable by exploiting CI.
Finally, we identify some challenges and future research directions for 1-bit
massive MIMO systems that are yet to be explored.

time-resolved unsteady surface pressure measurements are synchronized with
non-time-resolved planar PIV measurements acquired at 15 Hz in a Mach 0.6
cavity flow. Leveraging the spectral linear stochastic estimation (LSE) method
of Tinney et al. (2006), we first estimate the cross correlations between the
velocity field and the unsteady pressure sensors via sequential time shifts,
followed by a Fast Fourier transform to obtain the pressure-velocity cross
spectral density matrix. This leads to a linear multiple-input /
multiple-output (MIMO) model that determines the optimal transfer functions
between the input cavity wall pressure and the output velocity field. Two
variants of SAMMs are developed and applied. The first, termed ""SAMM-SPOD"",
combines the MIMO model with the SPOD algorithm of Towne et al. (2018). The
second, called ""SAMM-RR'', adds independent sources and uses a sorted
eigendecomposition of the input pressure cross-spectral matrix to enable an
efficient reduced-rank eigendecomposition of the velocity cross-spectral
matrix. In both cases, the resulting rank-1 POD eigenvalues associated with the
Rossiter frequencies exhibit very good agreement with those obtained using
independent time-resolved PIV measurements. The results demonstrate that SAMMs
provide a methodology to perform space-time POD without requiring a high-speed

permissioned blockchains garner particular attention thanks to their improved
scalability and diverse needs from different organizations. One representative
example of permissioned blockchain is Hyperledger Fabric (""Fabric""). Due to its

address is the tradeoff in the number of peers: a too large number will degrade
scalability while a too small number will make the network vulnerable to faulty
nodes. This optimization issue gets especially challenging in V2X networks due
to mobility of nodes: a transaction must be executed and the associated block
must be committed before the vehicle leaves a network. To this end, this paper
proposes an optimal peers selection mechanism based on reinforcement learning

to learn to automatically trade-off between the instantaneous linear estimation

(5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless communication systems, especially for ultra
dense networks. This paper proposes an end-to-end (e2e) power consumption model
and studies the energy efficiency for a heterogeneous B5G cellular architecture
that separates the indoor and outdoor communication scenarios in ultra dense
networks. In this work, massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
technologies at conventional sub-6 GHz frequencies are used for long-distance
outdoor communications. Light-Fidelity (LiFi) and millimeter wave (mmWave)
technologies are deployed to provide a high data rate service to indoor users.
Whereas, in the referenced nonseparated system, the indoor users communicate
with the outdoor massive MIMO macro base station directly. The performance of
these two systems are evaluated and compared in terms of the total power
consumption and energy efficiency. The results show that the network
architecture which separates indoor and outdoor communication can support a
higher data rate transmission for less energy consumption, compared to
non-separate communication scenario. In addition, the results show that
deploying LiFi and mmWave IAPs can enable users to transmit at a higher data
rate and further improve the EE.

  directly reveals information about the internal geometry","36 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In two phase materials, each phase having a non-local response in time, it
has been found that for some driving fields the response somehow untangles at
specific times, and allows one to directly infer useful information about the
geometry of the material, such as the volume fractions of the phases. Motivated
by this, and to obtain an algorithm for designing appropriate driving fields,
we find approximate, measure independent, linear relations between the values
that Markov functions take at a given set of possibly complex points, not
belonging to the interval [-1,1] where the measure is supported. The problem is
reduced to simply one of polynomial approximation of a given function on the
interval [-1,1] and to simplify the analysis Chebyshev approximation is used.
This allows one to obtain explicit estimates of the error of the approximation,
in terms of the number of points and the minimum distance of the points to the
interval [-1,1]. Assuming this minimum distance is bounded below by a number
greater than 1/2, the error converges exponentially to zero as the number of
points is increased. Approximate linear relations are also obtained that
incorporate a set of moments of the measure. In the context of the motivating
problem, the analysis also yields bounds on the response at any particular time
for any driving field, and allows one to estimate the response at a given
frequency using an appropriately designed driving field that effectively is
turned on only for a fixed interval of time. The approximation extends directly
to Markov-type functions with a positive semidefinite operator valued measure,
and this has applications to determining the shape of an inclusion in a body
from boundary flux measurements at a specific time, when the time-dependent
boundary potentials are suitably tailored.

investigated in a wireless network containing N correlated channels, where

requirement either stays idle or selects a segment comprising C (C < N)
contiguous channels to sense. Then, the vacant channels in the selected segment
will be aggregated for satisfying the user requirement. The user receives a
binary feedback signal indicating whether the transmission is successful or not
(i.e., ACK signal) after each transmission, and makes next decision based on
the sensing channel states. Here, we aim to find a policy that can maximize the
number of successful transmissions without interrupting the primary users
(PUs). The problem can be considered as a partially observable Markov decision

implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to address the challenge of unknown system

poor spatial information in audio signals. To solve this problem, this paper
presents a self-supervised training method using 360{\deg} images and

multichannel audio signals, our method trains deep neural networks (DNNs) to
distinguish multiple sound source objects. Our system for localizing sound

DNN is trained to localize sound source candidates within an input image. The
audio DNN verifies whether each candidate actually produces sound or not. These

high energy regime where quantum gravity is expected to play a vital role. Such
models not only subsume the ultraviolet nature of gravity but also exhibit
promising prospects in resolving issues like dark matter and dark energy, which
cannot be adequately addressed within the framework of GR. The Einstein-Maxwell
dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, which is central to this work is one such string
inspired model arising in the low energy effective action of the heterotic
string theory with interesting implications in inflationary cosmology and in
the late time acceleration of the universe. It is therefore important to survey
the role of such a theory in explaining astrophysical observations, e.g. the
continuum spectrum of black holes which is expected to hold a wealth of
information regarding the background metric. The Kerr-Sen spacetime corresponds
to the exact, stationary, and axisymmetric black hole solution in EMDA gravity,
possessing dilatonic charge and angular momentum originating from the axionic
field. In this work, we compute the theoretical spectrum from the accretion
disk around quasars in the Kerr-Sen background assuming the thin accretion disk
model due to Novikov \& Thorne. This is then used to evaluate the theoretical
estimates of optical luminosity for a sample of eighty Palomar-Green quasars
which are subsequently compared with the available observations. Our results
based on $\chi^2$ analysis indicate that the dilaton parameter $r_2\sim 0.2$ is
favored by optical observations of quasars which is further corroborated by
other error estimators e.g., the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, the index of
agreement, and their modified versions. We further report that strong dilaton

  Honeypots",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lateral movement of advanced persistent threats has posed a severe security
challenge. Due to the stealthy and persistent nature of the lateral movement,
defenders need to consider time and spatial locations holistically to discover
latent attack paths across a large time-scale and achieve long-term security
for the target assets. In this work, we propose a time-expanded random network
to model the stochastic service links in the user-host enterprise network and
the adversarial lateral movement. We design cognitive honeypots at idle
production nodes and disguise honey links as service links to detect and deter
the adversarial lateral movement. The location of the honeypot changes randomly
at different times and increases the honeypots' stealthiness. Since the
defender does not know whether, when, and where the initial intrusion and the
lateral movement occur, the honeypot policy aims to reduce the target assets'
Long-Term Vulnerability (LTV) for proactive and persistent protection. We
further characterize three tradeoffs, i.e., the probability of interference,
the stealthiness level, and the roaming cost. To counter the curse of multiple
attack paths, we propose an iterative algorithm and approximate the LTV with
the union bound for computationally efficient deployment of cognitive
honeypots. The results of the vulnerability analysis illustrate the bounds,
trends, and a residue of LTV when the adversarial lateral movement has infinite
duration. Besides honeypot policies, we obtain a critical threshold of
compromisability to guide the design and modification of the current system
parameters for a higher level of long-term security. We show that the target
node can achieve zero vulnerability under infinite stages of lateral movement
if the probability of movement deterrence is not less than the threshold.

optimization methods in machine learning. Compared with small batch training,
SGD with large batch training can better utilize the computational power of

rounds in distributed training. Hence, SGD with large batch training has
attracted more and more attention. However, existing empirical results show
that large batch training typically leads to a drop of generalization accuracy.
As a result, large batch training has also become a challenging topic. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, called stochastic normalized gradient descent
with momentum (SNGM), for large batch training. We theoretically prove that
compared to momentum SGD (MSGD) which is one of the most widely used variants
of SGD, SNGM can adopt a larger batch size to converge to the

used for optical videos and SAR temporal images cannot be directly utilized for

galaxies that show signs of rapid cessation or recent rejuvenation of star
formation. A recent observation shows that about half of QPSBs have large
amounts of cold gas. This molecular CO sample is, however, too small and is not
without limitations. Our work aims to verify previous results by applying a new
method to study a uniformly selected sample, more than 10 times larger. In
particular, we present detailed analysis of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios of
face-on QPSBs at $z = 0.02 - 0.15$ and with $M_\star =
10^{10}-10^{11}\,M_\odot$. We interpret the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios by
applying our recent gas mass calibration, which is based on non-PSB galaxies
but predicts gas masses that are consistent with CO observations of $\sim 100$
PSBs. We estimate the molecular gas by either using PSBs with well-measured
H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios or by measuring them from stacked spectra. Our
analysis reveals that QPSBs have a wide range of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios and
molecular gas fractions that overlap with the typical gas fractions of
star-forming or quiescent galaxies: H$\alpha$/H$\beta \approx 3-8$ and
$f_\mathrm{H_2} \approx 1\%-20\%$ with median $f_\mathrm{H_2} \approx 4\%-6\%$,
which correspond to $M_\mathrm{H_2} \approx (1-3) \times 10^{9} \,M_\odot$. Our
results indicate that large reservoirs of cold gas are still present in
significant numbers of QPSBs, and that they arguably were not removed or

improved, particularly in large-scale scenes, due to the limited acquisition of
HS images. Alternatively, we super-resolve MS images in the spectral domain by
the means of partially overlapped HS images, yielding a novel and promising
topic: spectral superresolution (SSR) of MS imagery. This is challenging and
less investigated task due to its high ill-posedness in inverse imaging. To
this end, we develop a simple but effective method, called joint sparse and
low-rank learning (J-SLoL), to spectrally enhance MS images by jointly learning
low-rank HS-MS dictionary pairs from overlapped regions. J-SLoL infers and
recovers the unknown hyperspectral signals over a larger coverage by sparse
coding on the learned dictionary pair. Furthermore, we validate the SSR
performance on three HS-MS datasets (two for classification and one for
unmixing) in terms of reconstruction, classification, and unmixing by comparing
with several existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing the effectiveness and

imagery (HSI) often suffers from poor spatial resolution, thus hampering many
applications of the imagery. Hyperspectral super-resolution refers to fusing
HSI and MSI to generate an image with both high spatial and high spectral
resolutions. Recently, several new methods have been proposed to solve this
fusion problem, and most of these methods assume that the prior information of
the Point Spread Function (PSF) and Spectral Response Function (SRF) are known.
However, in practice, this information is often limited or unavailable. In this
work, an unsupervised deep learning-based fusion method - HyCoNet - that can
solve the problems in HSI-MSI fusion without the prior PSF and SRF information
is proposed. HyCoNet consists of three coupled autoencoder nets in which the
HSI and MSI are unmixed into endmembers and abundances based on the linear
unmixing model. Two special convolutional layers are designed to act as a
bridge that coordinates with the three autoencoder nets, and the PSF and SRF
parameters are learned adaptively in the two convolution layers during the
training process. Furthermore, driven by the joint loss function, the proposed
method is straightforward and easily implemented in an end-to-end training
manner. The experiments performed in the study demonstrate that the proposed
method performs well and produces robust results for different datasets and
arbitrary PSFs and SRFs.

Standard Model heavy particles like $W,~Z$ bosons and top quark from gluon
initiated jets. Zest exhibits properties such as boost invariance, stability
against global color exchange among partons, and inclusion or exclusion of a
few soft particles in the jet. We also observe that for gluon jets, zest
distribution is mostly insensitive to the jet mass. These properties make zest
a suitable candidate for vetoing gluon jets at the colliders. Zest when used in
conjunction with other substructure observables that are uncorrelated to it can
further improve gluon jet veto. We generalize zest and show that in one limit
it is synonymous to particle multiplicity and in the other limit, it projects
only the leading particle. Optimization on the parameter of generalized zest
further improves the discrimination ability of the observable. We find that for
the top quark-initiated jets, the discrimination provided by generalized zest
is in close comparison with a class of machine learning-based top taggers. We

to obtain, and hence approximate models may be employed for control design.
Most existing results provide conditions under which the stability of the
approximate model in closed-loop carries over to the stability of the (unknown)
exact model but only in a practical sense, i.e. the trajectories of the
closed-loop system are ensured to converge to a bounded region whose size can
be made as small as desired by limiting the maximum sampling period. In
addition, some very stringent conditions exist for the exact model to exhibit
exactly the same type of asymptotic stability as the approximate model. In this
context, our main contribution consists in providing less stringent conditions
by considering semiglobal exponential input-to-state stability (SE-ISS), where
the inputs can successfully represent state-measurement and actuation errors.
These conditions are based on establishing SE-ISS for an adequate approximate
model and are applicable both under uniform and nonuniform sampling. As a
second contribution, we show that explicit Runge-Kutta models satisfy our
conditions and can hence be employed. An example of control design for
stabilization based on approximate discrete-time models is also given.

submerged buoy with three tethers. A frequency-domain model is derived by using
linear potential theory. Numerical simulations and parametric examinations are
designed in order to evaluate the distance influence among buoys with a
pre-defined arrangement on the total power output of the array, based on the
irregular wave models. With regard to validating the best-found layout, we
perform a landscape analysis experiment using a grid search technique. These
experiments are evaluated in four real wave scenarios from south of Australia.
Experiments show that the distance between WECs and also the relative angle of
the layout to significant wave direction plays a pivotal role to harness more
power from the incident waves. Furthermore, we observe that increasing the
number of WEC in the layout leads to a rise in the optimal distance among WECs.

carrying false information. To address fake news, several studies have been
conducted for detecting fake news by using SNS-extracted features. In this
study, we attempt to use temporal features generated from SNS posts by using a
point process algorithm to identify fake news from real news. Temporal features
in fake news detection have the advantage of robustness over existing features
because it has minimal dependence on fake news propagators. Further, we propose
a novel multi-modal attention-based method, which includes linguistic and user
features alongside temporal features, for detecting fake news from SNS posts.
Results obtained from three public datasets indicate that the proposed model
achieves better performance compared to existing methods and demonstrate the
effectiveness of temporal features for fake news detection.

technique in low-power vibrothermography, so-called vibro-thermal wave radar
(VTWR), for non-destructive inspection of composites. VTWR is applied by binary
phase modulation of the vibrational excitation using a 5 bit Barker coded
waveform, followed by matched filtering of the thermal response. The depth
resolvability of VTWR is analyzed by a 1D analytical formulation in which
defects are modeled as subsurface heating sources. The obtained results reveal
the outperformance of VTWR compared to the classical lock-in vibrothermography
(LVT), i.e. a sinusoidal amplitude modulation. Furthermore, the VTWR technique
is experimentally demonstrated on a 5.5 mm thick carbon fiber reinforced
polymer coupon with barely visible impact damage. A local defect resonance
frequency of a backside delamination is selected as the vibrational carrier
frequency. This allows for implementing VTWR in the low-power regime (input
power < 1 Watt). It is shown that the Barker coded amplitude modulation and the
resultant pulse compression efficiency lead to an increased probing depth, and
can fully resolve the deep backside delamination. It is also shown that VTWR
approach allows depth-selective imaging of defects through the lag of the
compressed pulse.

to the orbital angular momentum. The fraction of direct merging among the GW
captures increases in proportional to $v^{4/7}$ assuming the uniform
distribution of pericenter distances in the encounters, where $v$ is the
velocity dispersion of cluster, which means about 5 % of GW capture leads to
the direct merging for star clusters with $v=150$ km s$^{-1}$.

consider the weighted sum bit error rate (BER) minimization problem among all

scheduling, subject to the minimum primary rate requirements. To tackle this
complicated problem, a relaxation-based algorithm is proposed. We prove that
the converged relaxation scheduling variables are binary, which means that no

automatically satisfied. Second, we consider the fairness BER optimization
problem. We find that the relaxation-based method cannot solve this fairness
BER problem since the minimum primary rate requirements may not be satisfied by
the binary reconstruction operation. To address this issue, we first transform
the binary constraints into a series of equivalent equality constraints. Then,
a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution.

relaxation time, group velocity and mean free path, in amorphous solids are
still challenge to be captured. By systematically analyzing the normal mode
decomposition and structure factor methods, we conclude that the vibrational
dispersion can be calculated by applying effective wave vectors in the
structure factor method, while the vibrational relaxation time calculated by
the normal mode decomposition method is questionable since the group velocity
cannot be defined on the Gamma point. We also show that the anharmonicity
caused by the system temperature has little effect on the relaxation times of
the propagating modes in amorphous materials, and therefore, the corresponding
modal and total thermal conductivity is temperature independent when all the
vibrations are assumed to be excited. The non-propagating modes, i.e.,
diffusons, conduct heat via thermal coupling between different vibrational
modes, and can be calculated by harmonic lattice dynamics using Allen-Feldman
theory. As a result, the thermal conductivity contributed from diffusons is
also temperature independent when all the vibrational modes are activated which
is the situation in molecular dynamics simulations. The total thermal
conductivity concerning both propagons (50%) and diffusons (50%) agree quite
well with the results computed using Green-Kubo equilibrium molecular dynamics.
By correcting the excitation state of the vibrations in amorphous solids, the

the tactical decision making of autonomous vehicles is a challenging task. This
paper presents a low-complexity approach for lane-change initiation and
planning to facilitate highly automated driving on freeways. Conditions under
which human drivers find different manoeuvres desirable are learned from
naturalistic driving data, eliminating the need for an engineered objective
function and incorporation of expert knowledge in form of rules. Motion
planning is formulated as a finite-horizon optimisation problem with safety
constraints. It is shown that the decision model can replicate human drivers'
discretionary lane-change decisions with up to 92% accuracy. Further proof of
concept simulation of an overtaking manoeuvre is shown, whereby the actions of
the simulated vehicle are logged while the dynamic environment evolves as per
ground truth data recordings.

graph Laplacian regularization is proposed for sparse hyperspectral unmixing
method. Since it is likely to find spectrally similar pixels in a homogeneous
region, we use a superpixel segmentation algorithm to extract the homogeneous
regions by considering the image boundaries. We first extract the homogeneous
regions, which are called superpixels, then a weighted graph in each superpixel
is constructed by selecting $K$-nearest pixels in each superpixel. Each node in
the graph represents the spectrum of a pixel and edges connect the similar
pixels inside the superpixel. The spatial similarity is investigated using
graph Laplacian regularization. Sparsity regularization for abundance matrix is
provided using a weighted sparsity promoting norm. Experimental results on
simulated and real data sets show the superiority of the proposed algorithm
over the well-known algorithms in the literature.

\textit{simultaneously diagonalizing via $*$-congruence} a collection of
finitely many (not need pairwise commute) Hermitian matrices. Theoretically, we
provide some equivalent conditions for that such a matrix collection can be
simultaneously diagonalized via $^*$-congruence.% by a nonsingular matrix.
Interestingly, one of such conditions leads to the existence of a positive

view, we propose an algorithm for numerically solving such problem. The
proposed algorithm is a combination of
  (1) a positive semidefinite program detecting whether the initial Hermitian

  (2) a Jacobi-like algorithm for simultaneously diagonalizing via
$*$-congruence the commuting normal matrices derived from the previous stage.

  Channels",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The potential of using visible light communication (VLC) technologies for
vehicular communication networks has recently attracted much attention. The
underlying VLC channels, as a foundation for the proper design and optimization
of vehicular VLC communication systems, have not yet been sufficiently
investigated. Vehicular VLC link impairments can have a significant impact on
the system performance and capacity. Such impairments include the optical
wireless channel distortion and background noise. This paper proposes a novel
three-dimensional (3D) regular-shaped geometry-based stochastic model (RS-GBSM)
for vehicular VLC multiple-input single-output (MISO) channels. The proposed 3D
RS-GBSM combines a two-sphere model and an elliptic-cylinder model. Both the
line-of-sight (LoS) and single-bounced (SB) components are considered. The
proposed model jointly considers the azimuth and elevation angles by using
von-Mises-Fisher (VMF) distribution. Based on the proposed model, the
relationship between the communication range and the received optical power is
analyzed and validated by simulations. The impact of the elevation angle in the
3D model on the received optical power is investigated by comparing with the
received optical power of the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) model.
Furthermore, the background noise is also modeled to evaluate the system's
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

more and more planets are expected to be uncovered around M dwarfs, theories of
their formation and dynamical evolution are still in their infancy. We
investigate the giant impact growth of protoplanets, which includes strong
scattering around low-mass stars. The aim is to clarify whether strong
scattering around low-mass stars affects the orbital and mass distributions of
the planets. We perform $N$-body simulation of protoplanets by systematically
surveying the parameter space of the stellar mass and surface density of
protoplanets. We find that protoplanets are often ejected after twice or three
times close-scattering around late M dwarfs. The ejection sets the upper limit
of the largest planet mass. Adopting the surface density scaling linearly with
the stellar mass, we find that as the stellar mass decreases less massive
planets are formed in orbits with higher eccentricities and inclinations. Under
this scaling, we also find that a few close-in protoplanets are generally
ejected. The ejection of protoplanets plays an important role in the mass
distribution of super-Earths around late M dwarfs. The mass relation of
observed close-in super-Earths and their central star mass is well reproduced
by ejection.

classifiers will be vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations. We present
derivations of the optimal adversarial attacks for discrete and continuous
signals of interest, i.e., finding the optimal perturbation distributions to
minimize the mutual information between the degraded signal and a signal
following a continuous or discrete distribution. In addition, we show that it
is much harder to achieve adversarial attacks for minimizing mutual information
when multiple redundant copies of the input signal are available. This provides
additional support to the recently proposed ``feature compression"" hypothesis
as an explanation for the adversarial vulnerability of deep learning
classifiers. We also report on results from computational experiments to

classification results over machine learning models. A prime example of this is
the influential SHAP-score, a version of the Shapley value that can help
explain the result of a learned model on a specific entity by assigning a score
to every feature. While in general computing Shapley values is a
computationally intractable problem, it has recently been claimed that the
SHAP-score can be computed in polynomial time over the class of decision trees.
In this paper, we provide a proof of a stronger result over Boolean models: the
SHAP-score can be computed in polynomial time over deterministic and
decomposable Boolean circuits. Such circuits, also known as tractable Boolean
circuits, generalize a wide range of Boolean circuits and binary decision
diagrams classes, including binary decision trees, Ordered Binary Decision
Diagrams (OBDDs) and Free Binary Decision Diagrams (FBDDs). We also establish
the computational limits of the notion of SHAP-score by observing that, under a
mild condition, computing it over a class of Boolean models is always
polynomially as hard as the model counting problem for that class. This implies
that both determinism and decomposability are essential properties for the
circuits that we consider, as removing one or the other renders the problem of
computing the SHAP-score intractable (namely, #P-hard).

extremely small nanostructures with broken translational symmetry. It is a
long-term challenging task to correctly simulate quantum heat transport
including anharmonic scattering at a scale relevant to practical applications.
In this article, we present a clarified theoretical formulation of anharmonic
phonon non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) formalism for both 1D and 3D
nanostructures, through a diagrammatic perturbation expansion and an
introduction of Fourier representation to both harmonic and anharmonic terms. A
parallelized computational framework with first-principle force constants input
is developed for large-scale quantum heat transport simulation. Some crucial
approximations in numerical implementation are investigated to ensure the
balance between numerical accuracy and efficiency. A quantitative validation is
demonstrated for the anharmonic phonon NEGF formalism and computational
framework by modeling cross-plane heat transport through silicon thin film. The
phonon-phonon scattering is shown to be appreciable and to introduce about 20%
reduction of thermal conductivity at room temperature even for a film thickness
around 10 nm. The present methodology provides a robust platform for the device
quantum thermal modeling, as well as the study on the transition from coherent

a superposition operation of terms with unequal coefficient, Huygens principle,
and a proper time-varying biasing mechanism, some useful closed-form formulas
in the class of large digital metasurfaces were presented for predicting the
absolute directivity of scatted beams. Moreover, in the harmonic beam steering
scheme, by applying several suitable assumptions, we have derived two separate
expressions for calculating the exact total radiated power at harmonic
frequencies and total radiated power for scattered beams located at the
end-fire direction. Despite the simplifying assumptions we have applied, we
have proved that the provided formulas can still be a good and fast estimate
for developing a large digital metasurface with a predetermined power intensity
pattern. The effect of quantization level and metasurface dimensions on the
performance of power manipulating as well as the limitation on the maximum scan

examples numerically demonstrated through MATLAB software and the good
agreement between simulations and theoretical predictions have been observed.
By considering the introduced restrictions in the manuscript, this method can

codes to achieve substantial computational savings. In many of those models,
the hydrometeorological forcing conditions (inputs) or flood events (outputs)
are conveniently parameterized by scalar representations, neglecting that the
inputs are actually time series and that floods propagate spatially inland.
Both facts are crucial in flood prediction for complex coastal systems. Our aim
is to establish a surrogate model that accounts for time-varying inputs and
provides information on spatially varying inland flooding. We introduce a
multioutput Gaussian process model based on a separable kernel that correlates
both functional inputs and spatial locations. Efficient implementations
consider tensor-structured computations or sparse-variational approximations.
In several experiments, we demonstrate the versatility of the model for both
learning maps and inferring unobserved maps, numerically showing the
convergence of predictions as the number of learning maps increases. We assess
our framework in a coastal flood prediction application. Predictions are
obtained with small error values within computation time highly compatible with
short-term forecast requirements (on the order of minutes compared to the days
required by hydrodynamic simulators). We conclude that our framework is a
promising approach for forecast and early-warning systems.

precise necrosis of deeply seated tumor preserving the adjoining healthy tissue
with minimum thermally induced nociceptive pain sensation to the patient. The
aim of the present study is to determine the effects of nanoparticle mixed
tissues under pulsed and continuous heating during high intensity focused
ultrasound (HIFU) and laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT). The present
problem incorporating the tissue thermal relaxation times ( ) was solved in a
3-dimensional multilayered vasculature breast tumor model signifying the
complex inhomogeneous tissue structure. The coupled Radiative transfer,
Helmontz, momentum, dual phase lag (DPL) and equilibrium equations for optic,
acoustic, fluid, temperature and mechanical fields respectively were solved
simultaneously using COMSOL Multiphysics (Bangalore, India) software. An
in-vitro study on agar based tissue phantom was also performed to validate the
present numerical results of focused ultrasound heating. The thermal relaxation
times of tissue causes significant changes of thermal and damage history under
focused ultrasound heating compared to unfocused laser heating. With limited
rise in tissue temperature, the pulsed mode of heating for longer period with
lower duty cycle (16.6%) shows a target specific necrotic damage with reduced
nociceptive pain in contrast to continuous mode of heating. Further, the
presence of nanoparticles and multilevel artery and vein affect both the
thermal and mechanical response under external heating. Thus, the present
findings could help to understand the role of different external heating modes
and sources on tumor necrosis during clinical practice of thermo-therapy.

  during COVID-19",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), there is a
huge demand for medical masks. A mask manufacturer often receives a large
amount of orders that are beyond its capability. Therefore, it is of critical
importance for the manufacturer to schedule mask production tasks as
efficiently as possible. However, existing scheduling methods typically require
a considerable amount of computational resources and, therefore, cannot
effectively cope with the surge of orders. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end neural network for scheduling real-time production tasks. The neural
network takes a sequence of production tasks as inputs to predict a
distribution over different schedules, employs reinforcement learning to
optimize network parameters using the negative total tardiness as the reward
signal, and finally produces a high-quality solution to the scheduling problem.
We applied the proposed approach to schedule emergency production tasks for a
medical mask manufacturer during the peak of COVID-19 in China. Computational
results show that the neural network scheduler can solve problem instances with
hundreds of tasks within seconds. The objective function value (i.e., the total
weighted tardiness) produced by the neural network scheduler is significantly
better than those of existing constructive heuristics, and is very close to
those of the state-of-the-art metaheuristics whose computational time is
unaffordable in practice.

(d-KdV) equation. Four different types of singularities are identified. The
first type corresponds to localised, `confined', singularities, the confinement
constraints for which provide the integrability conditions for generalisations
of d-KdV. Two other types of singularities are of infinite extent and consist
of oblique lines of infinities, possibly alternating with lines of zeros. The
fourth type of singularity corresponds to horizontal strips where the product
of the values on vertically adjacent points is equal to 1. (A vertical version
of this singularity with product equal to $-1$ on horizontally adjacent sites
also exists). Due to its orientation this singularity can, in fact, interact
with the other types. This leads to an extremely rich structure for the
singularities of d-KdV, which is studied in detail in this paper. Given the
important role played by the fourth type of singularity we decided to give it a
special name: taishi (the origin of which is explained in the text). The taishi
do not exist for nonintegrable extensions of d-KdV, which explains the relative
paucity of singularity structures in the nonintegrable case: the second and
third type of singularities that correspond to oblique lines still exist and
the localised singularities of the integrable case now become unconfined,
leading to semi-infinite lines of infinities alternating with zeros.

works in the artificial intelligence field focus on recognizing emotion rather
than mining the reason why emotions are not or wrongly recognized. Correlation
among emotions contributes to the failure of emotion recognition. In this
paper, we try to fill the gap between emotion recognition and emotion
correlation mining through natural language text from web news. Correlation
among emotions, expressed as the confusion and evolution of emotion, is
primarily caused by human emotion cognitive bias. To mine emotion correlation
from emotion recognition through text, three kinds of features and two deep
neural network models are presented. The emotion confusion law is extracted
through orthogonal basis. The emotion evolution law is evaluated from three
perspectives, one-step shift, limited-step shifts, and shortest path transfer.
The method is validated using three datasets-the titles, the bodies, and the
comments of news articles, covering both objective and subjective texts in
varying lengths (long and short). The experimental results show that, in
subjective comments, emotions are easily mistaken as anger. Comments tend to
arouse emotion circulations of love-anger and sadness-anger. In objective news,

programmers from scratch is thought to be impractical. Adding constraints to
the code grammar, implementing domain specific concepts as primitives and
providing examples for the algorithm to learn, makes it practical. Formal
fields is a framework to do code generation across domains using the same

different narrow problems, but providing necessary abstractions to integrate
many working solutions as a single lifelong reasoning system. It provides a
common grammar to define: a domain language, a problem and its evaluation. The
framework learns from examples of code snippets about the structure of the
domain language and searches completely new code snippets to solve unseen
problems in the same field. Formal fields abstract the search algorithm away
from the problem. The search algorithm is taken from existing reinforcement
learning algorithms. In our implementation it is an apropos Monte-Carlo Tree

widely used event intensity function representation of point processes, we
provide a proof that a class of learnable functions can universally approximate
any valid intensity function. The proof connects the well known

non-negative continuous functions using a transfer functions, the formulation
of the parameters of a piece-wise continuous functions as a dynamic system, and
a recurrent neural network implementation for capturing the dynamics. Using
these insights, we design and implement UNIPoint, a novel neural point process

this simpler representation performs better than Hawkes process variants and

these singularities. In analogy with the dispersive KdV regularization of the
1D inviscid Burgers' equation, we propose a local conservative regularization
of ideal 3D compressible flows, MHD and 2-fluid plasmas (with potential
applications to high vorticity flows with low dissipation). The regularization
involves introducing a vortical `twirl' term lambda^2 w x curl w in the
velocity equation. The cut-off length lambda must be inversely proportional to
square root of density to ensure the conservation of a `swirl' energy. The
latter includes positive kinetic, compressional, magnetic and vortical
contributions, thus leading to a priori bounds on enstrophy. The extension to
2-fluid plasmas involves additionally magnetic `twirl' terms in the ion and
electron velocity equations and a solenoidal addition to the current in
Ampere's law. A Hamiltonian-Poisson bracket formulation is developed using the
swirl energy as Hamiltonian. We also establish a minimality property of the
twirl regularization. A swirl velocity field is shown to transport vortex and
magnetic flux tubes as well as w/rho and B/rho, thus generalizing the
Kelvin-Helmholtz and Alfven theorems. The steady regularized equations are used
to model a rotating vortex, MHD pinch and vortex sheet. Our regularization
could facilitate numerical simulations and a statistical treatment of vortex

ubiquitously available LEDs exhibited gigantic and fast photovoltaic signals
with excellent signal-to-noise ratios when being illuminated by THz field
strengths >50 kV/cm. We also successfully demonstrated THz-LED detectors and
camera prototypes. These unorthodox THz detectors exhibited high responsivities
(>1 kV/W) with response time shorter than those of pyroelectric detectors by
four orders of magnitude. The detection mechanism was attributed to
THz-field-induced nonlinear impact ionization and Schottky contact. These
findings not only help deepen our understanding of strong THz field-matter

is investigated for a standard optomechanical system coupled to a general
mechanical non-Markovian reservoir. We study the evolution of phonon number by
incorporating the effects of initial correlations into the time-dependent
coefficients in the Heisenberg equation. We introduce the concept of cooling
rate and define an average phonon reduction function to describe the sideband
cooling effect in non-Markovian regime. Our results show that the instantaneous
phonon number can be significantly reduced by introducing either the
parametric-amplification type or the beam-splitter type initial correlations.
In addition, the ground state cooling rate can be accelerated by enhancing the
initial correlation of beam-splitter type. By optimizing the initial state of
the system and utilizing Q-modulation technology, a stable mechanical ground
state can be obtained in a very short time. Our optimized cooling protocol
provides an appealing platform for phonon manipulation and quantum information

such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, Majorana fermions, and axion
electrodynamics. However, an exactly solvable model being capable to capture
the essential physics of the interplay between magnetism and topology is still

elevated temperature at suitable correlation strength. The results demonstrate

wound healing, bronchial asthma, and many others; a detailed theoretical
framework for such a system is, therefore, important. Vertex model (VM)
simulations have provided crucial insights into the dynamics of such systems,
but their nonequilibrium nature makes it difficult for theoretical development.
Cellular Potts model (CPM) of confluent monolayer provides an alternative model
for such systems with a well-defined equilibrium limit. We combine numerical
simulations of CPM and an analytical study based on one of the most successful
theories of equilibrium glass, the random first order transition theory, and
develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for a confluent glassy system. We
find that the glassy dynamics within CPM is qualitatively similar to that in
VM. Our study elucidates the crucial role of geometric constraints in bringing
about two distinct regimes in the dynamics, as the target perimeter $P_0$ is
varied. The unusual sub-Arrhenius relaxation results from the distinctive
interaction potential arising from the perimeter constraint in such systems.
Fragility of the system decreases with increasing $P_0$ in the low-$P_0$
regime, whereas the dynamics is independent of $P_0$ in the other regime. The
rigidity transition, found in VM, is absent within CPM; this difference seems
to come from the nonequilibrium nature of the former. We show that CPM captures
the basic phenomenology of glassy dynamics in a confluent biological system via
comparison of our numerical results with existing experiments on different

  For a given $\alpha$ with $\omega\leq \alpha\leq \varepsilon_0$ the

language of linear orders is $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\#\{\beta<\alpha:

focused on the neuronal dynamics, under the assumption that network
connectivity satisfies certain fine-tuning conditions required to generate

  Here we investigated the hypothesis that spike timing dependent plasticity
(STDP) can provide the underlying mechanism for tuning synaptic connectivity to
generate rhythmic activity in the gamma band. We addressed this question in a
modeling study. We examined STDP dynamics in the framework of a network of
excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations that has been suggested to
underlie the generation of gamma. Mean field Fokker Planck equations for the
synaptic weights dynamics are derived in the limit of slow learning. We drew on
this approximation to determine which types of STDP rules drive the system to
exhibit gamma oscillations, and demonstrate how the parameters that
characterize the plasticity rule govern the rhythmic activity. Finally, we
propose a novel mechanism that can ensure the robustness of self-developing
processes, in general and for rhythmogenesis in particular.

  Resampling Artifacts With Bayesian Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multimedia forensics, learning-based methods provide state-of-the-art
performance in determining origin and authenticity of images and videos.
However, most existing methods are challenged by out-of-distribution data,
i.e., with characteristics that are not covered in the training set. This makes
it difficult to know when to trust a model, particularly for practitioners with
limited technical background.
  In this work, we make a first step toward redesigning forensic algorithms
with a strong focus on reliability. To this end, we propose to use Bayesian
neural networks (BNN), which combine the power of deep neural networks with the
rigorous probabilistic formulation of a Bayesian framework. Instead of
providing a point estimate like standard neural networks, BNNs provide
distributions that express both the estimate and also an uncertainty range.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework on a classical forensic task:
resampling detection. The BNN yields state-of-the-art detection performance,
plus excellent capabilities for detecting out-of-distribution samples. This is
demonstrated for three pathologic issues in resampling detection, namely unseen
resampling factors, unseen JPEG compression, and unseen resampling algorithms.
We hope that this proposal spurs further research toward reliability in
multimedia forensics.

thermal simulations, buckling simulations, and modal frequencies, thus leading
to a proper result for forming design and mesh. After post-processing the

3D printing under a suitable manufacturing method. The final generative bracket

of a tile is the sum of elements that fall within it. We present a linear

groups. One of its purposes is to review some results and to provide precise
and correct statements and definitions, as well as some proofs and new results.
  A key concept is that of a tower (Sela) or NTQ system
(Kharlampovich-Myasnikov). We discuss them thoroughly.
  We state and prove a new general theorem which unifies several results in the
literature: elementarily equivalent torsion-free hyperbolic groups have
isomorphic cores (Sela); if $H$ is elementarily embedded in a torsion-free
hyperbolic group $G$, then $G$ is a tower over $H$ relative to $H$ (Perin);
free groups (Perin-Sklinos, Ould-Houcine), and more generally free products of
prototypes and free groups, are homogeneous.
  The converse to Sela and Perin's results just mentioned is true. This follows
from the solution to Tarski's problem on elementary equivalence of free groups,
due independently to Sela and Kharlampovich-Myasnikov, which we treat as a
black box throughout the paper.
  We present many examples and counterexamples, and we prove some new
model-theoretic results. We characterize prime models among torsion-free
hyperbolic groups, and minimal models among elementarily free groups. Using
Fra\""iss\'e's method, we associate to every torsion-free hyperbolic group $H$ a
unique homogeneous countable group $\mathcal{M}$ in which any hyperbolic group
$H'$ elementarily equivalent to $H$ has an elementary embedding.
  In an appendix we give a complete proof of the fact, due to Sela, that towers
over a torsion-free hyperbolic group $H$ are $H$-limit groups.

and sparse weights from registers. For multi-GPU parallelism, our SpDNN
implementation duplicates weights and statically partition the feature maps
across GPUs. Results for the challenge benchmarks show that the proposed kernel
design and multi-GPU parallelization achieve up to 180 tera-edges per second
inference throughput. These results are up to 4.3x faster for a single GPU and
an order of magnitude faster at full scale than those of the champion of the

increased attention due to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires
worldwide. Popular fire detection techniques such as satellite imaging and
remote camera-based sensing suffer from late detection and low reliability
while early wildfire detection is a key to prevent massive fires. In this
paper, we propose a novel wildfire detection solution based on unmanned aerial
vehicles assisted Internet of things (UAV-IoT) networks. The main objective is
to (1) study the performance and reliability of the UAV-IoT networks for
wildfire detection and (2) present a guideline to optimize the UAV-IoT network
to improve fire detection probability under limited budgets. We focus on
optimizing the IoT devices' density and number of UAVs covering the forest area
such that a lower bound of the wildfires detection probability is maximized
within a limited time and budget. At any time after the fire ignition, the IoT
devices within a limited distance from the fire can detect it. These IoT
devices can then report their measurements only when the UAV is nearby.
Discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) analysis is utilized to compute the fire
detection probability at discrete time. Before declaring fire detection, a
validation state is designed to account for IoT devices' practical limitations
such as miss-detection and false alarm probabilities. Numerical results suggest
that given enough system budget, the UAV-IoT based fire detection can offer a
faster and more reliable wildfire detection solution than the state of the art
satellite imaging techniques.

turbulence, most essentially the correlation time $\tau$, root-mean-square
turbulent speed $u$, and correlation scale $l$. However, these quantities are
difficult, or, in the case of $\tau$, impossible, to directly observe, and
theorists have mostly relied on order of magnitude estimates. Here we present
an analytic model to derive these quantities in terms of a small set of more
accessible parameters. In our model, turbulence is assumed to be driven
concurrently by isolated supernovae (SNe) and superbubbles (SBs), but
clustering of SNe to form SBs can be turned off if desired, which reduces the
number of model parameters by about half. In general, we find that isolated SNe
and SBs can inject comparable amounts of turbulent energy into the interstellar
medium, but SBs do so less efficiently. This results in rather low overall
conversion rates of SN energy into turbulent energy of $\sim1$-$3\%$. The
results obtained for $l$, $u$ and $\tau$ for model parameter values
representative of the Solar neighbourhood are consistent with those determined
from direct numerical simulations. Our analytic model can be combined with
existing dynamo models to predict more directly the magnetic field properties
for nearby galaxies or for statistical populations of galaxies in cosmological
models.

first-order model checking can be solved in time $f(d,k)n$ for $n$-vertex
graphs given with a witness that the twin-width is at most $d$, called
$d$-contraction sequence or $d$-sequence, and formulas of size $k$ [Bonnet et
al., FOCS '20]. The inevitable price to pay for such a general result is that
$f$ is a tower of exponentials of height roughly $k$. In this paper, we show
that algorithms based on twin-width need not be impractical. We present
$2^{O(k)}n$-time algorithms for $k$-Independent Set, $r$-Scattered Set,
$k$-Clique, and $k$-Dominating Set when an $O(1)$-sequence is provided. We
further show how to solve weighted $k$-Independent Set, Subgraph Isomorphism,
and Induced Subgraph Isomorphism, in time $2^{O(k \log k)}n$. These algorithms
are based on a dynamic programming scheme following the sequence of
contractions forward. We then show a second algorithmic use of the contraction
sequence, by starting at its end and rewinding it. As an example, we establish
that bounded twin-width classes are $\chi$-bounded. This significantly extends
the $\chi$-boundedness of bounded rank-width classes, and does so with a very
concise proof. The third algorithmic use of twin-width builds on the second
one. Playing the contraction sequence backward, we show that bounded twin-width
graphs can be edge-partitioned into a linear number of bicliques, such that
both sides of the bicliques are on consecutive vertices, in a fixed vertex
ordering. Given that biclique edge-partition, we show how to solve the
unweighted Single-Source Shortest Paths and hence All-Pairs Shortest Paths in
sublinear time $O(n \log n)$ and time $O(n^2 \log n)$, respectively. Finally we
show that Min Dominating Set and related problems have constant integrality

flapping plates at O(10--100) Reynolds numbers in incompressible flow. We vary
five parameters: flapping amplitude, frequency (or Reynolds number), horizontal
and vertical spacings between plates, and oncoming fluid stream velocity.
Lattices that are closely spaced in the streamwise direction produce intense
vortex dipoles between adjacent plates. The lattices transition sharply from
drag- to thrust-producing as these dipoles switch from upstream to downstream
orientations at critical flow speeds. Near these transitions the flows assume a
variety of periodic and nonperiodic states, with and without up-down symmetry,
and multiple stable self-propelled speeds can occur. As the streamwise spacing
increases, the plates may shed typical vortex wakes that impinge on downstream
neighbors. With small lateral spacing, rectangular lattices yield net drag,
while rhombic lattices may generate net thrust, sometimes with high efficiency.
As lateral spacing increases, rectangular lattices begin to generate thrust,
eventually with slightly higher efficiencies than rhombic lattices, as the two
types of lattice flows converge. At Re = 70, the maximum Froude efficiencies of
time-periodic lattice flows are about twice those of an isolated plate. At
lower Re, the lattices' efficiency advantage increases until the isolated
flapping plate no longer generates thrust. The mean input power needed to
generate the lattice flows can be estimated in the limits of small and large
streamwise spacings, with small-gap and Poiseuille-like flows between the
plates respectively in the two cases. For both lattices, the mean input power
saturates as the lateral spacing becomes large (and thrust occurs). At small
lateral spacings, the rhombic lattices' input power may be much larger when the
plates overlap, leading to a decrease in Froude efficiency.

Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) provide impressive image generations from
Gaussian white noise, but both of them are difficult to train since they need
to train the generator (or encoder) and the discriminator (or decoder)
simultaneously, which is easy to cause unstable training. In order to solve or
alleviate the synchronous training difficult problems of GANs and VAEs,
recently, researchers propose Generative Scattering Networks (GSNs), which use
wavelet scattering networks (ScatNets) as the encoder to obtain the features
(or ScatNet embeddings) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the decoder
to generate the image. The advantage of GSNs is the parameters of ScatNets are
not needed to learn, and the disadvantage of GSNs is that the expression
ability of ScatNets is slightly weaker than CNNs and the dimensional reduction
method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is easy to lead overfitting in the
training of GSNs, and therefore affect the generated quality in the testing
process. In order to further improve the quality of generated images while keep
the advantages of GSNs, this paper proposes Generative Fractional Scattering
Networks (GFRSNs), which use more expressive fractional wavelet scattering
networks (FrScatNets) instead of ScatNets as the encoder to obtain the features
(or FrScatNet embeddings) and use the similar CNNs of GSNs as the decoder to
generate the image. Additionally, this paper develops a new dimensional
reduction method named Feature-Map Fusion (FMF) instead of PCA for better
keeping the information of FrScatNets and the effect of image fusion on the

this problem, this paper develops a new noise reduction method to filter LiDAR
point clouds, i.e. an adaptive clustering method based on principal component
analysis (PCA). Different from the traditional filtering methods that directly
process three-dimension (3D) point cloud data, the proposed method uses
dimension reduction to generate two-dimension (2D) data by extracting the first
principal component and the second principal component of the original data
with little information attrition. In the 2D space spanned by two principal
components, the generated 2D data are clustered for noise reduction before
being restored into 3D. Through dimension reduction and the clustering of the
generated 2D data, this method derives low computational complexity,
effectively removing noises while retaining details of environmental features.
Compared with traditional filtering algorithms, the proposed method has higher
precision and recall. Experimental results show a F-score as high as 0.92 with
complexity reduced by 50% compared with traditional density-based clustering

multiple non-overlapping groups, and defining the control goal as two distinct
objectives. The first objective aims to minimize a group-wise
block-decentralized LQR function that models group-level mission. The second
objective, on the other hand, tries to minimize an LQR function between the
average states (centroids) of the groups. Exploiting this separation, we
redefine the weighting matrices of the LQR functions in a way that they allow
us to decouple their respective algebraic Riccati equations. Thereafter, we
develop a reinforcement learning strategy that uses online measurements of the
agent states and the average states to learn the respective controllers based
on the approximate Riccati equations. Since the first controller is
block-decentralized and, therefore, can be learned in parallel, while the
second controller is reduced-dimensional due to averaging, the overall design
enjoys a significantly reduced learning time compared to centralized

learn the underlying distributions of urban vehicle trajectory data. A
generative model for urban vehicle trajectories can better generalize from
training data by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and,
thus, produce synthetic vehicle trajectories similar to real vehicle
trajectories with limited observations. Synthetic trajectories can provide
solutions to data sparsity or data privacy issues in using location data. This
research proposesTrajGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning

location sequences in observed trajectories is formulated as an imitation

ball screening for confounder selection from modern ultra-high dimensional data

our confounder selection procedure aims to control for confounding while

this has been mostly an afterthought, with privacy-preserving models obtained

This approach leads to less than ideal privacy/utility tradeoffs, as we show

choice of activation function is central to bounding the sensitivity of
privacy-preserving deep learning. We demonstrate analytically and

merely inspecting the labels of $u$ and $v$, without using any other

admitting exact or approximate distance labeling schemes with labels of
polylogarithmic size. In this paper, we describe a $4$-approximate distance
labeling scheme forthe class of $K_4$-free bridged graphs. This scheme uses
labels of poly-logarithmic length $O(\log n^3)$ allowing a constant decoding
time. Given the labels of two vertices $u$ and $v$, the decoding function
returnsa value between the exact distance $d_G(u,v)$ and its quadruple
$4d_G(u,v)$.

Reinforcement Learning (LLIRL), a new incremental algorithm for efficient
lifelong adaptation to dynamic environments. We develop and maintain a library

equivalent to clustering environment parameters in a latent space. The prior
distribution over the mixture is formulated as a Chinese restaurant process
(CRP), which incrementally instantiates new environment models without any

lifelong learning, we employ the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with
online Bayesian inference to update the mixture in a fully incremental manner.
In EM, the E-step involves estimating the posterior expectation of
environment-to-cluster assignments, while the M-step updates the environment
parameters for future learning. This method allows for all environment models
to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated for environmental
changes and old models retrieved when previously seen environments are
encountered again. Experiments demonstrate that LLIRL outperforms relevant
existing methods, and enables effective incremental adaptation to various

Quasi-Newton Method. In an online optimization problem, an online agent uses a
certain algorithm to decide on an objective at each time step after which a
possible loss is encountered. Even though the online player will ideally try to
make the best decisions possible at each time step, there is a notion of regret
associated with the player's decisions. This study examines the regret of an
online player using optimization methods like the Quasi-Newton methods, due to
their fast convergent properties. The Barzilai-Borwein (BB) gradient method is
chosen in this paper over other Quasi-Newton methods such as the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm because of its less
computational complexities. In addition, the BB gradient method is suitable for
large-scale optimization problems including the online optimization scenario
presented in this paper. To corroborate the effectiveness of the
Barzilai-Borwein (BB) gradient algorithm, a greedy online gradient algorithm is
used in this study based on the two BB step sizes. Through a rigorous regret
analysis on the BB step sizes, it is established that the regret obtained from
the BB algorithm is sublinear in time. Moreover, this paper shows that the
average regret using the online BB algorithm approaches zero without assuming
strong convexity on the cost function to be minimized.

Ahn, Guha and McGregor'12 on connectivity in dynamic graph streams that has
enjoyed considerable attention in the literature since then, and has led to
near optimal dynamic streaming algorithms for many fundamental problems such as
connectivity, cut and spectral sparsifiers and matchings. Interestingly,
however, the sketching and dynamic streaming complexity of approximating the
shortest path metric of a graph is still far from well-understood. Besides a
direct $k$-pass implementation of classical spanner constructions (recently
improved to $\lfloor\frac k2\rfloor+1$-passes by Fernandez, Woodruff and
Yasuda'20) the state of the art amounts to a $O(\log k)$-pass algorithm of Ahn,
Guha and McGregor'12, and a $2$-pass algorithm of Kapralov and Woodruff'14. In
particular, no single pass algorithm is known, and the optimal tradeoff between
the number of passes, stretch and space complexity is open.
  In this paper we introduce several new graph sketching techniques for
approximating the shortest path metric of the input graph. We give the first
{\em single pass} sketching algorithm for constructing graph spanners: we show
how to obtain a $\widetilde{O}(n^{\frac23})$-spanner using $\widetilde{O}(n)$
space, and in general a $\widetilde{O}(n^{\frac23(1-\alpha)})$-spanner using
$\widetilde{O}(n^{1+\alpha})$ space for every $\alpha\in [0, 1]$, a tradeoff
that we think may be close optimal. We also give new spanner construction
algorithms for any number of passes, simultaneously improving upon all prior
work on this problem. Finally, we study the simultaneous communication model
and propose the first protocols with low per player information.

determination in the planet host star KELT-17 via spectral synthesis. Stellar
parameters were estimated iteratively by fitting Balmer line profiles and
imposing the Fe ionization balance, using the program SYNTHE together with
plane-parallel ATLAS12 model atmospheres. Specific opacities for an arbitrary
composition and microturbulence velocity vmicro were calculated through the
Opacity Sampling (OS) method. The abundances were determined iteratively by
fitting synthetic spectra to metallic lines of 16 different chemical species
using the program SYNTHE. The complete chemical pattern of KELT-17 was compared
to the recently published average pattern of Am stars. We estimated the stellar
radius by two methods: a) comparing the synthetic spectral energy distribution
with the available photometric data and the Gaia parallax, and b) using a
Bayesian estimation of stellar parameters using stellar isochrones. Results. We
found overabundances of Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba, together
with subsolar values of Ca and Sc. Notably, the chemical pattern agrees with
those recently published of Am stars, being then KELT-17 the first exoplanet

DANN models is chosen to be smaller than the filter width, in order to
accurately model the effects of SGS dynamics. The DANN models can predict the
SGS stress more accurately than the conventional approximate deconvolution
method (ADM) and velocity gradient model (VGM) in a prior study: the
correlation coefficients can be made larger than 99\% and the relative errors
can be made less than 15\% for the DANN model. In an a posteriori study, a
comprehensive comparison of the DANN model, the implicit large eddy simulation
(ILES), the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM), and the dynamic mixed model (DMM)
shows that: the DANN model is superior to the ILES, DSM, and DMM models in the
prediction of the velocity spectrum, various statistics of velocity and the
instantaneous coherent structures without increasing the considerable
computational cost. Besides, the trained DANN models without any fine-tuning
can predict the velocity statistics well for different filter widths. These

to questions of ontology. All ordinary matter is made of electrons, protons,
neutrons, and photons and they are all indistinguishable particles. Yet the
concept itself has proved elusive, in part because of the interpretational
difficulties that afflict quantum theory quite generally, and in part because
the concept was so central to the discovery of the quantum itself, by Planck in
1900; it came encumbered with revolution. I offer a deflationary reading of the
concept ""indistinguishable"" that is identical to the Gibbs concept of ""generic
phase"", save that it is defined for state spaces with only finitely-many states
of bounded volume and energy (finitely-many orthogonal states, in quantum
mechanics). That, and that alone, makes for the difference between the quantum
and Gibbs concepts of indistinguishability. This claim is heretical on several
counts, but here we consider only the content of the claim itself, and its
bearing on the early history of quantum theory rather than in relation to
contemporary debates about particle indistinguishability and permutation
symmetry. It powerfully illuminates that history.

  processes",,,,,"math.PR stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work is to popularize the method of computing the distribution of the
excursion times for a Gaussian process that involves extended and multivariate
Rice's formula. The approach was used in numerical implementations of the
high-dimensional integration routine and in earlier work it was shown that the
computations are more effective and thus more precise than those based on Rice
expansions.
  The joint distribution of excursion times is related to the distribution of
the number of level crossings, a problem that can be attacked via the Rice
series expansion, based on the moments of the number of crossings. Another
point of attack is the ""Independent Interval Approximation"" intensively studied
for the persistence of physical systems. It treats the lengths of successive
crossing intervals as statistically independent. A renewal type argument leads
to an expression that provides the approximate interval distribution via its
Laplace transform.
  However, independence is not valid in typical situations. Even if it leads to
acceptable results for the persistency exponent, rigorous assessment of the
approximation error is not available. Moreover, we show that the IIA approach
cannot deliver properly defined probability distributions and thus the method
is limited to persistence studies.
  This paper presents an alternative approach that is both more general, more
accurate, and relatively unknown. It is based on exact expressions for the
probability density for one and for two successive excursion lengths. The
numerical routine RIND computes the densities using recent advances in
scientific computing and is easily accessible via a simple Matlab interface.
The result solves the problem of two-step excursion dependence for a general
stationary differentiable Gaussian process. The work offers also some
analytical results that explain the effectiveness of the implemented method.

that QSO BR1202-0725 exhibits a large Ly$\alpha$ halo, covering $\approx55$
pkpc on-sky at surface brightness levels of SB$\geq$1E-17
erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$. In contrast, the SMG, of similar far-infrared
luminosity and star formation rate (SFR), does not exhibit such a Ly$\alpha$

gas motion is to some extent kinematically coupled with the previously observed
[CII] bridge between the QSO and the SMG. We note that the object known in the
literature as LAE2 shows no local peak of Ly$\alpha$ emission, rather, its
profile is more consistent with being part of the QSO's extended Ly$\alpha$
halo. The properties of LAE3 are typical of high-redshift LAEs; we measure
F$_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}$(LAE3) = $0.24\pm$0.03E-16 erg/s/cm$^2$, corresponding to
SFR$_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}\approx\ $5.0$\pm$0.5 M${_\odot}$/yr. The velocity width is
$\Delta v$(LAE3) $\approx 400$ km/s, and equivalent width
EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha_{\,5\sigma}^{\,lim})\geq 34.05$ $\\A$, consistent with star
formation being the primary driver of Ly$\alpha$ emission. We also note a
coherent absorption feature at $\sim -400$km/s in spectra from at least three

early integration and end-to-end learning with many versions of hybrid

NeuronGPU is a GPU library for large-scale simulations of spiking neural

a novel spike-delivery algorithm. This library includes simple LIF

way of estimating tie strength in data-driven studies has been to simply count
the total number or duration of contacts between two people. This, however,
disregards many features that can be extracted from the rich data sets used for
social network reconstruction. Here, we focus on contact data with temporal
information. We systematically study how features of the contact time series
are related to topological features usually associated with tie strength. We
analyze a large mobile-phone dataset and measure a number of properties of the
call time series for each tie, and use these to predict the so-called
neighbourhood overlap, a feature related to strong ties in the sociological
literature. We observe a strong relationship between temporal features and the
neighbourhood overlap, with many features outperforming simple contact counts.
Features that stand out include the number of days with calls, number of bursty
cascades, typical times of contacts, and temporal stability. Our results
suggest that these measures could be adapted for use in social network
construction and indicate that the best results can be achieved by combining
multiple temporal features.

confounding deflation and adjustment. We applied our framework to a cardiac

an increase of ventricular volumes and myocardial mass in athletes, which is

  references, journal submission","Computer Networks, Volume 195, 4 August 2021","10.1016/j.comnet.2021.108188",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coexistence between cellular systems and Wi-Fi gained the attention of the
research community when LTE License Assisted Access (LAA) entered the
unlicensed band. The recent introduction of NR-U as part of 5G introduces new
coexistence opportunities because it implements scalable numerology (flexible
subcarrier spacing and OFDM symbol lengths), and non-slot based scheduling
(mini-slots), which considerably impact channel access. This paper analyzes the
impact of NR-U settings on its coexistence with Wi-Fi networks and compares it
with LAA operation using simulations and experiments. First, we propose a
downlink channel access simulation model, which addresses the problem of the
dependency and non-uniformity of transmission attempts of different nodes, as a
result of the synchronization mechanism introduced by NR-U. Second, we validate
the accuracy of the proposed model using FPGA-based LAA, NR-U, and Wi-Fi
prototypes with over-the-air transmissions. Additionally, we show that
replacing LAA with NR-U would not only allow to overcome the problem of
bandwidth wastage caused by reservation signals but also, in some cases, to
preserve fairness in channel access for both scheduled and random-access
systems. Finally, we conclude that fair coexistence of the aforementioned
systems in unlicensed bands is not guaranteed in general, and novel mechanisms
are necessary for improving the sharing of resources between scheduled and
contention-based technologies.

  for High-Current-Density Hydrogen Evolution","23 pages, 5 figures","Nature Communications, 2020, 11, 3724","10.1038/s41467-020-17121-8",,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The high-throughput scalable production of cheap, efficient and durable
electrocatalysts that work well at high current densities demanded by industry
is a great challenge for the large-scale implementation of electrochemical
technologies. Here we report the production of a 2D MoS2-based ink-type
electrocatalyst by a scalable top-down exfoliation technique followed by a
simple heat treatment. The catalyst shows a high current density of 1000 mA
cm^-2 at an overpotential of 454 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
without the need of iR correction, as well as good stability over 24 hours.
Using the same method, we have, for the first time, produced a cheap MoS2
mineral-based catalyst and found that it had an excellent performance for
high-current-density HER. Noteworthy, production rate of this MoS2-based
catalyst is one to two orders of magnitude higher than those previously
reported. In addition, the price of the MoS2 mineral is five orders of
magnitude lower than commercial Pt catalysts, making the MoS2 mineral-based
catalyst cheap, and the ink-type catalyst dispersions can be easily integrated
with other technologies for large-scale catalyst electrode preparation. These
advantages indicate the huge potentials of this method and mineral-based cheap
and abundant natural resources as catalysts in the electrochemical
technologies.

a major role in shaping geophysical landscapes. Particularly in relation to the
global climate warming scenario, it is essential to be able to accurately
quantify how water-body environments dynamically interplay with ice formation
or melting process. Previous studies have revealed the complex nature of the
icing process, but have often ignored one of the most remarkable particularity
of water, its density anomaly, and the induced stratification layers
interacting and coupling in a complex way in presence of turbulence and phase
change. By combining experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical
modeling, we investigate solidification of freshwater, properly considering
phase transition, water density anomaly, and real physical properties of ice
and water phases, which we show to be essential for correctly predicting the
different qualitative and quantitative behaviors. We identify, with increasing
thermal driving, four distinct flow-dynamics regimes, where different levels of
coupling among ice front, stably and unstably stratified water layers occur.
Despite the complex interaction between the ice front and fluid motions,
remarkably, the average ice thickness and growth rate can be well captured with
the theoretical model. It is revealed that the thermal driving has major
effects on the temporal evolution of the global icing process, which can vary
from a few days to a few hours in the current parameter regime. Our model can
be applied to general situations where the icing dynamics occurs under
different thermal and geometrical conditions (e.g. cooling conditions or water
layer depth).

over imperative programs with real variables. The reachability property
requires that a program can reach certain target states during its execution.
Previous works that tackle reachability analysis are either unable to handle
programs consisting of general loops (e.g. symbolic execution), or lack
completeness guarantees (e.g. abstract interpretation), or are not automated
(e.g. incorrectness logic/reverse Hoare logic). In contrast, we propose a novel
approach for reachability analysis that can handle general programs, is
(semi-)complete, and can be entirely automated for a wide family of programs.
Our approach extends techniques from both invariant generation and
ranking-function synthesis to reachability analysis through the notion of
(Universal) Inductive Reachability Witnesses (IRWs/UIRWs). While traditional
invariant generation uses over-approximations of reachable states, we consider
the natural dual problem of under-approximating the set of program states that
can reach a target state. We then apply an argument similar to ranking
functions to ensure that all states in our under-approximation can indeed reach
the target set in finitely many steps.

(1+3)-dimensional spacetime symmetries, we show how to construct a model
$M_{G}$ of kinematics for which the set $W$ of worldview transformations
between inertial observers satisfies $W=G$. This holds in particular for all
relevant subgroups of $Gal$, $cPoi$, and $cEucl$ (the groups of Galilean,
Poincar\'e and Euclidean transformations, respectively, where $c\in Q$ is a
model-specific parameter orresponding to the speed of light in the case of
Poincar\'e transformations).
  In doing so, by an elementary geometrical proof, we demonstrate our main
contribution: spatial isotropy is enough to entail that the set $W$ of
worldview transformations satisfies either $W\subseteq Gal$, $W\subseteq cPoi$,
or $W\subseteq cEucl$ for some $c>0$. So assuming spatial isotropy is enough to
prove that there are only 3 possible cases: either the world is classical (the
worldview transformations between inertial observers are Galilean
transformations); the world is relativistic (the worldview transformations are
Poincar\'e transformations); or the world is Euclidean (which gives a
nonstandard kinematical interpretation to Euclidean geometry). This result
considerably extends previous results in this field, which assume a priori the
(strictly stronger) special principle of relativity, while also restricting the
choice of $Q$ to the field of reals.
  As part of this work, we also prove the rather surprising result that, for
any $G$ containing translations and rotations fixing the time-axis $t$, the
requirement that $G$ be a subgroup of one of the groups $Gal$, $cPoi$ or
$cEucl$ is logically equivalent to the somewhat simpler requirement that, for
all $g\in G$: $g[t]$ is a line, and if $g[t]=t$ then $g$ is a trivial
transformation (i.e. $g$ is a linear transformation that preserves Euclidean
length and fixes the time-axis setwise).

function which meets fairness requirements. This framework is built upon the
notion of $\alpha$-relative (fairness) improvement of the regression function

corresponds to the regression problem under the Demographic Parity constraint,
while $\alpha = 1$ corresponds to the classical regression problem without any
constraints. For $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ the proposed framework allows to
continuously interpolate between these two extreme cases and to study partially
fair predictors. Within this framework we precisely quantify the cost in risk
induced by the introduction of the fairness constraint. We put forward a
statistical minimax setup and derive a general problem-dependent lower bound on
the risk of any estimator satisfying $\alpha$-relative improvement constraint.
We illustrate our framework on a model of linear regression with Gaussian
design and systematic group-dependent bias, deriving matching (up to absolute
constants) upper and lower bounds on the minimax risk under the introduced
constraint. We provide a general post-processing strategy which enjoys
fairness, risk guarantees and can be applied on top of any black-box algorithm.
Finally, we perform a simulation study of the linear model and numerical

different coverage-vs-correctness trade-offs come in play, leading to tools

non-Gaussianity inducing operation, in the enhancement of nonclassicality in a
finite dimensional quantum state, namely hypergeometric state with the help of
some quantifiers and measures of nonclassicality. We observed that measures to
characterize the quality of single photon source and anticlassicality lead to
the similar conclusion, i.e., to obtain the desired quantum features one has to
choose all the state parameters such that average photon numbers remains low.
Wigner logarithmic negativity of the photon added hypergeometric state and
concurrence of the two-mode entangled state generated at the output of a
beamsplitter from this state show that nonclassicality can be enhanced by
increasing the state parameter and photon number addition but decreasing the
dimension of the state. In principle, decreasing the dimension of the state is
analogous to holeburning and is thus expected to increase nonclassicality.
Further, the variation of Wigner function not only qualitatively illustrates
the same features as observed quantitatively through concurrence potential and
Wigner logarithimic negativity, but illustrate non-Gaussianity of the quantum
state as well.

quantify entanglement in an information-theoretically meaningful way. In
particular, every previously defined entanglement measure bearing a precise
information-theoretic meaning is not known to be efficiently computable, or if
it is efficiently computable, then it is not known to have a precise
information-theoretic meaning. In this Letter, we meet this challenge by
introducing an entanglement measure that has a precise information-theoretic
meaning as the exact cost required to prepare an entangled state when two
distant parties are allowed to perform quantum operations that completely
preserve the positivity of the partial transpose. Additionally, this
entanglement measure is efficiently computable by means of a semidefinite

subjective, or hedonic, wellbeing, as well as digital literacy and online
activity; the overall aim is to understand how a user's online experiences
affect their wellbeing. The second scale, the Trust Index includes three
subscales covering the importance of trust to the user, trusting beliefs, and
contextual factors; the aim for this scale is to examine trust in online
algorithm-driven systems. The scales will be used together to aid researchers
in understanding how trust (or lack of trust) relates to overall wellbeing
online. They will also contribute to the development of a suite of tools for
empowering users to negotiate issues of trust online, as well as in designing
guidelines for the inclusion of trust considerations in the development of
online algorithm-driven systems. The next step is to release the prototype
scales developed as a result of this pilot in a large online study in to

second price auctions. We focus on the pure equilibria of the induced strategic

as a tight corresponding lower bound on the price of stability for all auctions
whose payment rules are convex combinations of the bids. This implies a tight

lower bounds for the whole class, for more complex auctions (like VCG), and for

Brazilian practitioners engaged on the software development industry. Results:
Code review practices are widespread among Brazilian practitioners who
recognize its importance. However, there is no routine for applying these
practices. In addition, they report difficulties to fit static analysis tools
in the software development process. One possible reason recognized by
practitioners is that most of these tools use a single metric threshold, which
might be not adequate to evaluate all system classes. Conclusion: Improving
guidelines to fit code review practices into the software development process
could help to make them widely used. Additionally, future studies should
investigate whether multiple metric thresholds that take source code context
into account reduce static analysis tool false alarms. Finally, these tools
should allow their use in distinct phases of the software development process.

the infinite random graph). Every finitely-colored $K_\mathbb{N}$ contains a

generalization on the shifted target domain. We propose a Generative Nearest

First, multiple simpler policies are trained to generate trajectories for a
discrete set of target velocities and turning radius. These policies are then
augmented using a higher level neural network for handling the transition
between the learned trajectories. Specifically, we develop a neural
network-based filter that takes in target velocity, radius and transforms them
into new commands that enable smooth transitions to the new trajectory. This
transformation is achieved by learning from expert demonstrations. An
application of this is the transformation of a novice user's input into an

demonstrations compared to standard neural network architectures. Finally, we

demosaicking. The key of EARI is a new edge detector for generating an
effective guide image used to interpolate the missing pixel values. We also
present a newly constructed full color-polarization image dataset captured
using a 3-CCD camera and a rotating polarizer. Using the dataset, we
experimentally demonstrate that our EARI-based method outperforms existing
methods in MPFA and CPFA demosaicking.

emanating from the companion in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary
stars with a circumbinary disk. In doing so, we also determine the mass
accretion rates on to the companion and investigate the source feeding the
circum-companion accretion disk. Methods. We perform a spatio-kinematic
modelling of the jet of two well-sampled post-AGB binaries, BD+46442 and
IRAS19135+3937, by fitting the orbital phased time series of H-alpha spectra.
Once the jet geometry, velocity and scaled density structure are computed, we
carry out radiative transfer modelling of the jet for the first four Balmer
lines to determine the jet densities, thus allowing us to compute the jet
mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates. Results. The spatio-kinematic model
of the jet reproduces the observed absorption feature in the H-alpha lines. In
both objects, the jets have an inner region with extremely low density. Using
our radiative transfer model, we find the full three-dimensional density
structure of both jets. From these results, we can compute mass-loss rates of
the jets, which are of the order of 10^-7 - 10^-5 M_sol/yr. We estimate mass
accretion rates onto the companion of 10^-6 - 10^-4 M_sol/yr. Conclusions.
Based on the mass accretion rates found for these two objects, we conclude that
the circumbinary disk is most likely the source feeding the circum-companion
accretion disk. This is in agreement with the observed depletion patterns in
post-AGB binaries. The high accretion rates from the circumbinary disk imply
that the lifetime of the disk will be short. Mass-transfer from the post-AGB
star cannot be excluded in these systems, but it is unlikely to provide a
sufficient mass-transfer rate to sustain the observed jet mass-loss rates.

applied researchers. However, little guidance exists to help researchers
systematically identify plausible missing data mechanisms in order to ensure
that these methods are appropriately applied. Two considerations motivate the
present study. First, psychological research is typically characterized by a
large number of potential response variables that may be observed across
multiple waves of data collection. This situation makes it more challenging to
identify plausible missing data mechanisms than is the case in other fields
such as biostatistics where a small number of dependent variables is typically
of primary interest and the main predictor of interest is statistically
independent of other covariates. Second, there is growing recognition of the
importance of systematic approaches to sensitivity analyses for treatment of
missing data in psychological science. We develop and apply a systematic
approach for reducing a large number of observed patterns and demonstrate how
these can be used to explore potential missing data mechanisms within
multivariate contexts. A large scale simulation study is used to guide
suggestions for which approaches are likely to be most accurate as a function
of sample size, number of factors, number of indicators per factor, and
proportion of missing data. Three applications of this approach to data
examples suggest that the method appears useful in practice.

trajectory design challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
distributed sense-and-send protocol, where the UAVs determine the trajectories
by selecting from a discrete set of tasks and a continuous set of locations for

design problem for AoI minimization and propose a compound-action actor-critic

this work, we utilize the Fourier analysis to empirically provide a promising
mechanism to understand why feedforward deeper learning is faster. To this end,
we separate a deep neural network, trained by normal stochastic gradient
descent, into two parts during analysis, i.e., a pre-condition component and a
learning component, in which the output of the pre-condition one is the input
of the learning one. We use a filtering method to characterize the frequency
distribution of a high-dimensional function. Based on experiments of deep
networks and real dataset, we propose a deep frequency principle, that is, the
effective target function for a deeper hidden layer biases towards lower
frequency during the training. Therefore, the learning component effectively
learns a lower frequency function if the pre-condition component has more
layers. Due to the well-studied frequency principle, i.e., deep neural networks
learn lower frequency functions faster, the deep frequency principle provides a
reasonable explanation to why deeper learning is faster. We believe these
empirical studies would be valuable for future theoretical studies of the

compression techniques on the performance of such deep learning architectures.
Focusing on the JPEG and H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC) as a representative proxy for
contemporary lossy image/video compression techniques that are in common use
within network-connected image/video devices and infrastructure, we examine the
impact on performance across five discrete tasks: human pose estimation,
semantic segmentation, object detection, action recognition, and monocular
depth estimation. As such, within this study we include a variety of network
architectures and domains spanning end-to-end convolution, encoder-decoder,
region-based CNN (R-CNN), dual-stream, and generative adversarial networks

network performance and the level of lossy compression applied. Notably,
performance decreases significantly below a JPEG quality (quantization) level
of 15% and a H.264 Constant Rate Factor (CRF) of 40. However, retraining said
architectures on pre-compressed imagery conversely recovers network performance
by up to 78.4% in some cases. Furthermore, there is a correlation between
architectures employing an encoder-decoder pipeline and those that demonstrate
resilience to lossy image compression. The characteristics of the relationship
between input compression to output task performance can be used to inform

distribution and kinematic features in the non-radial propagation of both

crucial in determining the trajectory of CMEs, in agreement with previous

for machine learning models: given a data point and model, determine whether
the point was used to train the model. Existing membership inference attacks
exploit models' abnormal confidence when queried on their training data. These
attacks do not apply if the adversary only gets access to models' predicted
labels, without a confidence measure. In this paper, we introduce label-only
membership inference attacks. Instead of relying on confidence scores, our
attacks evaluate the robustness of a model's predicted labels under
perturbations to obtain a fine-grained membership signal. These perturbations
include common data augmentations or adversarial examples. We empirically show
that our label-only membership inference attacks perform on par with prior
attacks that required access to model confidences. We further demonstrate that
label-only attacks break multiple defenses against membership inference attacks
that (implicitly or explicitly) rely on a phenomenon we call confidence
masking. These defenses modify a model's confidence scores in order to thwart
attacks, but leave the model's predicted labels unchanged. Our label-only
attacks demonstrate that confidence-masking is not a viable defense strategy
against membership inference. Finally, we investigate worst-case label-only
attacks, that infer membership for a small number of outlier data points. We
show that label-only attacks also match confidence-based attacks in this
setting. We find that training models with differential privacy and (strong) L2
regularization are the only known defense strategies that successfully prevents
all attacks. This remains true even when the differential privacy budget is too
high to offer meaningful provable guarantees.

channel has the property that the intersection event of correct $q$-decoding of
receiver $1$ and erroneous $\rho$-decoding of receiver $2$ has zero probability

holds in the strong converse sense of an exponential decay of the probability
of correct decoding at rates above the bound. Further, we refine the proof and
present a bound that is at least as tight as that of any choice of $\rho$.
Several examples that demonstrate the strict improvement of our bound compared
to previous results are analyzed. Finally, we detect equivalence classes of
isomorphic channel-metric pairs $(W,q)$ that share the same mismatch capacity.
We prove that if the class contains a matched pair, then our bound is tight and
the mismatch capacity of the entire class is fully characterized and is equal
to the LM rate, which is achievable by random coding, and may be strictly lower
that the matched capacity.

uncertainties. By modeling the system as a probabilistic labeled Markov
decision process (PL-MDP), the control objective is to synthesize a
finite-memory policy, under which the agent satisfies complex high-level tasks
expressed as linear temporal logic (LTL) with desired satisfaction probability.
In particular, the cost optimization of the trajectory that satisfies infinite
horizon tasks is considered, and the trade-off between reducing the expected
mean cost and maximizing the probability of task satisfaction is analyzed.
Instead of using traditional Rabin automata, the LTL formulas are converted to
limit-deterministic B\""uchi automata (LDBA) with a reachability acceptance
condition and a compact graph structure. The novelty of this work lies in
considering the cases where LTL specifications can be potentially infeasible
and developing a relaxed product MDP between PL-MDP and LDBA. The relaxed
product MDP allows the agent to revise its motion plan whenever the task is not
fully feasible and quantify the revised plan's violation measurement. A
multi-objective optimization problem is then formulated to jointly consider the
probability of task satisfaction, the violation with respect to original task
constraints, and the implementation cost of the policy execution. The
formulated problem can be solved via coupled linear programs. To the best of
our knowledge, this work first bridges the gap between probabilistic planning
revision of potential infeasible LTL specifications and optimal control
synthesis of both plan prefix and plan suffix of the trajectory over the
infinite horizons. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

measure that aims at having WLAN devices operating in an environment that
provides sufficient attenuation to enable sharing with other services. In this

are directly looking for a detection of an attenuating environment. The basic
idea is that signals from global navigation satellite services (GNSS) can be
received practically everywhere on earth where there is a view to the sky.
Where these signals are attenuated, the receiving device is assumed to be in an
attenuating environment. In order to characterize such environment, we evaluate
the detectable GNSS satellites and their carrier-to-noise density. Example
measurements show that GNSS raw data can help to distinguish between
low-attenuating locations and higher-attenuating locations. These measurements
were conducted with GNSS receiver in an off-the-shelf Android tablet in order

thermalization of high-energy radioactive ion beams. Common challenges of many
stopping cells are a high molecular background of extracted ions and
limitations of extraction efficiency due to space-charge effects. At the FRS
Ion Catcher at GSI, a new technique for removal of ionized molecules prior to
their extraction out of the stopping cell has been developed. This technique
utilizes the RF carpet for the separation of atomic ions from molecular
contaminant ions through their difference in ion mobility. Results from the
successful implementation and test during an experiment with a 600~MeV/u
$^{124}$Xe primary beam are presented. Suppression of molecular contaminants by
three orders of magnitude has been demonstrated. Essentially background-free
measurement conditions with less than $1~\%$ of background events within a
mass-to-charge range of 25 u/e have been achieved. The technique can also be
used to reduce the space-charge effects at the extraction nozzle and in the
downstream beamline, thus ensuring high efficiency of ion transport and
highly-accurate measurements under space-charge-free conditions.

decade, and this effort will require novel approaches to train and use ML
models. In this paper, we discuss a Machine Learning as a Service pipeline for
HEP (MLaaS4HEP) which provides three independent layers: a data streaming layer
to read High-Energy Physics (HEP) data in their native ROOT data format; a data
training layer to train ML models using distributed ROOT files; a data
inference layer to serve predictions using pre-trained ML models via HTTP
protocol. Such modular design opens up the possibility to train data at large
scale by reading ROOT files from remote storage facilities, e.g. World-Wide LHC
Computing Grid (WLCG) infrastructure, and feed the data to the user's favorite
ML framework. The inference layer implemented as TensorFlow as a Service
(TFaaS) may provide an easy access to pre-trained ML models in existing
infrastructure and applications inside or outside of the HEP domain. In
particular, we demonstrate the usage of the MLaaS4HEP architecture for a
physics use-case, namely the $t\bar{t}$ Higgs analysis in CMS originally
performed using custom made Ntuples. We provide details on the training of the
ML model using distributed ROOT files, discuss the performance of the MLaaS and
TFaaS approaches for the selected physics analysis, and compare the results

the connectivity of a tensor network without manually bookkeeping tensor
indices. The ITensor interface rules out common programming errors and enables
rapid prototyping of tensor network algorithms. After discussing the philosophy
behind the ITensor approach, we show examples of each part of the interface
including Index objects, the ITensor product operator, tensor factorizations,
tensor storage types, algorithms for matrix product state (MPS) and matrix

ITensor for quantum many-body physics and for other areas where tensor networks
are increasingly applied. To conclude we discuss promising features and
optimizations to be added in the future.

It aims to search for the most promising pulsar candidates from an all-sky
survey, such as High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU), Green Bank Northern
Celestial Cap (GBNCC), Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope
(FAST), etc. Recently, machine learning (ML) is a hot topic in pulsar candidate
sifting investigations. However, one typical challenge in ML for pulsar
candidate sifting comes from the learning difficulty arising from the highly
class-imbalance between the observation numbers of pulsars and non-pulsars.
Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework for candidate sifting, named
multi-input convolutional neural networks (MICNN). The MICNN is an architecture
of deep learning with four diagnostic plots of a pulsar candidate as its
inputs. To train our MICNN in a highly class-imbalanced dataset, a novel image
augment technique, as well as a three-stage training strategy, is proposed.
Experiments on observations from HTRU and GBNCC show the effectiveness and
robustness of these proposed techniques. In the experiments on HTRU, our MICNN
model achieves a recall of 0.962 and a precision rate of 0.967 even in a highly
class-imbalanced test dataset.

characterised. Here, we directly apply singular value decomposition (SVD) in
source-reconstructed electroencephalography (EEG) in order to characterise the
dynamics of spatiotemporal patterns of resting-state functional connectivity.
We found that changes in resting-state functional connectivity were associated
with distinct complex topological features, ""Rich-Club organisation"", of the
default mode network, salience network, and motor network. Rich-club topology
of the salience network revealed greater functional connectivity between
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, whereas Rich-club

of the dynamics underlying Rich-club organisations of these source-space

apoptosis, as evaluated by 8-oxoguanine and cleaved caspase-3
immunohistochemistry, respectively. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment
showed changes in markers related to macrophage polarization. In vitro,
incubation of CCA cells with CAP-treated culture media (i.e. plasma-activated

level, CAP treatment induced double-strand DNA breaks, followed by an increased
phosphorylation and activation of the cell cycle master regulators CHK1 and

CAP is a novel therapeutic option to consider for CCA in the future.

methods, in which the Theory-guided Neural Network (TgNN) is constructed as a
deep-learning surrogate for problems with uncertain model parameters. By
incorporating physical laws and other constraints, the TgNN surrogate can be
constructed with limited simulation runs and accelerate the inversion process
significantly. Three TgNN surrogate-based inversion methods are proposed,

in which TgNN constrained with geostatistical information, named TgNN-geo, is
proposed for direct inverse modeling. In TgNN-geo, two neural networks are
introduced to approximate the respective random model parameters and the
solution. Since the prior geostatistical information can be incorporated, the
direct-inversion method based on TgNN-geo works well, even in cases with sparse
spatial measurements or imprecise prior statistics. Although the proposed
deep-learning based inverse modeling methods are general in nature, and thus
applicable to a wide variety of problems, they are tested with several

represented by some latent distribution learned from data. However, such latent
distribution may incur difficulties in data sampling for GANs. In this paper,
rather than sampling from the predefined prior distribution, we propose an
LCCGAN model with local coordinate coding (LCC) to improve the performance of

meaningful points from the latent manifold. With the LCC sampling method, we
can exploit the local information on the latent manifold and thus produce new

LCCGAN++, by introducing a higher-order term in the generator approximation.
This term is able to achieve better approximation and thus further improve the
performance. More critically, we derive the generalization bound for both
LCCGAN and LCCGAN++ and prove that a low-dimensional input is sufficient to
achieve good generalization performance. Extensive experiments on four

typing by suggesting the next word to a user to select, as typing in a
conversation consumes time. A few previous studies have focused on the Kurdish
language, including the use of next word prediction. However, the lack of a
Kurdish text corpus presents a challenge. Moreover, the lack of a sufficient
number of N-grams for the Kurdish language, for instance, five grams, is the
reason for the rare use of next Kurdish word prediction. Furthermore, the
improper display of several Kurdish letters in the Rstudio software is another
problem. This paper provides a Kurdish corpus, creates five, and presents a
unique research work on next word prediction for Kurdish Sorani and Kurmanji.
The N-gram model has been used for next word prediction to reduce the amount of
time while typing in the Kurdish language. In addition, little work has been
conducted on next Kurdish word prediction; thus, the N-gram model is utilized
to suggest text accurately. To do so, R programming and RStudio are used to
build the application. The model is 96.3% accurate.

  Natural Language Modeling",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transformer has been widely-used in many Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks and the scaled dot-product attention between tokens is a core module of
Transformer. This attention is a token-wise design and its complexity is
quadratic to the length of sequence, limiting its application potential for
long sequence tasks. In this paper, we propose a dimension-wise attention
mechanism based on which a novel language modeling approach (namely
TensorCoder) can be developed. The dimension-wise attention can reduce the
attention complexity from the original $O(N^2d)$ to $O(Nd^2)$, where $N$ is the
length of the sequence and $d$ is the dimensionality of head. We verify
TensorCoder on two tasks including masked language modeling and neural machine
translation. Compared with the original Transformer, TensorCoder not only
greatly reduces the calculation of the original model but also obtains improved
performance on masked language modeling task (in PTB dataset) and comparable
performance on machine translation tasks.

COVID-19 following the relaxation of lockdown measures. Using an agent-based
model, we explore one of the technology-based strategies proposed, a
contact-tracing smartphone app. The model simulates the spread of COVID-19 in a
population of agents on an urban scale. Agents are heterogeneous in their
characteristics and are linked in a multi-layered network representing the
social structure - including households, friendships, employment and schools.
We explore the interplay of various adoption rates of the contact-tracing app,
different levels of testing capacity, and behavioural factors to assess the
impact on the epidemic. Results suggest that a contact tracing app can
contribute substantially to reducing infection rates in the population when
accompanied by a sufficient testing capacity or when the testing policy
prioritises symptomatic cases. As user rate increases, prevalence of infection
decreases. With that, when symptomatic cases are not prioritised for testing, a
high rate of app users can generate an extensive increase in the demand for
testing, which, if not met with adequate supply, may render the app
counterproductive. This points to the crucial role of an efficient testing
policy and the necessity to upscale testing capacity.

plasma has been generated to improve their germinative properties. A special
attention has been paid on understanding the resulting plasma electrical
properties through an equivalent electrical model whose experimental validity
has been demonstrated here. In this model, the interelectrode gap is subdivided
into 4 types of elementary domains, according to whether they contain electric
charges (or not) and according to their type of medium (gas, seed or
insulator). The model enables to study the influence of seeds on the plasma
electrical properties by measuring and deducing several parameters (charge per
filament, gas capacitance, plasma power, ...) either in no-bed configuration
(i.e. no seed in the reactor) or in packed-bed configuration (seeds in the
reactor). In that second case, we have investigated how seeds can influence the
plasma electrical parameters considering six specimens of seeds (beans,
radishes, corianders, lentils, sunflowers and corns). The influence of
molecular oxygen (0-100 sccm) mixed with a continuous flow rate of helium (2
slm) is also investigated, especially through filaments breakdown voltages,
charge per filament and plasma power. It is demonstrated that such bed-packing
drives to an increase in the gas capacitance, to a decrease in the
beta-parameter and to variations of the filaments' breakdown voltages in a
seed-dependent manner. Finally, we show how the equivalent electrical model can
be used to assess the total volume of the contact points, the capacitance of
the seeds in the packed-bed configuration and we demonstrate that germinative
effects can be induced by plasma on four of the six agronomical specimens.

both in industry and research due to the practical advantages and sensitivity
of this type of sensing. The measuring principle is the luminescence quenching
by oxygen molecules, which results in a change of the luminescence decay time
and intensity. In the classical approach, this change is related to an oxygen
concentration using the Stern-Volmer equation. This equation, which in most of
the cases is non-linear, is parametrized through device-specific constants.
Therefore, to determine these parameters every sensor needs to be precisely
calibrated at one or more known concentrations. This work explores an entirely
new artificial intelligence approach and demonstrates the feasibility of oxygen
sensing through machine learning. The specifically developed neural network
learns very efficiently to relate the input quantities to the oxygen
concentration. The results show a mean deviation of the predicted from the
measured concentration of 0.5 percent air, comparable to many commercial and
low-cost sensors. Since the network was trained using synthetically generated
data, the accuracy of the model predictions is limited by the ability of the
generated data to describe the measured data, opening up future possibilities
for significant improvement by using a large number of experimental
measurements for training. The approach described in this work demonstrates the
applicability of artificial intelligence to sensing of sensors.

variable Covid-19 and independent variables from socioeconomic and pre-existing
health conditions within the local government area (LGA) in New South Wales

in building both global and GWPR models, four (4) independent variables are
finally selected to investigate relationships between dependent and independent
variables at the local scale. The GWPR model's results with the Goodness-of-Fit
(R2) range between 45-73% exhibit positive relationships between Covid-19 and
the total population, the cancers, and the people with ages between 60 and 85
in most of the NSW state. Meanwhile, a negative relationship is observed
between Covid-19 and the ischaemic heart disease; however, the estimated
coefficients for this relationship are very low and close to zero; hence
further investigation, including assessment from a different perspective, is
necessary for validation. In conclusion, the model suggests that the
relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are
nonstationary. Therefore, GWPR model calibration plays a vital role in
geographic modelling at the local scale.
