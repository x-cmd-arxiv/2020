to characterize directed graphs (a.k.a. networks). Many interesting results are
obtained, including the finding that community structure is related to
rotational symmetry in the spectral measurements for a type of stochastic block
model. Due the hermiticity property of the magnetic Laplacian we show here how
to scale our approach to larger networks containing hundreds of thousands of
nodes using the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM). We also propose to combine the
KPM with the Wasserstein metric in order to measure distances between networks
even when these networks are directed, large and have different sizes, a hard
problem which cannot be tackled by previous methods presented in the
literature. In addition, our python package is publicly available at

studied in different ways. Most prominently, the binary attack relation of Dung
frameworks has been extended to the notion of collective attacks. The resulting
formalism is often termed SETAFs. Another approach is provided via abstract
dialectical frameworks (ADFs), where acceptance conditions specify the relation
between arguments; restricting these conditions naturally allows for so-called
support-free ADFs. The aim of the paper is to shed light on the relation
between these two different approaches. To this end, we investigate and compare
the expressiveness of SETAFs and support-free ADFs under the lens of 3-valued

class of all graphs embeddable on any fixed surface (and in particular the
class of planar graphs) has asymptotic dimension 2, which gives a positive
answer to a recent question of Fujiwara and Papasoglu. Our result extends from
graphs to Riemannian surfaces. We also prove that graphs of bounded pathwidth
have asymptotic dimension at most 1 and graphs of bounded layered pathwidth
have asymptotic dimension at most 2. We give some applications of our
techniques to graph classes defined in a topological or geometrical way, and to
graph classes of polynomial growth. Finally we prove that the class of bounded

bounded degree graphs from any fixed proper minor-closed class are 3-colorable

(infinite) Cayley graphs avoiding some minor have asymptotic dimension at most
2, which solves a problem raised by Ostrovskii and Rosenthal.

Imaging (WSI) is essential for clinical research in renal pathology. In
computer vision, the end-to-end instance segmentation methods (e.g., Mask-RCNN)
have shown their advantages relative to detect-then-segment approaches by
performing complementary detection and segmentation tasks simultaneously. As a
result, the end-to-end Mask-RCNN approach has been the de facto standard method
in recent glomerular segmentation studies, where downsampling and patch-based
techniques are used to properly evaluate the high resolution images from WSI
(e.g., >10,000x10,000 pixels on 40x). However, in high resolution WSI, a single
glomerulus itself can be more than 1,000x1,000 pixels in original resolution
which yields significant information loss when the corresponding features maps
are downsampled via the Mask-RCNN pipeline. In this paper, we assess if the
end-to-end instance segmentation framework is optimal for high-resolution WSI
objects by comparing Mask-RCNN with our proposed detect-then-segment framework.
Beyond such a comparison, we also comprehensively evaluate the performance of
our detect-then-segment pipeline through: 1) two of the most prevalent
segmentation backbones (U-Net and DeepLab_v3); 2) six different image
resolutions (from 512x512 to 28x28); and 3) two different color spaces (RGB and
LAB). Our detect-then-segment pipeline, with the DeepLab_v3 segmentation
framework operating on previously detected glomeruli of 512x512 resolution,
achieved a 0.953 dice similarity coefficient (DSC), compared with a 0.902 DSC
from the end-to-end Mask-RCNN pipeline. Further, we found that neither RGB nor
LAB color spaces yield better performance when compared against each other in
the context of a detect-then-segment framework. Detect-then-segment pipeline
achieved better segmentation performance compared with End-to-end method.

its vertices is called a geodesic. Under natural conditions of curvature of the
limiting geodesic weight profile and stretched exponential decay of both tails
of the point-to-point weight, we use geometric arguments to upgrade the
assumptions to prove optimal upper and lower tail behavior with the exponents
of $3/2$ and $3$ for the weight of the geodesic from $(1,1)$ to $(r,r)$ for all
large finite $r$. The proofs merge several ideas, including the well known
super-additivity property of last passage values, concentration of measure
behavior for sums of stretched exponential random variables, and geometric
insights coming from the study of geodesics and more general objects called
geodesic watermelons. Previously such optimal behavior was only known for
exactly solvable models, with proofs relying on hard analysis of formulas from
integrable probability, which are unavailable in the general setting. Our
results illustrate a facet of universality in a class of KPZ stochastic growth
models and provide a geometric explanation of the upper and lower tail
exponents of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution, the conjectured one point
scaling limit of such models. The key arguments are based on an observation of
general interest that super-additivity allows a natural iterative bootstrapping
procedure to obtain improved tail estimates.

contacts between civilisations in the Galaxy. We make no assumptions regarding
the origin and evolution of intelligent life. We simply assume a network of
causally connected nodes. These nodes refer somehow to intelligent agents with
the capacity of receiving and emitting electromagnetic signals. Here we present
a three-parametric statistical Monte Carlo model of the network in a simplified
sketch of the Galaxy. Our goal, using Monte Carlo simulations, is to explore
the parameter space and analyse the probabilities of causal contacts. We find
that the odds to make a contact over decades of monitoring are low for most
models, except for those of a galaxy densely populated with long-standing
civilisations. We also find that the probability of causal contacts increases
with the lifetime of civilisations more significantly than with the number of
active civilisations. We show that the maximum probability of making a contact
occurs when a civilisation discovers the required communication technology.

device is among the challenging functionalities of a quantum processor. In the
context of spin qubits, this requirement can be met by coherent electron spin
shuttling between semiconductor quantum dots. Here we theoretically study a
minimal version of spin shuttling between two quantum dots. To this end, we
analyze the dynamics of an electron during a detuning sweep in a silicon double
quantum dot (DQD) occupied by one electron. Possibilities and limitations of
spin transport are investigated. Spin-orbit interaction and the Zeeman effect
in an inhomogeneous magnetic field play an important role for spin shuttling
and are included in our model. Interactions that couple the position, spin and
valley degrees of freedom open a number of avoided crossings in the spectrum
allowing for diabatic transitions and interfering paths. The outcomes of single
and repeated spin shuttling protocols are explored by means of numerical
simulations and an approximate analytical model based on the solution of the
Landau--Zener problem. We find that a spin infidelity as low as $1-F_s\lesssim
0.002$ with a relatively fast level velocity of $\alpha = 600\, {\mu}$eV/ns is
feasible for optimal choices of parameters or by making use of constructive
interference.

but few have focused on the early stages of the disease and the gender effect.
In this article, we have adapted the latest speaker recognition system, called
x-vectors, in order to detect an early stage of PD from voice analysis.
X-vectors are embeddings extracted from a deep neural network, which provide
robust speaker representations and improve speaker recognition when large
amounts of training data are used. Our goal was to assess whether, in the
context of early PD detection, this technique would outperform the more
standard classifier MFCC-GMM (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients - Gaussian
Mixture Model) and, if so, under which conditions. We recorded 221 French
speakers (including recently diagnosed PD subjects and healthy controls) with a
high-quality microphone and with their own telephone. Men and women were
analyzed separately in order to have more precise models and to assess a
possible gender effect. Several experimental and methodological aspects were
tested in order to analyze their impacts on classification performance. We
assessed the impact of audio segment duration, data augmentation, type of
dataset used for the neural network training, kind of speech tasks, and
back-end analyses. X-vectors technique provided better classification
performances than MFCC-GMM for text-independent tasks, and seemed to be
particularly suited for the early detection of PD in women (7 to 15%
improvement). This result was observed for both recording types (high-quality
microphone and telephone).

RFID devices (i.e. which use a single antenna at a time for both transmitting
and receiving RFID signals to and from the tags) to monitor browsing activity
of customers in front of display items in places such as retail stores. To this
end, we propose TagSee, a multi-person imaging system based on monostatic RFID
imaging. TagSee is based on the insight that when customers are browsing the
items on a shelf, they stand between the tags deployed along the boundaries of
the shelf and the reader, which changes the multi-paths that the RFID signals
travel along, and both the RSS and phase values of the RFID signals that the
reader receives change. Based on these variations observed by the reader,
TagSee constructs a coarse grained image of the customers. Afterwards, TagSee
identifies the items that are being browsed by the customers by analyzing the
constructed images. The key novelty of this paper is on achieving browsing
behavior monitoring of multiple customers in front of display items by
constructing coarse grained images via robust, analytical model-driven deep
learning based, RFID imaging. To achieve this, we first mathematically
formulate the problem of imaging humans using monostatic RFID devices and
derive an approximate analytical imaging model that correlates the variations
caused by human obstructions in the RFID signals. Based on this model, we then
develop a deep learning framework to robustly image customers with high
accuracy. We implement TagSee scheme using a Impinj Speedway R420 reader and
SMARTRAC DogBone RFID tags. TagSee can achieve a TPR of more than ~90% and a
FPR of less than ~10% in multi-person scenarios using training data from just
3-4 users.

First, we introduce deflation operators built with known solutions to make

close to the desired local minimizer. Together with neural network structures
carefully designed in this paper, the new regularized optimization can converge
to new solutions efficiently. Due to the mesh-free nature of deep learning, the
proposed method is capable of solving high-dimensional problems on complicated

two-dimensional regular domains and are more expensive in operation counts.
Numerical experiments also demonstrate that the proposed method could find more

For a $C^1$ function $f:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow

Armijo's condition is satisfied if $f(x-\delta \nabla f(x))-f(x)\leq -\alpha
\delta ||\nabla f(x)||^2$. It is a basis for the well known Backtracking
Gradient Descent (Backtracking GD) algorithm.
  Consider a sequence $\{x_n\}$ defined by $x_{n+1}=x_n-\delta _n\nabla
f(x_n)$, for positive numbers $\delta _n$ for which Armijo's condition is
satisfied. We show that if $\{x_n\}$ converges to a non-degenerate critical
point, then $\{\delta _n\}$ must be bounded. Moreover this boundedness can be
quantified in terms of the norms of the Hessian $\nabla ^2f$ and its inverse at
the limit point. This complements the first author's results on Unbounded
Backtracking GD, and shows that in case of convergence to a non-degenerate
critical point the behaviour of Unbounded Backtracking GD is not too different
from that of usual Backtracking GD. On the other hand, in case of convergence
to a degenerate critical point the behaviours can be very much different. We
run some experiments to illustrate that both scenrios can really happen.
  In another part of the paper, we argue that Backtracking GD has the correct
unit (according to a definition by Zeiler in his Adadelta's paper). The main
point is that since learning rate in Backtracking GD is bound by Armijo's
condition, it is not unitless.

jointly learns an implicit model of graph structure formation and discovers an
underlying optimization mechanism in the form of a latent objective function.
The learned objective can serve as an explanation for the observed graph
properties, thereby lending itself to transfer across different graphs within a

process and solves it using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning
algorithm. Further, it employs a novel continuous latent action space that aids
scalability. Empirically, we demonstrate that GraphOpt discovers a latent
objective transferable across graphs with different characteristics. GraphOpt
also learns a robust stochastic policy that achieves competitive link
prediction performance without being explicitly trained on this task and
further enables construction of graphs with properties similar to those of the

viscosity-stratified flow are different from those in a constant-viscosity
flow, and how nonlinearity is a crucial ingredient. We derive the
viscosity-varying adjoint Navier-Stokes equations, where gradients in viscosity
force both the adjoint momentum and the adjoint scalar (here temperature). By
the technique of direct-adjoint looping, we obtain the nonlinear optimal
perturbation which maximises the perturbation kinetic energy of the nonlinear
system. While we study three-dimensional plane Poiseuille (channel) flow with
the walls at different temperatures, and a temperature-dependent viscosity, our
findings are general for any flow with viscosity variations near walls. The Orr
and modified lift-up mechanisms are in operation at low and high perturbation
amplitudes respectively at our subcritical Reynolds number. The nonlinear
optimal perturbation contains more energy on the hot (less-viscous) side, with
a stronger initial lift-up. However, as the flow evolves, the important
dynamics shifts to the cold (more-viscous) side, where wide high-speed streaks
of low viscosity grow and persist, and strengthen the inflectional quality of
the velocity profile. We provide a physical description of this process, and
show that the evolution of the linear optimal perturbation misses most of the
physics. The Prandtl number does not qualitatively affect the findings at these
times. The study of nonlinear optimal perturbations is still in its infancy,
and viscosity variations are ubiquitous. We hope that this first work on

Ambainis [AA15], is a well studied problem in the context of separating quantum
and classical models. Variants of this problem were used to give exponential
separations between quantum and classical query complexity [A10, AA15]; quantum
query complexity and bounded-depth circuits [RT19]; and quantum and classical
communication complexity [GRT19]. In all these separations, the lower bound for
the classical model only holds when the advantage of the protocol (over a
random guess) is more than $\approx 1/\sqrt{N}$, that is, the success
probability is larger than $\approx 1/2 + 1/\sqrt{N}$. To achieve separations
when the classical protocol has smaller advantage, we study in this work the
XOR of $k$ independent copies of the Forrelation function (where $k\ll N$). We
prove a very general result that shows that any family of Boolean functions
that is closed under restrictions, whose Fourier mass at level $2k$ is bounded
by $\alpha^k$, cannot compute the XOR of $k$ independent copies of the
Forrelation function with advantage better than
$O\left(\frac{\alpha^k}{{N^{k/2}}}\right)$. This is a strengthening of a result
of [CHLT19], that gave a similar result for $k=1$, using the technique of
[RT19]. As an application of our result, we give the first example of a partial
Boolean function that can be computed by a simultaneous-message quantum
protocol of cost $\mbox{polylog}(N)$ (when players share $\mbox{polylog}(N)$
EPR pairs), however, any classical interactive randomized protocol of cost at
most $\tilde{o}(N^{1/4})$, has quasipolynomially small advantage over a random
guess. We also give the first example of a partial Boolean function that has a
quantum query algorithm of cost $\mbox{polylog}(N)$, and such that, any
constant-depth circuit of quasipolynomial size has quasipolynomially small
advantage over a random guess.

performed. While supervised methods may lead to good performance, they require
to fully annotate additional data which may not be an option in practice. In
contrast, unsupervised methods don't need additional annotations but are
usually unstable and hard to train. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised method. Instead of requiring detailed but time-consuming

adaptation. This paper introduces a new formulation of domain adaptation based
on structured learning and co-segmentation. Our method is easy to train, thanks
to the introduction of a regularised loss. The framework is validated on

the streaming model. This is a classic supervised learning problem that has
drawn lots of attention, including for developing fast algorithms for solving

approximately optimizing the SVM objective is Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD), which requires only $O(\frac{1}{\lambda\epsilon})$ random samples, and
which immediately yields a streaming algorithm that uses
$O(\frac{d}{\lambda\epsilon})$ space. For related problems, better streaming
algorithms are only known for smooth functions, unlike the SVM objective that
we focus on in this work. We initiate an investigation of the space complexity
for both finding an approximate optimum of this objective, and for the related
``point estimation'' problem of sketching the data set to evaluate the function
value $F_\lambda$ on any query $(\theta, b)$. We show that, for both problems,
for dimensions $d=1,2$, one can obtain streaming algorithms with space
polynomially smaller than $\frac{1}{\lambda\epsilon}$, which is the complexity
of SGD for strongly convex functions like the bias-regularized SVM, and which
is known to be tight in general, even for $d=1$. We also prove polynomial lower
bounds for both point estimation and optimization. In particular, for point
estimation we obtain a tight bound of $\Theta(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ for $d=1$ and
a nearly tight lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(d/{\epsilon}^2)$ for $d =
\Omega( \log(1/\epsilon))$. Finally, for optimization, we prove a
$\Omega(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ lower bound for $d = \Omega( \log(1/\epsilon))$,

roboticists since the 1970s. Researchers and interdisciplinary artists have
employed various painting techniques and human-robot collaboration models to
create visual mediums on canvas. One of the challenges of robotic painting is
to apply a desired artistic style to the painting. Style transfer techniques
with machine learning models have helped us address this challenge with the
visual style of a specific painting. However, other manual elements of style,
i.e., painting techniques and brushstrokes of an artist, have not been fully
addressed. We propose a method to integrate an artistic style to the
brushstrokes and the painting process through collaboration with a human
artist. In this paper, we describe our approach to 1) collect brushstrokes and
hand-brush motion samples from an artist, and 2) train a generative model to
generate brushstrokes that pertains to the artist's style, and 3) fine tune a
stroke-based rendering model to work with our robotic painting setup. We will
report on the integration of these three steps in a separate publication. In a
preliminary study, 71% of human evaluators find our reconstructed brushstrokes
are pertaining to the characteristics of the artist's style. Moreover, 58% of

terms are also terms and linear combinations of types are also types. In its
first presentation, Vectorial only provides a weakened version of the Subject

complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Kato-Rellich perturbation theory says that
isolated eigenvalues of $A(t)$ will be analytic functions of $t$ as long as
they remain below the minimum of the essential spectrum of $A(t)$. At a
threshold value $t_0$ where one of these eigenvalue functions hits the
essential spectrum, the corresponding point in the essential spectrum might or
might not be an eigenvalue of $A(t_0)$. Our results generalize a theorem of
Simon to give a sufficient condition for the minimum of the essential spectrum
to be an eigenvalue of $A(t_0)$ based on the rate at which eigenvalues approach
the essential spectrum. We also show that the rates at which the eigenvalues of
$A(t)$ can approach the essential spectrum from below correspond to eigenvalues
of a bounded self-adjoint operator. The key insight behind these results is the
essential numerical range which was recently extended to unbounded operators by
B\""{o}gli, Marletta, and Tretter.

approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these
can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data.
Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly,
as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic
method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its
functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design
methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to
construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships
between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of
a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by
using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of
attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally,
we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and
reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.

wireless-empowered applications in the Internet of Things and cyber-physical
systems. Motivated by such applications, this work proposes decentralized
policies for the real-time monitoring and estimation of autoregressive
processes over random access channels. Two classes of policies are
investigated: (i) oblivious schemes in which sampling and transmission policies
are independent of the processes that are monitored, and (ii) non-oblivious
schemes in which transmitters causally observe their corresponding processes
for decision making. In the class of oblivious policies, we show that
minimizing the expected time-average estimation error is equivalent to
minimizing the expected age of information. Consequently, we prove lower and
upper bounds on the minimum achievable estimation error in this class. Next, we
consider non-oblivious policies and design a threshold policy, called
error-based thinning, in which each source node becomes active if its
instantaneous error has crossed a fixed threshold (which we optimize). Active
nodes then transmit stochastically following a slotted ALOHA policy. A
closed-form, approximately optimal, solution is found for the threshold as well
as the resulting estimation error. It is shown that non-oblivious policies
offer a multiplicative gain close to $3$ compared to oblivious policies.
Moreover, it is shown that oblivious policies that use the age of information
for decision making improve the state-of-the-art at least by the multiplicative
factor $2$. The performance of all discussed policies is compared using
simulations. The numerical comparison shows that the performance of the
proposed decentralized policy is very close to that of centralized greedy
scheduling.

goal is to track the (possibly) time-varying network topology, and effect
memory and computational savings by processing the data on-the-fly as they are
acquired. The setup entails observations modeled as stationary graph signals
generated by local diffusion dynamics on the unknown network. Moreover, we may
have a priori information on the presence or absence of a few edges as in the
link prediction problem. The stationarity assumption implies that the
observations' covariance matrix and the so-called graph shift operator (GSO --
a matrix encoding the graph topology) commute under mild requirements. This
motivates formulating the topology inference task as an inverse problem,
whereby one searches for a sparse GSO that is structurally admissible and
approximately commutes with the observations' empirical covariance matrix. For
streaming data said covariance can be updated recursively, and we show online
proximal gradient iterations can be brought to bear to efficiently track the
time-varying solution of the inverse problem with quantifiable guarantees.
Specifically, we derive conditions under which the GSO recovery cost is
strongly convex and use this property to prove that the online algorithm
converges to within a neighborhood of the optimal time-varying batch solution.
Numerical tests illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed graph learning
approach in adapting to streaming information and tracking changes in the
sought dynamic network.

projects, notably cathedrals that took decades and in some cases centuries to
complete. Cathedrals are often taken as archetypes for long-term projects. In
this article, I will explore the cathedral from the point of view of project
management and systems architecting and draw implications for long-term
projects in the space domain, notably developing a starship. I will show that
the popular image of a cathedral as a continuous long-term project is in
contradiction to the current state of research. More specifically, I will show
that for the following propositions: The cathedrals were built based on an
initial detailed master plan; Building was a continuous process that adhered to
the master plan; Investments were continuously provided for the building
process. Although initial plans might have existed, the construction process
took often place in multiple campaigns, sometimes separated by decades. Such
interruptions made knowledge-preservation very challenging. The reason for the
long stretches of inactivity was mostly due to a lack of funding. Hence, the
availability of funding coincided with construction activity. These findings
paint a much more relevant picture of cathedral building for long-duration
projects today: How can a project be completed despite a range of uncertainties
regarding loss in skills, shortage in funding, and interruptions? It is
concluded that long-term projects such as an interstellar exploration program
can take inspiration from cathedrals by developing a modular architecture,
allowing for extensibility and flexibility, thinking about value delivery at an
early point, and establishing mechanisms and an organization for stable
funding.

predicate Constraint Satisfaction Problems called pCSP where constraints are
represented as clauses modulo first-order theories over function variables and
predicate variables that may represent well-founded predicates. The
verification framework generalizes an existing one based on Constrained Horn
Clauses (CHCs) to arbitrary clauses, function variables, and well-foundedness
constraints. While it is known that the satisfiability of CHCs and the validity
of queries for Constrained Logic Programs (CLP) are inter-reducible, we show
that, thanks to the added expressiveness, pCSP is expressive enough to express
muCLP queries. muCLP itself is a new extension of CLP that we propose in this
paper. It extends CLP with arbitrarily nested inductive and co-inductive
predicates and is equi-expressive as first-order fixpoint logic. We show that
muCLP can naturally encode a wide variety of verification problems including
but not limited to termination/non-termination verification and even full modal
mu-calculus model checking of programs written in various languages. To
establish our verification framework, we present (1) a sound and complete
reduction algorithm from muCLP to pCSP and (2) a constraint solving method for
pCSP based on stratified CounterExample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) of
(co-)inductive invariants, ranking functions, and Skolem functions witnessing
existential quantifiers. Stratified CEGIS combines CEGIS with stratified
families of templates to achieve relative completeness and faster and stable
convergence of CEGIS by avoiding the overfitting problem. We have implemented
the proposed framework and obtained promising results on diverse verification

fully explained by a non-equilibrium, nanoscale modulation of the chemical
composition of the films. This modulation leads to a magnetic domain pattern of
nanoscale speckles superimposed on a background of in-plane domains that form
Laudau configurations in micron-scale patterned elements. It is this speckle
magnetic structure that gives rise to a sharp two step-reversal mechanism that

dominantly populates the single electron bin. An undulating signal could also
reveal precious dark sector information after discovery. In this regard we

and Linial-Rabinovich in the late 80's. How large must the independence number
$\alpha(G)$ of a graph $G$ be whose every $m$ vertices contain an independent
set of size $r$? In this paper we discuss new methods to attack this problem.
The first new approach, based on bounding Ramsey numbers of certain graphs,
allows us to improve previously best lower bounds due to Linial-Rabinovich,
Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal and Alon-Sudakov. As an example, we prove that any $n$-vertex
graph $G$ having an independent set of size $3$ among every $7$ vertices has
$\alpha(G) \ge \Omega(n^{5/12})$. This confirms a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and
Hajnal that $\alpha(G)$ should be at least $n^{1/3+\varepsilon}$ and brings the
exponent half-way to the best possible value of $1/2$. Our second approach
deals with upper bounds. It relies on a reduction of the original question to
the following natural extremal problem. What is the minimum possible value of
the $2$-density of a graph on $m$ vertices having no independent set of size
$r$? This allows us to improve previous upper bounds due to Linial-Rabinovich,
Krivelevich and Kostochka-Jancey. As part of our arguments we link the problem
of Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal and Linial-Rabinovich and our new extremal $2$-density
problem to a number of other well-studied questions. This leads to many
interesting directions for future research.

a light, solar-mass black hole (BH) - neutron star (NS) merger. We explore two
exotic scenarios involving primordial black holes (PBH) that could produce such
an event, taking into account available observational information on NGC 4993.
First, we entertain the possibility of dynamical NS-PBH binary formation where
a solar-mass PBH and a NS form a binary through gravitational interaction. We
find that while dynamical NS-PBH formation could account for the GW170817
event, the rate is highly dependent on unknown density contrast factors and
could potentially be affected by galaxy mergers. We also find that PBH-PBH
binaries would likely have a larger merger rate, assuming the density contrast
boost factor of an order similar to the NS-PBH case. These exotic merger
formations could provide new channels to account for the volumetric rate of
compact-object mergers reported by LIGO/Virgo. Secondly, we consider the case
where one of the NS's in a binary NS system is imploded by a microscopic PBH.
We find that the predicted rate for NS implosion into a BH is very small, at
least for the specific environment of NGC 4993. We point out that similar
existing (e.g. GW190425 and GW190814) and future observations will shed
additional light on these scenarios.

Galactic outer disc to the inner disc (4 < r < 8 kpc) based on the SDSS/APOGEE
survey. Different from the outer disc, the inner disc stars exhibit a clear
bimodal distribution in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. While a number of scenarios
have been proposed in the literature, it remains challenging to recover this
bimodal distribution with theoretical models. To this end, we present a
chemical evolution model embedding a complex multi-phase inner disc formation
scenario that matches the observed bimodal [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution. In this
scenario, the formation of the inner disc is dominated by two main starburst
episodes 6 Gyr apart with secular, low-level star formation activity in
between. In our model, the first starburst occurs at early cosmic times (t~1
Gyr) and the second one 6 Gyr later at a cosmic time of t~7 Gyr. Both these
starburst episodes are associated with gas accretion events in our model, and
are quenched rapidly. The first starburst leads to the formation of the
high-$\alpha$ sequence, and the second starburst leads to the formation of the
metal-poor low-$\alpha$ sequence. The metal-rich low-$\alpha$ stars, instead,
form during the secular evolution phase between the two bursts. Our model shows
that the $\alpha$-dichotomy originates from the rapid suppression of star
formation after the first starburst. The two starburst episodes are likely to
be responsible for the formation of the geometric thick disc (z >1 kpc), with
the old inner thick disc and the young outer thick disc forming during the
first and the second starbursts, respectively.

for hot jupiter hosts and main-sequence contact binaries in Gaia DR2, and
compare the very wide companion fractions with their object-by-object-matched
field star samples. We find that $11.9\pm 2.5$% of hot jupiter hosts and
$14.1\pm 1.0$% of contact binaries have companions at separations of
$10^3-10^4$ AU. While the very wide companion fraction of hot jupiter hosts is
a factor of $1.9\pm0.5$ larger than their matched field star sample, it is
consistent, within $\sim1\sigma$, with that of matched field stars if the
matching is only with field stars without close companions (within $\sim50$ AU)
as is the case for hot jupiter hosts. The very wide companion fraction of
contact binaries is a factor of $3.1\pm0.5$ larger than their matched field
star sample, suggesting that the formation and evolution of contact binaries
are either tied to or correlated with the presence of wide companions. In
contrast, the weak enhancement of very wide companion fraction for hot jupiter
hosts implies that the formation of hot jupiters is not as sensitive to those
environment properties. Our results also hint that the occurrence rates of dual
hot jupiter hosts and dual contact binaries may be higher than the expected
values from random pairing of field stars, which may be due to their underlying
metallicity and age dependence.

through a comprehensive set of evolutionary phases from atomic gas clouds to
unembedded young stellar populations. In this paper, we present an empirical
determination of the lifetime of atomic clouds using the Uncertainty Principle
for Star Formation formalism, based on the de-correlation of H$\alpha$ and
H\,{\sc i} emission as a function of spatial scale. We find an atomic gas cloud
lifetime of 48$\substack{+13\\-8}$\,Myr. This timescale is consistent with the
predicted average atomic cloud lifetime in the LMC (based on galactic dynamics)
that is dominated by the gravitational collapse of the mid-plane ISM. We also
determine the overlap time-scale for which both H\,{\sc i} and H$\alpha$
emission are present to be very short ($t_{over}<1.7$\,Myr), consistent with
zero, indicating that there is a near-to-complete phase change of the gas to a
molecular form in an intermediary stage between H\,{\sc i} clouds and H\,{\sc

empirically determined limits on the time-scale of molecular cloud formation.

included, we find that the most extreme star forming environment in the LMC has
little effect on the measured average atomic gas cloud lifetime. By measuring
the lifetime of the atomic gas clouds, we place strong constraints on the

scales is notoriously difficult. To address this challenge, we introduce the
Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). This framework holds for superhorizon
modes whose comoving momentum is far below the UV scale, which is set by the
inverse comoving horizon. The SdSET is formulated using the same approach that
yields the Heavy Quark Effective Theory. The degrees of freedom that capture
the long wavelength dynamics are identified with the growing and decaying
solutions to the equations of motion. The operator expansion is organized using
a power counting scheme, and loops can be regulated while respecting the low
energy symmetries. For massive quantum fields in a fixed de Sitter background,
power counting implies that all interactions beyond the horizon are irrelevant.
Alternatively, if the fields are very light, the leading interactions are at
most marginal, and resumming the associated logarithms using (dynamical)
renormalization group techniques yields the evolution equation for canonical
stochastic inflation. The SdSET is also applicable to models where gravity is
dynamical, including inflation. In this case, diffeomorphism invariance ensures
that all interactions are irrelevant, trivially implying the all-orders
conservation of adiabatic density fluctuations and gravitational waves. We
briefly touch on the application to slow-roll eternal inflation by identifying
novel relevant operators. This work serves to demystify many aspects of
perturbation theory outside the horizon, and has a variety of applications to
problems of cosmological interest.

determination based on Gaia DR2 data. All of these calibrations have similar

evolution is properly understood. However, observed clusters give us only a
single timeframe of their dynamical state. Therefore, finding present
observable data of clusters that are well correlated to their assembly history
constitutes an inestimable tool for cosmology. Former studies correlating
environmental descriptors of clusters to their formation history are dominated
by halo mass - environment relations. This paper presents a mass-free
correlation between the present neighbor distribution of cluster-size halos and
the latter mass assembly history. From the Big Multidark simulation, we extract
two large samples of random halos with masses ranging from Virgo to Coma
cluster sizes. Additionally, to find the main environmental culprit for the
formation history of the Virgo cluster, we compare the Virgo-size halos to 200
Virgo-like halos extracted from simulations that resemble the local Universe.
The number of neighbors at different cluster-centric distances permits
discriminating between clusters with different mass accretion histories.
Similarly to Virgo-like halos, clusters with numerous neighbors within a
distance of about 2 times their virial radius experience a transition at z~1
between an active period of mass accretion, relative to the mean, and a quiet
history. On the contrary, clusters with few neighbors share an opposite trend:
from passive to active assembly histories. Additionally, clusters with massive
companions within about 4 times their virial radius tend to have recent active
merging histories. Therefore, the radial distribution of cluster neighbors
provides invaluable insights into the past history of these objects.

$\sim$50% of galaxies in these clusters are bulge-dominated compared to
$\sim$30% in the field, and they are significantly more compact. This result is
more significant for low-mass galaxies with $\log M/M_\odot \lessapprox 10.5$,

drives the chemodynamical evolution of a low-mass, isolated dwarf galaxy using
a suite of high-resolution simulations. Our model follows individual star
particles sampled randomly from an adopted initial mass function, considering
independently feedback from: supernovae; stellar radiation causing
photoelectric heating of dust grains, ionization and associated heating,
Lyman-Werner (LW) dissociation of H$_2$, and radiation pressure; and winds from
massive main sequence (neglecting their energy input) and asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars. Radiative transfer is done by ray tracing. We consider the
effects each of these processes have on regulating the star formation rate,
global properties, multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), and driving of
galactic winds. We follow individual metal species from distinct
nucleosynthetic enrichment channels (AGB winds, massive star stellar winds,
core collapse and Type Ia supernovae) and pay particular attention to how these
feedback processes regulate metal mixing in the ISM, the metal content of
outflows, and the stellar abundance patterns in our galaxy. We find that---for
a low-metallicity, low-mass dwarf galaxy ---stellar radiation, particularly
ionizing radiation and LW radiation, are important sources of stellar feedback
whose effects dominate over photoelectric heating and HI radiation pressure.
However, feedback is coupled non-linearly, and the inclusion or exclusion of
each process produces non-negligible effects. We find strong variations with:
the star formation history; the ejection fractions of metals, mass, and energy;
and the distribution of elements from different nucleosynthetic sources in both

dark sectors with feeble couplings to the standard model. Prime targets are
dark matter scenarios where co-scattering or co-annihilation sets the relic
abundance upon freeze-out. At the LHC, searches for soft displaced leptons are
challenged by a large background from hadron or tau lepton decays. In this
article, we present an analysis tailored for displaced leptons with a low
transverse momentum threshold at 20 GeV. Using a neural network, we perform a
comprehensive analysis of the event kinematics, including a study of the
expected detection efficiencies and backgrounds at small momenta. Our results
show that weak-scale particles decaying into soft leptons with decay lengths
between 1mm and 1m can be probed with LHC Run 2 data. This motivates the need
for dedicated triggers that maximize the sensitivity to displaced soft leptons.

previous results which showed that $\alpha$ is the primary indicator of halo
assembly bias for a number of halo properties beyond halo mass, we then extend
our analytical framework to accommodate the dependence of $b_1$ and $b_2$ on
any such secondary property which has, or can be monotonically transformed to

galaxy assembly bias, as well as analytical forecasts of the potential for
using $\alpha$ as a segregating variable in multi-tracer analyses.

optical afterglow with $i\approx25.1$~mag, at an angular offset of 0.59 $\pm$
0.16$''$ from its host galaxy. Using $grizYJHK$ observations, we measure a
photometric redshift of the host galaxy of $z = 1.77^{+0.30}_{-0.17}$. From a
combination of Gemini and Keck spectroscopy of the host galaxy spanning
4500-18000~\AA , we detect a single emission line at 13390~\AA, inferred as
H$\beta$ at $z = 1.754 \pm 0.001$ and corroborating the photometric redshift.

distant secure SGRB with an optical afterglow detection, and one of only three
at $z>1.5$. Motivated by a growing number of high-$z$ SGRBs, we explore the
effects of a missing $z>1.5$ SGRB population among the current {\it Swift}
sample on delay time distribution models. We find that log-normal models with
mean delay times of $\approx 4-6$~Gyr are consistent with the observed
distribution, but can be ruled out to $95\%$ confidence with an additional
$\approx1-5$~{\it Swift} SGRBs recovered at $z>1.5$. In contrast, power-law
models with $\propto$ $t^{-1}$ are consistent with the redshift distribution
and can accommodate up to $\approx30$ SGRBs at these redshifts. Under this
model, we predict that $\approx 1/3$ of the current {\it Swift} population of
SGRBs is at $z>1$. The future discovery or recovery of existing high-$z$ SGRBs
will provide significant discriminating power on their delay time
distributions, and thus their formation channels.

matter. The temperature-dependence of viscosity is used to adjust process
variables for glass-making, from melting to annealing. The aim of this work was
to develop a physics-informed machine learning model capable of predicting
$\eta(T)$ of oxide liquids. Instead of predicting the viscosity itself, the NN
predicts the parameters of the MYEGA viscosity equation: the liquid's fragility
index, the glass transition temperature, and the asymptotic viscosity. With
these parameters, $\eta$ can be computed at any temperature of interest, with
the advantage of good extrapolation capabilities inherent to the MYEGA
equation. The dataset was collected from the SciGlass database; only oxide
liquids with enough data points in the high and low viscosity regions were
selected, resulting in a final dataset with 17,584 data points containing 847
different liquids. About 600 features were engineered from the liquids'
chemical composition and 35 of these features were selected using a feature
selection protocol. The hyperparameter (HP) tuning of the NN was performed in a
set of experiments using both random search and Bayesian strategies, where a
total of 700 HP sets were tested. The most successful HP sets were further
tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and the one with the lowest average
validation loss was selected as the best set. The final trained NN was tested
with a test dataset of 85 liquids with different compositions than those used
for training and validating the NN. The $R^2$ for the test dataset's prediction
was 0.97. This work introduces three advantages: the model can predict
viscosity as well as the liquids' glass transition temperature and fragility
index; the model is designed and trained with a focus on extrapolation;
finally, the model is available as free and open-source software licensed under

distinct populations - classical, resonant, detached, and scattering - with a
>97 per cent accuracy for the testing set of 542 securely classified KBOs. Over
80 per cent of these objects have a $>3\sigma$ probability of class membership,
indicating that the machine learning method is classifying based on the
fundamental dynamical features of each population. We also demonstrate how, by
using computational savings over traditional methods, we can quickly derive a
distribution of class membership by examining an ensemble of object clones
drawn from the observational errors. We find two major reasons for
misclassification: inherent ambiguity in the orbit of the object - for
instance, an object that is on the edge of resonance - and a lack of
representative examples in the training set. This work provides a promising
avenue to explore for fast and accurate classification of the thousands of new

the trained model with robustness against adversarially manipulated input data,

testing data distributions, or among datasets stored at different workers. To
this aim, the data distribution is assumed unknown, and lies within a
Wasserstein ball centered around the empirical data distribution. This robust
learning task entails an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, which is
challenging. Leveraging a strong duality result, a surrogate is obtained, for
which three stochastic primal-dual algorithms are developed: i) stochastic
proximal gradient descent with an $\epsilon$-accurate oracle, which invokes an
oracle to solve the convex sub-problems; ii) stochastic proximal gradient
descent-ascent, which approximates the solution of the convex sub-problems via
a single gradient ascent step; and, iii) a distributionally robust federated
learning algorithm, which solves the sub-problems locally at different workers
where data are stored. Compared to the empirical risk minimization and
federated learning methods, the proposed algorithms offer robustness with
little computation overhead. Numerical tests using image datasets showcase the
merits of the proposed algorithms under several existing adversarial attacks

this was done by comparing the classical limit of the quantum tomograms with

to extend the previous results by taking the tomograms of the WKB solutions of
the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with a any potential. Furthermore in the previous

  Deep Neural Networks","Manuscript under review",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning for distribution grid optimization can be advocated as a
promising solution for near-optimal yet timely inverter dispatch. The principle
is to train a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the solutions of an optimal
power flow (OPF), thus shifting the computational effort from real-time to
offline. Nonetheless, before training this DNN, one has to solve a large number
of OPFs to create a labeled dataset. Granted the latter step can still be
prohibitive in time-critical applications, this work puts forth an original
technique for improving the prediction accuracy of DNNs by taking into account
the sensitivities of the OPF minimizers with respect to the OPF parameters. By
expanding on multiparametric programming, it is shown that although inverter
control problems may exhibit dual degeneracy, the required sensitivities do
exist in general and can be computed readily using the output of any standard
quadratic program (QP) solver. Numerical tests showcase that
sensitivity-informed deep learning can enhance prediction accuracy in terms of
mean square error (MSE) by 2-3 orders of magnitude at minimal computational
overhead. Improvements are more significant in the small-data regime, where a
DNN has to learn to optimize using a few examples. Beyond multiparametric QPs,
the approach is currently being generalized to parametric (non)-convex

applying block diagonal preprocessing to the matrix and then compressing
appropriate scaled off-diagonal blocks. Here, we use an enhanced
scaling-and-compression strategy to design the new eSIF preconditioner. Some
subtle modifications are made, such as the use of two-sided block triangular
preprocessing. A practical multilevel eSIF scheme is then designed. We give
rigorous analysis for both the enhanced scaling-and-compression strategy and
the multilevel eSIF preconditioner. The new eSIF framework has some significant
advantages and overcomes some major limitations of the SIF strategy. (i) With
the same tolerance for compressing the off-diagonal blocks, the eSIF
preconditioner can approximate the original matrix to a much higher accuracy.
(ii) The new preconditioner leads to much more significant reductions of
condition numbers due to an accelerated magnification effect for the decay in
the singular values of the scaled off-diagonal blocks. (iii) With the new
preconditioner, the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are much better
clustered around $1$. (iv) The multilevel eSIF preconditioner is further
unconditionally robust or is guaranteed to be positive definite without the
need of extra stabilization, while the multilevel SIF preconditioner has a
strict requirement in order to preserve positive definiteness. Comprehensive
numerical tests are used to show the advantages of the eSIF preconditioner in
accelerating the convergence of iterative solutions.

conduct supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in the form of mass
vaccination campaigns, in addition to delivering scheduled vaccination through
routine immunization (RI) programs. To achieve balanced implementations of RI
and SIAs, robust measurement of sub-national RI-specific coverage is crucial.
In this paper, we develop a space-time smoothing model for estimating
RI-specific coverage of the first dose of measles-containing-vaccines (MCV1) at
sub-national level using complex survey data. The application that motivated
this work is estimation of the RI-specific MCV1 coverage in Nigeria's 36 states
and the Federal Capital Territory. Data come from four Demographic and Health
Surveys, three Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and two National Nutrition
and Health Surveys conducted in Nigeria between 2003 and 2018. Our method
incorporates information from the SIA calendar published by the World Health
Organization and accounts for the impact of SIAs on the overall MCV1 coverage,
as measured by cross-sectional surveys. The model can be used to analyze data
from multiple surveys with different data collection schemes and construct
coverage estimates with uncertainty that reflects the various sampling designs.
Implementation of our method can be done efficiently using integrated nested

in relatively twisted lattices is studied by multiple scattering theory. It is
found that, for a given frequency, it is always possible to find localized
modes for a discrete set of rotation angles, analogous to the so-called ""magic
angles"" recently found in two-dimensional materials like graphene. Similarly,
for small rotations of the lattices, a large number of resonant frequencies is
found, whose position strongly depends on the rotation angle. Moreover, for
angles close to those that make the two lattices commensurable a single mode
appears that can be easily tuned by the rotation angle. Unlike other twisted
materials, where the properties of the bilayers are mainly explained in terms
of the dispersion relation of the individual lattices, the special angles in
these clusters happen because of the formation of dipolar scatterers due to the
relative rotation between the two lattices, enhancing therefore their
interaction. While the presented results are valid for any type of wave, the
specific case of flexural waves in thin elastic plates is numerically studied,
and the different modes found are comprehensively explained in terms of the
interaction between pairs of scatterers. The analysis presented here shows that
these structures are promising candidates for the inverse design of tunable
wave-trapping devices for classical waves.

building trust in computer generated findings. When it comes to complex systems
in domains of science that are less firmly grounded in theory, notably biology
and medicine, to say nothing of the social sciences and humanities, computers
can create the illusion of objectivity, not least because the rise of big data
and machine learning pose new challenges to reproducibility, while lacking true
explanatory power. We also discuss important aspects of the natural world which
cannot be solved by digital means. In the long-term, renewed emphasis on
analogue methods will be necessary to temper the excessive faith currently

probabilistically-safe, meta-active learning approach to efficiently learn
system dynamics and optimal configurations. We cast this problem as
meta-learning an acquisition function, which is represented by a Long-Short
Term Memory Network (LSTM) encoding sampling history. This acquisition function
is meta-learned offline to learn high quality sampling strategies. We employ a
mixed-integer linear program as our policy with the final, linearized layers of
our LSTM acquisition function directly encoded into the objective to trade off
expected information gain (e.g., improvement in the accuracy of the model of
system dynamics) with the likelihood of safe control. We set a new
state-of-the-art in active learning for control of a high-dimensional system
with altered dynamics (i.e., a damaged aircraft), achieving a 46% increase in
information gain and a 20% speedup in computation time over baselines.
Furthermore, we demonstrate our system's ability to learn the optimal parameter
settings for deep brain stimulation in a rat's brain while avoiding unwanted

first layer allows for accurate DOI extraction using a single threshold
relative to the PD sum signal, for up to 4 layers. The number of PD pixels
exceeding the threshold corresponds to the layer of interaction. The
corresponding approach is not possible for the same geometries with a light
sharing readout scheme. 2) When employing a low threshold of 2 optical photons
the layered approach with one-to-one readout of the first layer improves timing
close to the PD compared to single layer, due to reduced crystal thickness.
Single detector timing resolution values of 91, 127, 151 and 164 ps were seen
in the 4-layer design with unpolished pixels, compared to 148 ps for single

model without sharing their potentially sensitive data. This makes FL suitable
for privacy-preserving applications. At the same time, FL is susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to decentralized and unvetted data. One important line
of attacks against FL is the backdoor attacks. In a backdoor attack, an
adversary tries to embed a backdoor functionality to the model during training
that can later be activated to cause a desired misclassification. To prevent
backdoor attacks, we propose a lightweight defense that requires minimal change
to the FL protocol. At a high level, our defense is based on carefully
adjusting the aggregation server's learning rate, per dimension and per round,
based on the sign information of agents' updates. We first conjecture the
necessary steps to carry a successful backdoor attack in FL setting, and then,
explicitly formulate the defense based on our conjecture. Through experiments,
we provide empirical evidence that supports our conjecture, and we test our
defense against backdoor attacks under different settings. We observe that
either backdoor is completely eliminated, or its accuracy is significantly
reduced. Overall, our experiments suggest that our defense significantly
outperforms some of the recently proposed defenses in the literature. We
achieve this by having minimal influence over the accuracy of the trained
models. In addition, we also provide convergence rate analysis for our proposed

water gravity waves with a draining bathtub vortex, a system which constitutes
the analogue of a rotating black hole in the non-dispersive limit. In

the light-ring frequencies, a concept routinely applied in black hole physics,

find that the frequency range in which the reflected wave is superradiantly

the condition to observe this amplification is complicated by the fact that a

key challenge in realizing the benefits of these topologies is routing. On one
hand, these networks provide shorter path lengths than established topologies

the number of shortest paths between each pair of endpoints is much smaller
than in Clos, but there is a large number of non-minimal paths between router

routing schemes such as ECMP. In this work, to facilitate high-performance
routing in modern networks, we analyze existing routing protocols and
architectures, focusing on how well they exploit the diversity of minimal and
non-minimal paths. We first develop a taxonomy of different forms of support
for multipathing and overall path diversity. Then, we analyze how existing
routing schemes support this diversity. Among others, we consider multipathing
with both shortest and non-shortest paths, support for disjoint paths, or
enabling adaptivity. To address the ongoing convergence of HPC and ""Big Data""

address this issue, we propose a SofGAN image generator to decouple the latent

The latent codes sampled from the two subspaces are fed to two network branches
separately, one to generate the 3D geometry of portraits with canonical pose,
and the other to generate textures. The aligned 3D geometries also come with
semantic part segmentation, encoded as a semantic occupancy field (SOF). The
SOF allows the rendering of consistent 2D semantic segmentation maps at
arbitrary views, which are then fused with the generated texture maps and
stylized to a portrait photo using our semantic instance-wise (SIW) module.
Through extensive experiments, we show that our system can generate high
quality portrait images with independently controllable geometry and texture
attributes. The method also generalizes well in various applications such as
appearance-consistent facial animation and dynamic styling.

number of Dirac fermions is taken to be $N_f=1/4$ (GNY) and $N_f=1/2$ (NJLY)
these models relate to the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino (WZ) theory with cubic
superpotential and one superfield. In this case the results show that the
strong-weak entropy density ratio decreases from the Stefan-Boltzmann value, in
the weak limit, to $s/s_{free}=31/35$ at strong couplings. This value agrees
with the one recently obtained by applying the large-$N$ approximation to the
supersymmetric $O(N)$ WZ model with quartic superpotential and $N$ superfields.
When $N_f=0$ one obtains $s/s_{free}=4/5$ recovering, as expected, the ratio
predicted in the context of the $O(N)$ scalar model. However, contrary to the
$O(N)$ WZ model the simple Yukawa models analyzed here do not behave as CFTs
for all couplings since the conformal measure exactly vanishes only at the
extreme weak and strong limits although the speed of sound indicates that the
deviation, at intermediate couplings, appears to be rather small. By comparing
the thermal masses behavior in each case one can trace this difference as being
a consequence that in the GNY/NJLY case the fermionic mass vanishes for all
couplings while within the $O(N)$ WZ it only vanishes at the weak and strong
limits. On the other hand, the Yukawa bosonic dimensionless masses display a
more universal behavior decreasing from $2 \ln [(1+\sqrt{5})/2]$, at infinite
coupling, to zero (at vanishing coupling).

These datasets can be considered as representations of the landscape of all

number of stereotypical routes, characterized by `points of no return' and
`final states' (such as lethal or recovery states). Extracting this information
directly from the data remains challenging, especially in the case of
synchronic (with a short-term follow up) observations. Here we suggest a
semi-supervised methodology for the analysis of large clinical datasets,
characterized by mixed data types and missing values, through modeling the
geometrical data structure as a bouquet of bifurcating clinical trajectories.
The methodology is based on application of elastic principal graphs which can
address simultaneously the tasks of dimensionality reduction, data
visualization, clustering, feature selection and quantifying the geodesic
distances (pseudotime) in partially ordered sequences of observations. The
methodology allows positioning a patient on a particular clinical trajectory
(pathological scenario) and characterizing the degree of progression along it
with a qualitative estimate of the uncertainty of the prognosis. Overall, our
pseudo-time quantification-based approach gives a possibility to apply the
methods developed for dynamical disease phenotyping and illness trajectory
analysis (diachronic data analysis) to synchronic observational data. We
developed a tool $ClinTrajan$ for clinical trajectory analysis implemented in

describe the so-called Majorana particle is the Dirac equation with a real
Lorentz scalar potential plus the so-called Majorana condition. Certainly,
depending on the representation that one uses, the resulting differential
equation changes. It could be a real or a complex system of coupled equations,
or it could even be a single complex equation for a single component of the
entire wave function. Any of these equations or systems of equations could be
referred to as a Majorana equation or Majorana system of equations because it
can be used to describe the Majorana particle. For example, in the Weyl
representation, in (3+1) dimensions, we can have two non-equivalent explicitly
covariant complex first-order equations; in contrast, in (1+1) dimensions, we
have a complex system of coupled equations. In any case, whichever equation or
system of equations is used, the wave function that describes the Majorana
particle in (3+1) or (1+1) dimensions is determined by four or two real
quantities. The aim of this paper is to study and discuss all these issues from
an algebraic point of view, highlighting the similarities and differences that
arise between these equations in the cases of (3+1) and (1+1) dimensions in the

task, we rederive and use results that come from a procedure already introduced

Likewise, we introduce for the first time a somewhat analogous procedure in

processes in cell biology such as the protrusion of lamellipodia, propulsion of
growth cones in dendrites of neurons, intracellular transport of organelles and
pathogens, among others. The forces required for these mechanical functions
have been deduced from mechano-chemical models of actin polymerization; most
models are focused on single growing filaments, and only a few address
polymerization of filament networks through simulations. Here we propose a
continuum model of surface growth and filament nucleation to describe
polymerization of dendritic actin networks. The model describes growth and
elasticity in terms of macroscopic stresses, strains and filament density
rather than focusing on individual filaments. The microscopic processes
underlying polymerization are subsumed into kinetic laws characterizing the
change of filament density and the propagation of growing surfaces. This
continuum model can predict the evolution of actin networks in disparate
experiments. A key conclusion of the analysis is that existing laws relating
force to polymerization speed of single filaments cannot predict the response
of growing networks. Therefore a new kinetic law, consistent with the
dissipation inequality, is proposed to capture the evolution of dendritic actin
networks under different loading conditions. This model may be extended to
other settings involving a more complex interplay between mechanical stresses
and polymerization kinetics, such as the growth of networks of microtubules,
collagen filaments, intermediate filaments and carbon nanotubes.

Here, using monolayer MoS2 as a model system and an organic reductant based on

animating this letter. Covariant density functional theory provides a unique
framework to investigate both the properties of finite nuclei and neutron
stars, while enforcing causality at all densities. By tuning existing energy
density functionals we were able to: (a) account for a 2.6 Msun neutron star,
(b) satisfy the original constraint on the tidal deformability of a 1.4 Msun

for the class of models explored in this work, we find that the stiffening of
the equation of state required to support super-massive neutron stars is
inconsistent with either constraints obtained from energetic heavy-ion
collisions or from the low deformability of medium-mass stars. Thus, we
speculate that the maximum neutron star mass can not be significantly higher
than the existing observational limit and that the 2.6 Msun compact object is
likely to be the lightest black hole ever discovered.

  Aims. To investigate the impact of correlated energy uncertainties on
reaction rates.
  Methods. Using a combination of numerical and Monte Carlo variation of
resonance energies, the effect of correlations are investigated. Five reactions
are considered: two fictional, illustrative cases and three reactions whose
rates are of current interest.
  Results. The effect of correlations in resonance energies depends on the
specific reaction cross section and temperatures considered. When several
resonances contribute equally to a reaction rate, and are located either side
of the Gamow peak, correlations between their energies dilute their effect on
reaction rate uncertainties. If they are both located above or below the
maximum of the Gamow peak, however, correlations between their resonance
energies can increase the reaction rate uncertainties. This effect can be hard
to predict for complex reactions with wide and narrow resonances contributing
to the reaction rate.

three model alloys. Nucleation kinetics of isolated bands and characteristic

required for band nucleation. The nucleation stress bears little dependence on
the normal stress and is proportional to the shear modulus. These properties
are quite akin to those governing the onset of dislocation slip in crystalline
solids. A change in the flow mode from shear banding to homogeneous plastic
flow occurs at stress levels below the nucleation stress. Phase diagrams
delineating the strain, strain rate and temperature domains where these two
contrasting flow modes occur are presented. Our work enables interpretation of

significantly affect the vulnerability of user-chosen passwords to guessing

justifiable, with a tendency for system administrators to choose password
composition policies based on intuition alone. In this work, we propose a novel
methodology that draws on password probability distributions constructed from
large sets of real-world password data which have been filtered according to
various password composition policies. Password probabilities are then
redistributed to simulate different user password reselection behaviours in
order to automatically determine the password composition policy that will
induce the distribution of user-chosen passwords with the greatest uniformity,
a metric which we show to be a useful proxy to measure overall resistance to
password guessing attacks. Further, we show that by fitting power-law equations
to the password probability distributions we generate, we can justify our
choice of password composition policy without any direct access to user
password data. Finally, we present Skeptic---a software toolkit that implements
this methodology, including a DSL to enable system administrators with no
background in password security to compare and rank password composition
policies without resorting to expensive and time-consuming user studies.
Drawing on 205,176,321 pass words across 3 datasets, we lend validity to our

create novel quantum phases of matter. Most topological electronic phases
appear in systems with weak electron-electron interactions. The instances where
topological phases emerge only as a result of strong interactions are rare, and
mostly limited to those realized in the presence of intense magnetic fields.
The discovery of flat electronic bands with topological character in
magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has created a unique opportunity
to search for new strongly correlated topological phases. Here we introduce a
novel local spectroscopic technique using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
to detect a sequence of topological insulators in MATBG with Chern numbers C =
$\pm$ 1, $\pm$ 2, $\pm$ 3, which form near $\nu$ = $\pm$ 3, $\pm$ 2, $\pm$ 1
electrons per moir\'e unit cell respectively, and are stabilized by the
application of modest magnetic fields. One of the phases detected here (C = +1)
has been previously observed when the sublattice symmetry of MATBG was
intentionally broken by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, with
interactions playing a secondary role. We demonstrate that strong
electron-electron interactions alone can produce not only the previously
observed phase, but also new and unexpected Chern insulating phases in MATBG.
The full sequence of phases we observed can be understood by postulating that
strong correlations favor breaking time-reversal symmetry to form Chern
insulators that are stabilized by weak magnetic fields. Our findings illustrate
that many-body correlations can create topological phases in moir\'e systems
beyond those anticipated from weakly interacting models.

  Identification",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Differentially private SGD (DP-SGD) is one of the most popular methods for
solving differentially private empirical risk minimization (ERM). Due to its
noisy perturbation on each gradient update, the error rate of DP-SGD scales
with the ambient dimension $p$, the number of parameters in the model. Such
dependence can be problematic for over-parameterized models where $p \gg n$,
the number of training samples. Existing lower bounds on private ERM show that
such dependence on $p$ is inevitable in the worst case. In this paper, we
circumvent the dependence on the ambient dimension by leveraging a
low-dimensional structure of gradient space in deep networks -- that is, the
stochastic gradients for deep nets usually stay in a low dimensional subspace
in the training process. We propose Projected DP-SGD that performs noise
reduction by projecting the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace,
which is given by the top gradient eigenspace on a small public dataset. We
provide a general sample complexity analysis on the public dataset for the
gradient subspace identification problem and demonstrate that under certain
low-dimensional assumptions the public sample complexity only grows
logarithmically in $p$. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluations to show that our method can substantially improve the
accuracy of DP-SGD in the high privacy regime (corresponding to low privacy

one of several strengthened versions of the universal approximation property

subdural hemorrhage and/or increasing intracranial pressure. In these cases, CT
scans are obtained to diagnose and assess injuries, or guide a certain therapy

  We propose a deep learning based method to reconstruct the skull defect

reconstruction is useful in multiple scenarios, e.g. to support the creation of
cranioplasty plates, accurate measurements of bone flap volume and total
intracranial volume, important for studies that aim to relate later atrophy to
patient outcome. We propose and compare alternative self-supervised methods
where an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) estimates the
missing bone flap on post-operative CTs. The self-supervised learning strategy
only requires images with complete skulls and avoids the need for annotated DC

the results with other state-of-the-art approaches. The experiments show that
the proposed model outperforms current manual methods, enabling reconstruction

mapping between entanglement entropies and domain wall free energies of an
underlying spin model, we propose a statistical mechanical description of the
QECC in terms of ""entanglement domain walls"". Free energies of such domain
walls generically feature a leading volume law term coming from its ""surface
energy"", and a sub-volume law correction coming from thermodynamic entropies of
its transverse fluctuations. These are most easily accounted for by
capillary-wave theory of liquid-gas interfaces, which we use as an illustrative
tool. We show that the information-theoretic decoupling criterion corresponds
to a geometric decoupling of domain walls, which further leads to the
identification of the ""contiguous code distance"" of the QECC as the crossover
length scale at which the energy and entropy of the domain wall are comparable.
The contiguous code distance thus diverges with the system size as the
subleading entropic term of the free energy, protecting a finite code rate
against local undetectable errors. We support these correspondences with
numerical evidence, where we find capillary-wave theory describes many
qualitative features of the QECC; we also discuss when and why it fails to do
so.

within many domains. Despite their promising performance, deep networks have
shown sensitivities to perturbations of their inputs (e.g., adversarial
examples) and their learned feature representations are often difficult to
interpret, raising concerns about their true capability and trustworthiness.
Recent work in adversarial training, a form of robust optimization in which the
model is optimized against adversarial examples, demonstrates the ability to
improve performance sensitivities to perturbations and yield feature
representations that are more interpretable. Adversarial training, however,
comes with an increased computational cost over that of standard (i.e.,
nonrobust) training, rendering it impractical for use in large-scale problems.
Recent work suggests that a fast approximation to adversarial training shows
promise for reducing training time and maintaining robustness in the presence
of perturbations bounded by the infinity norm. In this work, we demonstrate
that this approach extends to the Euclidean norm and preserves the
human-aligned feature representations that are common for robust models.
Additionally, we show that using a distributed training scheme can further
reduce the time to train robust deep networks. Fast adversarial training is a
promising approach that will provide increased security and explainability in
machine learning applications for which robust optimization was previously
thought to be impractical.

Moreover, by calculating the winding number, a topological phase transition can
be revealed with the increase of potential amplitude, and we find that the
behavior is quite different from the single-particle systems. Based on our
numerical results, we conjecture that these three types of phase transition
occur at the same point in the thermodynamic limit, and the MBL transition of

spectra corresponds to solving a complicated inverse problem. Once trained, the

the intensity profile near the calculated G-band to be the most important

synchronization protocols require multiple timestamp exchanges to estimate skew
between the clocks of CRN nodes. The proposed symbol timing recovery method
already estimates the skew of hardware clock at the physical layer and use it
for skew correction of application layer clock of each node. The heart of
application layer clock is the hardware clock and hence application layer clock
skew will be same as of physical layer and can be corrected from symbol timing

conserves the energy utilized by application layer protocol and makes a CRN
energy efficient and can achieve time synchronization in short span.

simulation (MCs) is a nonintrusive method to evaluate such impact that can be

convection in the whole space are shown to exist through perturbations of
Dyson's isothermal affine solutions. This setting presents new difficulties
because of the vacuum at infinity behavior of the density. In particular, the
perturbation of isothermal motion introduces a Gaussian function into our
stability analysis and a novel finite propagation result is proven to handle
potentially unbounded terms arising from the presence of the Gaussian. Crucial
stabilization-in-time effects of the background motion are mitigated through
the use of this finite propagation result however and a careful use of the heat
transport formulation in conjunction with new time weight manipulations are
used to establish global existence. The heat transport by convection offers
unique physical insights into the model and mathematically, we use a controlled
spatial perturbation in the analysis of this feature of our system which leads
us to exploit source term estimates as part of our techniques.

electric charge, with any non-conserved quantity such as net proton or net kaon

collaborating agents without requiring them to share their underlying data.
However, malicious agents who train on random data, or worse, on datasets with
the result classes inverted, can weaken the combined model. BlockFLow is an
accountable federated learning system that is fully decentralized and
privacy-preserving. Its primary goal is to reward agents proportional to the
quality of their contribution while protecting the privacy of the underlying
datasets and being resilient to malicious adversaries. Specifically, BlockFLow
incorporates differential privacy, introduces a novel auditing mechanism for
model contribution, and uses Ethereum smart contracts to incentivize good
behavior. Unlike existing auditing and accountability methods for federated
learning systems, our system does not require a centralized test dataset,
sharing of datasets between the agents, or one or more trusted auditors; it is
fully decentralized and resilient up to a 50% collusion attack in a malicious
trust model. When run on the public Ethereum blockchain, BlockFLow uses the
results from the audit to reward parties with cryptocurrency based on the
quality of their contribution. We evaluated BlockFLow on two datasets that
offer classification tasks solvable via logistic regression models. Our results
show that the resultant auditing scores reflect the quality of the honest
agents' datasets. Moreover, the scores from dishonest agents are statistically
lower than those from the honest agents. These results, along with the
reasonable blockchain costs, demonstrate the effectiveness of BlockFLow as an

The study is performed as a function of the relative transverse activity

the transverse region ($\pi/3<|\phi^{\rm trig.}-\phi^{\rm assoc.}|<2\pi/3$) of
the di-hadron correlations, and it is sensitive to the Multi-Parton

$R_{\rm T}$, while its corresponding yield is independent of $R_{\rm T}$.
Contrarily, the near-side yield increases with $R_{\rm T}$. This effect is

challenging, and the key for such an ill-posed problem is the 3D representation
of the human models. To overcome the limitations of regular 3D representations,
we propose Parametric Model-Conditioned Implicit Representation (PaMIR), which
combines the parametric body model with the free-form deep implicit function.
In our PaMIR-based reconstruction framework, a novel deep neural network is
proposed to regularize the free-form deep implicit function using the semantic
features of the parametric model, which improves the generalization ability
under the scenarios of challenging poses and various clothing topologies.
Moreover, a novel depth-ambiguity-aware training loss is further integrated to
resolve depth ambiguities and enable successful surface detail reconstruction
with imperfect body reference. Finally, we propose a body reference
optimization method to improve the parametric model estimation accuracy and to
enhance the consistency between the parametric model and the implicit function.
With the PaMIR representation, our framework can be easily extended to
multi-image input scenarios without the need of multi-camera calibration and
pose synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance for image-based 3D human reconstruction in the
cases of challenging poses and clothing types.

physics. In this letter, we generalize the Majorana zero modes to non-Hermitian
(NH) topological systems that show universal but quite different properties
from their Hermitian counterparts. Based on the NH Majorana zero modes, the
orthogonal and nonlocal Majorana qubits are well defined. In particular, due to
the particle-hole-symmetry breaking, NH Majorana zero modes have irrational
non-Abelian statistics with continuously tunable braiding Berry phase from pi/8
to 3pi/8. This is quite different from the usual non-Abelian statistics with
fixed braiding Berry phase pi/4 and becomes an example of ""irrational
topological phenomenon"". The one-dimensional NH Kitaev model is taken as an
example to numerically verify the irrational non-Abelian statistics for two NH
Majorana zero modes. The numerical results are exactly consistent with the
theoretical prediction. With the help of braiding these two zero modes, the
pi/8 gate can be reached and thus universal topological quantum computation

alternation fragments are known to be complete for the levels of the
exponential time hierarchy. We consider two types of restriction of this logic:
1) restrictions to term constructions, 2) restrictions to the form of the
Boolean matrix. Of the first sort, we consider two kinds of restrictions:
firstly, disallowing nested use of proper function variables, and secondly
stipulating that each function variable must appear with a fixed sequence of
arguments. Of the second sort, we consider Horn, Krom, and core fragments of
the Boolean matrix. We classify the complexity of logics obtained by combining
these two types of restrictions. We show that, in most cases, logics with k
alternating blocks of function quantifiers are complete for the kth or (k-1)th
level of the exponential time hierarchy. Furthermore, we establish
NL-completeness for the Krom and core fragments, when k=1 and both restrictions
of the first sort are in effect.

  segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Annotating multiple organs in medical images is both costly and
time-consuming; therefore, existing multi-organ datasets with labels are often
low in sample size and mostly partially labeled, that is, a dataset has a few
organs labeled but not all organs. In this paper, we investigate how to learn a
single multi-organ segmentation network from a union of such datasets. To this
end, we propose two types of novel loss function, particularly designed for
this scenario: (i) marginal loss and (ii) exclusion loss. Because the
background label for a partially labeled image is, in fact, a `merged' label of
all unlabelled organs and `true' background (in the sense of full labels), the
probability of this `merged' background label is a marginal probability,
summing the relevant probabilities before merging. This marginal probability
can be plugged into any existing loss function (such as cross entropy loss,
Dice loss, etc.) to form a marginal loss. Leveraging the fact that the organs
are non-overlapping, we propose the exclusion loss to gauge the dissimilarity
between labeled organs and the estimated segmentation of unlabelled organs.
Experiments on a union of five benchmark datasets in multi-organ segmentation
of liver, spleen, left and right kidneys, and pancreas demonstrate that using
our newly proposed loss functions brings a conspicuous performance improvement
for state-of-the-art methods without introducing any extra computation.

that the probability to correctly transfer single-spin eigenstates and two-spin

the future, state and process tomography will be required to verify the
transfer of arbitrary single qubit states with a fidelity exceeding the

flow of wealth. Economic actors can exploit them, at a cost, and bend that flow
in their favor. If intervention becomes widespread, microeconomic strategies of
different actors can collide or resonate, building into macroeconomic effects.
How viable is a `rigged' economy, and how is this viability affected by growing
economic complexity and wealth? Here we capture essential elements of `rigged'
economies with a toy model. Nash equilibria of payoff matrices in simple cases
show how increased intervention turns economic degrees of freedom from minority
into majority games through a dynamical phase. These stages are reproduced by
agent-based simulations of our model, which allow us to explore scenarios out
of reach for payoff matrices. Increasing economic complexity is then revealed
as a mechanism that spontaneously defuses cartels or consensus situations. But
excessive complexity enters abruptly into a regime of large fluctuations that
threaten the system's viability. This regime results from non-competitive
efforts to intervene the economy coupled across degrees of freedom, becoming
unpredictable. Thus non-competitive actions can result in negative spillover
due to sheer economic complexity. Simulations suggest that wealth must grow
faster than linearly with economic complexity to avoid this regime and keep
economies viable in the long run. Our work provides testable conclusions and
phenomenological charts to guide policing of `rigged' economic systems.

  Distribution Bias","Accepted at CVPR2021, Oral",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monocular depth predictors are typically trained on large-scale training sets
which are naturally biased w.r.t the distribution of camera poses. As a result,
trained predictors fail to make reliable depth predictions for testing examples
captured under uncommon camera poses. To address this issue, we propose two
novel techniques that exploit the camera pose during training and prediction.
First, we introduce a simple perspective-aware data augmentation that
synthesizes new training examples with more diverse views by perturbing the
existing ones in a geometrically consistent manner. Second, we propose a
conditional model that exploits the per-image camera pose as prior knowledge by
encoding it as a part of the input. We show that jointly applying the two
methods improves depth prediction on images captured under uncommon and even
never-before-seen camera poses. We show that our methods improve performance
when applied to a range of different predictor architectures. Lastly, we show
that explicitly encoding the camera pose distribution improves the
generalization performance of a synthetically trained depth predictor when
evaluated on real images.

and modeling scenes. Compared to a single camera, multi-cameras provide larger
field-of-view and more object cues, and the related applications are multi-view
counting, multi-view tracking, 3D pose estimation or 3D reconstruction, etc. It
is usually assumed that the cameras are all temporally synchronized when
designing models for these multi-camera based tasks. However, this assumption
is not always valid,especially for multi-camera systems with network
transmission delay and low frame-rates due to limited network bandwidth,
resulting in desynchronization of the captured frames across cameras. To handle
the issue of unsynchronized multi-cameras, in this paper, we propose a
synchronization model that works in conjunction with existing DNN-based
multi-view models, thus avoiding the redesign of the whole model. Under the
low-fps regime, we assume that only a single relevant frame is available from
each view, and synchronization is achieved by matching together image contents
guided by epipolar geometry. We consider two variants of the model, based on
where in the pipeline the synchronization occurs, scene-level synchronization
and camera-level synchronization. The view synchronization step and the
task-specific view fusion and prediction step are unified in the same framework
and trained in an end-to-end fashion. Our view synchronization models are
applied to different DNNs-based multi-camera vision tasks under the
unsynchronized setting, including multi-view counting and 3D pose estimation,
and achieve good performance compared to baselines.

Evaluation consists of running the previous and the proposed solutions on given

Existing uniform and non-uniform quantization methods, however, exhibit an
inherent conflict between the representing range and representing resolution,

drop. Moreover, these methods encounter three drawbacks: i) the absence of a
quantitative metric for in-depth analysis of the source of the quantization
errors; ii) the limited focus on the image classification tasks based on CNNs;
iii) the unawareness of the real hardware and energy consumption reduced by
lowering the bit-width. In this paper, we first define two quantitative
metrics, i.e., the Clipping Error and rounding error, to analyze the
quantization error distribution. We observe that the boundary- and rounding-
errors vary significantly across layers, models and tasks. Consequently, we
propose a novel quantization method to quantize the weight and activation. The
key idea is to Approximate the Uniform quantization by Adaptively Superposing
multiple Non-uniform quantized values, namely AUSN. AUSN is consist of a
decoder-free coding scheme that efficiently exploits the bit-width to its
extreme, a superposition quantization algorithm that can adapt the coding
scheme to different DNN layers, models and tasks without extra hardware design
effort, and a rounding scheme that can eliminate the well-known bit-width
overflow and re-quantization issues. Theoretical analysis~(see Appendix A) and
accuracy evaluation on various DNN models of different tasks show the
effectiveness and generalization of AUSN. The synthesis~(see Appendix B)
results on FPGA show $2\times$ reduction of the energy consumption, and
$2\times$ to $4\times$ reduction of the hardware resource.

apps, the smartphone users place a significant amount of trust towards the
security companies who developed these apps, because a fully functional mobile
security app requires access to many smartphone resources such as the storage,
text messages and email, browser history, and information about other installed
applications. Often these resources contain highly sensitive personal
information. As such, it is essential to understand the mobile security apps
ecosystem to assess whether is it indeed beneficial to install them. To this
end, in this paper, we present the first empirical study of Android security
apps. We analyse 100 Android security apps from multiple aspects such as
metadata, static analysis, and dynamic analysis and presents insights to their
operations and behaviours. Our results show that 20% of the security apps we
studied potentially resell the data they collect from smartphones to third

potentially much larger than the number of observations. The cross-sectional
dependence is described through a linear regression model. We study three tests
named the sum test, the max test and the max-sum test, where the latter two are
new. The sum test is initially proposed by Breusch and Pagan (1980). We design
the max and sum tests for sparse and non-sparse residuals in the linear
regressions, respectively.And the max-sum test is devised to compromise both
situations on the residuals. Indeed, our simulation shows that the max-sum test
outperforms the previous two tests. This makes the max-sum test very useful in
practice where sparsity or not for a set of data is usually vague. Towards the
theoretical analysis of the three tests, we have settled two conjectures
regarding the sum of squares of sample correlation coefficients asked by
Pesaran (2004 and 2008). In addition, we establish the asymptotic theory for
maxima of sample correlations coefficients appeared in the linear regression
model for panel data, which is also the first successful attempt to our
knowledge. To study the max-sum test, we create a novel method to show
asymptotic independence between maxima and sums of dependent random variables.
We expect the method itself is useful for other problems of this nature.
Finally, an extensive simulation study as well as a case study are carried out.
They demonstrate advantages of our proposed methods in terms of both empirical
powers and robustness for residuals regardless of sparsity or not.

a learning method that searches for a subspace that maximizes the prediction

Such loosely bound anionic electrons are easily captured to stabilize a
clathrate structure consisting of H cages. This addition of anionic electrons
to H cages enhances the H-derived electronic density of states at the Fermi
level, thereby leading to a high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity. We thus propose
that the electride nature of Li dopants is an essential ingredient in the

lensing induces time delays between multiple images of a source which, for
solar mass objects, is of order $\sim10^{-5}$ seconds. If an astrophysically
compact source, such as a Fast Radio Burst (FRB), is observed through a region
with a high optical depth of such microlensing masses, this gravitational
lensing time delay can be imprinted on short timescale transient signals. In
this paper, we consider the impact of the parity of the macroimage on the
resultant microlensing time delays. It is found that this parity is directly
imprinted on the microlensing signal, with macroimages formed at minima of the
time arrival surface beginning with the most highly magnified microimages and
then progressing to the fainter microimages. At macroimages at the maxima of
the time arrival surface, this situation is reversed, with fainter images
observed first and finishing with the brightest microimages. For macroimages at
saddle-points, the signal again begins with fainter images, followed by
brighter images before again fading through the fainter microimages. The
growing populations of cosmologically distant bursty transient sources will
undoubtedly result in the discovery of strong lensed, multiply imaged FRBs,
which will be susceptible to microlensing by compact masses. With the temporal
resolution being offered my modern and future facilities, the detection of
microlensing induced time delays will reveal the parities of the gravitational
lens macroimages, providing additional constraints on macrolensing mass models
and improving the efficacy of these transient sources as a cosmological probes.

sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 fb$^{-1}$ and collected

from the proton-proton collision, where in both cases the requirements placed
on the event and the assumptions made about the production mechanisms are kept
as minimal as possible. The searches for promptly decaying $X$ bosons explore
the mass range from near the dimuon threshold up to 60 GeV, with nonnegligible
$X$ widths considered above 20 GeV. The searches for displaced $X \to
\mu^+\mu^-$ decays consider masses up to 3 GeV. None of the searches finds
evidence for a signal and 90% confidence-level exclusion limits are placed on
the $X \to \mu^+\mu^-$ cross sections, each with minimal model dependence. In
addition, these results are used to place world-leading constraints on
GeV-scale bosons in the two-Higgs-doublet and hidden-valley scenarios.

longstanding research problems across the sciences. Notwithstanding its success
across disciplines, the recent trend of the overuse of deep learning is
concerning to many machine learning practitioners. Recently, seismologists have
also demonstrated the efficacy of deep learning algorithms in detecting low
magnitude earthquakes. Here, we revisit the problem of seismic event detection
but using a logistic regression model with feature extraction. We select
well-discriminating features from a huge database of time-series operations
collected from interdisciplinary time-series analysis methods. Using a simple
learning model with only five trainable parameters, we detect several
low-magnitude induced earthquakes from the Groningen gas field that are not
present in the catalog. We note that the added advantage of simpler models is
that the selected features add to our understanding of the noise and event
classes present in the dataset. Since simpler models are easy to maintain,
debug, understand, and train, through this study we underscore that it might be
a dangerous pursuit to use deep learning without carefully weighing simpler
alternatives.

such as machine learning, signal processing and statistics. They can represent
rich spaces of functions while preserving the convexity of the optimization
problems where they are used, and are simple to evaluate, differentiate and
integrate. However, for modeling non-negative functions, which are crucial for
unsupervised learning, density estimation, or non-parametric Bayesian methods,
linear models are not applicable directly. Moreover, current state-of-the-art
models like generalized linear models either lead to non-convex optimization
problems, or cannot be easily integrated. In this paper we provide the first
model for non-negative functions which benefits from the same good properties
of linear models. In particular, we prove that it admits a representer theorem
and provide an efficient dual formulation for convex problems. We study its
representation power, showing that the resulting space of functions is strictly
richer than that of generalized linear models. Finally we extend the model and
the theoretical results to functions with outputs in convex cones. The paper is
complemented by an experimental evaluation of the model showing its
effectiveness in terms of formulation, algorithmic derivation and practical
results on the problems of density estimation, regression with heteroscedastic
errors, and multiple quantile regression.

for sampling the high-dimensional feature space implicitly defined by a kernel
transformation. Our main contribution is an importance sampling method for
subsampling the feature space of a degree $q$ tensoring of data points in
almost input sparsity time, improving the recent oblivious sketching method of
(Ahle et al., 2020) by a factor of $q^{5/2}/\epsilon^2$. This leads to a
subspace embedding for the polynomial kernel, as well as the Gaussian kernel,
with a target dimension that is only linearly dependent on the statistical
dimension of the kernel and in time which is only linearly dependent on the
sparsity of the input dataset. We show how our subspace embedding bounds imply
new statistical guarantees for kernel ridge regression. Furthermore, we
empirically show that in large-scale regression tasks, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art kernel approximation methods.

Energy limitations are introduced, including the dephasing and depletion

concept of the wake Hamiltonian is introduced and the resulting particle orbits
are identified in phase space, which illustrates how the peak energy and energy

strongly connected spanning subgraph without any pair of antiparallel (or twin)
edges. The twinless strongly connected components (TSCCs) of a directed graph
$G$ are its maximal twinless strongly connected subgraphs. These concepts have
several diverse applications, such as the design of telecommunication networks
and the structural stability of buildings. A vertex $v \in V$ is a twinless
strong articulation point of $G$ if the deletion of $v$ increases the number of
TSCCs of $G$. Here, we present the first linear-time algorithm that finds all
the twinless strong articulation points of a directed graph. We show that the
computation of twinless strong articulation points reduces to the following
problem in undirected graphs, which may be of independent interest: Given a
$2$-vertex-connected (biconnected) undirected graph $H$, find all vertices $v$
that belong to a vertex-edge cut-pair, i.e., for which there exists an edge $e$
such that $H \setminus \{v,e\}$ is not connected. We develop a linear-time
algorithm that not only finds all such vertices $v$, but also computes the
number of edges $e$ such that $H \setminus \{v,e\}$ is not connected. This also
implies that for each twinless strong articulation point $v$ which is not a
strong articulation point in a strongly connected digraph $G$, we can compute
the number of TSCCs in $G \setminus v$. We note that the problem of computing
all vertices that belong to a vertex-edge cut-pair can be solved in linear-time
by exploiting the structure of $3$-vertex-connected (triconnected) components
of $H$, represented by an SPQR tree of $H$. Our approach, however, is
conceptually simple, and thus likely to be more amenable to practical
implementations.

effective action of the heterotic string theory and provides a simple framework
to explore the signatures of the same. The dilaton and the axion fields
inherited in the action from string compactifications have interesting
consequences in inflationary cosmology and in explaining the present
accelerated expansion of the universe. It is therefore worthwhile to search for
the footprints of these fields in the available astrophysical observations.
Since Einstein gravity is expected to receive quantum corrections in the high
curvature domain, the near horizon regime of black holes seems to be the ideal
astrophysical laboratory to test these deviations from general relativity.
Exact, stationary and axisymmetric black hole solution in EMDA gravity
corresponds to the Kerr-Sen spacetime which carries dilaton charge, while the
angular momentum is sourced by the axion field. The ballistic jets and the peak
emission of the continuum spectrum from the accretion disk are believed to be
launched very close to the event horizon and hence should bear the imprints of
the background spacetime. We compute the jet power and the radiative efficiency
derived from the continuum spectrum in the Kerr-Sen background and compare them
with the corresponding observations of microquasars. Our analysis reveals that
Kerr black holes are more favored compared to Kerr-Sen black holes with dilaton

combinatorial optimisation problems, one promising idea is to improve node
selection within a mixed integer programming (MIP) branch-and-bound tree by
using a learned policy. Previous work using imitation learning indicates the
feasibility of acquiring a node selection policy, by learning an adaptive node
searching order. In contrast, our imitation learning policy is focused solely
on learning which of a node's children to select. We present an offline method
to learn such a policy in two settings: one that comprises a heuristic by
committing to pruning of nodes; one that is exact and backtracks from a leaf to
guarantee finding the optimal integer solution. The former setting corresponds
to a child selector during plunging, while the latter is akin to a diving
heuristic. We apply the policy within the popular open-source solver SCIP, in
both heuristic and exact settings. Empirical results on five MIP datasets
indicate that our node selection policy leads to solutions significantly more
quickly than the state-of-the-art precedent in the literature. While we do not
beat the highly-optimised SCIP state-of-practice baseline node selector in
terms of solving time on exact solutions, our heuristic policies have a
consistently better optimality gap than all baselines, if the accuracy of the
predictive model is sufficient. Further, the results also indicate that, when a
time limit is applied, our heuristic method finds better solutions than all
baselines in the majority of problems tested. We explain the results by showing
that the learned policies have imitated the SCIP baseline, but without the
latter's early plunge abort. Our recommendation is that, despite the clear
improvements over the literature, this kind of MIP child selector is better
seen in a broader approach using learning in MIP branch-and-bound tree
decisions.

take into account not only the graph connectivity, but also the metadata
available, such as node and edge labels, or temporal information. In this paper
we are interested in settings where such metadata is used to define a
similarity between edges. We consider the problem of finding subgraphs that are
dense and whose edges are similar to each other with respect to a given
similarity function. Depending on the application, this function can be, for
example, the Jaccard similarity between the edge label sets, or the temporal
correlation of the edge occurrences in a temporal graph. We formulate a
Lagrangian relaxation-based optimization problem to search for dense subgraphs
with high pairwise edge similarity. We design a novel algorithm to solve the
problem through parametric MinCut, and provide an efficient search scheme to
iterate through the values of the Lagrangian multipliers. Our study is
complemented by an evaluation on real-world datasets, which demonstrates the
usefulness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

attracted increasing research interest. However, plain networks cannot recover
fine details for a complex task, such as real noisy images. In this paper, we
propsoed a Dual denoising Network (DudeNet) to recover a clean image.
Specifically, DudeNet consists of four modules: a feature extraction block, an
enhancement block, a compression block, and a reconstruction block. The feature
extraction block with a sparse machanism extracts global and local features via
two sub-networks. The enhancement block gathers and fuses the global and local
features to provide complementary information for the latter network. The
compression block refines the extracted information and compresses the network.
Finally, the reconstruction block is utilized to reconstruct a denoised image.
The DudeNet has the following advantages: (1) The dual networks with a parse
mechanism can extract complementary features to enhance the generalized ability
of denoiser. (2) Fusing global and local features can extract salient features
to recover fine details for complex noisy images. (3) A Small-size filter is
used to reduce the complexity of denoiser. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of DudeNet over existing current state-of-the-art denoising
methods.

with a real-valued codomain, single-objective optimization tasks. Performance
aggregation over several benchmark problems is possible, for example in the

methods. PIC refers to a particular class of policy search methods that are
closely tied to the setting of Linearly Solvable Optimal Control (LSOC), a
restricted subclass of nonlinear Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) problems.
This class is unique in the sense that it can be solved explicitly to yield a
formal optimal state trajectory distribution. In this contribution we first
review the PIC theory and discuss related algorithms tailored to policy search
in general. We are able to identify a generic design strategy that relies on
the existence of an optimal state trajectory distribution and finds a
parametric policy by minimizing the cross entropy between the optimal and a
state trajectory distribution parametrized through its policy. Inspired by this
observation we then aim to formulate a SOC problem that shares traits with the
LSOC setting yet that covers a less restrictive class of problem formulations.
We refer to this SOC problem as Entropy Regularized Trajectory Optimization.
The problem is closely related to the Entropy Regularized Stochastic Optimal
Control setting which is lately often addressed by the Reinforcement Learning
(RL) community. We analyse the theoretical convergence behaviour of the
theoretical state trajectory distribution sequence and draw connections with
stochastic search methods tailored to classic optimization problems. Finally we
derive explicit updates and compare the implied Entropy Regularized PIC with
earlier work in the context of both PIC and RL for derivative-free trajectory
optimization.

where a \textit{user} queries a function of data matrices generated at

curious computation servers, which are connected to the sources, the user, and
each other through orthogonal and reliable communication links. Our goal is to
minimize the amount of data that must be transmitted from the sources to the
servers, called the \textit{upload cost}, while guaranteeing that no $T$

user cannot learn any information beyond the computation result. We first focus
on secure distributed matrix multiplication (SDMM), considering two matrices,

lower than the existing results in the literature. We then generalize the

within-person relations from between-person differences (stable traits) using
longitudinal data. In this paper, we propose a method of within-person
variability score-based causal inference for estimating joint effects of
time-varying continuous treatments by effectively controlling for stable
traits. After explaining the assumed data-generating process and providing
formal definitions of stable trait factors, within-person variability scores,
and joint effects of time-varying treatments at the within-person level, we
introduce the proposed method, which consists of a two-step analysis.
Within-person variability scores for each person, which are disaggregated from
stable traits of that person, are first calculated using weights based on a
best linear correlation preserving predictor through structural equation
modeling (SEM). Causal parameters are then estimated via a potential outcome
approach, either marginal structural models (MSMs) or structural nested mean
models (SNMMs), using calculated within-person variability scores. Unlike the
approach that relies entirely on SEM, the present method does not assume
linearity for observed time-varying confounders at the within-person level. We
emphasize the use of SNMMs with G-estimation because of its property of being
doubly robust to model misspecifications in how observed time-varying
confounders are functionally related with treatments/predictors and outcomes at
the within-person level. Through simulation, we show that the proposed method
can recover causal parameters well and that causal estimates might be severely
biased if one does not properly account for stable traits. An empirical
application using data regarding sleep habits and mental health status from the
Tokyo Teen Cohort study is also provided.

is suggested describing the evolution and interconversion of

proposes the EH4 and EH5 traps frequently found by DLTS to originate from the
(+/0) charge transition level belonging to different configurations of the
carbon antisite-carbon vacancy (CAV) complex. Furthermore, we show that the
transformation channel between the silicon vacancy (VSi) and CAV is effectively
blocked under n-type conditions, but becomes available in samples where the
Fermi level has moved towards the center of the band gap due to
irradiation-induced donor compensation. The annealing of VSi and the carbon
vacancy (VC) is shown to be dominated by recombination with residual
self-interstitials at temperatures of up to 400{\deg}C. Going to higher
temperatures, a decay of the CAV pair density is reported which is closely
correlated to a renewed increase of VC concentration. A conceivable explanation
for this process is the dissociation of the CAV pair into separate carbon
anitisites and VC defects. Lastly, the presented data supports the claim that
the removal of free carriers in irradiated SiC is due to introduced
compensating defects and not passivation of shallow nitrogen donors.

which widely employ a phase-locked loop (PLL) for grid synchronization.
However, it has been pointed out that PLL can give rise to small-signal
instabilities under weak grid conditions. This problem can be potentially
resolved by operating the converters in grid-forming mode, namely, without
using a PLL. Nonetheless, it has not been theoretically revealed how the
placement of grid-forming converters enhances the small-signal stability of
power systems integrated with large-scale PLL-based converters. This paper aims
at filling this gap. Based on matrix perturbation theory, we explicitly
demonstrate that the placement of grid-forming converters is equivalent to
increasing the power grid strength and thus improving the small-signal
stability of PLL-based converters. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal
locations to place grid-forming converters by increasing the smallest
eigenvalue of the weighted and Kron-reduced Laplacian matrix of the power
network. The analysis in this paper is validated through high-fidelity
simulation studies on a modified two-area test system and a modified 39-bus
test system. This paper potentially lays the foundation for understanding the
interaction between PLL-based (i.e., grid-following) converters and
grid-forming converters, and coordinating their placements in future
converter-dominated power systems.

i-C$_3$H$_7$OH, C$_3$O, and cis-HC(O)CHO towards IRAS 16293B. We then use a
three-phase chemical model to simulate the formation of these species in a
typical prestellar environment followed by its hydrodynamical collapse until
the birth of the central protostar. Different formation paths, such as
successive hydrogenation and radical-radical additions on grain surfaces, are

problems in asynchronous ad hoc networks. Since time synchronization is
extremely costly in these networks, application of asynchronous methods like
quorum-based protocols have attracted increased interest for their suitability.
This is because Quorum-based protocols can guarantee that two nodes with
differing clock times have an intersection within at least one timeslot. A
higher neighbour discovery rate of active nodes is desired, but it also results
in a higher active ratio and consequently and adversely more overall power
consumption of the nodes and a shorter network lifetime. There must be a
trade-off between extensive neighbour discovery and active ratio in order to
design high-performance and efficient protocols. In this paper, two novel
asynchronous quorum-based protocols to maximize the neighbour discovery and
minimize the active ratio have been designed and presented. A new metric
(Quorum Efficiency Ratio: QER) has also been designed to evaluate and compare
the performance of quorum-based protocols in terms of their neighbour discovery
(the Expected Quorum Overlap Size: EQOS) and the active ratio. The EQOS has
been theoretically derived, along with the Active Ratio and the QER values for
the proposed novel protocols and the other contemporary protocols. Finally, the
proposed methods have been evaluated and compared against the other methods

are currently in tension with the value inferred from Planck observations of
the CMB and other high redshift datasets if a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological
model is assumed. One of the few promising theoretical resolutions of this
tension is to invoke new physics that changes the sound horizon scale in the
early universe; this can bring CMB and BAO constraints on $H_0$ into better
agreement with local measurements. In this paper, we discuss how a measurement
of the Hubble constant can be made from the CMB without using information from
the sound horizon scale, $r_s$. In particular, we show how measurements of the
CMB lensing power spectrum can be used to place interesting constraints on
$H_0$ when combined with measurements of either supernovae or galaxy weak
lensing, which constrain the matter density parameter. The constraints arise
from the sensitivity of the CMB lensing power spectrum to the horizon scale at
matter-radiation equality (in projection); this scale could have a different
dependence on new physics than the sound horizon. From an analysis of current
CMB lensing data from Planck and Pantheon supernovae with conservative external
priors, we derive an $r_s$-independent constraint of $H_0 = 73.5\pm 5.3$
km/s/Mpc. Forecasts for future CMB surveys indicate that improving constraints
beyond an error of $\sigma(H_0) = 3$ km/s/Mpc will be difficult with CMB

procedures in two ways. First, back-scatter significantly contributes to
patient (skin) dose during complicated interventions. Second, forward-scattered
radiation reduces contrast in projection images and introduces artifacts in 3-D
reconstructions. While conventionally employed anti-scatter grids improve image
quality by blocking X-rays, the additional attenuation due to the anti-scatter
grid at the detector needs to be compensated for by a higher patient entrance
dose. This also increases the room dose affecting the staff caring for the
patient. For skin dose quantification, back-scatter is usually accounted for by
applying pre-determined scalar back-scatter factors or linear point spread
functions to a primary kerma forward projection onto a patient surface point.
However, as patients come in different shapes, the generalization of
conventional methods is limited. Here, we propose a novel approach combining
conventional techniques with learning-based methods to simultaneously estimate
the forward-scatter reaching the detector as well as the back-scatter affecting
the patient skin dose. Knowing the forward-scatter, we can correct X-ray
projections, while a good estimate of the back-scatter component facilitates an
improved skin dose assessment. To simultaneously estimate forward-scatter as
well as back-scatter, we propose a multi-task approach for joint back- and
forward-scatter estimation by combining X-ray physics with neural networks. We
show that, in theory, highly accurate scatter estimation in both cases is
possible. In addition, we identify research directions for our multi-task
framework and learning-based scatter estimation in general.

conditions in the nodes are analyzed and defined. Finally, the model is solved

the consistency with the diffusive limit without restrictions due to the

steering inequality called Tilted Steering Inequality for certifying any pure
two-qubit entangled state. Further, we use this inequality to certify any

acquired great attention in semiconductor physics thanks to the appearance of
novel and very effective growth methods. However, many questions remain
unaddressed on their extrinsic doping capability and on how it compares to
those of diamond-like structures. This point is here investigated through
numerical simulations conducted in the framework of the Density Functional
Theory (DFT). The comparative analysis for group III and V dopant atoms shows
that: i) in diamond-type crystals the bulk sites symmetry ($T_d$) is preserved
by doping while in hexagonal crystals the impurity site moves towards a higher
($T_d$) or lower ($C_{3v}$) symmetry configuration dependently on the valence
of the dopant atoms; ii) for Si and Ge, group III impurities can be more easily
introduced in the hexagonal-diamond phase, whose local $C_{3v}$ symmetry better
accommodates the three-fold coordination of the impurity, while n-type
impurities do not reveal any marked phase preference; iii) for C, both n and p
dopants are more stable in the hexagonal-diamond structure than in the the
cubic one, but this tendency is much more pronounced for n-type impurities.

networks: bad data and (poorly) trained models. When trained with SGD, deep
neural networks essentially achieve zero training error, even in the presence
of label noise, while also exhibiting good generalization on natural test data,
something referred to as benign overfitting [2, 10]. However, these models are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We identify label noise as one of the causes
for adversarial vulnerability, and provide theoretical and empirical evidence
in support of this. Surprisingly, we find several instances of label noise in
datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR, and that robustly trained models incur
training error on some of these, i.e. they don't fit the noise. However,
removing noisy labels alone does not suffice to achieve adversarial robustness.
Standard training procedures bias neural networks towards learning ""simple""
classification boundaries, which may be less robust than more complex ones. We
observe that adversarial training does produce more complex decision
boundaries. We conjecture that in part the need for complex decision boundaries
arises from sub-optimal representation learning. By means of simple toy
examples, we show theoretically how the choice of representation can
drastically affect adversarial robustness.

of incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the cohort
ages, death (a terminal event) is a prominent competing risk for AD (a
non-terminal event), although the reverse is not the case. As such, analyses of
data from ACT can be placed within the semi-competing risks framework. Central
to semi-competing risks, and in contrast to standard competing risks, is that
one can learn about the dependence structure between the two events. To-date,
however, most methods for semi-competing risks treat dependence as a nuisance
and not a potential source of new clinical knowledge. We propose a novel
regression-based framework that views the two time-to-event outcomes through
the lens of a longitudinal bivariate process on a partition of the time scale.
A key innovation of the framework is that dependence is represented in two
distinct forms, $\textit{local}$ and $\textit{global}$ dependence, both of
which have intuitive clinical interpretations. Estimation and inference are
performed via penalized maximum likelihood, and can accommodate right
censoring, left truncation and time-varying covariates. The framework is used
to investigate the role of gender and having $\ge$1 APOE-$\epsilon4$ allele on

symmetric Gaussian-like distribution of the barrier heights after annealing at
700{\deg}C, where a low Schottky barrier height ($\Phi$B=1.05 eV) and an
ideality factor n=1.06 were measured. The low value of the barrier height makes
such a WC contact an interesting candidate to reduce the conduction losses in
4H-SiC Schottky diodes. A deeper characterization has been carried out, by
monitoring the temperature dependence of the I-V characteristics and the
behavior of the relevant parameters $\Phi$B and n. The increase of the barrier
height and decrease of the ideality factor with increasing temperature
indicated a lateral inhomogeneity of the WC/4H-SiC Schottky contact, which was
described by invoking the Tung's model. Interestingly, the temperature
dependence of the leakage current under reverse bias could be described by
considering in the thermionic field emission model the temperature dependent
barrier height related to the inhomogeneity. These results can be useful to
predict the behavior of WC/4H-SiC Schottky diodes under operative conditions.

time-to-first-spike coding. With this coding scheme, neurons fire at most once
per stimulus, but the firing order carries information. Here, we introduce
BS4NN, a modification of S4NN in which the synaptic weights are constrained to
be binary (+1 or -1), in order to decrease memory (ideally, one bit per
synapse) and computation footprints. This was done using two sets of weights:
firstly, real-valued weights, updated by gradient descent, and used in the
backward pass of backpropagation, and secondly, their signs, used in the
forward pass. Similar strategies have been used to train (non-spiking)
binarized neural networks. The main difference is that BS4NN operates in the
time domain: spikes are propagated sequentially, and different neurons may
reach their threshold at different times, which increases computational power.
We validated BS4NN on two popular benchmarks, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and
obtained reasonable accuracies for this sort of network (97.0% and 87.3%
respectively) with a negligible accuracy drop with respect to real-valued
weights (0.4% and 0.7%, respectively). We also demonstrated that BS4NN
outperforms a simple BNN with the same architectures on those two datasets (by
0.2% and 0.9% respectively), presumably because it leverages the temporal
dimension. The source codes of the proposed BS4NN are publicly available at

develop three controllers according to different model precision. Specifically,
based on accurate model, an open-loop controller is realized by combining
piece-wise constant curvature (PCC) modeling method and machine learning
method. Based on inaccurate model, a feedback controller, using estimated
Jacobian, is realized in 3D space. A model-free controller, using reinforcement
learning to learn a control policy rather than a model, is realized in 2D
plane, with minimal training data. Then, these three control methods are
compared on a same experiment platform to explore the applicability of
different methods under different conditions. Lastly, we figure out that soft
arm can greatly simplify the perception, planning, and control of interaction
tasks through its compliance, which is its main advantage over the rigid arm.
Through plentiful experiments in three interaction application scenarios,
human-robot interaction, free space interaction task, and confined space
interaction task, we demonstrate the potential application prospect of the soft
arm.

collapse of a core and the subsequent formation of a disk depends on the
assumed dust size distribution. We study the impact of grain-grain coagulation
on the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) resistivities during the collapse
of a prestellar core. We use a 1-D model to follow the evolution of the dust
size distribution, out-of-equilibrium ionization state and gas chemistry during
the collapse of a prestellar core. To compute the grain-grain collisional rate,
we consider models for both random and systematic, size-dependent, velocities.
We include grain growth through grain-grain coagulation and ice accretion, but
ignore grain fragmentation. Starting with a MRN (Mathis et al. 1977) size
distribution, we find that coagulation in grain-grain collisions generated by
hydrodynamical turbulence is not efficient at removing the smallest grains, and
as a consequence does not affect much the evolution of the Hall and ambipolar
diffusion MHD resistivities which still severly drop during the collapse like
in models without coagulation. The inclusion of systematic velocities, possibly
induced by the presence of ambipolar diffusion, increases the coagulation rate
between small and large grains, removing small grains earlier in the collapse
and therefore limiting the drop in the Hall and ambipolar diffusion
resistivities. At intermediate densities ($n_{\rm H} \sim 10^8\,$cm$^{-3}$),
the Hall and ambipolar diffusion resistivities are found to be higher by 1 to 2
orders of magnitude in models with coagulation than in models where coagulation
is ignored, and also higher than in a toy model without coagulation where all
grains smaller than $0.1\,{\mu}$m would have been removed in the parent cloud
before the collapse. When grain drift velocities induced by ambipolar diffusion
are included, dust coagulation ... (abridged)

origin, and so far several events have been detected at extragalactic
distances. The dispersion measure (DM) of the radio signal is a probe of the
integrated electron density along the line of sight and therefore allows to map
the electron distribution within the large-scale structure. Since a fraction of
electrons gets expelled from galaxies by feedback, they are anticorrelated with
halos at large scales and hence the angular DM correlations show a
scale-dependent bias caused by primordial non-Gaussianity. Although the signal
is weaker than in other probes like galaxy clustering, FRBs can potentially
probe considerably larger volumes. We show that while studying the FRB
clustering signal requires very large samples, correlations in the DM are
cosmic-variance limited on large angular scales with only $\sim 10^{3-4}$
events. A tomographic analysis of the angular DM correlation function can
constrain the local primordial bispectrum shape parameter $f_\mathrm{NL}$ to a
precision down to ${f_\mathrm{NL}}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ depending on assumptions
about the FRB redshift distribution and the astrophysical feedback on large

exclusion on $\Lambda$, but when they occupy neighboring sites they feel a
binding energy $-U_1<0$ in the horizontal direction and $-U_2<0$ in the
vertical one. Thus the Kawasaki dynamics is conservative inside the volume
$\Lambda$. Along each bond touching the boundary of $\Lambda$ from the outside
to the inside, particles are created with rate $\rho=e^{-\Delta\beta}$, while
along each bond from the inside to the outside, particles are annihilated with
rate $1$, where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $\Delta>0$ is an
activity parameter. Thus, the boundary of $\Lambda$ plays the role of an
infinite gas reservoir with density $\rho$. We consider the parameter regime
$U_1>2U_2$ also known as the strongly anisotropic regime. We take
$\Delta\in{(U_1,U_1+U_2)}$ and we prove that the empty (respectively full)

recovery overhead. This formulation highlights the method's similarities to
checkpoint-restart (CR). Thus, this method, which we call ESR with periodic
storage (ESRP), can be considered a form of algorithm-based checkpoint-restart.
The state is stored implicitly, by exploiting redundancy inherent to the
algorithm, rather than explicitly as in CR. We also minimize the amount of data
to be stored and retrieved compared to CR, but additional computation is
required to reconstruct the solver's state. In this paper, we describe the
necessary modifications to ESR to convert it into ESRP, and perform an
experimental evaluation.
  We compare ESRP experimentally with previously-existing ESR and
application-level in-memory CR. Our results confirm that the overhead for ESR
is reduced significantly, both in the failure-free case, and if node failures
are introduced. In the former case, the overhead of ESRP is usually lower than
that of CR. However, CR is faster if node failures happen. We claim that these
differences can be alleviated by the implementation of more appropriate
preconditioners.

of post-colonial and decolonial theories, in understanding and shaping the
ongoing advances in artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
viewed as amongst the technological advances that will reshape modern societies
and their relations. Whilst the design and deployment of systems that
continually adapt holds the promise of far-reaching positive change, they
simultaneously pose significant risks, especially to already vulnerable
peoples. Values and power are central to this discussion. Decolonial theories
use historical hindsight to explain patterns of power that shape our
intellectual, political, economic, and social world. By embedding a decolonial
critical approach within its technical practice, AI communities can develop
foresight and tactics that can better align research and technology development
with established ethical principles, centring vulnerable peoples who continue
to bear the brunt of negative impacts of innovation and scientific progress. We
highlight problematic applications that are instances of coloniality, and using
a decolonial lens, submit three tactics that can form a decolonial field of
artificial intelligence: creating a critical technical practice of AI, seeking
reverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies, and the renewal of affective and
political communities. The years ahead will usher in a wave of new scientific
breakthroughs and technologies driven by AI research, making it incumbent upon
AI communities to strengthen the social contract through ethical foresight and
the multiplicity of intellectual perspectives available to us; ultimately
supporting future technologies that enable greater well-being, with the goal of
beneficence and justice for all.

fraction of stars which show flares appears to drop significantly at periods
<0.2 d. If the periods are a signature of the rotation rate, this would be a
surprise, since faster rotators would be expected to have a stronger magnetic
field and, therefore, produce more flares. We explore possible reasons for our
finding: the flare inactive stars are members of binaries, in which case the
stars rotation rate could have increased as the binary orbital separation
reduced due to angular momentum loss over time, or that enhanced emission
occurs at blue wavelengths beyond the pass band of TESS. Follow-up spectroscopy
and flare monitoring at blue/ultraviolet wavelengths of these flare inactive

develop PoSH Auto-sklearn, which enables AutoML systems to work well on large

meta-learning technique and by employing a successful bandit strategy for
budget allocation. However, PoSH Auto-sklearn introduces even more ways of
running AutoML and might make it harder for users to set it up correctly.
Therefore, we also go one step further and study the design space of AutoML
itself, proposing a solution towards truly hands-free AutoML. Together, these
changes give rise to the next generation of our AutoML system, Auto-sklearn
2.0. We verify the improvements by these additions in an extensive experimental
study on 39 AutoML benchmark datasets. We conclude the paper by comparing to
other popular AutoML frameworks and Auto-sklearn 1.0, reducing the relative

quasi-flat bands of TBG that emerge around the charge-neutrality point for
twist angles around the magic angle $\theta\sim1.05^\circ$. We show that the

ground state for neutral TBG ($n=0$). We then show that the theorem can also be
applied only to the flat conduction or valence bands, if the substrate induces
a single-particle gap at charge neutrality. Also in this case, the
corresponding density matrix turns out to be irreducible, leading to
ferromagnetism at half filling ($n=\pm2$).

Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm by rationally repurposing the power
spent during the mining process. The original PoW mining scheme is designed to
consider one block at a time and assign a reward to the first place winner of a
computation race. To reduce the mining-related energy consumption, we propose
to compensate the computation effort of the runner(s)-up of a mining round, by
granting them exclusivity of solving the upcoming block in the next round. This
will considerably reduce the number of competing nodes in the next round and
consequently, the consumed energy. Our proposed scheme divides time into
epochs, where each comprises two mining rounds; in the first one, all network
nodes can participate in the mining process, whereas in the second round only
runners-up can take part. Thus, the overall mining energy consumption can be
reduced to nearly $50\%$. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is
the first to considerably improve the energy consumption of the original PoW
algorithm. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our scheme in
reducing energy consumption, the probability of fork occurrences, the level of
mining centralization presented in the original PoW algorithm, and the effect

ionosphere. This upper part of the atmosphere is highly reactive and complex
ion chemistry takes place at altitudes from 1200 to 900 km. The ionosphere is a
nitrogen plasma with a few percent of methane and hydrogen. Carbon from methane
enables the formation of macromolecules with long organic chains, finally
leading to the organic aerosols. On the other hand, we suspect that hydrogen
and the protonated ions have a different erosive effect on the aerosols. Here
we experimentally studied the effect of hydrogen and protonated species on
organic aerosols. Analogues of Titan's aerosols were formed in a CCP RF plasma
discharge in 95% N2 and 5% CH4. Thereafter, the aerosols were exposed to a DC
plasma in 99% N2 and 1% H2. Samples were analysed by scanning electron
microscopy and in situ infrared transmission spectroscopy. Two pellet
techniques - KBr pressed pellets and thin metallic grids - were compared to
confirm that modifications seen are not due to the material used to make the
pellet. We observed that the spherical aerosols of ~500 nm in diameter were
eroded under N2-H2 plasma exposure, with the formation of holes of ~10 nm at
their surface. Aerosols were globally removed from the pellet by the plasma. IR
spectra showed a faster disappearance of isonitriles and/or carbo-diimides
compared to the global band of nitriles. The opposite effect was seen with
beta-unsaturated nitriles and/or cyanamides. Double bonds as C=C and C=N were
more affected than amines and C-H bonds. N-H and C-H absorption bands kept a
similar ratio in intensity and their shape did not vary. Therefore, it seems
that carbon and hydrogen play opposite roles in Titan's ionosphere: the carbon
from methane lead to organic growth while hydrogen and protonated species erode
the aerosols and react preferentially with unsaturated chemical functions.

result in a reversal of electron magnetization. In our all-optical scheme the
impurity-to-band excitation via the Mn dimers results in direct orientation of
the ionized Mn-donor $d$ shell. A photoexcited electron is then captured by the
interstitial Mn and the electron spin becomes parallel to the optically
oriented $d$ shell. That produces, in the low excitation regime, the
spin-reversal electron magnetization. As the excitation intensity increases the
capture by donors is saturated and the polarization of delocalized electrons
restores the normal average spin in accordance with the selection rules. A
possibility of the experimental observation of the electron spin reversal by

  paragraph before the abstract",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are repulsive point processes where the
interaction between points depends on the determinant of a positive-semi
definite matrix. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First of all, we
introduce the concept of extended L-ensemble, a novel representation of DPPs.
These extended L-ensembles are interesting objects because they fix some
pathologies in the usual formalism of DPPs, for instance the fact that
projection DPPs are not L-ensembles. Every (fixed-size) DPP is an (fixed-size)
extended L-ensemble, including projection DPPs. This new formalism enables to
introduce and analyze a subclass of DPPs, called partial-projection DPPs.
Secondly, with these new definitions in hand, we first show that
partial-projection DPPs arise as perturbative limits of L-ensembles, that is,
limits in $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ of L-ensembles based on matrices of the
form $\varepsilon \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$ where $\mathbf{B}$ is low-rank. We
generalise this result by showing that partial-projection DPPs also arise as
the limiting process of L-ensembles based on kernel matrices, when the kernel
function becomes flat (so that every point interacts with every other point, in
a sense). We show that the limiting point process depends mostly on the
smoothness of the kernel function. In some cases, the limiting process is even
universal, meaning that it does not depend on specifics of the kernel function,
but only on its degree of smoothness.

high accuracy on standard benchmarks. However, it has raised security concerns
in enormous FR applications because deep CNNs are unusually vulnerable to
adversarial examples, and it is still lack of a comprehensive robustness
evaluation before a FR model is deployed in safety-critical scenarios. To
facilitate a better understanding of the adversarial vulnerability on FR, we
develop an adversarial robustness evaluation library on FR named
\textbf{RobFR}, which serves as a reference for evaluating the robustness of
downstream tasks. Specifically, RobFR involves 15 popular naturally trained FR
models, 9 models with representative defense mechanisms and 2 commercial FR API
services, to perform the robustness evaluation by using various adversarial
attacks as an important surrogate. The evaluations are conducted under diverse
adversarial settings in terms of dodging and impersonation, $\ell_2$ and
$\ell_\infty$, as well as white-box and black-box attacks. We further propose a
landmark-guided cutout (LGC) attack method to improve the transferability of
adversarial examples for black-box attacks by considering the special
characteristics of FR. Based on large-scale evaluations, the commercial FR API
services fail to exhibit acceptable performance on robustness evaluation, and
we also draw several important conclusions for understanding the adversarial
robustness of FR models and providing insights for the design of robust FR
models. RobFR is open-source and maintains all extendable modules, i.e.,

SCALAR, where dark matter is in form of fuzzy dark matter, described by a light
scalar field with a mass of $m_{\rm B} = 2.5 \times 10^{-22}$ eV and evolving
according to the Schr\""{o}dinger-Poisson system of equations. In comoving
units, the simulation volume is $2.5 ~ h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$ on a side, with a
resolution of $20~h^{-1}{\rm pc}$ at the finest refinement level. We analyse
the formation and the evolution of central solitonic cores, which are found to
leave their imprints on dark matter density profiles, resulting in shallower
central densities, and on rotation curves, producing an additional circular
velocity peak at small radii from the center. We find that the suppression of
structures due to the quantum nature of the scalar field results in an
shallower halo mass function in the low-mass end compared to the case of a
$\Lambda$CDM simulation, in which dark matter is expected to cluster at all
mass scales even if evolved with the same initial conditions used for fuzzy
dark matter. Furthermore, we verify the scaling relations characterising the
solution to the Schr\""{o}dinger-Poisson system, for both isolated and merging
halos, and we find that they are preserved by merging processes. We
characterise each fuzzy dark matter halo in terms of the dimensionless quantity
$\Xi \propto \left | E_{\rm halo} \right |/M_{\rm halo}^3$ and we show that the
core mass is tightly linked to the halo mass by the core-halo mass relation
$M_{\rm core}/M_{\rm halo} \propto \Xi^{1/3}$. We also show that the core
surface density of the simulated fuzzy dark matter halos does not follow the
scaling with the core radius as observed for dwarf galaxies, representing a big
challenge for the fuzzy dark matter model as the sole explanation of core

stars turn out to be a crucial ingredient for probing their structure,
composition, and evolution. Moreover, the astronomical observations on the
pulsars and their mass-radius relations put important constraints on the dense
matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we consider a homogeneous and
unpaired charge-neutral $3$-flavor interacting quark matter with
$\mathcal{O}(m_s^4)$ corrections that account for the moderately heavy strange
quark instead of the naive MIT bag model. In this article, we perform a
detailed analysis of strange quark star in the context of recently proposed
$4D$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) theory of gravity. However, this theory does
not have standard four-dimensional field equations. Thus, we thoroughly show
that the equivalence of the actions in the regularized $4D$ EGB theory and in
the original one is satisfied for a spherically symmetric spacetime. We pay
particular attention to the possible existence of massive neutron stars of mass
compatible with $M \sim 2 M_{\odot}$. Our findings suggest that the
fourth-order corrections parameter ($a_4$) of the QCD perturbation and coupling
constant $\alpha$ of the GB term play an important role in the mass-radius

For a more detailed consideration of the ordering processes, we study local
distributions. Based on the Markov property of the dilute Ising chain, we
obtain an explicit expression for the probability of any finite sequence and
find a geometric probability distribution for the lengths of sequences
consisting of repeating blocks. An analysis of distributions shows that the
critical behavior of the spin correlation length is defined by ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic sequences, while the critical behavior of the impurity
correlation length is defined by the sequences of impurities or by the
charge-ordered sequences. For the dilute Ising chain, there are no other
repeating sequences whose mean length diverges at zero temperature. While both
the spin correlation and the impurity correlation lengths can diverge only at
zero temperature, the ordering processes result in a maximum of the specific
heat at finite temperature defined by the maximum rate of change of the
impurity-spin pairs concentration. A simple approximate equation is found for
this temperature. We show that the non-ordered dilute Ising chains correspond
to the regular Markov chains, while various orderings generate the irregular

indexing called the string indexing for top-$k$ close consecutive occurrences
problem (SITCCO). Here, a consecutive occurrence is a pair $(i,j)$, $i < j$,
such that $P$ occurs at positions $i$ and $j$ in $S$ and there is no occurrence

Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap.
Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost
uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of
education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to
cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people
from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service
jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but
the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this
sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the
extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to
other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census
and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic
segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with
the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The
results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they
live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.

increase in energy consumption in order to keep them cost-effective and most
importantly to reduce the carbon footprint of cellular networks. We propose a
reinforcement learning cell switching algorithm, to minimize the energy
consumption in ultra-dense deployments without compromising the quality of
service (QoS) experienced by the users. In this regard, the proposed algorithm
can intelligently learn which small cells (SCs) to turn off at any given time
based on the traffic load of the SCs and the macro cell. To validate the idea,
we used the open call detail record (CDR) data set from the city of Milan,
Italy, and tested our algorithm against typical operational benchmark
solutions. With the obtained results, we demonstrate exactly when and how the
proposed algorithm can provide energy savings, and moreover how this happens
without reducing QoS of users. Most importantly, we show that our solution has
a very similar performance to the exhaustive search, with the advantage of
being scalable and less complex.

representations from the raw audio waveform. We train a raw audio encoder by
combining audio-only self-supervision (by predicting informative audio
attributes) with visual self-supervision (by generating talking faces from
audio). The visual pretext task drives the audio representations to capture
information related to lip movements. This enriches the audio encoder with
visual information and the encoder can be used for evaluation without the
visual modality. Our method attains competitive performance with respect to
existing self-supervised audio features on established isolated word
classification benchmarks, and significantly outperforms other methods at
learning from fewer labels. Notably, our method also outperforms fully
supervised training, thus providing a strong initialization for speech related
tasks. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal self-supervision in
audiovisual speech for learning good audio representations.

cornerstone capability of ultrafast optics laboratories and is routine both for
optimizing laser pulse duration and designing custom fields. Beyond pure
temporal characterization, spatio-temporal characterization provides a more
complete measurement of the spatially-varying temporal properties of a laser
pulse. These so-called spatio-temporal couplings (STCs) are generally
nonseparable chromatic aberrations that can be induced by very common optical
elements -- for example diffraction gratings and thick lenses or prisms made
from dispersive material. In this tutorial we introduce STCs and a detailed
understanding of their behavior in order to have a background knowledge, but
also to inform the design of characterization devices. We then overview a broad
range of spatio-temporal characterization techniques with a view to mention
most techniques, but also to provide greater details on a few chosen methods.
The goal is to provide a reference and a comparison of various techniques for
newcomers to the field. Lastly, we discuss nuances of analysis and

epidemics has been perceived and used as a central element in understanding,
predicting, and governing the pandemic event. However, soon it became clear
that long term predictions were extremely challenging to address. Moreover, it
is still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the
evolution of the outbreaks. Yet a robust modeling of pandemic dynamics and a
consistent choice of the transmission metric is crucial for an in-depth
understanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation
strategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed
to describe the evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the
instantaneous reproductive ratio. We then introduce and use entropy-based
metrics of global transmission to measure the impact and temporal evolution of
a pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of
the outbreak is modeled by the master equation of a nonlinear Markov process
for a statistically averaged individual, leading to a clear physical
interpretation. We also provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for
calibration. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the
system entropy, and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and
transparent outputs of this framework. The framework has the appealing property
of being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model. As an illustration, we
apply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model. Applying the model to the
Hubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and French COVID-19
data-sets, we discover a significant difference in the absolute change of
entropy but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the
instantaneous reproductive ratio.

  https://github.com/ssloxford/short-lived-adversarial-perturbations",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research into adversarial examples (AE) has developed rapidly, yet static
adversarial patches are still the main technique for conducting attacks in the
real world, despite being obvious, semi-permanent and unmodifiable once
deployed.
  In this paper, we propose Short-Lived Adversarial Perturbations (SLAP), a
novel technique that allows adversaries to realize physically robust real-world
AE by using a light projector. Attackers can project a specifically crafted
adversarial perturbation onto a real-world object, transforming it into an AE.
This allows the adversary greater control over the attack compared to
adversarial patches: (i) projections can be dynamically turned on and off or
modified at will, (ii) projections do not suffer from the locality constraint
imposed by patches, making them harder to detect.
  We study the feasibility of SLAP in the self-driving scenario, targeting both
object detector and traffic sign recognition tasks, focusing on the detection
of stop signs. We conduct experiments in a variety of ambient light conditions,
including outdoors, showing how in non-bright settings the proposed method
generates AE that are extremely robust, causing misclassifications on
state-of-the-art networks with up to 99% success rate for a variety of angles
and distances. We also demostrate that SLAP-generated AE do not present
detectable behaviours seen in adversarial patches and therefore bypass
SentiNet, a physical AE detection method. We evaluate other defences including
an adaptive defender using adversarial learning which is able to thwart the
attack effectiveness up to 80% even in favourable attacker conditions.

detectors (WCDs). Sophisticated analyses exploiting WCD data have made it
possible to demonstrate that shower simulations, based on different
hadronic-interaction models, cannot reproduce the observed number of muons at
the ground. The accurate knowledge of the WCD response to muons is paramount in
establishing the exact level of this discrepancy. In this work, we report on a
study of the response of a WCD of the Pierre Auger Observatory to atmospheric
muons performed with a hodoscope made of resistive plate chambers (RPCs),
enabling us to select and reconstruct nearly 600 thousand single muon
trajectories with zenith angles ranging from 0$^\circ$ to 55$^\circ$.
Comparison of distributions of key observables between the hodoscope data and
the predictions of dedicated simulations allows us to demonstrate the accuracy
of the latter at a level of 2%. As the WCD calibration is based on its response
to atmospheric muons, the hodoscope data are also exploited to show the
long-term stability of the procedure.

Thickening (DST) above a critical shear rate. Start-up shear experiments show
stress overshoots in the vicinity of the onset of DST related with a change in
microscopic morphology, as the sample shows dilatancy effects. The analysis of
the normal stress together with direct sample observation by high speed camera,
indicates the appearance of positive N1 and dilation behavior at the shear
thickening onset. Dilatancy effects are detected also under extensional flow.
The latter was studied through capillary breakup and filament stretching
experimental setups, where liquid-like response is seen for strain rate lower

QL-XSbO$_2$ can exhibit unconventional inner-QL ferroelectricity and

other metastable ferroelectric (FE) phases, demonstrating the first 2D example
with multiple FE orders. The ground FE phase can be flexibly driven into one of
the two metastable FE phases and then into the antiferroelectric (AFE) phase.
During this phase transition, several types of 2D fermions emerge, for
instance, hourglass hybrid and type-II Weyl loops in the ground FE phase,
type-II Weyl fermions in the metastable FE phase, and type-II Dirac fermions in
the AFE phase. These 2D fermions are robust under spin-orbit coupling. Notably,

demonstrate the novel use of structure motif information, we show that a
motif-centric learning framework can be effectively created by combining motif
information with the recently developed atom-based graph neural networks to
form an atom-motif dual graph network (AMDNet). Taking advantage of node and
edge information on both atomic and motif level, the AMDNet is more accurate
than an atom graph network in predicting electronic structure related material
properties of metal oxides such as band gaps. The work illustrates the route
toward fundamental design of graph neural network learning architecture for
complex material properties by incorporating beyond-atom physical principles.

a binary classifier with data from only one class, have been separately well
studied, their intersection remains rather unexplored. Our work addresses the
few-shot OCC problem and presents a method to modify the episodic data sampling
strategy of the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm to learn a model
initialization particularly suited for learning few-shot OCC tasks. This is
done by explicitly optimizing for an initialization which only requires few
gradient steps with one-class minibatches to yield a performance increase on
class-balanced test data. We provide a theoretical analysis that explains why
our approach works in the few-shot OCC scenario, while other meta-learning
algorithms fail, including the unmodified MAML. Our experiments on eight
datasets from the image and time-series domains show that our method leads to
better results than classical OCC and few-shot classification approaches, and
demonstrate the ability to learn unseen tasks from only few normal class
samples. Moreover, we successfully train anomaly detectors for a real-world
application on sensor readings recorded during industrial manufacturing of
workpieces with a CNC milling machine, by using few normal examples. Finally,
we empirically demonstrate that the proposed data sampling technique increases
the performance of more recent meta-learning algorithms in few-shot OCC and
yields state-of-the-art results in this problem setting.

run on Virtual Machines (VMs) in form of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). More
recently, the so-called Serverless Computing has gained traction in cloud
computing, offering Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms that make use of
containerization techniques to deploy services. In contrast to VM-based VNFs,
where resources are usually reserved and continuously running, FaaS can just be
subsets of code implementing small functions allowing for event-driven,
on-demand instantiations. Thus, a hybrid VM-Container based Service Function
Chains (SFCs) are a natural evolution of NFV architecture. We study a novel
problem of optimal placement of hybrid SFCs from an Internet Service Provider
(ISP) point of view, whereby VNFs can be instantiated either over VMs or
containers in a generic edge and cloud continuum. To this end, we propose a
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model as well as a heuristic solution to solve
this optimization problem that considers three objectives unique to the
specific VM and container deployment in a carrier network: operational costs
for maintaining servers in the edge, costs of placing VNFs in third-party cloud
providers and penalty costs applied when SLA agreements are violated in terms
of end-to-end delay. We also propose 2-phases optimization process to analyze
the effect on performance as a result of replications and migrations of VNFs.
The model can be used to highlight scenarios where a combination of VMs and

are critical for estimating personalized optimal dynamic treatment regimes
(DTRs) in medical/health research, especially in managing chronic conditions.
Traditional statistical methods for DTRs usually focus on estimating the
optimal treatment or dosage at each given medical intervention, but overlook
the important question of ""when this intervention should happen."" We fill this
gap by developing a two-step Bayesian approach to optimize clinical decisions
with timing. In the first step, we build a generative model for a sequence of
medical interventions-which are discrete events in continuous time-with a
marked temporal point process (MTPP) where the mark is the assigned treatment
or dosage. Then this clinical action model is embedded into a Bayesian joint
framework where the other components model clinical observations including
longitudinal medical measurements and time-to-event data conditional on
treatment histories. In the second step, we propose a policy gradient method to
learn the personalized optimal clinical decision that maximizes the patient
survival by interacting the MTPP with the model on clinical observations while
accounting for uncertainties in clinical observations learned from the
posterior inference of the Bayesian joint model in the first step. A signature
application of the proposed approach is to schedule follow-up visitations and
assign a dosage at each visitation for patients after kidney transplantation.
We evaluate our approach with comparison to alternative methods on both
simulated and real-world datasets. In our experiments, the personalized
decisions made by the proposed method are clinically useful: they are
interpretable and successfully help improve patient survival.

old open clusters of the Milky Way led us to identify a kink in the IFMR,
located over a range of initial masses, $1.65 \lesssim M_{\rm i}/M_{\odot}

coincides with the initial mass limit between low-mass stars that develop a
degenerate helium core after central hydrogen exhaustion, and intermediate-mass

oncology to infer treatment effects for a binary primary outcome (e.g., tumour
response). It is imperative that such studies be designed, analysed, and
reported effectively. However, there is little available evidence on whether
this is the case, particularly for key statistical considerations. We therefore
comprehensively review such trials, examining in particular quality of
reporting. Methods: Published oncology trials that utilised ""Simon's two-stage
design"" over a 5 year period were identified and reviewed. Articles were
evaluated on whether they reported sufficient design details, such as the
required sample size, and analysis details, such as a confidence interval (CI).
The articles that did not adjust their inference for the incorporation of an
interim analysis were re-analysed to evaluate the impact on their reported
point estimate and CI. Results: Four hundred and twenty five articles that
reported the results of a single treatment arm were included. Of these, 47.5%
provided the five components that ensure design reproducibility. Only 1.2% and
2.1% reported an adjusted point estimate or CI, respectively. Just 55.3% of
trials provided the final stage rejection bound, indicating many trials did not
test the hypothesis the design is constructed to assess. Re-analysis of the
trials suggests that reported point estimates underestimated treatment effects
and that reported CIs were too narrow. Conclusion: Key design details of
two-stage single-arm trials are often unreported. Whilst inference is regularly
performed, it is rarely done so in a way that removes the bias introduced by
the interim analysis. In order to maximise their value, future studies must
improve the way that they are analysed and reported.

interventional Shapley is equivalent to a multi-path integration along $n!$
paths where $n$ is the number of model input features. Applying Stoke's theorem
we show that the path symmetry of these two methods results in the same
attributions when the model is composed of a sum of separable functions of
individual features and a sum of two-feature products. We then perform a series
of experiments with varying degrees of data missingness to demonstrate how
interventional Shapley's multi-path approach can yield less consistent
attributions than the single straight-line path of Aumann-Shapley. We argue
this is because the multiple paths employed by interventional Shapley extend
away from the training data manifold and are therefore more likely to pass
through regions where the model has little support. In the absence of a more
meaningful path choice, we therefore advocate the straight-line path since it
will almost always pass closer to the data manifold. Among straight-line path
attribution algorithms, GIG is uniquely robust since it will still yield
Shapley values for atomic games modeled by decision trees.

efforts and attracts considerable attention. Different from previous methods
focusing on learning domain-invariant feature representations, some recent
methods present generic semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques and directly
apply them to DA tasks, even achieving competitive performance. One of the most
popular SSL techniques is pseudo-labeling that assigns pseudo labels for each
unlabeled data via the classifier trained by labeled data. However, it ignores
the distribution shift in DA problems and is inevitably biased to source data.
To address this issue, we propose a new pseudo-labeling framework called
Auxiliary Target Domain-Oriented Classifier (ATDOC). ATDOC alleviates the
classifier bias by introducing an auxiliary classifier for target data only, to
improve the quality of pseudo labels. Specifically, we employ the memory
mechanism and develop two types of non-parametric classifiers, i.e. the nearest
centroid classifier and neighborhood aggregation, without introducing any
additional network parameters. Despite its simplicity in a pseudo
classification objective, ATDOC with neighborhood aggregation significantly
outperforms domain alignment techniques and prior SSL techniques on a large
variety of DA benchmarks and even scare-labeled SSL tasks.

star and a permanently dark nightside orbiting dim stars are prime candidates
for habitability. Simulations of these planets often show the potential to
maintain an Earth-like climate with a complete hydrological cycle. Here, we
examine the sensitivity of the atmospheric water cycle to changes in stellar
flux and describe the main underlying mechanisms. In a slowly-rotating,
tidally-locked Earth-like atmospheric model, the response to a small (about
10%) increase in stellar irradiance from a habitable-zone control simulation is
examined. The water cycle is enhanced in response to the increased stellar
irradiance. While the evaporation increase behaves similarly to the stellar
radiation increase, the day-to-night energy transport by the mean circulation
is critical to the planet's precipitation changes. Increased efficiency of the
energy transport in a warmer climate shapes the substellar precipitation
increase. On the nightside, precipitation changes are weak as a result of the
large cancellation between the increased energy transport and the increased
longwave emission. The day-to-night energy transport efficiency is sensitive to
the variation of the atmosphere's vertical stratification. Due to weak
temperature gradients in upper troposphere and a moist adiabat maintained in
the substellar region, variations in the substellar surface temperature and
specific humidity govern the increase of the planet's stratification with
warming. This suggests a scaling of nightside's precipitation based on the
substellar surface thermodynamic changes, a sensitivity that holds over a wider
range of stellar irradiance changes.

neutron star merger GW170817 was the first - and still only - confirmed
electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational-wave event. However,
observations of late-time electromagnetic emission are in tension with the
expectations from standard neutron-star merger models. Although the large
measured ejecta mass is potentially explained by a progenitor system that is
asymmetric in terms of the stellar component masses, i.e. with a mass ratio $q$
of 0.7-0.8, the known Galactic population of merging double neutron star (DNS)
systems (i.e. those that will coalesce within billions of years or less) has,
until now, only consisted of nearly equal-mass ($q > 0.9$) binaries. PSR
J1913+1102 is a DNS system in a 5-hour, low-eccentricity ($e = 0.09$) orbit,
implying an orbital separation of 1.8 solar radii, with the two neutron stars
predicted to coalesce in 470 million years due to gravitational-wave emission.
Here we report that the masses of the two neutron stars, as measured by a
dedicated pulsar timing campaign, are $1.62 \pm 0.03$ and $1.27 \pm 0.03$ solar
masses for the pulsar and companion neutron star, respectively; with a measured
mass ratio $q = 0.78 \pm 0.03$, it is the most asymmetric DNS among known
merging systems. Based on this detection, our population synthesis analysis
implies that such asymmetric binaries represent between 2 and 30% (90%
confidence) of the total population of merging DNS binaries. The coalescence of
a member of this population offers a possible explanation for the anomalous
properties of GW170817, including the observed kilonova emission from that
event.

the inspiral stage. This is achieved by incorporating the Bayesian approach
into the CLDNN classifier, which integrates together the Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and the Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM).
Our model successfully detect all seven BBH events in the LIGO Livingston O2
data, with the periods of their GW waveforms correctly labeled. The ability of
a Bayesian approach for uncertainty estimation enables a newly defined
`awareness' state for recognizing the possible presence of signals of unknown
types, which is otherwise rejected in a non-Bayesian model. Such data chunks
labeled with the awareness state can then be further investigated rather than
overlooked. Performance tests with 40,960 training samples against 512 chunks
of 8-second real noise mixed with mock signals of various optimal
signal-to-noise ratio $0 \leq \rho_\text{opt} \leq 18$ show that our model
recognizes 90% of the events when $\rho_\text{opt} >7$ (100% when
$\rho_\text{opt} >8.5$) and successfully labels more than 95% of the waveform
periods when $\rho_\text{opt} >8$. The latency between the arrival of peak
signal and generating an alert with the associated waveform period labeled is
only about 20 seconds for an unoptimized code on a moderate GPU-equipped
personal computer. This makes our model possible for nearly real-time detection
and for forecasting the coalescence events when assisted with deeper training
on a larger dataset using the state-of-art HPCs.

(OD) models, and Zero-Inflation (ZI) models, both of which can be seen as
generalisations of the Poisson distribution; we refer to these as Implicit and
Explicit ZI models, respectively. Although sometimes seen as competing
approaches, they can be complementary; OD is a consequence of ZI modelling, and
ZI is a by-product of OD modelling. The central objective in such analyses is
often concerned with inference on the effect of covariates on the mean, in
light of the apparent excess of zeros in the counts. Typically the modelling of
the excess zeros per se is a secondary objective and there are choices to be
made between, and within, the OD and ZI approaches. The contribution of this
paper is primarily conceptual. We contrast, descriptively, the impact on zeros
of the two approaches. We further offer a novel descriptive characterisation of
alternative ZI models, including the classic hurdle and mixture models, by
providing a unifying theoretical framework for their comparison. This in turn
leads to a novel and technically simpler ZI model. We develop the underlying
theory for univariate counts and touch on its implication for multivariate
count data.

  for Clustering",,,,"cs.CL cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detecting hate speech in the workplace is a unique classification task, as
the underlying social context implies a subtler version of conventional hate
speech. Applications regarding a state-of the-art workplace sexism detection
model include aids for Human Resources departments, AI chatbots and sentiment
analysis. Most existing hate speech detection methods, although robust and
accurate, focus on hate speech found on social media, specifically Twitter. The
context of social media is much more anonymous than the workplace, therefore it
tends to lend itself to more aggressive and ""hostile"" versions of sexism.
Therefore, datasets with large amounts of ""hostile"" sexism have a slightly
easier detection task since ""hostile"" sexist statements can hinge on a couple
words that, regardless of context, tip the model off that a statement is
sexist. In this paper we present a dataset of sexist statements that are more
likely to be said in the workplace as well as a deep learning model that can
achieve state-of-the art results. Previous research has created
state-of-the-art models to distinguish ""hostile"" and ""benevolent"" sexism based
simply on aggregated Twitter data. Our deep learning methods, initialized with
GloVe or random word embeddings, use LSTMs with attention mechanisms to
outperform those models on a more diverse, filtered dataset that is more
targeted towards workplace sexism, leading to an F1 score of 0.88.

total entropy generation. These global quantities are naturally expressed in

the driver flux on global forces, corresponding to the process of Joule

basis of morphogenesis"") has been widely applied to a number of areas in
developmental biology. The related pattern formation models normally comprise a
system of reaction-diffusion equations for interacting chemical species
(""morphogens""), whose heterogeneous distribution in some spatial domain acts as
a template for cells to form some kind of pattern or structure through, for
example, differentiation or proliferation induced by the chemical pre-pattern.
Here we develop a hybrid discrete-continuum modelling framework for the
formation of cellular patterns via the Turing mechanism. In this framework, a
stochastic individual-based model of cell movement and proliferation is
combined with a reaction-diffusion system for the concentrations of some
morphogens. As an illustrative example, we focus on a model in which the
dynamics of the morphogens are governed by an activator-inhibitor system that
gives rise to Turing pre-patterns. The cells then interact with morphogens in
their local area through either of two forms of chemically-dependent cell
action: chemotaxis and chemically-controlled proliferation. We begin by
considering such a hybrid model posed on static spatial domains, and then turn
to the case of growing domains. In both cases, we formally derive the
corresponding deterministic continuum limit and show that that there is an
excellent quantitative match between the spatial patterns produced by the
stochastic individual-based model and its deterministic continuum counterpart,
when sufficiently large numbers of cells are considered. This paper is intended
to present a proof of concept for the ideas underlying the modelling framework,
with the aim to then apply the related methods to the study of specific
patterning and morphogenetic processes in the future.

that of Schwarzschild black hole. Moreover, as the tuning parameter increases,
both the positive real part and negative imaginal part of the quasi-normal
frequency approach to the horizonal axis, but they will not change sign. This
means that all the perturbations could die off and the system is stable under
those perturbations. Since the larger tuning parameter suppresses the effective
potential barrier, so it enhances the grey-body factor. The energy emission
rate of Hawking radiation does not monotonically increase of the tuning
parameter because of the non-monotonicity of the Hawking temperature. Finally,

the related acoustic horizon and the acoustic sphere become larger. Our studies

point between +4 and +7.7, with an average radiant power of 5W (assuming a 945
W power for a zero magnitude meteor) and masses of 1 - 10 mg. These correspond
to a typical magnitude of +6. We find that $\beta$ / ${\tau}$ strongly
correlates with radiant power. All our simultaneous meteors had asteroidal-like
orbits and six were found to be probable iron meteoroids, representing 20
percent of our slow velocity sample. Luminous efficiency values averaged 0.6%
at low speed, ranging from less than 0.1% to almost 30%. No trend of luminous
efficiency with speed was apparent, though a weak correlation between higher
values of luminous efficiency and radiant power may be present.

concentration. This is attributed to Mn$^{2+}$ partially replacing Li$^+$ at
the tetrahedral sites of the spinel lattice accompanied by Mn 3d-state filling
of octahedrally coordinated Mn. During electrocatalytic OER cycling, this
near-surface tetrahedral Mn is leached out, thereby increasing the oxidation

significantly in the surface layer during cycling. The fact that e$_g$ emptying
fails to correlate with OER activity here indicates that octahedral cation
valence is not a fundamental measure of activity, either because the active

theoretical perspective we consider the price of anarchy (PoA). In this paper
we study the impact of spillback effects on the PoA, which turn out to be
substantial. It is known that, in general, the PoA is unbounded in the
spillback setting. We extend this by showing that it is still unbounded even
when considering networks with unit edge capacities and that the Braess ratio
can be arbitrarily large. In contrast to that, we show that on a fixed network
the PoA as a function of the flow amount is bounded by a constant and also
upper bound the PoA for the set of networks where the outflow capacities
satisfy certain constraints depending on the quickest flow. This upper bound
only depends on the worst spillback factor of the Nash flows over time of the
given network. It therefore provides a way to quantify the impact of spillback
to the quality of the dynamic equilibria. In addition, we show the surprising
fact that the introduction of spillback behavior can actually speed up dynamic
equilibria in some networks.

investigate the application of this robust perception-based approach to a
quadrotor model using VIO for state estimation and demonstrate the benefits and
drawbacks of using this technique in simulation and hardware. Additionally, to

They appear as dark matter due to their low charge-to-mass ratio. Their
distribution is believed to be the same as that of dark matter. As such, they
could be accreted by high magnetic field objects and their collisions with
pulsars are inevitable. Pulsar glitches are commonly seen as sudden spin-ups in
pulsar frequency. It is still an open debate with regard to mechanisms giving
rise to such a phenomenon. However, there is a class of sudden changes in
pulsar spin frequency known as microglitches. These event are characterized by
sudden small change in pulsar spin frequency ($ \delta \nu/\nu \approx \pm
10^{-9}$). Clearly, the negative signature seen in some of the events is
inconsistent with the known glitch mechanisms. In this analysis, we suggest
that accretion of strange nuggets with pulsars could readily give rise to
microglitch events. The signature of the events depends on the energy of the
strange nuggets and line of interaction.

One would like tools for statistically analyzing the shapes of BANs, i.e.
quantify shape differences, compare population of subjects, and study the
effects of covariates on these shapes. This paper mathematically represents and
statistically analyzes BAN shapes as elastic shape graphs. Each elastic shape
graph is made up of nodes that are connected by a number of 3D curves, and
edges, with arbitrary shapes. We develop a mathematical representation, a
Riemannian metric and other geometrical tools, such as computations of
geodesics, means and covariances, and PCA for analyzing elastic graphs and
BANs. This analysis is applied to BANs after separating them into four
components -- top, bottom, left, and right. This framework is then used to
generate shape summaries of BANs from 92 subjects, and to study the effects of
age and gender on shapes of BAN components. We conclude that while gender
effects require further investigation, the age has a clear, quantifiable effect
on BAN shapes. Specifically, we find an increased variance in BAN shapes as age
increases.

to serve millions experiencing sleep deprivation and disorders and enable
longitudinal sleep monitoring in home environments. Learning from raw
polysomnography signals and their derived time-frequency image representations
has been prevalent. However, learning from multi-view inputs (e.g., both the
raw signals and the time-frequency images) for sleep staging is difficult and
not well understood. This work proposes a sequence-to-sequence sleep staging
model, XSleepNet, that is capable of learning a joint representation from both
raw signals and time-frequency images. Since different views may generalize or
overfit at different rates, the proposed network is trained such that the
learning pace on each view is adapted based on their generalization/overfitting
behavior. In simple terms, the learning on a particular view is speeded up when
it is generalizing well and slowed down when it is overfitting. View-specific
generalization/overfitting measures are computed on-the-fly during the training
course and used to derive weights to blend the gradients from different views.
As a result, the network is able to retain the representation power of
different views in the joint features which represent the underlying
distribution better than those learned by each individual view alone.
Furthermore, the XSleepNet architecture is principally designed to gain
robustness to the amount of training data and to increase the complementarity
between the input views. Experimental results on five databases of different
sizes show that XSleepNet consistently outperforms the single-view baselines
and the multi-view baseline with a simple fusion strategy. Finally, XSleepNet
also outperforms prior sleep staging methods and improves previous
state-of-the-art results on the experimental databases.

pandemic is to detect and quantify the severity of the disease in a timely
manner. Computed tomographies (CT) of the lungs are effective for assessing the
state of the infection. Unfortunately, labeling CT scans can take a lot of time
and effort, with up to 150 minutes per scan. We address this challenge
introducing a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system that
accelerates the labeling of CT scan images. Conventionally, active learning
methods require the labelers to annotate whole images with full supervision,
but that can lead to wasted efforts as many of the annotations could be
redundant. Thus, our system presents the annotator with unlabeled regions that
promise high information content and low annotation cost. Further, the system
allows annotators to label regions using point-level supervision, which is much
cheaper to acquire than per-pixel annotations. Our experiments on open-source
COVID-19 datasets show that using an entropy-based method to rank unlabeled
regions yields to significantly better results than random labeling of these
regions. Also, we show that labeling small regions of images is more efficient
than labeling whole images. Finally, we show that with only 7\% of the labeling
effort required to label the whole training set gives us around 90\% of the
performance obtained by training the model on the fully annotated training set.

  Single Line Formatting","23 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables, 5 references",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Processing large amounts of data is an essential problem of the big data era.
Most of the data exchange is done via direct communication (using APIs) and
well-structured file formats (JSON, XML, EDI, etc.), but a significant portion
of the data is transferred using arbitrary formatted computer-generated
documents (such as invoices, purchase orders, financial reports, etc.), which
require sophisticated processing and human intervention for data interpretation
and extraction. The currently available solutions, ranging from manual data
entry to low-level scripting and data extraction tools, are costly and require
human intervention. This paper describes the principle methodology for
unsupervised, fully automatic data extraction from a wide range of
computer-generated documents, assuming that their formatting reflects the
original structure of the data sources. The presented methodology falls into
the category of unsupervised machine learning and consists of the three main
parts: (1) - detecting repeating patterns of text formatting by employing the
relative feature space clustering and adaptive weighted feature score maps, (2)
- detecting hierarchical formatting structures via collapsing and noise
filtering procedure applied to the repeating formatting patterns and (3) -
automatic configuration of the interactive data extraction tool (SiMX
TextConverter) for fully automated processing.

based on their historical behaviors. Most of recent advances in recommender
systems mainly focus on modeling users' preferences accurately using deep
learning based approaches. There are two important properties of users'
interests, one is that users' interests are dynamic and evolve over time, the
other is that users' interests have different resolutions, or temporal-ranges
to be precise, such as long-term and short-term preferences. Existing
approaches either use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to address the drifts in
users' interests without considering different temporal-ranges, or design two
different networks to model long-term and short-term preferences separately.
This paper presents a multi-resolution interest fusion model (MRIF) that takes
both properties of users' interests into consideration. The proposed model is
capable to capture the dynamic changes in users' interests at different
temporal-ranges, and provides an effective way to combine a group of
multi-resolution user interests to make predictions. Experiments show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods consistently.

estimation of the joint distribution between individuals, their behaviors, and
goods or services of interest. This work proposes a conditional, coupled
generative adversarial network (RecommenderGAN) that learns to produce samples
from a joint distribution between (view, buy) behaviors found in extremely
sparse implicit feedback training data. User interaction is represented by two
matrices having binary-valued elements. In each matrix, nonzero values indicate
whether a user viewed or bought a specific item in a given product category,
respectively. By encoding actions in this manner, the model is able to
represent entire, large scale product catalogs. Conversion rate statistics
computed on trained GAN output samples ranged from 1.323 to 1.763 percent.
These statistics are found to be significant in comparison to null hypothesis
testing results. The results are shown comparable to published conversion rates
aggregated across many industries and product types. Our results are
preliminary, however they suggest that the recommendations produced by the
model may provide utility for consumers and digital retailers.

to an insistent attack. Once a potential cyber security incidents and system
failures have been identified, deciding how to proceed is often complex.
Especially, if the real cause is not directly in detail determinable.
Therefore, we developed the concept of a Cyber Incident Handling Support
System. The developed system is enriched with information by multiple sources
such as intrusion detection systems and monitoring tools. It uses over twenty
key attributes like sync-package ratio to identify potential security incidents
and to classify the data into different priority categories. Afterwards, the
system uses artificial intelligence to support the further decision-making
process and to generate corresponding reports to brief the Board of Directors.
Originating from this information, appropriate and detailed suggestions are
made regarding the causes and troubleshooting measures. Feedback from users
regarding the problem solutions are included into future decision-making by
using labelled flow data as input for the learning process. The prototype shows
that the decision making can be sustainably improved and the Cyber Incident
Handling process becomes much more effective.

  Misspecification and High-Dimensional Data",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study two practically important cases of model based clustering using
Gaussian Mixture Models: (1) when there is misspecification and (2) on high
dimensional data, in the light of recent advances in Gradient Descent (GD)
based optimization using Automatic Differentiation (AD). Our simulation studies
show that EM has better clustering performance, measured by Adjusted Rand
Index, compared to GD in cases of misspecification, whereas on high dimensional
data GD outperforms EM. We observe that both with EM and GD there are many
solutions with high likelihood but poor cluster interpretation. To address this
problem we design a new penalty term for the likelihood based on the Kullback
Leibler divergence between pairs of fitted components. Closed form expressions
for the gradients of this penalized likelihood are difficult to derive but AD
can be done effortlessly, illustrating the advantage of AD-based optimization.
Extensions of this penalty for high dimensional data and for model selection
are discussed. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate
the efficacy of clustering using the proposed penalized likelihood approach.

generates lymphocytes, the cells in charge of the adaptive immune response.
Disruptions of this process are associated with diseases like leukaemia, which
is especially incident in children. The characteristics of self-regulation of
this process make them suitable for a mathematical study.
  In this paper we develop mathematical models of lymphopoiesis using currently
available data. We do this by drawing inspiration from existing structured
models of cell lineage development and integrating them with paediatric bone
marrow data, with special focus on regulatory mechanisms. A formal analysis of
the models is carried out, giving steady states and their stability conditions.
We use this analysis to obtain biologically relevant regions of the parameter
space and to understand the dynamical behaviour of B-cell renovation. Finally,
we use numerical simulations to obtain further insight into the influence of
proliferation and maturation rates on the reconstitution of the cells in the B
line. We conclude that a model including feedback regulation of cell
proliferation represents a biologically plausible depiction for B-cell
reconstitution in bone marrow. Research into haematological disorders could
benefit from a precise dynamical description of B lymphopoiesis.
