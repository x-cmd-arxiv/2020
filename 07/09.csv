  of Feynman graphs and other integrals","39 pages, 10 figures",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Landau equations give a physically useful criterion for how singularities
arise in Feynman amplitudes. Furthermore, they are fundamental to the uses of
perturbative QCD, by determining the important regions of momentum space in
asymptotic problems. Generalizations are also useful. We will show that in
existing treatments there are significant gaps in derivations, and in some
cases implicit assumptions that will be shown here to be false in important
cases like the massless Feynman graphs ubiquitous in QCD applications. In this
paper is given a new proof that the Landau condition is both necessary and
sufficient for physical-region pinches in the kinds of integral typified by
Feynman graphs. The proof's range is broad enough to include the modified
Feynman graphs that are used in QCD applications. Unlike many existing
derivations, there is no need to use the Feynman parameter method. Some
possible further applications of the new proof and its subsidiary results are
proposed.

  under Additive Gaussian White Noise","There was an error in the derivation",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The power-spectrum subband energy ratio (PSER) has been applied in a variety
of fields, but reports on its statistical properties have been limited. As
such, this study investigates these characteristics in the presence of additive
Gaussian white noise for both pure noise and mixed signals. By analyzing the
probability and independence of power spectrum bins, and the relationship
between the F and beta distributions, we develop a probability distribution for
the PSER. Results showed that in the case of pure noise, the PSER follows a
beta distribution. In addition, the probability density function and the
quantile exhibited no relationship with the noise variance, only with the
number of lines in the power spectrum, that is, PSER is not affected by noise.
When Gaussian white noise was mixed with the known signal, the resulting PSER
followed a doubly non-central beta distribution. In this case, it was difficult
to identify the quantile, as the probability density and cumulative
distribution functions were represented by infinite series. However, when a
spectral bin did not contain the power spectrum of the known signal, an
approximated quantile was found. This quantile is strictly proved to be in
agreement with the quantile in the case of pure noise and offers a convenient
methodology for identifying valid signals.

the experience of a team of neuroradiologists who labelled over 5000 MRI

learning-based neuroradiology report classifier. We show that, in our
experience, assigning binary labels (i.e. normal vs abnormal) to images from
reports alone is highly accurate. In contrast to the binary labels, however,
the accuracy of more granular labelling is dependent on the category, and we
highlight reasons for this discrepancy. We also show that downstream model
performance is reduced when labelling of training reports is performed by a
non-specialist. To allow other researchers to accelerate their research, we
make our refined abnormality definitions and labelling rules available, as well
as our easy-to-use radiology report labelling app which helps streamline this

simply averaging covariance matrix estimators from multiple chains (average BM)

for the underestimation. Under weak conditions on the mixing rate of the

similar large-sample bias and variance. However, in small runs the RBM
estimator can be dramatically superior. This is demonstrated through a variety
of examples, including a two-variable Gibbs sampler for a bivariate Gaussian

just as it is for classical computing. Current schedulers optimize for data
parallelism by allowing simultaneous execution of instructions, as long as
their qubits do not overlap. However, on many quantum hardware platforms,
instructions on overlapping qubits can be executed simultaneously through
__global interactions__. For example, while fan-out in traditional quantum
circuits can only be implemented sequentially when viewed at the logical level,
global interactions at the physical level allow fan-out to be achieved in one
step. We leverage this simultaneous fan-out primitive to optimize circuit
synthesis for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) workloads. In addition,
we introduce novel quantum memory architectures based on fan-out.
  Our work also addresses hardware implementation of the fan-out primitive. We
perform realistic simulations for trapped ion quantum computers. We also
demonstrate experimental proof-of-concept of fan-out with superconducting
qubits. We perform depth (runtime) and fidelity estimation for NISQ application
circuits and quantum memory architectures under realistic noise models. Our
simulations indicate promising results with an asymptotic advantage in runtime,
as well as 7--24% reduction in error.

erroneous predictions. However it is unclear which OoDD method should be used
in practice. Specific Problem: Systems trained for one particular domain of
images cannot be expected to perform accurately on images of a different
domain. These images should be flagged by an OoDD method prior to diagnosis.
Our approach: This paper defines 3 categories of OoD examples and benchmarks
popular OoDD methods in three domains of medical imaging: chest X-ray, fundus
imaging, and histology slides. Results: Our experiments show that despite
methods yielding good results on some categories of out-of-distribution
samples, they fail to recognize images close to the training distribution.
Conclusion: We find a simple binary classifier on the feature representation
has the best accuracy and AUPRC on average. Users of diagnostic tools which
employ these OoDD methods should still remain vigilant that images very close
to the training distribution yet not in it could yield unexpected results.

the collective motion appears in disorder. To initiate and maintain a swarm in
place, flying insects often use a visual external cue called a marker. In
mosquitoes, understanding the swarming behavior and its relation to the marker
has an additional medical relevance since swarming often precedes mating in the
wild, thus constituting an important stage to intercept for controlling
mosquito population. In this paper, we conduct preliminary experiments to
characterize the visual coupling between a swarm of mosquitoes and a marker. A
laboratory microcosm with artificial lighting was built to stimulate consistent
swarming in the malarial mosquito Anopheles stephensi. The experimental setup
was used to film a mosquito swarm with a stereo camera system as a marker was
moved back-and-forth with different frequencies. System identification analysis
of the frequency response shows that the relationship between the swarm and the
marker can be described by delayed second order dynamics in a feedback loop.
Further, the length of the internal time delay appears to correlate with the
number of mosquitoes swarming on the marker indicating that such a delay may be
able capture social interactions within swarming systems. For insect swarms,
model fitting of trajectory data provides a way to numerically compare swarming
behaviors of different species with respect to marker characteristics. These
preliminary results motivate investigating linear dynamic system in feedback as
a framework for modeling insect swarms and set the stage for future studies.

sourced by the quantum inflationary fluctuations, if measured, could both
provide a substantial evidence for primordial inflation and shed light on
physics at extremely high energy scales. In this work we focus on their
propagating speed. Using an effective field theory approach we introduce a
time-dependent propagating speed $c_{\rm T}(t)$ showing that also small
deviations from the General Relativity (GR) prediction $c_{\rm T}(t) = c$ can
lead to testable consequences. We derive a set of equations that relate the
propagating speed and its time dependence to the inflationary parameters and
that generalize the usual slow roll consistency relations. Imposing the new
generalized consistency relations and combining small and large scales data, we
derive model independent constraints on inflation with non-trivial primordial
tensor speed. In particular we constrain its scale dependence to be $d\log
c_{\rm T} / d\log k=0.082^{+0.047}_{-0.11}$ at 68% C.L. while we only derive
the lower bound $c_{\rm T}>0.22\,c$ at 95% C.L. . We also constrain the
tensor-to-scalar ratio at the pivot scale $k_*=0.05\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to be
$r<0.0599$ at 95% C.L. in agreement with the result provided by the Planck

results show a remarkable agreement with the standard slow roll predictions and

accuracy seriously compromised for reduced numbers of superpixels. We have
investigated a solution based on the Iterative Spanning Forest (ISF) framework.
In this work, we present Dynamic ISF (DISF) -- a method based on the following
steps. (a) It starts from an image graph and a seed set with considerably more
pixels than the desired number of superpixels. (b) The seeds compete among
themselves, and each seed conquers its most closely connected pixels, resulting
in an image partition (spanning forest) with connected superpixels. In step
(c), DISF assigns relevance values to seeds based on superpixel analysis and
removes the most irrelevant ones. Steps (b) and (c) are repeated until the
desired number of superpixels is reached. DISF has the chance to reconstruct
relevant edges after each iteration, when compared to region merging
algorithms. As compared to other seed-based superpixel methods, DISF is more
likely to find relevant seeds. It also introduces dynamic arc-weight estimation
in the ISF framework for more effective superpixel delineation, and we
demonstrate all results on three datasets with distinct object properties.

by the presence of artifacts, occlusions, limited contrast and more. Most
notable is the case of chest radiography, where there is a high inter-rater
variability in the detection and classification of abnormalities. This is
largely due to inconclusive evidence in the data or subjective definitions of
disease appearance. An additional example is the classification of anatomical
views based on 2D Ultrasound images. Often, the anatomical context captured in
a frame is not sufficient to recognize the underlying anatomy. Current machine
learning solutions for these problems are typically limited to providing
probabilistic predictions, relying on the capacity of underlying models to
adapt to limited information and the high degree of label noise. In practice,
however, this leads to overconfident systems with poor generalization on unseen
data. To account for this, we propose a system that learns not only the
probabilistic estimate for classification, but also an explicit uncertainty
measure which captures the confidence of the system in the predicted output. We
argue that this approach is essential to account for the inherent ambiguity
characteristic of medical images from different radiologic exams including
computed radiography, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. In our
experiments we demonstrate that sample rejection based on the predicted
uncertainty can significantly improve the ROC-AUC for various tasks, e.g., by
8% to 0.91 with an expected rejection rate of under 25% for the classification
of different abnormalities in chest radiographs. In addition, we show that
using uncertainty-driven bootstrapping to filter the training data, one can
achieve a significant increase in robustness and accuracy.

dimensional fluid code. The features of the blobs (size, amplitude, position)
are determined with a blob tracking algorithm, which identifies them as
coherent structures above a chosen density threshold and compared to a
conventional center of mass approach. The agreement of these two methods is
shown to be affected by the parameters of the blob tracking algorithm. The
benchmarked approach is then extended to a population of interacting plasma
blobs with statistically distributed amplitudes, sizes and initial positions
for different levels of intermittency. As expected, for decreasing
intermittency, we observe an increasing number of blobs deviating from
size-velocity scaling laws of perfectly isolated blobs. This is found to be
caused by the interaction of blobs with the electrostatic potential of one
another, leading to higher average blob velocities. The degree of variation
from the picture of perfectly isolated blobs is quantified as a function of the

plan to extract weather relations between the Chajnantor Plateau and the summit

We revised our method to convert from submillimeter tipper opacity to PWV. We
now include the ground temperature as an input parameter to the conversion
scheme and, therefore, achieve a higher conversion accuracy. Results.We found a
decrease in the measured PWV at the summit of Cerro Chajnantor with respect to
the plateau of 28%. In addition, we found a PWV difference of 1:9% with only 27
m of altitude difference between two sites in the Chajnantor Plateau: the
Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) and the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI)
near the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) center. This difference is
possibly due to local topographic conditions that favor the discrepancy in PWV.
The scale height for the plateau was extracted from the measurements of the
plateau and the Cerro Chajnantor summit, giving a value of 1537 m. Considering
the results obtained in this work from the long-term study, we do not see
evidence of PWV trends in the 20-year period of the analysis that would suggest
climate change in such a timescale.

perform a series of 2D simulations using the Bousinessq approximation with
Prandtl number ranging from Pr = 0.1 to 7, extending previous work on salty
water to low Pr. We show that the evolution of the convection zone is
well-described by an entrainment prescription in which a fixed fraction of the
kinetic energy of convective motions is used to mix fluid at the interface with
the stable layer. We measure the entrainment efficiency and find that it grows
with decreasing Prandtl number or increased applied heat flux. The kinetic
energy flux that determines the entrainment rate is a small fraction of the
total convective luminosity. In this time-dependent situation, the density
ratio at the interface is driven to a narrow range that depends on the value of
Pr, and with low enough values that advection dominates the interfacial
transport. We characterize the interfacial flux ratio and how it depends on the
interface stability. We present an analytic model that accounts for the growth
of the convective layer with two parameters, the entrainment efficiency and the
interfacial heat transport, both of which can be measure from the simulations.

principles is introduced, focusing on the coherent case. The model is based on
the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism and maximally localized
Wannier functions (MLWFs). Any device simulation, here based on two-dimensional
(2-D) materials, starts by identifying a representative unit cell, computing
its electronic structure with density functional theory (DFT), and converting
the plane-wave results into a set of MLWFs. From this localized representation
of the original unit cell, the device Hamiltonian can be constructed with the
help of properly designed upscaling techniques. Here, a powerful tool called
Winterface is presented to automatize the whole process and interface the
initial MLWF representation with a quantum transport solver. Its concepts,
algorithms, and general functionality are discussed on the basis of a
molybdenum disulfide (2-D) monolayer structure, as well as its combination with
tungsten disulfide. The developed approach can be considered as completely
general, restricted only by the capability of the user to perform the required
DFT calculations and to ""wannierize"" its plane-wave results.

(i) localize the boundary pixels and (ii) identify the corresponding interior
pixel for each boundary pixel. We build the correspondence by learning a
direction away from the boundary pixel to an interior pixel. Our method
requires no prior information of the segmentation models and achieves nearly
real-time speed. We empirically verify that our SegFix consistently reduces the

coefficient, which quantifies the fraction of plastic work that is converted
into heat during plastic deformation. Associated with the two energy
contributions are two separate temperatures -- the ordinary temperature for the
thermal energy and the effective temperature for the configurational energy. We
show that the Taylor-Quinney coefficient is a function of the thermodynamically
defined effective temperature that measures the atomic configurational disorder
in the material. Finite-element analysis of recently published experiments on
the aluminum alloy 6016-T4 \citep{neto_2020}, using the thermodynamic
dislocation theory (TDT), shows good agreement between theory and experiment
for both stress-strain behavior and temporal evolution of the temperature. The
simulations include both conductive and convective thermal energy loss during
the experiments, and significant thermal gradients exist within the simulation
results. Computed values of the differential Taylor-Quinney coefficient are

material without magnetic transition metal ions, thus ensuring that the Er ions
play a key role in achieving this interesting property. Our detailed study
includes measurements of the structural, magnetic, and electric properties of
this material. Bulk characterization and neutron powder diffraction show no
evidence for structural phase transitions down to 0.3 K and therefore
CsEr(MoO4)2 maintains the room temperature P2/c space group over a wide
temperature range without external magnetic field. These same measurements also
identify collinear antiferromagnetic ordering of the Er3+ moments below TN =
0.87 K. Complementary dielectric constant and pyroelectric current measurements
reveal that a ferroelectric phase (P ~ 0.5 nC/cm2) emerges when applying a
modest external magnetic field, which indicates that this material has a strong
magnetoelectric coupling. We argue that the magnetoelectric coupling in this

approaches being developed. The aim of this work is to compare three of them:
quantum Darwinism, Spectrum Broadcast Structures, and strong quantum Darwinism.
The paper is concentrated on foundations, providing a synthetic analysis of how
the three approaches realize the idea of objectivity and how they are related
to each other. As a byproduct of this analysis, a proof of a generalized
Spectrum Broadcast Structure theorem is presented. Recent quantum Darwinism
experiments are also briefly discussed.

For $\Upsilon$(nS) mesons with $p_\mathrm{T}^{\mu\mu}$ $\gt$ 7 GeV, where most

function of the underlying event transverse sphericity and the number of

XENON1T detector has drawn many attentions as a potential hint for an extension
of the Standard Model (SM). Absorption of a vector boson with the mass of
$m_{A'}\!\in\!(2\,{\rm keV},\!3\,{\rm keV})$ is one of the feasible
explanations to the excess. In the case where the vector boson explains the
dark matter (DM) population today, it is highly probable that the vector boson
belongs to a class of the warm dark matter (WDM) due to its suspected mass
regime. In such a scenario, providing a good fit for the excess, the kinetic
mixing $\kappa\!\sim\!10^{-15}$ asks for a non-thermal origin of the vector DM.
In this letter, we consider a scenario where the gauge boson is nothing but the
$U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ gauge boson and its non-thermal origin is attributed to the
decay of the coherently oscillating scalar of which condensation induces the
spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$. We discuss implications for the early
universe physics when the warm nature of the vector DM serves as a resolution
to both the small scale problems that $\Lambda$CDM model encounters and the
XENON1T anomaly.

wide variety of applications ranging from inertial sensing, electro- and
magnetometry to chemical and biological sensing. These sensors have a dynamic
range limited by the linewidth of the cavity mode transducing the input. This
dynamic range not only determines the range of the signal strength that can be
detected, but also affects the resilience of the sensor to large deteriorating
external perturbations and shocks in a practical environment. Unfortunately,
there is a general trade-off between the detection sensitivity and the dynamic
range, which undermines the performance of all microcavity-based sensors. Here
we propose an approach to extend the dynamic range significantly beyond the
cavity linewidth limit, in the nonlinear modulation regime, without degrading
the detection sensitivity for weak signals. With a cavity optomechanical
system, we experimentally demonstrate a dynamic range six times larger than the
cavity linewidth, far beyond the conventional linear region of operation for
such a sensor. The approach demonstrated here will help design
microcavity-based sensors to achieve high detection sensitivity and a large
dynamic range at the same time, a crucial property for their use in a practical
environment.

changes on their communication models and a shift from the classical bent-pipe
architectures to more sophisticated networking platforms. Thanks to
technological advancements in microelectronics and micro-systems, the terahertz
(THz) band has emerged as a strong candidate for inter-satellite links (ISLs)
due to its promise of high data rates. Yet, the propagation conditions of the
THz band need to be properly modeled and controlled by utilizing reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) to leverage their full potential. In this work, we
first provide an assessment of the use of the THz band for ISLs, and quantify
the impact of misalignment fading on error performance. Then, in order to
compensate for the high path loss associated with high carrier frequencies, and
to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we propose the use of RISs
mounted on neighboring satellites to enable signal propagation. Based on a
mathematical analysis of the problem, we present the error rate expressions for
RIS-assisted ISLs with misalignment fading. Also, numerical results show that
RIS can leverage the error rate performance and achievable capacity of THz
ISLs.

MRI. Fasting and administration of hyoscine butylbromide (BUSC) have been
proposed for bowel motion reduction, but with inconsistent results and limited
efficacy assessments. Here, we evaluate these regimes for mouse abdominal MRI
at high field. Methods: Thirty-two adult C57BL/6J mice were imaged on a 9.4T
scanner with a FLASH sequence, acquired over 90 minutes with ~19s temporal
resolution. During MRI acquisition, eight mice were injected with a low-dose
and eight mice with a high-dose bolus of BUSC (0.5 and 5 mg/kg, respectively).
Eight mice were food deprived for 4.5-6.5h before MRI and another group of 8
mice was injected with saline during MRI acquisition. Two expert readers
reviewed the images and classified bowel motion, and quantitative voxel-wise
analyses were performed for identification of moving regions. After defining
the most effective protocol, high-resolution T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted
images were acquired from four mice. Results: High-dose BUSC was the most
effective protocol for bowel motion reduction, for up to 45 minutes. Fasting
and saline protocols were not effective in suppressing bowel motion.
High-resolution abdominal MRI clearly demonstrated improved image quality and
ADC quantification with the high-dose BUSC protocol. Conclusion: Our data show
that BUSC administration is advantageous for abdominal MRI in the mouse.
Specifically, it endows significant bowel motion reduction, with relatively
short onset timings after injection (~8.5 minutes) and relatively long duration
of the effect (~45 minutes). These features improve the quality of
high-resolution images of the mouse abdomen.

observed dynamics is developed. The prediction problem we consider is a
supervised learning task of finding a regression function that takes a delay
embedded observable to the observable at a future time. When delay embedding
theory is applicable, the proposed regression function is a consistent
estimator of the flow map induced by the delay embedding. Furthermore, the
corresponding Mori-Zwanzig equation governing the evolution of the observable
simplifies to only a Markovian term, represented by the regression function. We
realize this supervised learning task with a class of kernel-based linear
estimators, the kernel analog forecast (KAF), which are consistent in the limit
of large data. In a scenario with a high-dimensional covariate space, we employ
a Markovian kernel smoothing method which is computationally cheaper than the
Nystr\""om projection method for realizing KAF. In addition to the guaranteed
theoretical convergence, we numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach on higher-dimensional problems where the relevant kernel features are
difficult to capture with the Nystr\""om method. Given noisy training data, we
propose a nonparametric smoother as a de-noising method. Numerically, we show
that the proposed smoother is more accurate than EnKF and 4Dvar in de-noising
signals corrupted by independent (but not necessarily identically distributed)
noise, even if the smoother is constructed using a data set corrupted by white
noise. We show skillful prediction using the KAF constructed from the denoised

recommendation systems, feature selection, or summary extraction, harnessing
the intrinsic ability of these probabilistic models to facilitate sample
diversity. The ability to sample from DPPs is paramount to the empirical
investigation of these models. Most exact samplers are variants of a spectral
meta-algorithm due to Hough, Krishnapur, Peres and Vir\'ag (henceforth HKPV),
which is in general time and resource intensive. For DPPs with symmetric
kernels, scalable HKPV samplers have been proposed that either first downsample
the ground set of items, or force the kernel to be low-rank, using e.g.
Nystr\""om-type decompositions.
  In the present work, we contribute a radically different approach than HKPV.
Exploiting the fact that many statistical and learning objectives can be
effectively accomplished by only sampling certain key observables of a DPP
(so-called linear statistics), we invoke an expression for the Laplace
transform of such an observable as a single determinant, which holds in
complete generality. Combining traditional low-rank approximation techniques
with Laplace inversion algorithms from numerical analysis, we show how to
directly approximate the distribution function of a linear statistic of a DPP.
This distribution function can then be used in hypothesis testing or to
actually sample the linear statistic, as per requirement. Our approach is
scalable and applies to very general DPPs, beyond traditional symmetric
kernels.

locational marginal price (DLMP) and distribution locational price (DLP), are
analyzed. For DLMP, an explicit method is developed to calculate the marginal
loss that does not require a backward/forward sweep algorithm and thus reduces
the computational complexity. However, the marginal loss component in DLMP will
cause over-collection of losses (OCL). To address this issue, DLP is defined,
which contains two components, the energy cost component and loss component,
where the loss component is determined by the proposed loss allocation method
(LAM). Numerical tests show that the proposed MDOPF has a better accuracy than
existing OPF models based on linear power flow equations. In addition, the
proposed marginal loss method and DLMP algorithm have satisfactory accuracy
compared with benchmarks provided by ACOPF, and the proposed DLP can eliminate

proportion of prime numbers in almost all short intervals. Furthermore we
quantify ""almost all"" with uniform power-saving upper bounds, that is, we save
a power of the suitably normalized length of the interval regardless of how
long or short the interval is. Such power-saving bounds are new even in the
special case of the M\""obius function. These general results are motivated by
several applications. First, we strengthen work of Hooley on sums of two
squares by establishing an asymptotic for the number of integers that are sums
of two squares in almost all short intervals. Previously only the order of
magnitude was known. Secondly, we extend this result to general norm forms of
an arbitrary number field $K$ (sums of two squares are norm-forms of
$\mathbb{Q}(i)$). Thirdly, Hooley determined the order of magnitude of the sum
of $(s_{n + 1} - s_{n})^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \in (1, 5/3)$ where $s_{1} < s_2
< \ldots$ denote integers representable as sums of two squares. We establish a
similar results with $\gamma \in (1, 3/2)$ and $s_n$ the sequence of integers
representable as norm-forms of an arbitrary number field $K$. This is the first
such result for a number field of degree greater than two. Assuming the Riemann
Hypothesis for all Hecke $L$-functions we also show that $\gamma \in (1,2)$ is
admissible. Fourthly, we improve on a recent result of Heath-Brown about gaps
between $x^{\varepsilon}$-smooth numbers. More generally, we obtain results
about gaps between multiplicative sequences. Finally our result is useful in
other contexts aswell, for instance in our forthcoming work on Fourier
uniformity (joint with Terence Tao, Joni Terav\""ainen and Tamar Ziegler).

this scenario when a single component transition magnetic moment takes values
$\mu_{\nu_e\nu_\mu} \in(1.65 - 3.42) \times 10^{-11} \mu_B$. Such a large value
typically leads to unacceptably large neutrino masses. In this paper we show
that new leptonic symmetries can solve this problem and demonstrate this with
several examples. We first revive and then propose a simplified model based on
$SU(2)_H$ horizontal symmetry. Owing to the difference in their Lorentz
structures, in the $SU(2)_H$ symmetric limit, $m_\nu$ vanishes while
$\mu_{\nu_e\nu_\mu}$ is nonzero. Our simplified model is based on an
approximate $SU(2)_H$, which we also generalize to a three family
$SU(3)_H$-symmetry. Collider and low energy tests of these models are analyzed.
We have also analyzed implications of the XENON1T data for the Zee model and
its extensions which naturally generate a large $\mu_{\nu_e\nu_\mu}$ with
suppressed $m_\nu$ via a spin symmetry mechanism, but found that the induced
$\mu_{\nu_e\nu_\mu}$ is not large enough to explain recent data. Finally, we
suggest a mechanism to evade stringent astrophysical limits on neutrino
magnetic moments arising from stellar evolution by inducing a medium-dependent
mass for the neutrino.

workloads, several inefficiencies in the memory hierarchy and data movement
result in a waste of GPU resources and difficulties in programming MGPU
systems. First, due to the lack of hardware-level coherence, the MGPU
programming model requires the programmer to replicate and repeatedly transfer
data between the GPUs' memory. This leads to inefficient use of precious GPU
memory. Second, to maintain coherency across an MGPU system, transferring data
using low-bandwidth and high-latency off-chip links leads to degradation in
system performance. Third, since the programmer needs to manually maintain data
coherence, the programming of an MGPU system to maximize its throughput is
extremely challenging. To address the above issues, we propose a novel
lightweight timestamp-based coherence protocol, HALCONE, for MGPU systems and
modify the memory hierarchy of the GPUs to support physically shared memory.
HALCONE replaces the Compute Unit (CU) level logical time counters with cache
level logical time counters to reduce coherence traffic. Furthermore, HALCONE
introduces a novel timestamp storage unit (TSU) with no additional performance
overhead in the main memory to perform coherence actions. Our proposed HALCONE
protocol maintains the data coherence in the memory hierarchy of the MGPU with
minimal performance overhead (less than 1\%). Using a set of standard MGPU
benchmarks, we observe that a 4-GPU MGPU system with shared memory and HALCONE
performs, on average, 4.6$\times$ and 3$\times$ better than a 4-GPU MGPU system
with existing RDMA and with the recently proposed HMG coherence protocol,
respectively. We demonstrate the scalability of HALCONE using different GPU
counts (2, 4, 8, and 16) and different CU counts (32, 48, and 64 CUs per GPU)

magnitude to the Biermann term. We then include this in an extended
magneto-hydrodynamics approach to post-process an xRAGE radiation-hydrodynamic

the electron heat conduction enough to cause contraction of the jet to an

change its core penetration and therefore the final mix mass, which is known to
be well correlated with fusion yield degradation. Fully exploring this will
require self-consistent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. Experimental
signatures of this self-magnetization may emerge in the high energy neutron

cosmic rays up to the knee, the supernova paradigm still has many loose ends.
The weakest point in this construction is the possibility that individual
supernova remnants can accelerate particles to the rigidity of the knee, $\sim
10^{6}$ GV. This scenario heavily relies upon the possibility to excite current
driven non-resonant hybrid modes while the shock is still at the beginning of
the Sedov phase. These modes can enhance the rate of particle scattering
thereby leading to potentially very-high maximum energies. Here we calculate
the spectrum of particles released into the interstellar medium from the
remnants of different types of supernovae. We find that only the remnants of
very powerful, rare core-collapse supernova explosions can accelerate light
elements such as hydrogen and helium nuclei, to the knee rigidity, and that the
local spectrum of cosmic rays directly constrains the rate of such events, if
they are also source of PeV cosmic rays. On the other hand, for remnants of
typical core-collapse supernova explosions, the Sedov phase is reached at late
times, when the maximum energy is too low and the spectrum at very-high
energies is very steep, being mostly produced during the ejecta dominated
phase. For typical thermonuclear explosions, resulting in type Ia supernovae,
we confirm previous findings that these objects can only produce cosmic rays up
to $\lesssim 10^{5}$ GeV. The implications for the overall cosmic ray spectrum
observed at the Earth and for the detection of PeVatrons by future gamma-ray

other states play a role. Using density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG)
calculations of the Pariser-Parr-Pople-Peierls Hamiltonian, we investigate
candidate states that could be involved in singlet fission. We find that the

composed of both triplet-pair and electron-hole character, which are
fundamentally the same excitation, but have different center-of-mass energies.
The lowest energy member of this family, the $2^1A_g^-$ state, cannot undergo

the main phonon scattering mechanisms are disentangled. This led to the

effects, the strong spin-orbit interaction causes a significant enhancement of
the $g$-factor with magnetic field.The large spin-orbit interaction strength

engineered molecular dimer composed of two strongly coupled chromophores. We
show that if pumped by the surrounding photosynthetic complex, which

optimizes two main components: 1) a public module, that receives the raw data

in a photo-realistic and seamless way; and 2) a private module, designed for
legal/security authorities, that analyses the public stream and reconstructs
the original scene, disclosing the actual IDs of all the subjects in the scene.
The proposed solution is landmarks-free and uses a conditional generative
adversarial network to generate synthetic faces that preserve pose, lighting,
background information and even facial expressions. Also, we enable full
control over the set of soft facial attributes that should be preserved between
the raw and de-identified data, which broads the range of applications for this

a wide range of impacts, using 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations

to extremely different behaviours and consequences for the planets. In spite of

Scaling is independent of the system mass for a constant impactor mass ratio.
Slow atmosphere-hosting impactors can also deliver a significant mass of
atmosphere, but always accompanied by larger proportions of their mantle and
core. Different Moon-forming impact hypotheses suggest that around 10 to 60% of

removable by multi-frequency cleaning or masking and can lead to large biases
if not properly accounted for. For foregrounds made of a number of unclustered
point sources, an estimator for the source amplitude can be derived and
deprojected, removing any bias to the lensing reconstruction. We show with
simulations that all of the extragalactic foregrounds in temperature can be
approximated by a collection of sources with identical profiles, and that a
simple bias hardening technique is effective at reducing any bias to lensing,
at a minimal noise cost. We compare the performance and bias to other methods
such as ""shear-only"" reconstruction, and discuss how to jointly deproject any
arbitrary number of foregrounds, each with an arbitrary profile. In particular,
for a Simons Observatory-like experiment foreground-hardened estimators allow
us to extend the maximum multipole used in the reconstruction, increasing the
overall statistical power by $\sim 50\%$ over the standard quadratic estimator,

outperforms the standard lensing quadratic estimator both in auto and

recently led to the investigation of spectral and steady-state properties of
random Lindbladian dynamics. A natural question is then how realistic and
universal those properties are. Here, we address these issues by considering a
different description of dissipative quantum systems, namely, the discrete-time
Kraus map representation of completely positive quantum dynamics. Through
random matrix theory (RMT) techniques and numerical exact diagonalization, we
study random Kraus maps, allowing for a varying dissipation strength, and their
local circuit counterpart. We find the spectrum of the random Kraus map to be
either an annulus or a disk inside the unit circle in the complex plane, with a
transition between the two cases taking place at a critical value of
dissipation strength. The eigenvalue distribution and the spectral transition
are well described by a simplified RMT model that we can solve exactly in the
thermodynamic limit, by means of non-Hermitian RMT and quaternionic free
probability. The steady state, on the contrary, is not affected by the spectral
transition. It has, however, a perturbative crossover regime at small
dissipation, inside which the steady state is characterized by uncorrelated
eigenvalues. At large dissipation (or for any dissipation for a large-enough
system), the steady state is well described by a random Wishart matrix. The
steady-state properties thus coincide with those already observed for random
Lindbladian dynamics, indicating their universality. Quite remarkably, the
statistical properties of the local Kraus circuit are qualitatively the same as
those of the nonlocal Kraus map, indicating that the latter, which is more
tractable, already captures the realistic and universal physical properties of
generic open quantum systems.

type IIB flux compactifications but did not systematically incorporate the
K\""ahler moduli. In this paper we point out that the inclusion of the K\""ahler
moduli is crucial to understand the distribution of the supersymmetry breaking
scale in the landscape since in general one obtains unstable vacua when the
F-terms of the dilaton and the complex structure moduli are larger than the
F-terms of the K\""ahler moduli. After taking K\""ahler moduli stabilisation into
account, we find that the distribution of the gravitino mass and the soft terms
is power-law only in KKLT and perturbatively stabilised vacua which therefore
favour high scale supersymmetry. On the other hand, LVS vacua feature a
logarithmic distribution of soft terms and thus a preference for lower scales
of supersymmetry breaking. Whether the landscape of type IIB flux vacua
predicts a logarithmic or power-law distribution of the supersymmetry breaking
scale thus depends on the relative preponderance of LVS and KKLT vacua.

respectively, produce shifts of $\lesssim 0.25\sigma$ on each of the six

effects can deteriorate the constraints severely, especially on the linear
growth rate. Adding the galaxy bispectrum helps break parameter degeneracies
significantly. We find that a joint power spectrum-bispectrum analysis of a
Euclid-like survey can still measure the linear growth rate to 10% precision

parameter shifts arising from ignoring selection effects and/or other bias
parameters, and emphasize that it is necessary to either control selection
effects at the percent level or marginalize over them. We obtain similar

the oblateness effect on the orientation of the satellite. The numerical
evolution of the eccentricity, obtained by a two-degree-of-freedom model
assuming different orders in the series expansion of the third-body effect, is
compared against the mean evolution given by the TLE. The results show that,
despite being highly elliptical orbits, the second order expansion catches
extremely well the behavior. Also, the lunisolar effect turns out to be
non-negligible for the behavior of the longitude of the ascending node and the

achieved impressive performances on single image super-resolution (SISR).
However, their excessive amounts of convolutions and parameters usually consume
high computational cost and more memory storage for training a SR model, which
limits their applications to SR with resource-constrained devices in real
world. To resolve these problems, we propose a lightweight enhanced SR CNN
(LESRCNN) with three successive sub-blocks, an information extraction and
enhancement block (IEEB), a reconstruction block (RB) and an information
refinement block (IRB). Specifically, the IEEB extracts hierarchical
low-resolution (LR) features and aggregates the obtained features step-by-step
to increase the memory ability of the shallow layers on deep layers for SISR.
To remove redundant information obtained, a heterogeneous architecture is
adopted in the IEEB. After that, the RB converts low-frequency features into
high-frequency features by fusing global and local features, which is
complementary with the IEEB in tackling the long-term dependency problem.
Finally, the IRB uses coarse high-frequency features from the RB to learn more
accurate SR features and construct a SR image. The proposed LESRCNN can obtain
a high-quality image by a model for different scales. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed LESRCNN outperforms state-of-the-arts on SISR in
terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The code of LESRCNN is
accessible on https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/LESRCNN.

exhibit both low bias and a reduced variance in finite samples compared to

semiparametric efficiency and demonstrate how to utilize additional information

presence of model misspecification, which may lead to undesirable extreme
behavior of the posterior distributions for large sample sizes. Generalized
belief updating with a loss function represents a central principle to making
Bayesian inference more robust and less vulnerable to deviations from the
assumed model. Here we consider such updates with $f$-divergences to quantify a
discrepancy between the assumed statistical model and the probability
distribution which generated the observed data. Since the latter is generally
unknown, estimation of the divergence may be viewed as an intractable problem.
We show that the divergence becomes accessible through the use of probabilistic
classifiers that can leverage an estimate of the ratio of two probability
distributions even when one or both of them is unknown. We demonstrate the
behavior of generalized belief updates for various specific choices under the
$f$-divergence family. We show that for specific divergence functions such an

truthful mechanism that provides an approximation ratio of $\min(m,n)$, where
$n$ is the number of machines and $m$ is the number of jobs. They also proved
that no truthful mechanism can provide an approximation ratio better than $2$.
Since then, the lower bound was improved to $1 +\sqrt 2 \approx 2.41$ by
Christodoulou, Kotsoupias, and Vidali, and then to $1+\phi\approx 2.618$ by
Kotsoupias and Vidali. Very recently, the lower bound was improved to $2.755$

bound to $3-\delta$, for every constant $\delta>0$.
  Note that a gap between the upper bound and the lower bounds exists even when
the number of machines and jobs is very small. In particular, the known
$1+\sqrt{2}$ lower bound requires at least $3$ machines and $5$ jobs. In
contrast, we show a lower bound of $2.2055$ that uses only $3$ machines and $3$
jobs and a lower bound of $1+\sqrt 2$ that uses only $3$ machines and $4$ jobs.
For the case of two machines and two jobs we show a lower bound of $2$. Similar
bounds for two machines and two jobs were known before but only via complex
proofs that characterized all truthful mechanisms that provide a finite
approximation ratio in this setting, whereas our new proof uses a simple and

existence of more efficient classical algorithms for simulating largescale

thermoacoustics, specifically, (i) high-order spectral perturbation theory,
(ii) symmetry induced degenerate thermoacoustic modes, (iii) intrinsic
thermoacoustic modes, and (iv) exceptional points. Their connection helps gain
physical insight into the behaviour of the thermoacoustic spectrum when
parameters of the system are varied. First, we extend high-order adjoint-based
perturbation theory of thermoacoustic modes to the degenerate case. We provide
explicit formulae for the calculation of the eigenvalue corrections to any
order. These formulae are valid for self-adjoint, non-self-adjoint or even
non-normal systems; therefore, they can be applied to a large range of
problems, including fluid dynamics. Second, by analysing the expansion
coefficients of the eigenvalue corrections as a function of a parameter of
interest, we accurately estimate the radius of convergence of the power series.
Third, we connect the existence of a finite radius of convergence to the
existence of singularities in parameter space. We identify these singularities
as exceptional points, which correspond to defective thermoacoustic
eigenvalues, with infinite sensitivity to infinitesimal changes in the
parameters. At an exceptional point, two eigenvalues and their associated
eigenvectors coalesce. Close to an exceptional point, strong veering of the
eigenvalue trajectories is observed. As demonstrated in recent work,
exceptional points naturally arise in thermoacoustic systems due to the
interaction between modes of acoustic and intrinsic origin. The role of
exceptional points in thermoacoustic systems sheds new light on the physics and
sensitivity of thermoacoustic stability, which can be leveraged for passive
control by small design modifications.

good description of the spectrum, with reflection arising from gas with a
global average column density > 4 x 10^24 cm^-2 and transmission of the
continuum through an order-of-magnitude lower column. In this model, the
reflection strength is a factor ~3 higher than expected from a simple torus.
Such a result may indicate that much of the intrinsic X-ray continuum is hidden
from view. An alternative model is that of a patchy torus, where 85% of
sight-lines are obscured by Compton-thick gas and the remaining 15% by

interacting QCD-like hidden sector, at least two generations of right-handed
neutrinos and one scalar singlet. Once scalar singlet obtains a nonzero vacuum
expectation value, active neutrino masses are generated through type-I seesaw
mechanism. Simultaneously, the electroweak scale is generated through the
radiative corrections involving these massive fermions. This is the essence of
the scenario that is known as the ""neutrino option"" for which the successful
masses of right-handed neutrinos are in the range $10^7-10^8$ GeV. The main
goal of this work is to scrutinize the potential to accommodate dark matter in
such a realization. The dark matter candidates are Nambu-Goldstone bosons which
appear due to the dynamical breaking of the hidden chiral symmetry. The mass
spectrum studied in this work is such that masses of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and
singlet scalar exceed those of right-handed neutrinos. Having the masses of all
relevant particles several orders of magnitude above $\mathcal{O}$(TeV), the
freeze-out of dark matter is not achievable and hence we turn to alternative
scenarios, namely freeze-in. The Nambu-Goldstone bosons can interact with
particles that are not in SM but, however, have non-negligible abundance
through their not-too-small couplings with SM. Utilizing this, we demonstrate
that the dark matter in the model is successfully produced at temperature scale
where the right-handed neutrinos are still stable. We note that the lepton
number asymmetry sufficient for the generation of observable baryon asymmetry
of the Universe can be produced in right-handed neutrino decays. Hence, we
infer that the model has the potential to simultaneously address several of the
most relevant puzzles in contemporary high-energy physics.

Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KPII) equation modelling internal and surface gravity
waves are analysed using modulation theory. In contrast to previous studies on
obliquely interacting solitons that develop from acute incidence angles, this
work focuses on initial value problems for the obtuse incidence of two or three
partial line solitons, which propagate away from one another. Despite
counterpropagation, significant residual soliton interactions are observed with
novel physical consequences. The initial value problem for a truncated line
soliton-describing the emergence of a quasi-one-dimensional soliton from a wide
channel-is shown to be related to the interaction of oblique solitons.
Analytical descriptions for the development of weak and strong interactions are
obtained in terms of interacting simple wave solutions of modulation equations
for the local soliton amplitude and slope. In the weak interaction case, the
long-time evolution of truncated and large obtuse angle solitons exhibits a
decaying, parabolic wave profile with temporally increasing focal length that
asymptotes to a cylindrical Korteweg-de Vries soliton. In contrast, the strong
interaction case of slightly obtuse interacting solitons evolves into a steady,
one-dimensional line soliton with amplitude reduced by an amount proportional
to the incidence slope. This strong interaction is identified with the ""Mach
expansion"" of a soliton with an expansive corner, contrasting with the
well-known Mach reflection of a soliton with a compressive corner.
Interestingly, the critical angles for Mach expansion and reflection are the
same. Numerical simulations of the KPII equation quantitatively support the
analytical findings.

(LV) DC power conversion is proposed; single-phase-modules (SPMs), each
consisting of an active-front-end (AFE) stage and an isolated DC-DC stage, are
connected in input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) configuration to reach desired
voltage and power capacity. In prior art, high-speed bidirectional
communication among modules and a centralized controller is required to ensure
module-level voltage and power balancing, which severely limits the scalability
and practical realization of higher voltage and higher power systems. Moreover,
large capacitors are used to suppress double-line-frequency voltage variations
on the common MV DC bus shared by the AFE and the DC-DC stage originating from
AC power pulsations through the SPMs. We propose a comprehensive controller
which achieves voltage and power balancing using complete decentralized control
of the DC-DC stages based on only local sensor feedback and the AFE stages are
controlled using feedback of only the LV DC output. Furthermore, reduced
capacitor requirement on the MV DC bus is achieved through design and control.
The proposed method is validated through simulation and experimental results.

performed by the MURaM code. We detected three-dimensional vortices distributed
along intergranular regions and displaying coned shapes that extend from the
photosphere to the low chromosphere. Based on a well-defined vortex center and
boundary, we were able to determine averaged radial profiles and thereby
investigate the dynamics across the vortical flows at different height levels.
The solar vortex tubes present nonuniform angular rotational velocity, and, at
all height levels, there are eddy viscosity effects within the vortices, which
slow down the plasma as it moves toward the center. The vortices impact the
magnetic field as they help to intensify the magnetic field at the sinking
points, and in turn, the magnetic field ends up playing an essential role in
the vortex dynamics. The magnetic field was found to be especially important to
the vorticity evolution. On the other hand, it is shown that, in general,
kinematic vortices do not give rise to magnetic vortices unless their
tangential velocities at different height levels are high enough to overcome
the magnetic tension.

constant supply of energy to participate in the system's collective behavior.
These systems are often powered by an external energy source accessible by at
least one module and rely on module-to-module power transfer to distribute
energy throughout the system. While much effort has gone into addressing
challenging aspects of power management in programmable matter hardware,
algorithmic theory for programmable matter has largely ignored the impact of
energy usage and distribution on algorithm feasibility and efficiency. In this
work, we present an algorithm for energy distribution in the amoebot model that
is loosely inspired by the growth behavior of Bacillus subtilis bacterial
biofilms. These bacteria use chemical signaling to communicate their metabolic
states and regulate nutrient consumption throughout the biofilm, ensuring that
all bacteria receive the nutrients they need. Our algorithm similarly uses
communication to inhibit energy usage when there are starving modules, enabling
all modules to receive sufficient energy to meet their demands. As a supporting
but independent result, we extend the amoebot model's well-established spanning
forest primitive so that it self-stabilizes in the presence of crash failures.
We conclude by showing how this self-stabilizing primitive can be leveraged to
compose our energy distribution algorithm with existing amoebot model
algorithms, effectively generalizing previous work to also consider energy
constraints.

Bayesian method for structured high-dimensional ensembles that is useful for

dynamics. This is a general formulation that is motivated by the use of local
linearization in control of nonlinear dynamical systems. To state meaningful
guarantees over changing environments, we introduce the metric of {\it adaptive
regret} to the field of control. This metric, originally studied in online
learning, measures performance in terms of regret against the best policy in
hindsight on {\it any interval in time}, and thus captures the adaptation of
the controller to changing dynamics.
  Our main contribution is a novel efficient meta-algorithm: it converts a
controller with sublinear regret bounds into one with sublinear {\it adaptive
regret} bounds in the setting of time-varying linear dynamical systems. The
main technical innovation is the first adaptive regret bound for the more
general framework of online convex optimization with memory. Furthermore, we
give a lower bound showing that our attained adaptive regret bound is nearly
tight for this general framework.

In this paper, we propose a multi-level graph matching network (MGMN) framework

node-graph matching network for effectively learning cross-level interactions
between each node of one graph and the other whole graph, and a siamese graph
neural network to learn global-level interactions between two input graphs.
Furthermore, to compensate for the lack of standard benchmark datasets, we have
created and collected a set of datasets for both the graph-graph classification
and graph-graph regression tasks with different sizes in order to evaluate the
effectiveness and robustness of our models. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that MGMN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models
on both the graph-graph classification and graph-graph regression tasks.
Compared with previous work, MGMN also exhibits stronger robustness as the
sizes of the two input graphs increase.

atmosphere-stripping bow shocks. We investigate the proto-atmospheres on
low-mass planets with eccentric orbits with radiation-hydrodynamics

tabulated opacities for the gas and dust. The solutions reveal large-scale gas
recycling inside a bow shock structure. The atmospheres on eccentric planets
are typically three to four orders of magnitude less massive than those of
planets with circular orbits. Overall, however, a supersonic environment is
favorable for planets to keep an early stable atmosphere, rather than harmful,
due to the steady gas supply through the recycling flow. We also quantitatively
explore how such atmospheres are affected by the relative velocity of the
planet to the gas, the planet mass, and the background gas density. Our
time-dependent simulations track the orbital evolution of the proto-atmosphere
with the planet--disk parameters changing throughout the orbit. Atmospheric
properties show oscillatory patterns as the planet travels on an eccentric
orbit, with a lag in phase. To sum up, low-mass eccentric planets can retain
small proto-atmospheres despite the stripping effects of bow shocks. The
atmospheres are always connected to and interacting with the disk gas. These
findings provide important insights into the impacts of migration and

that the behaviour of the extinction curve might be more complex than
previously assumed, pointing towards a variation of the extinction curve as a
function of wavelength. We aim at analysing the variations of the extinction
index, $\alpha$, with wavelength, line-of-sight, and absolute extinction,
extending previous analysis to a larger area of the innermost regions of the

unprecedented detail. It covers a region of $\sim 6000$\,pc$^2$, comprising
fields in the nuclear stellar disc, the inner bulge, and the transition region
between them. We applied two independent methods based on red clump (RC) stars
to constrain the extinction curve and analysed its variation superseding
previous studies. We used more than 165,000 RC stars and increased
significantly the size of the regions analysed to confirm that the extinction
curve varies with the wavelength. We estimated a difference $\Delta\alpha =
0.21\pm0.07$ between the obtained extinction indices, $\alpha_{JH}=2.44\pm0.05$
and $\alpha_{HK_s} = 2.23\pm0.05$. We also concluded that there is no

distribution functions of near Earth measurements, we find a small but
significant population of He$^+$ ions in the normal solar wind whose properties
indicate that it originated from the Sun and has evolved as part of the normal

observed, we investigate recombination of solar He$^{2+}$ through charge
exchange with neutrals from circumsolar dust as a possible formation mechanism
of solar He$^{+}$. We present an empirical profile of neutrals necessary for
charge exchange to become an effective vehicle to recombine He$^{2+}$ to
He$^{+}$ such that it meets observational He$^{+}$ values. We find the
formation of He$^{+}$ is not only sensitive to the density of neutrals but also
to the inner boundary of the neutral distribution encountered along the solar

that the interaction between solar $\alpha$ particles and dust neutrals is the

develop a theory of the intra-axonal diffusion MRI signal based on
coarse-graining of the axonal shape by 3d diffusion. We demonstrate how the
estimate of the inner diameter is confounded by the diameter variations
(beading), and by the local variations in direction (undulations) along the
axon. We analytically relate diffusion MRI metrics, such as time-dependent
radial diffusivity D(t) and kurtosis K(t), to the axonal shape, and validate
our theory using Monte Carlo simulations in synthetic undulating axons with
randomly positioned beads, and in realistic axons reconstructed from electron
microscopy images of mouse brain white matter. We show that (i) In the narrow
pulse limit, the inner diameter from D(t) is overestimated by about twofold due
to a combination of axon caliber variations and undulations (each contributing
a comparable effect size); (ii) The narrow-pulse kurtosis K$_{t\to\infty}$
deviates from that in an ideal cylinder due to caliber variations; we also
numerically calculate the fourth-order cumulant for an ideal cylinder in the
wide pulse limit, which is relevant for inner diameter overestimation; (iii) In
the wide pulse limit, the axon diameter overestimation is mainly due to
undulations at low diffusion weightings b; and (iv) The effect of undulations
can be considerably reduced by directional averaging of high-b signals, with
the apparent inner diameter given by a combination of the axon caliber
(dominated by the thickest axons), caliber variations, and the residual

differential equations with a fixed domain by using logarithm transformation
and taking additional derivatives. With the addition of an intermediate
function with a fixed free boundary, a quadratic formula is derived to compute
the velocity of the optimal exercise boundary analytically. Furthermore, we
implement an extrapolation method to ensure that at least, a third-order
accuracy in space is maintained at the boundary point when computing the
optimal exercise boundary from its derivative. As such, it enables us to employ
fourth-order spatial and temporal discretization with Dirichlet boundary
conditions for obtaining the numerical solution of the asset option, option

that can be used to predict upper limits of the GOES-class magnitude of solar
flares. The flare prediction scheme is based on the scaling of the
slowly-varying potential energy $E_p(t)$, which is extrapolated in time over an
interval of $\Delta t \le$ 24 hrs. The observed scaling of the dissipated
energy $E_{diss}$ scales with the potential field energy as $E_{diss} \propto
E_p^{1.32}$. In addition, the observed scaling relationship of the flare
volume, $V \propto E_{diss}^{1.17}$, the multi-thermal energy, $E_{th} \propto
V^{0.76}$, the flare emission measure $EM \propto E_{th}^{0.79}$, the
EM-weighted temperature $T_{w}$, and the GOES flux, $F_8(t) \propto
E_p(t)^{0.92}$, allows us then to predict an upper limit of the GOES-class
flare magnitude in the extrapolated time window. We find a good correlation
(CCC$\approx 0.7$) between the observed and predicted GOES-class flare
magnitudes (in 172 X and M-class events). This is the first algorithm that
employs observed scaling laws of physical flare parameters to predict GOES flux
upper limits, an important capability that complements previous flare
prediction methods based on machine-learning algorithms used in space weather
forecasting.

for near-term quantum computers. Its success largely relies on the chosen
variational ansatz, corresponding to a quantum circuit that prepares an
approximate ground state of a Hamiltonian. Typically, it either aims to achieve
high representation accuracy (at the expense of circuit depth), or uses a
shallow circuit sacrificing the convergence to the exact ground state energy.
Here, we propose the approach which can combine both low depth and improved
precision, capitalizing on a genetically-improved ansatz for hardware-efficient
VQE. Our solution, the multiobjective genetic variational quantum eigensolver
(MoG-VQE), relies on multiobjective Pareto optimization, where topology of the
variational ansatz is optimized using the non-dominated sorting genetic
algorithm (NSGA-II). For each circuit topology, we optimize angles of
single-qubit rotations using covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES) -- a derivative-free approach known to perform well for noisy
black-box optimization. Our protocol allows preparing circuits that
simultaneously offer high performance in terms of obtained energy precision and
the number of two-qubit gates, thus trying to reach Pareto-optimal solutions.
Tested for various molecules (H$_2$, H$_4$, H$_6$, BeH$_2$, LiH), we observe
nearly ten-fold reduction in the two-qubit gate counts as compared to the
standard hardware-efficient ansatz. For 12-qubit LiH Hamiltonian this allows
reaching chemical precision already at 12 CNOTs. Consequently, the algorithm
shall lead to significant growth of the ground state fidelity for near-term
devices.

transverse-to-radial force ratio map (ratio map, hereafter) in a different
manner from previous studies. When we display the ratio map in polar
coordinates, barred galaxies appear as four aligned, horizontal thick slabs.
This characteristic feature enables us to successfully classify barred and
nonbarred galaxies with an accuracy of 87%. It yields the bar fraction of 53%,
including both SBs and SABs, when applied to 884 nearby (z < 0.01) spiral
galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey/DR7. It also provides the bar
strength and length measurements, in particular, separated from the spiral
arms. They show good correlations with the measures estimated from ellipse
fitting and Fourier analysis. However, we find different tendencies of the bar
strength measurements in terms of the Hubble sequence: as the Hubble sequence
increases (towards late-type), the bar strength and bar ellipticity increase,
whereas the dipole Fourier amplitude decreases. We show that the bulge affects
the estimation of the bar strength differently, depending on the classification
methods. The bulge causes the bar length to be overestimated in all three

profiles of the angle-averaged force ratio: one has a maximum peak (type M) and
the other a plateau (type P). Comparison with numerical simulations suggests
that type M bars are more mature than type P bars in terms of evolutionary

popularity due to a combination of factors: computational advances making their

DE solvers suffer from a fundamental limitation: they are trained using loss
functions that depend only implicitly on the error associated with the
estimate. As such, validation and error analysis of solution estimates requires
knowledge of the true solution. Indeed, if the true solution is unknown, we are
often reduced to simply hoping that a ""low enough"" loss implies ""small enough""
errors, since explicit relationships between the two are not available/well
defined. In this work, we describe a general strategy for efficiently
constructing error estimates and corrections for Neural Network Differential

directly allow us to estimate and correct for the errors.

we systematically investigate the effect of 56Ni mixing on the photospheric
velocity evolution in stripped-envelope supernovae. We show that 56Ni mixing
significantly affects the early photospheric velocity evolution. The
photospheric velocity, which is often used to constrain the ejecta mass and
explosion energy, significantly varies by just changing the degree of 56Ni
mixing. In addition, the models with a small degree of 56Ni mixing show a
flattening in the early photospheric velocity evolution, while the fully mixed
models show a monotonic decrease. The velocity flattening appears in both
helium and carbon+oxygen progenitor explosions with a variety of ejecta mass,
explosion energy, and 56Ni mass. Some stripped-envelope supernovae with early
photospheric velocity information do show such a flattening. We find that Type
Ib SN 2007Y, which has early photospheric velocity information, has a signature
of a moderate degree of 56Ni mixing in the photospheric velocity evolution and
about a half of the ejecta is mixed in it. The immediate spectroscopic
follow-up observations of stripped-envelope supernovae shortly after the
explosion providing the early photospheric evolution give an important clue to
constrain 56Ni mixing in the ejecta.

in deep neural networks (DNNs) are well-studied, less is known about how these
trade-offs apply to representations of semantically-meaningful information.
Class selectivity, the variability of a unit's responses across data classes or
dimensions, is one way of quantifying the sparsity of semantic representations.
Given recent evidence showing that class selectivity can impair generalization,
we sought to investigate whether it also confers robustness (or vulnerability)
to perturbations of input data. We found that mean class selectivity predicts
vulnerability to naturalistic corruptions; networks regularized to have lower
levels of class selectivity are more robust to corruption, while networks with
higher class selectivity are more vulnerable to corruption, as measured using
Tiny ImageNetC and CIFAR10C. In contrast, we found that class selectivity
increases robustness to multiple types of gradient-based adversarial attacks.
To examine this difference, we studied the dimensionality of the change in the
representation due to perturbation, finding that decreasing class selectivity
increases the dimensionality of this change for both corruption types, but with
a notably larger increase for adversarial attacks. These results demonstrate
the causal relationship between selectivity and robustness and provide new
insights into the mechanisms of this relationship.

While Gaia enables to probe in great detail the extended local
neighbourhood, the thin disk structure at larger distances remains sparsely
explored.
  Aims. We aim here to build a non-parametric 3D model of the thin disc
structures handling both the extinction and the stellar density simultaneously.
  Methods. We developed a Bayesian deconvolution method in two dimensions:
extinction and distance. It uses a reference catalogue which completeness
information defines the selection function. It is designed so that any
complementary information from other catalogues can be added. It has also been
designed to be robust to outliers, frequent in crowded fields, and differential
extinction. The prior information is designed to be minimal: only a reference
H-R diagram. We derived for this an empirical H-R diagram of the thin disk
using Gaia DR2 data and synthetic isochrone-based H-R diagrams can also be
used.
  Results. We validated the method on simulations and real fields using 2MASS
and UKIDSS data complemented by Gaia DR2 photometry and parallaxes. We detail
the results of two test fields: a 2MASS field centred around the NGC 4815 open
cluster which shows an over-density of both extinction and stellar density at
the cluster distance, and a UKIDSS field at $l=10^{\circ}$ where we recover the
position of the Galactic bar.

train the machine learning models for efficient monitoring and recognition of

activities in a dataset, i.e., having missing samples in dataset captures.
Therefore, in this work, we propose a methodology for extrapolating the missing
samples of a dataset to better recognize the human daily living activities. The
proposed method efficiently pre-processes the data captures and utilizes the
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation technique to extrapolate the missing

example. We consider that we have a set of `one-class classification'
objective-tasks with only a small set of positive examples available for each
task, and a set of training tasks with full supervision (i.e. highly imbalanced
classification). We propose an approach using order-equivariant networks to
learn a 'meta' binary-classifier. The model will take as input an example to
classify from a given task, as well as the corresponding supervised set of
positive examples for this OCC task. Thus, the output of the model will be
'conditioned' on the available positive example of a given task, allowing to
predict on new tasks and new examples without labeled negative examples. In
this paper, we are motivated by an astronomy application. Our goal is to
identify if stars belong to a specific stellar group (the 'one-class' for a
given task), called \textit{stellar streams}, where each stellar stream is a
different OCC-task. We show that our method transfers well on unseen (test)
synthetic streams, and outperforms the baselines even though it is not
retrained and accesses a much smaller part of the data per task to predict
(only positive supervision). We see however that it doesn't transfer as well on
the real stream GD-1. This could come from intrinsic differences from the
synthetic and real stream, highlighting the need for consistency in the
'nature' of the task for this method. However, light fine-tuning improve
performances and outperform our baselines. Our experiments show encouraging
results to further explore meta-learning methods for OCC tasks.

model during animation. Our CGA algorithm also provides easy interpolation and
application of all deformations in each intermediate steps, all within the same
geometric framework. Furthermore we also present two novel algorithms that
enable cutting and tearing of the input rigged, animated model, while the

$(8.9^{+0.2}_{-0.4}) \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the temperature at the
inner-disk radius ($kT_{\rm in}$) was $1.12\pm0.04$ keV. At the last detection

reproduced with the standard model of a constant inner radius but is better

equations based on a variable transformation of the moment approximation.
Classical minimum-entropy moment closures are a class of reduced models for
kinetic equations that conserve many of the fundamental physical properties of
solutions. However, their practical use is limited by their high computational
cost, as an optimization problem has to be solved for every cell in the
space-time grid. In addition, implementation of numerical solvers for these
models is hampered by the fact that the optimization problems are only
well-defined if the moment vectors stay within the realizable set. For the same
reason, further reducing these models by, e.g., reduced-basis methods is not a
simple task. Our new method overcomes these disadvantages of classical
approaches. The transformation is performed on the semi-discretized level which
makes them applicable to a wide range of kinetic schemes and replaces the
nonlinear optimization problems by inversion of the positive-definite Hessian
matrix. As a result, the new scheme gets rid of the realizability-related
problems. Moreover, a discrete entropy law can be enforced by modifying the
time stepping scheme. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our new method
is often several times faster than the standard optimization-based scheme.

But consistency requires the assumption that the component likelihoods are
perfectly specified, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we add
rigor to data-analysis folk wisdom by proving that under even the slightest

posterior probability of any particular finite number of components converges
to 0 in the limit of infinite data. Contrary to intuition, posterior-density
consistency is not sufficient to establish this result. We develop novel

have more general growth and continuity in $y$ in the local solution; while in
the global solution, the generator $g(t,y,z)$ can have a skew sub-quadratic but
in addition ""strictly and diagonally"" quadratic growth in the second unknown

$g(t,y,z)$ is ""diagonally dependent"" on the second unknown variable $z$ (i.e.,

an existence and uniqueness result is given under the assumptions that the

  - A new definition of fairness called ""controlled fairness"" with respect to
choices of protected features and filters. The definition provides a simple
test of fairness of an algorithm with respect to a dataset. This notion of
fairness is suitable in cases where fairness is prioritized over accuracy, such
as in cases where there is no ""ground truth"" data, only data labeled with past
decisions (which may have been biased).
  - Algorithms for retraining a given classifier to achieve ""controlled
fairness"" with respect to a choice of features and filters. Two algorithms are
presented, implemented and tested. These algorithms require training two
different models in two stages. We experiment with combinations of various
types of models for the first and second stage and report on which combinations
perform best in terms of fairness and accuracy.
  - Algorithms for adjusting model parameters to achieve a notion of fairness
called ""classification parity"". This notion of fairness is suitable in cases
where accuracy is prioritized. Two algorithms are presented, one which assumes
that protected features are accessible to the model during testing, and one
which assumes protected features are not accessible during testing.
  We evaluate our tools on three different publicly available datasets. We find
that the tools are useful for understanding various dimensions of bias, and
that in practice the algorithms are effective in starkly reducing a given
observed bias when tested on new data.

of a multi-energy (ME) X-ray transform. The energy-dependent X-ray attenuation
profiles can be represented by a set of coefficients using the Alvarez-Macovski
(AM) method. An ME X-ray transform is a mapping from $N$ AM coefficients to $N$
noise-free energy-weighted measurements, where $N\geq2$.
  Methods: We apply a general invertibility theorem which tests whether the
Jacobian of the mapping $J(\mathbf A)$ has zero values over the support of the
mapping. The Jacobian of an arbitrary ME X-ray transform is an integration over
all spectral measurements. A sufficient condition of $J(\mathbf A)\neq0$ for
all $\mathbf A$ is that the integrand of $J(\mathbf A)$ is $\geq0$ (or $\leq0$)
everywhere. Note that the trivial case of the integrand equals to zero
everywhere is ignored. With symmetry, we simplified the integrand of the
Jacobian into three factors that are determined by the total attenuation, the
basis functions, and the energy-weighting functions, respectively. The factor
related to total attenuation is always positive, hence the invertibility of the
X-ray transform can be determined by testing the signs of the other two
factors. Furthermore, we use the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize
the noise-induced estimation uncertainty and provide a maximum-likelihood (ML)
estimator.
  Conclusions: We have provided a framework to study the invertibility of an
arbitrary ME X-ray transform and proved the global invertibility for four types
of systems.

however the challenges associated with their observation mean their formation
mechanisms are still poorly understood. To address this, we present deep
integral field observations of a sample of 31 low-mass ($10^{7.5} <$ M$_\star <
10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$) early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster with the SAMI
instrument. For 21 galaxies our observations are sufficiently deep to construct
spatially resolved maps of the stellar velocity and velocity dispersion - for
the remaining galaxies we extract global velocities and dispersions from
aperture spectra only. From the kinematic maps we measure the specific stellar
angular momentum $\lambda_R$ of the lowest mass dE galaxies to date. Combining
our observations with early-type galaxy data from the literature spanning a
large range in stellar mass, we find that $\lambda_R$ decreases towards lower
stellar mass, with a corresponding increase in the proportion of slowly
rotating galaxies in this regime. The decrease of $\lambda_R$ with mass in our
sample dE galaxies is consistent with a similar trend seen in somewhat more
massive spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey. This suggests that the degree
of dynamical heating required to produce dEs from low-mass starforming
progenitors may be relatively modest, and consistent with a broad range of
formation mechanisms.

gross confinement properties in devices built to contain hot plasmas. In most
practical applications, evaluating a Poincar\'e map requires numerical
integration of a magnetic field line, a process that can be slow and that
cannot be easily accelerated using parallel computations. We show that a novel
neural network architecture, the H\'enonNet, is capable of accurately learning
realistic Poincar\'e maps from observations of a conventional
field-line-following algorithm. After training, such learned Poincar\'e maps
evaluate much faster than the field-line integration method. Moreover, the
H\'enonNet architecture exactly reproduces the primary physics constraint
imposed on field-line Poincar\'e maps: flux preservation. This
structure-preserving property is the consequence of each layer in a H\'enonNet
being a symplectic map. We demonstrate empirically that a H\'enonNet can learn
to mock the confinement properties of a large magnetic island by using coiled
hyperbolic invariant manifolds to produce a sticky chaotic region at the
desired island location. This suggests a novel approach to designing magnetic
fields with good confinement properties that may be more flexible than ensuring
confinement using KAM tori.

e.g., activity at rest. The resting-state associates the underlying brain
dynamics of healthy subjects that are not actively compromised with sensory or

door to understand the general principles of brain functioning. We hypothesize
about how could be the spatio-temporal dynamics of cortical fluctuations for
healthy subjects at resting-state. We retrieve the alphabet that reconstructs

an emergent phenomenon of each band. Interestingly, we find that the posterior

collecting, transmitting and storing tremendous trajectory data. However, such
an unprecedented scale of GPS data has posed an urgent demand for not only an

simplification in online mode, searving as a mainstream trajectory compression
method, plays an important role to attack this issue. But for the existing
algorithms, either their time cost is extremely high, or the accuracy loss
after the compression is completely unacceptable. To attack this issue, we
propose $\epsilon \_$Region based Online trajectory Compression with Error
bounded (ROCE for short), which makes the best balance among the accuracy loss,
the time cost and the compression rate. The range query serves as a primitive,
yet quite essential operation on analyzing trajectories. Each trajectory is
usually seen as a sequence of discrete points, and in most previous work, a
trajectory is judged to be overlapped with the query region R iff there is at
least one point in this trajectory falling in R. But this traditional criteria
is not suitable when the queried trajectories are compressed, because there may
be hundreds of points discarded between each two adjacent points and the points
in each compressed trajectory are quite sparse. And many trajectories could be
missing in the result set. To address this, in this paper, a new criteria based
on the probability and an efficient Range Query processing algorithm on
Compressed trajectories RQC are proposed. In addition, an efficient index
\emph{ASP\_tree} and lots of novel techniques are also presented to accelerate
the processing of trajectory compression and range queries obviously. Extensive
experiments have been done on multiple real datasets, and the results

is a crucial step towards full instrument pose estimation and it is used for
integration of pre- and intra-operative images into the endoscopic view. While
many recent approaches based on convolutional neural networks have shown great
results, a key barrier to progress lies in the acquisition of a large number of
manually-annotated images which is necessary for an algorithm to generalize and
work well in diverse surgical scenarios. Unlike the surgical image data itself,
annotations are difficult to acquire and may be of variable quality. On the
other hand, synthetic annotations can be automatically generated by using
forward kinematic model of the robot and CAD models of tools by projecting them
onto an image plane. Unfortunately, this model is very inaccurate and cannot be
used for supervised learning of image segmentation models. Since generated
annotations will not directly correspond to endoscopic images due to errors, we
formulate the problem as an unpaired image-to-image translation where the goal
is to learn the mapping between an input endoscopic image and a corresponding
annotation using an adversarial model. Our approach allows to train image
segmentation models without the need to acquire expensive annotations and can
potentially exploit large unlabeled endoscopic image collection outside the
annotated distributions of image/annotation data. We test our proposed method

set of $G$, i.e., bonds are cut-sets that determine cuts $[S,V\setminus S]$ of
$G$ such that $G[S]$ and $G[V\setminus S]$ are both connected. Contrasting with
a large number of studies related to maximum cuts, there exist very few results
regarding the largest bond of general graphs. In this paper, we aim to reduce
this gap on the complexity of computing the largest bond, and the maximum
connected cut of a graph. Although cuts and bonds are similar, we remark that
computing the largest bond and the maximum connected cut of a graph tends to be
harder than computing its maximum cut. We show that it does not exist a
constant-factor approximation algorithm to compute the largest bond, unless P =
NP. Also, we show that {\sc Largest Bond} and {\sc Maximum Connected Cut} are
NP-hard even for planar bipartite graphs, whereas \textsc{Maximum Cut} is
trivial on bipartite graphs and polynomial-time solvable on planar graphs. In
addition, we show that {\sc Largest Bond} and {\sc Maximum Connected Cut} are
NP-hard on split graphs, and restricted to graphs of clique-width $w$ they can
not be solved in time $f(w)\times n^{o(w)}$ unless the Exponential Time
Hypothesis fails, but they can be solved in time $f(w)\times n^{O(w)}$.
Finally, we show that both problems are fixed-parameter tractable when
parameterized by the size of the solution, the treewidth, and the twin-cover
number.

generate electricity to supply itself and to trade the surplus on energy
markets. To minimize the overall cost, a microgrid must determine how to
schedule its energy resources and electrical loads and how to trade with
others. The control decisions are influenced by various factors, such as energy
storage, renewable energy yield, electrical load, and competition from other
microgrids. Making the optimal control decision is challenging, due to the
complexity of the interconnected microgrids, the uncertainty of renewable
energy generation and consumption, and the interplay among microgrids. The
previous works mainly adopted the modeling-based approaches for deriving the
control decision, yet they relied on the precise information of future system
dynamics, which can be hard to obtain in a complex environment. This work
provides a new perspective of obtaining the optimal control policy for
distributed energy trading and scheduling by directly interacting with the
environment, and proposes a multiagent deep reinforcement learning approach for
learning the optimal control policy. Each microgrid is modeled as an agent, and
different agents learn collaboratively for maximizing their rewards. The agent
of each microgrid can make the local scheduling decision without knowing
others' information, which can well maintain the autonomy of each microgrid. We
evaluate the performances of our proposed method using real-world datasets. The
experimental results show that our method can significantly reduce the cost of

galaxies, galaxy groups and clusters. However, the energy content of AGN jets
that mediate this feedback process is still far from clear. Here we present a
preliminary study of radial elongations $\tau$ of a large sample of X-ray
cavities, which are apparently produced by mechanical AGN feedback. All the
cavities in our sample are elongated along the angular (type-I) or jet
directions (type-II), or nearly circular (type-III). The observed value of
$\tau$ roughly decreases as the cavities rise buoyantly, confirming the same
trend found in hydrodynamic simulations. For young cavities, both type-I and II
cavities exist, and the latter dominates. Assuming a spheroidal cavity shape,
we derive an analytical relation between the intrinsic radial elongation
$\bar{\tau}$ and the inclination-angle-dependent value of $\tau$, showing that
projection effect makes cavities appear more circular, but does not change
type-I cavities into type-II ones, or vice versa. We summarize radial
elongations of young cavities in simulations, finding that $\bar{\tau}$
increases with the kinetic fraction of AGN jets. While mild jets always produce
type-II cavities, thermal-energy-dominated strong jets produce type-I cavities,
and kinetic-energy-dominated strong jets produce type-II cavities. Our results
suggest that some AGN jets are strong and dominated by thermal energy (or
cosmic rays). However, these jets do not dominate in AGN feedback. If most jets
are dominated by non-kinetic energies, they should be mainly mild jets. If most
jets are strong, they must be mainly dominated by the kinetic energy.

advantages, such as streamlined procedures for chemical analysis, enhanced
chemical reaction efficiency and high specificity of conversion. In this work,
we experimentally and theoretically investigate the rate for biphasic chemical
reactions between acidic nanodroplets on a substrate surface and basic
reactants in a surrounding bulk flow. The reaction rate is measured by droplet
shrinkage as the product is removed from the droplets by the flow. In our
experiments, we determine the dependence of the reaction rate on the flow rate
and the solution concentration. The theoretical analysis predicts that the life
time $\tau$ of the droplets scales with Peclet number $Pe$ and the reactant
concentration in the bulk flow $c_{re,bulk}$ as $\tau\propto
Pe^{-3/2}c_{re,bulk}^{-1}$, in good agreement with our experimental results.
Furthermore, we found that the product from the reaction on an upstream surface
can postpone the droplet reaction on a downstream surface, possibly due to the
adsorption of interface-active products on the droplets in the downstream. The
time of the delay decreases with increasing $Pe$ of the flow and also with
increasing reactant concentration in the flow, following the scaling same as
that of the reaction rate with these two parameters. Our findings provide
insight for the ultimate aim to enhance droplet reactions under flow
conditions.

real-time, automatic product question answering (PQA). In the literature, PQA
is formulated as a retrieval problem with the goal to search for the most
relevant reviews to answer a given product question. In this paper, we focus on
the issue of answerability and answer reliability for PQA using reviews. Our
investigation is based on the intuition that many questions may not be
answerable with a finite set of reviews. When a question is not answerable, a
system should return nil answers rather than providing a list of irrelevant
reviews, which can have significant negative impact on user experience.
Moreover, for answerable questions, only the most relevant reviews that answer
the question should be included in the result. We propose a conformal
prediction based framework to improve the reliability of PQA systems, where we
reject unreliable answers so that the returned results are more concise and
accurate at answering the product question, including returning nil answers for
unanswerable questions. Experiments on a widely used Amazon dataset show
encouraging results of our proposed framework. More broadly, our results
demonstrate a novel and effective application of conformal methods to a

approximation power of physics informed neural networks (PINN), and the
computational efficiency of the pseudo-spectral methods, which we named
pseudo-spectral PINN or SPINN. Unlike the baseline PINN, the pseudo-spectral
PINN has several advantages. First of all, it requires less training data. A
minimum of two snapshots with uniform spatial resolution would be adequate.
Secondly, it is computationally efficient, as the pseudo-spectral method is
used for spatial discretization. Thirdly, it requires less trainable parameters
compared with the baseline PINN. Thus, it significantly simplifies the training
process and assures less local minima or saddle points. We illustrate the
effectiveness of pseudo-spectral PINN through several numerical examples. The
newly proposed pseudo-spectral PINN is rather general, and it can be readily
applied to discover other PDE-based models from image data.

Unfortunately these same state-of-the-art approaches perform poorly when

particularly concerning since point clouds generated by 3D sensors in the real

wherein the latent feature encoding a complete point clouds is inferred by
applying a local point set voting strategy. In particular, each local point set
constructs a vote that corresponds to a distribution in the latent space, and
the optimal latent feature is the one with the highest probability. This

scenes but also the directions of all incoming light rays. The spatial and
angular information implicitly contain geometrical characteristics such as
multi-view or epipolar geometry, which can be exploited to improve the
performance of depth estimation. An Epipolar Plane Image (EPI), the unique 2D
spatial-angular slice of the light field, contains patterns of oriented lines.
The slope of these lines is associated with the disparity. Benefiting from this
property of EPIs, some representative methods estimate depth maps by analyzing
the disparity of each line in EPIs. However, these methods often extract the
optimal slope of the lines from EPIs while ignoring the relationship between
neighboring pixels, which leads to inaccurate depth map predictions. Based on
the observation that an oriented line and its neighboring pixels in an EPI
share a similar linear structure, we propose an end-to-end fully convolutional
network (FCN) to estimate the depth value of the intersection point on the
horizontal and vertical EPIs. Specifically, we present a new feature-extraction
module, called Oriented Relation Module (ORM), that constructs the relationship
between the line orientations. To facilitate training, we also propose a
refocusing-based data augmentation method to obtain different slopes from EPIs
of the same scene point. Extensive experiments verify the efficacy of learning
relations and show that our approach is competitive to other state-of-the-art

which emerges between the non-synchronized state and partially synchronized

exponents, and we focus on the critical exponent defined by coupling strength
dependence of the order parameter for revealing universality classes. In a
typical interaction represented by the perfect graph, an infinite number of
universality classes is yielded by dependency on the natural frequency

also observed in a model on a small-world network, whose number of links is
proportional to the number of oscillators, a natural question is whether the

the heat transfer is sharply suppressed by electrostatic doping. This allows
for tuning of the heat exchange by a small applied voltage between the two

a more realistic framework based on the cellular Potts model which captures
cell shape changes and cluster rearrangement. In both cases, we find that cells
have an optimal adhesion strength that maximizes cluster migration speed. The
optimum negotiates a tradeoff between maintaining cell-cell contact and

that exerts significant influence on the performance of the workloads, and how
to manage LLC is a key to the performance isolation and QoS in the cloud with
multi-tenancy. In this paper, we argue that besides CPU cores, high-speed
network I/O is also important for LLC management. This is because of an Intel
architectural innovation -- Data Direct I/O (DDIO) -- that directly injects the
inbound I/O traffic to (part of) the LLC instead of the main memory. We
summarize two problems caused by DDIO and show that (1) the default DDIO
configuration may not always achieve optimal performance, (2) DDIO can decrease
the performance of non-I/O workloads which share LLC with it by as high as 32%.
  We then present IOCA, the first LLC management mechanism for network-centric
platforms that treats the I/O as the first-class citizen. IOCA monitors and
analyzes the performance of the cores, LLC, and DDIO using CPU's hardware
performance counters, and adaptively adjusts the number of LLC ways for DDIO or
the tenants that demand more LLC capacity. In addition, IOCA dynamically
chooses the tenants that share its LLC resource with DDIO, to minimize the
performance interference by both the tenants and the I/O. Our experiments with
multiple microbenchmarks and real-world applications in two major end-host

naturally captures the phase transitions of the epidemic growth rate via
change-points and further enjoys great interpretability due to its
semiparametric nature. On the methodological front, we advance the nascent
self-normalization (SN) technique (Shao, 2010) to testing and estimation of a
single change-point in the linear trend of a nonstationary time series. We
further combine the SN-based change-point test with the NOT algorithm
(Baranowski et al., 2019) to achieve multiple change-point estimation. Using
the proposed method, we analyze the trajectory of the cumulative COVID-19 cases
and deaths for 30 major countries and discover interesting patterns with
potentially relevant implications for effectiveness of the pandemic responses
by different countries. Furthermore, based on the change-point detection
algorithm and a flexible extrapolation function, we design a simple two-stage
forecasting scheme for COVID-19 and demonstrate its promising performance in
predicting cumulative deaths in the U.S.

numerous attentions, which can be divided into horizontal movement generator

for powering the integrated and miniaturized energy chip as the current output
direction is depending on the moving direction of the water droplet, which
means a sustainable and continuous direct-current (DC) electricity output can
be hardly achieved because of the film of limited length. On the other hand,
the existing vertical movement generators include triboelectricity or humidity
gradient-based liquid electricity generator, where the liquid or water resource
must be sustainably supplied to ensure continuous current output. Herein, we
have designed an integratable vertical generator by sandwiching water droplets
with semiconductor and metal, such as graphene or aluminum. This generator,
named as polarized liquid molecular generator (PLMG), directly converts the
lateral kinetic energy of water droplet into vertical DC electricity with an
output voltage of up to ~1.0 V from the dynamic water-semiconductor interface.
The fundamental discovery of PLMG is related to the non-symmetric structure of
liquid molecules, such as water and alcohols, which can be polarized under the
guidance of built-in field caused by the Fermi level difference between metal
and semiconductor, while the symmetric liquid molecules cannot produce any
electricity on the opposite. Integratable PLMG with a large output power of ~90
nW and voltage of ~2.7 V has been demonstrated, meanwhile its small internal
resistance of ~250 kilohm takes a huge advantage in resistance matching with
the impedance of electron components. The PLMG shows potential application
value in the Internet of Things (IoTs) after proper miniaturization and

This paper first proposes a novel pre-processing technique that facilitates the
detection of such modified images under any DNN-based image classifier as well
as the attacker model. The proposed pre-processing algorithm involves a certain
combination of principal component analysis (PCA)-based decomposition of the
image, and random perturbation based detection to reduce computational
complexity. Next, an adaptive version of this algorithm is proposed where a
random number of perturbations are chosen adaptively using a doubly-threshold
policy, and the threshold values are learnt via stochastic approximation in
order to minimize the expected number of perturbations subject to constraints
on the false alarm and missed detection probabilities. Numerical experiments
show that the proposed detection scheme outperforms a competing algorithm while
achieving reasonably low computational complexity.

bidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in
second-price auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value
truthfully and hard to know the others' bidding behaviors? In this paper, we
take an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem of learning
to bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private
valuations and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first
minimax optimal online bidding algorithm that achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz
bidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding
strategies. This novel algorithm is built on the insight that the presence of a
good expert can be leveraged to improve performance, as well as an original
hierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent
interest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that
exists in the problem, we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form
statistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to a computationally
efficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally,
through an impossibility result, we highlight that one is unlikely to compete
this favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz bidding
policies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price
auction datasets obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's
superior performance compared to several existing bidding algorithms.

common and necessary technique to make a back-up of their program states and
other necessary data in a non-volatile memory (NVM) before going to sleep or
low power mode. However, this memory is often left unprotected as adding robust
security measures tends to be expensive for these resource constrained systems.
In this paper, we propose a lightweight security system for NVM during low
power mode. This security architecture uses the memristor, an emerging
nanoscale device which is used to build hardware security primitives like PUF
(physical unclonable function) based encryption-decryption, true random number
generators (TRNG), and memory integrity checking. A reliability enhancement
technique for this PUF is also proposed which shows how this system would work
even with less-than-100\% reliable PUF responses. Together, with all these
techniques, we have established a dual layer security protocol (data
encryption+integrity check) which provides reasonable security to an embedded
processor while being very lightweight in terms of area, power, and computation
time. A complete system design is demonstrated with 65$n$m CMOS and emerging
memristive technology. With this, we have provided a detailed and accurate
estimation of resource overhead. Analysis of the security of the whole system

to as \textit{D2D-aided F-RAN}, takes advantage of caching at enhanced remote

D2D-aided F-RAN, we develop a framework that exploits the cached contents at
eRRHs, their transmission rates/powers, and previously received contents by
different users to deliver the requesting contents to users with a minimum
completion time. Given the intractability of the completion time minimization
problem, we formulate it at each transmission by approximating the completion
time and decoupling it into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, we
minimize the possible completion time in eRRH downlink transmissions, while in
the second subproblem, we maximize the number of users to be scheduled on D2D
links. We design two theoretical graphs, namely \textit{interference-aware
instantly decodable network coding (IA-IDNC)} and \textit{D2D conflict} graphs
to reformulate two subproblems as maximum weight clique and maximum independent
set problems, respectively. Using these graphs, we heuristically develop joint
and coordinated scheduling approaches. Through extensive simulation results, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes against existing baseline
schemes. Simulation results show that the proposed two approaches achieve a
considerable performance gain in terms of the completion time minimization.

  Spatiotemporal Context Model",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past two decades, traditional block-based video coding has made
remarkable progress and spawned a series of well-known standards such as
MPEG-4, H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC. On the other hand, deep neural networks
(DNNs) have shown their powerful capacity for visual content understanding,
feature extraction and compact representation. Some previous works have
explored the learnt video coding algorithms in an end-to-end manner, which show
the great potential compared with traditional methods. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end deep neural video coding framework (NVC), which uses
variational autoencoders (VAEs) with joint spatial and temporal prior
aggregation (PA) to exploit the correlations in intra-frame pixels, inter-frame
motions and inter-frame compensation residuals, respectively. Novel features of
NVC include: 1) To estimate and compensate motion over a large range of
magnitudes, we propose an unsupervised multiscale motion compensation network
(MS-MCN) together with a pyramid decoder in the VAE for coding motion features
that generates multiscale flow fields, 2) we design a novel adaptive
spatiotemporal context model for efficient entropy coding for motion
information, 3) we adopt nonlocal attention modules (NLAM) at the bottlenecks
of the VAEs for implicit adaptive feature extraction and activation, leveraging
its high transformation capacity and unequal weighting with joint global and
local information, and 4) we introduce multi-module optimization and a
multi-frame training strategy to minimize the temporal error propagation among
P-frames. NVC is evaluated for the low-delay causal settings and compared with
H.265/HEVC, H.264/AVC and the other learnt video compression methods following
the common test conditions, demonstrating consistent gains across all popular
test sequences for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.

  Learning Algorithms",,,,,"cs.AI q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although deep RL models have shown a great potential for solving various
types of tasks with minimal supervision, several key challenges remain in terms
of learning from limited experience, adapting to environmental changes, and
generalizing learning from a single task. Recent evidence in decision
neuroscience has shown that the human brain has an innate capacity to resolve
these issues, leading to optimism regarding the development of
neuroscience-inspired solutions toward sample-efficient, and generalizable RL
algorithms. We show that the computational model combining model-based and
model-free control, which we term the prefrontal RL, reliably encodes the
information of high-level policy that humans learned, and this model can
generalize the learned policy to a wide range of tasks. First, we trained the
prefrontal RL, and deep RL algorithms on 82 subjects' data, collected while
human participants were performing two-stage Markov decision tasks, in which we
manipulated the goal, state-transition uncertainty and state-space complexity.
In the reliability test, which includes the latent behavior profile and the
parameter recoverability test, we showed that the prefrontal RL reliably
learned the latent policies of the humans, while all the other models failed.
Second, to test the ability to generalize what these models learned from the
original task, we situated them in the context of environmental volatility.
Specifically, we ran large-scale simulations with 10 Markov decision tasks, in
which latent context variables change over time. Our information-theoretic
analysis showed that the prefrontal RL showed the highest level of adaptability
and episodic encoding efficacy. This is the first attempt to formally test the
possibility that computational models mimicking the way the brain solves
general problems can lead to practical solutions to key challenges in machine
learning.

analysis tasks. It works by smoothing the node features across the graph. The
current GCN models overwhelmingly assume that the node feature information is
complete. However, real-world graph data are often incomplete and containing
missing features. Traditionally, people have to estimate and fill in the
unknown features based on imputation techniques and then apply GCN. However,
the process of feature filling and graph learning are separated, resulting in
degraded and unstable performance. This problem becomes more serious when a
large number of features are missing. We propose an approach that adapts GCN to
graphs containing missing features. In contrast to traditional strategy, our
approach integrates the processing of missing features and graph learning
within the same neural network architecture. Our idea is to represent the
missing data by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and calculate the expected
activation of neurons in the first hidden layer of GCN, while keeping the other
layers of the network unchanged. This enables us to learn the GMM parameters
and network weight parameters in an end-to-end manner. Notably, our approach
does not increase the computational complexity of GCN and it is consistent with
GCN when the features are complete. We demonstrate through extensive
experiments that our approach significantly outperforms the imputation-based
methods in node classification and link prediction tasks. We show that the
performance of our approach for the case with a low level of missing features
is even superior to GCN for the case with complete features.

Griffin-Lim. DeepSinger has several advantages over previous SVS systems: 1) to
the best of our knowledge, it is the first SVS system that directly mines
training data from music websites, 2) the lyrics-to-singing alignment model
further avoids any human efforts for alignment labeling and greatly reduces
labeling cost, 3) the singing model based on a feed-forward Transformer is
simple and efficient, by removing the complicated acoustic feature modeling in
parametric synthesis and leveraging a reference encoder to capture the timbre
of a singer from noisy singing data, and 4) it can synthesize singing voices in
multiple languages and multiple singers. We evaluate DeepSinger on our mined
singing dataset that consists of about 92 hours data from 89 singers on three
languages (Chinese, Cantonese and English). The results demonstrate that with
the singing data purely mined from the Web, DeepSinger can synthesize
high-quality singing voices in terms of both pitch accuracy and voice
naturalness (footnote: Our audio samples are shown in

of charged shower particles is greater than or equal to twenty eight (Ns geq
28) were chosen for the analysis. They are not exactly central collision
events, but may be considered as pseudo-central collision events. The angular
characteristics of relativistic charged secondaries have been studied in terms
of pseudo-rapidity, and bimodality is found to be absent in the distributions.
The mean pseudo-rapidity seems to be independent of grey and heavy particle
multiplicities, which indicates its independence with number of collisions.

experiments, we study the non equilibrium dynamics of a sheared colloidal
cluster, which is confined to a two-dimensional disk. The experimental system
is composed of a mixture of paramagnetic and non magnetic polystyrene
particles, which are held in the disk by time shared optical tweezers. The
paramagnetic particles are located at the center of the disk and are actuated
by an external, rotating magnetic field that induces a magnetic torque. We
identify two different steady states by monitoring the mean angular velocities
per ring. The first one is characterized by rare slip events, where the inner
rings momentarily depin from the outer ring, which is kept static by the set of
optical traps. For the second state, we find a bistability of the mean angular
velocities, which can be understood from the analysis of the slip events in the
particle trajectories. We calculate the particle waiting- and jumping time
distributions and estimate a time scale between slips, which is also reflected
by a plateau in the mean squared azimuthal displacement. The dynamical
transition is further reflected by the components of the stress tensor,
revealing a shear-thinning behavior as well as shear stress overshoots.
Finally, we briefly discuss the observed transition in the context of
stochastic thermodynamics and how it may open future directions in this field.

proposed as a promising technology in secure communications to achieve a
precise transmission of confidential messages, and artificial noise (AN) was
considered as an important helper in RFDA-DM. Compared with previous works that
only focus on the spot of the desired receiver, in this work, we investigate a
secrecy region around the desired receiver, that is, a specific range and angle
resolution around the desired receiver. Firstly, the minimum number of antennas
and the bandwidth needed to achieve a secrecy region are derived. Moreover,
based on the lower bound of the secrecy capacity in RFDA-DM-AN scheme, we
investigate the performance impact of AN on the secrecy capacity. From this
work, we conclude that: 1) AN is not always beneficial to the secure
transmission. Specifically, when the number of antennas is sufficiently large
and the transmit power is smaller than a specified value, AN will reduce
secrecy capacity due to the consumption of limited transmit power. 2)
Increasing bandwidth will enlarge the set for randomly allocating frequencies
and thus lead to a higher secrecy capacity. 3) The minimum number of antennas
increases as the predefined secrecy transmission rate increases.

semi-central collisions (10-40\% centrality) and compared to that of protons.
While the $v_1(y)$ slopes of protons are generally negative for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}

of the $v_1(y)$ slope of deuterons is seen at the lowest collision energy (the

the transverse momentum dependence of $v_1$ for protons and deuterons. The

(ASP) is NP-complete, thus, as hard as the satisfaction problem for classical
propositional logic (SAT). The best algorithms to solve these problems take
exponential time in the worst case. The exponential time hypothesis (ETH)
implies that this result is tight for SAT, that is, SAT cannot be solved in
subexponential time. This immediately establishes that the result is also tight
for the consistency problem for ASP. However, accounting for the treewidth of
the problem, the consistency problem for ASP is slightly harder than SAT: while
SAT can be solved by an algorithm that runs in exponential time in the
treewidth k, it was recently shown that ASP requires exponential time in k
\cdot log(k). This extra cost is due checking that there are no self-supported
true atoms due to positive cycles in the program. In this paper, we refine the
above result and show that the consistency problem for ASP can be solved in
exponential time in k \cdot log({\lambda}) where {\lambda} is the minimum
between the treewidth and the size of the largest strongly-connected component
in the positive dependency graph of the program. We provide a dynamic
programming algorithm that solves the problem and a treewidth-aware reduction
from ASP to SAT that adhere to the above limit.

development takes the following steps. Firstly, we perform proof-theoretic
reconstruction of Moggi's computational metalanguage and obtain a type theory
with a modal type $\rhd$ as a refinement. Through the proposition-as-type
paradigm, its logic can be seen as a decomposition of lax logic via Benton's
adjoint calculus. This calculus models as a programming language a weaker
version of effects, which we call \emph{semi-effects}. Secondly, we give its
semantics using actegories and equivariant functors. Compared to previous
studies of effects and actegories, our approach is more general in that models
are directly given by equivariant functors, which include Freyd categories
(hence strong monads) as a special case. Thirdly, we show that categorical
gluing along equivariant functors is possible and derive logical predicates for
$\rhd$-modality. We also show that this gluing, under a natural assumption,
gives rise to logical predicates that coincide with those derived by
Katsumata's categorical $\top\top$-lifting for Moggi's metalanguage.

different languages. However, most of them are based on texts in prose, lacking
applications that work with poetry texts. An example of an application of text
mining in poetry is the usage of features derived from their individual words
in order to capture the lexical, sublexical and interlexical meaning, and infer
the General Affective Meaning (GAM) of the text. However, even though this
proposal has been proved as useful for poetry in some languages, there is a
lack of studies for both Spanish poetry and for highly-structured poetic
compositions such as sonnets. This article presents a study over an annotated
corpus of Spanish sonnets, in order to analyse if it is possible to build
features from their individual words for predicting their GAM. The purpose of
this is to model sonnets at an affective level. The article also analyses the
relationship between the GAM of the sonnets and the content itself. For this,
we consider the content from a psychological perspective, identifying with tags
when a sonnet is related to a specific term. Then, we study how GAM changes
according to each of those psychological terms.
  The corpus used contains 274 Spanish sonnets from authors of different
centuries, from 15th to 19th. This corpus was annotated by different domain
experts. The experts annotated the poems with affective and lexico-semantic
features, as well as with domain concepts that belong to psychology. Thanks to
this, the corpus of sonnets can be used in different applications, such as
poetry recommender systems, personality text mining studies of the authors, or
the usage of poetry for therapeutic purposes.

remnants as accelerators of GeV hadronic cosmic rays. In such processes, CRs
accelerated in SNR shocks interact with particles from gas clouds in their
surrounding. In particular, the rich medium in which core-collapse SNRs explode
provides a large target density to boost hadronic gamma-rays. SNR G39.2-0.3 is
one of the brightest SNR in infrared wavelengths, and its broad multiwavelength
coverage allows detailed modelling of its radiation from radio to high
energies. We reanalyzed the Fermi-LAT data on this region and compare it with
new radio observations from the MWISP survey. The modelling of the spectral
energy distribution from radio to GeV energies favors a hadronic origin of the
gamma-ray emission and constrains the SNR magnetic field to be at least ~100
uG. Despite the large magnetic field, the present acceleration of protons seems
to be limited to ~10 GeV, which points to a drastic slow down of the shock
velocity due to the dense wall traced by the CO observations, surrounding the
remnant. Further investigation of the gamma-ray spectral shape points to a
dynamically old remnant subjected to severe escape of CRs and a decrease of
acceleration efficiency. The low-energy peak of the gamma-ray spectrum also
suggests that that the composition of accelerated particles might be enriched
by heavy nuclei which is certainly expected for a core-collapse SNR.
Alternatively, the contribution of the compressed pre-existing Galactic cosmic
rays is discussed, which is, however, found to not likely be the dominant
process for gamma-ray production.

the lasing spectra in the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime can be easily
tuned in terms of intensity, bandwidth and wavelength by varying the magnitude
of the phase shift in the middle of the structure. Surprisingly, the
multi-modal lasing spectra are suppressed by virtue of judiciously selected
phase and the gain-loss value. Also, it is possible to obtain sidelobe-less
spectra in the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime, without a need for an
apodization profile, which is a traditional way to tame the unwanted sidelobes.
The system is found to show narrow band single-mode lasing behavior for a wide
range of phase shift values for given values of gain and loss. Moreover, we
report the intensity tunable reflection and transmission characteristics in the
unbroken regime via variation in gain and loss. At the exceptional point, the
system shows unidirectional wave transport phenomenon independent of the
presence of phase shift in the middle of the grating. For the right light
incidence direction, the system exhibits zero reflection wavelengths within the
stopband at the exceptional point. We also investigate the role of multiple
phase shifts placed at fixed locations along the length of the FBG and the
variations in the spectra when the phase shift and gain-loss values are tuned.
In the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime, the presence of multiple phase
shifts aids in controlling the number of reflectivity peaks besides controlling
their magnitude.

generalize the concept of the corpus as a counting process which is defined by
three key elements vocabulary set, feature (annotation) set, and context. This
generalization enables the principal word embedding method to generate word
vectors with regard to different types of contexts and different types of
annotations provided for a corpus. The second is to generalize the
transformation step used in most of the word embedding methods. To this end, we
define two levels of transformations. The first is a quadratic transformation,
which accounts for different types of weighting over the vocabulary units and
contextual features. Second is an adaptive non-linear transformation, which
reshapes the data distribution to be meaningful to principal component
analysis. The effect of these generalizations on the word vectors is
intrinsically studied with regard to the spread and the discriminability of the
word vectors. We also provide an extrinsic evaluation of the contribution of
the principal word vectors on a word similarity benchmark and the task of

results. In this work, we will provide an improved radial basis function
interpolator which is used to obtain the interpolated stellar spectra based on

local dispersion of stars in the stellar atmospheric parameter space.
Furthermore, we use the empirical stellar spectral library MILES to test this
interpolator. On the whole, the interpolator has a good performance except for
the edge of the low-temperature region. At last, we compare this interpolator

radiation era. We assume that a light scalar field is decoupled from matter and
oscillates harmonically around its vacuum expectation value. We include
self-interactions and consider the nonrelativistic regime. The scalar dynamics
are described by a fluid approach where the fluid pressure depends on both
quantum and self-interaction effects. When the squared speed of sound of the
scalar fluid becomes negative, an instability arises and the fluctuations of
the scalar energy-density field start growing. They eventually become nonlinear
and clumps form. Subsequently, the clumps aggregate and reach a universal
regime. Afterwards, they play the role of cold dark matter. We apply this
mechanism first to a model with a negative quartic term stabilised by a
positive self-interaction of order six, and then to axion monodromy, where a
subdominant cosine potential corrects a mass term. In the first case, the
squared speed of sound becomes negative when the quartic term dominates,
leading to a tachyonic instability. For axion monodromy, the instability starts
very slowly after the squared speed of sound first becomes negative and then
oscillates around zero. Initially the density perturbations perform acoustic
oscillations due to the quantum pressure. Eventually, they start growing
exponentially due to a parametric resonance.
  In both scenarios, the scalar-field clumps span a wide range of scales and
masses, running from the size of atoms to that of galactic molecular clouds,
and from $10^{-3} \, {\rm gram}$ to thousands of solar masses. Because of
finite-size effects, both from the source and the lens, these dark matter
clumps are far beyond the reach of microlensing observations.

relative camera pose estimation from labeled image-pair data, without requiring
any hand-engineered features, camera intrinsic parameters or depth information.
The trained CNN can be utilized for performing pose based visual servo control
(PBVS). One of the ways to improve the quality of visual servo output is to
improve the accuracy of the CNN for estimating the relative pose estimation.
With a given state-of-the-art CNN for relative pose regression, how can we
achieve an improved performance for visual servo control? In this paper, we
explore switching of CNNs to improve the precision of visual servo control. The
idea of switching a CNN is due to the fact that the dataset for training a
relative camera pose regressor for visual servo control must contain variations
in relative pose ranging from a very small scale to eventually a larger scale.
We found that, training two different instances of the CNN, one for
large-scale-displacements (LSD) and another for small-scale-displacements (SSD)
and switching them during the visual servo execution yields better results than
training a single CNN with the combined LSD+SSD data. However, it causes extra
storage overhead and switching decision is taken by a manually set threshold
which may not be optimal for all the scenes. To eliminate these drawbacks, we
propose an efficient switching strategy based on model agnostic meta learning
(MAML) algorithm. In this, a single model is trained to learn parameters which
are simultaneously good for multiple tasks, namely a binary classification for
switching decision, a 6DOF pose regression for LSD data and also a 6DOF pose
regression for SSD data. The proposed approach performs far better than the
naive approach, while storage and run-time overheads are almost negligible.

point-to-point regression, and pixel-wise estimations. Despite the good
performance, those methods have a few issues in nature, such as the poor
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and plain feature representation
learning with local convolutions. In this paper, a novel pixel-wise
prediction-based method is proposed to address the above issues. The key ideas
are two-fold: a) explicitly modeling the dependencies among joints and the
relations between the pixels and the joints for better local feature
representation learning; b) unifying the dense pixel-wise offset predictions
and direct joint regression for end-to-end training. Specifically, we first
propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) based joint graph reasoning module
to model the complex dependencies among joints and augment the representation
capability of each pixel. Then we densely estimate all pixels' offsets to
joints in both image plane and depth space and calculate the joints' positions
by a weighted average over all pixels' predictions, totally discarding the
complex postprocessing operations. The proposed model is implemented with an
efficient 2D fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone and has only about 1.4M

candidates for light emitting diodes and tandem solar cells. However,
illuminating mixed-halide perovskites results in the formation of segregated
phases enriched in a single-halide. This segregation occurs through ion
migration, which is also observed in single-halide compositions, and whose
control is thus essential to enhance the lifetime and stability. Using
pressure-dependent transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that the
formation rates of both iodide- and bromide-rich phases in MAPb(BrxI1-x)3
reduce by two orders of magnitude on increasing the pressure to 0.3 GPa. We
explain this reduction from a compression-induced increase of the activation
energy for halide migration, which is supported by first-principle
calculations. A similar mechanism occurs when the unit cell volume is reduced
by incorporating a smaller cation. These findings reveal that stability with
respect to halide segregation can be achieved either physically through
compressive stress or chemically through compositional engineering.

in which a teacher model is used to guide the training of a student model

reweights training data using a teacher model, receives much attention due to
its simplicity and effectiveness. In existing learning to reweight works, the
teacher model only utilizes shallow/surface information such as training
iteration number and loss/accuracy of the student model from
training/validation sets, but ignores the internal states of the student model,
which limits the potential of learning to reweight. In this work, we propose an
improved data reweighting algorithm, in which the student model provides its
internal states to the teacher model, and the teacher model returns adaptive
weights of training samples to enhance the training of the student model. The
teacher model is jointly trained with the student model using meta gradients
propagated from a validation set. Experiments on image classification with

non-rigidly deformed during a simulated CT scan creating motion corrupted

dataset with audio clips and corresponding natural language descriptions (i.e.
captions). A significant challenge for audio captioning is the distribution of
words in the captions: some words are very frequent but acoustically
non-informative, i.e. the function words (e.g. ""a"", ""the""), and other words are
infrequent but informative, i.e. the content words (e.g. adjectives, nouns). In
this paper we propose two methods to mitigate this class imbalance problem.
First, in an autoencoder setting for audio captioning, we weigh each word's
contribution to the training loss inversely proportional to its number of
occurrences in the whole dataset. Secondly, in addition to multi-class,

trivially on the matter content. While many physical observables are not
sensitive to this fact, the identification of the precise gauge group becomes
crucial when the magnetic spectrum of the theory is considered. This question
is addressed in the context of Coulomb branches for $3$d $\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver
gauge theories, which are moduli spaces of dressed monopole operators. Since
monopole operators are characterized by their magnetic charge, the
identification of the gauge group is imperative for the determination of the
magnetic lattice. It is well-known that the gauge group of unframed unitary
quivers is the product of all unitary nodes in the quiver modded out by the
diagonal $\mathrm{U}(1)$ acting trivially on the matter representation. This
reasoning generalises to the notion that a choice of gauge group associated to
a quiver is given by the product of the individual nodes quotiented by any
subgroup that acts trivially on the matter content. For unframed (unitary-)
orthosymplectic quivers composed of $\mathrm{SO}(\textrm{even})$,
$\mathrm{USp}$, and possibly $\mathrm{U}$ gauge nodes, the maximal subgroup
acting trivially is a diagonal $\mathbb{Z}_2$. For unframed unitary quivers
with a single $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ node it is $\mathbb{Z}_N$. We use this notion to
compute the Coulomb branch Hilbert series of many unitary-orthosymplectic
quivers. Examples include nilpotent orbit closures of the exceptional E-type
algebras and magnetic quivers that arise from brane physics. This includes
Higgs branches of theories with 8 supercharges in dimensions $4$, $5$, and $6$.
A crucial ingredient in the calculation of exact refined Hilbert series is the
alternative construction of unframed magnetic quivers from resolved Slodowy
slices, whose Hilbert series can be derived from Hall-Littlewood polynomials.

privacy-conscious users, whistle-blowers and political activists alike. Prior
research deems popular anonymization systems like Tor unsuitable for providing
requisite performance guarantees that real-time applications like VoIP need.
Their claims are backed by studies that may no longer be valid due to constant
advancements in Tor. Moreover, we believe that these studies lacked the
requisite diversity and comprehensiveness. Thus, conclusions from these studies
led them to propose novel and tailored solutions. However, no such system is
available for immediate use. Additionally, operating such new systems would
incur significant costs for recruiting users and volunteered relays, to provide
the necessary anonymity guarantees.
  It thus becomes imperative that the exact performance of VoIP over Tor be
quantified and analyzed so that the potential performance bottlenecks can be
amended. We thus conducted an extensive empirical study across various in-lab
and real-world scenarios to shed light on VoIP performance over Tor. In over
0.5 million measurements spanning 12 months, across seven countries and
covering about 6650 Tor relays, we observed that Tor supports good voice
quality (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) >3 and oneway delay
<400ms) in more than 85% of cases. Further analysis indicates that in general
for most Tor relays, the contentions due to cross-traffic were low enough to
support VoIP calls, that are anyways transmitted at low rates (<120 Kbps). Our
findings are supported by concordant measurements using iperf that show more
than the adequate available bandwidth for most cases. Data published by the Tor
Metrics also corroborates the same. Hence, unlike prior efforts, our research
reveals that Tor is suitable for supporting anonymous VoIP calls.

accelerated through multifidelity approaches which leverage multiple black-box
approximations of the objective functions that can be computationally cheaper
to evaluate, but still provide relevant information to the search task. Further
computational benefits are offered by the availability of parallel and
distributed computing architectures whose optimal usage is an open opportunity
within the context of active learning. This paper introduces the Resource Aware
Active Learning (RAAL) strategy, a multifidelity Bayesian scheme to accelerate
the optimization of black box functions. At each optimization step, the RAAL
procedure computes the set of best sample locations and the associated fidelity
sources that maximize the information gain to acquire during the
parallel/distributed evaluation of the objective function, while accounting for
the limited computational budget. The scheme is demonstrated for a variety of
benchmark problems and results are discussed for both single fidelity and
multifidelity settings. In particular we observe that the RAAL strategy
optimally seeds multiple points at each iteration allowing for a major speed up

proposed one efficient method to train RBMs with binary synapses by using a

Bernoulli distribution rather than the expectation parameters. Since the
natural parameters take values in the entire real domain, no additional
clipping is needed. Interestingly, the algorithm in \cite{huang2019data} could
be viewed as one first-order approximation of the proposed algorithm, which
justifies its efficacy with heuristic clipping.

structural, thermodynamic and corrosion properties are analyzed and interpreted
by means of X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy,

variations are reported and interpreted regarding possible formation of
structural defects and uneven Mn distribution within the Ni sublattice.
Reversible capacity is improved for x > 0.3 leading to larger and flatter
isotherm curves, allowing for reversible capacity >1.4 wt %. Regarding
corrosion, the binary compound corrodes in alkaline medium to form rare earth
hydroxide and nanoporous nickel. As for the Mn-substituted compounds, a new
corrosion product is formed in addition to those above mentioned, as manganese
initiates a sacrificial anode mechanism taking place at the early corrosion

higher-dimensional operators because they can significantly change the
background dynamics and the canonical normalization of the fluctuations around
it. Correspondingly, the typical energy of particles produced during the first
stage of preheating can remain comparable to or below the cutoff scale of the
theory. As an example, we numerically calculate the particle production in the

the statement above. Our argument also applies to multi-field inflation with

feature a tonal behavior. The flow field is investigated to understand its
origin and show how it modifies side-load properties. The temporal and spatial
organization of wall pressure and jet velocity field are first experimentally
characterized based on synchronized acquisition of both wall-pressure along
rings of pressure probes located within the nozzle and high-rate time-resolved
PIV velocity fields measured in a plane section crossing the jet downstream of
the nozzle exit. The external jet aerodynamics and internal wall pressure field
are first shown to be clearly linked, but only at this frequency peak for which
a significant coherence emerges between first azimuthal mode of fluctuating
wall pressure and first azimuthal mode of fluctuating external velocity field.
A Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation is carried out and validated against
experimental results in order to reproduce this tonal flow dynamics. The
analysis of simulation data shows that the tonal flow behaviour of first
azimuthal mode is indeed more largely felt within the whole flow structure
where both upstream and downstream propagating waves are shown to co-exist,
even far downstream of the nozzle exit. The analysis shows that both waves
possess support in the jet core and have a non negligible pressure signature in
the separated region. The Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of
fluctuating pressure field at this tonal frequency reveals that the nature and
intensity of lateral pressure forces is directed by the resonance related to
the upstream- and downstream-propagating coherent structures, which imposes the
shock-waves network to respond and modulate the pressure levels on the nozzle
internal surface.

especially in the spin period of neutron stars. Several physical mechanisms may
produce this bimodality. The most favored candidate mechanisms are two distinct
supernova channels or different accretion modes of the neutron stars in
Be/X-ray binaries. Investigating the kinematics of these systems may provide
some additional insight into the physics of this bimodality. If the two
Be/X-ray binary subpopulations arise from two distinct supernova types, then
the two subpopulations should have different peculiar (systemic) velocities.
This can be tested either directly, by measuring the velocity of the system, or
indirectly, by measuring the position of the system with respect to its
birthplace. Using the most recent Gaia dataset and the newest catalogs of Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) star clusters, we analyzed the tangential peculiar
velocities of Be/X-ray binaries in the Galaxy and the positions of Be/X-ray
binaries in the SMC. We used the distance of the system from the nearest young
star cluster as a proxy to the tangential velocity of the system. We applied
statistical testing to investigate whether the two subpopulations that are
divided by the spin of the neutron star are also kinematically distinct. There
is evidence that the two subpopulations are indeed kinematically distinct.
However, the tangential peculiar velocities of the two subpopulations are the
reverse from what is expected from the distinct supernova channel hypothesis.
We find some marginal evidence ($p \approx$~0.005) that the Galactic Be/X-ray
binaries from the short-spin subpopulation have systematically higher peculiar
velocities than the systems from the long-spin subpopulation. The same effect,
but weaker, is also recovered for the SMC Be/X-ray binaries for all considered
cluster catalogs.

incomplete despite numerous investigations of intermodal nonlinear phenomena
and spatiotemporal coupling. Some of the striking phenomena observed in bulk
media with ultrashort and ultra-intense pulses (i.e., conical emission,
harmonic generation and light bullets) require a deeper insight to be possibly
unveiled in multimode fibers. Here we generalize the concept of conical waves
described in bulk media towards structured media, such as multimode optical
fibers, in which only a discrete and finite number of modes can propagate. The
modal distribution of optical fibers provides a quantization of conical
emission (e.g., quantized X-waves) through phase-matched resonant radiations
(i.e., dispersive waves) seeded by optical shocks or ultrashort wave structures
during spatiotemporal compression stages. Such quantized dispersion- and
diffraction-free waves are generated when a rather intense short pulse
propagates nonlinearly in a multimode waveguide, whatever the dispersion regime
and waveguide geometry. Future nonlinear experiments in commercially-available
multimode fibers could reveal different forms of conical emission and an easy
control of supercontinuum light bullets.

Applications include secure multiparty computation, oblivious sampling,

oblivious transfer is impossible to achieve. Imperfect variants, where both
participants' ability to cheat is still limited, are possible using quantum
means while remaining classically impossible. Precisely what security
parameters are attainable remains unknown. We introduce a theoretical framework
for studying semirandom quantum oblivious transfer, which is shown to be
equivalent to regular oblivious transfer in terms of cheating probabilities. We
then use it to derive bounds on cheating. We also present a protocol with lower
cheating probabilities than previous schemes, together with its optical
realization. We show that a lower bound of 2/3 on the minimum achievable
cheating probability can be directly derived for semirandom protocols using a
different method and definition of cheating than used previously. The lower
bound increases from 2/3 to approximately 0.749 if the states output by the
protocol are pure and symmetric. The oblivious transfer scheme we present uses
unambiguous state elimination measurements and can be implemented with the same
technological requirements as standard quantum cryptography. The cheating
probabilities are 3/4 and approximately 0.729 for sender and receiver
respectively, which is lower than in existing protocols. Using a photonic
test-bed, we have implemented the protocol with honest parties, as well as
optimal cheating strategies.

constraints, and limited flexibility in resource management. In this paper, we
adopt a metric, Offered Capacity to requested Traffic Ratio (OCTR), to measure
the requested-offered data (or rate) mismatch in multi-beam satellite systems.
In the considered system, NOMA is applied to mitigate intra-beam interference
while precoding is implemented to reduce inter-beam interference. We jointly
optimize power, decoding orders, and terminal-timeslot assignment to improve
the max-min fairness of OCTR. The problem is inherently difficult due to the
presence of combinatorial and non-convex aspects. We first fix the
terminal-timeslot assignment, and develop an optimal fast-convergence
algorithmic framework based on Perron-Frobenius theory (PF) for the remaining
joint power-allocation and decoding-order optimization problem. Under this
framework, we propose a heuristic algorithm for the original problem, which
iteratively updates the terminal-timeslot assignment and improves the overall
OCTR performance. Numerical results verify that max-min OCTR is a suitable
metric to address the mismatch issue, and is able to improve the fairness among
terminals. In average, the proposed algorithm improves the max-min OCTR by
40.2% over Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA).

Evaporative (sublimation) cooling of icy interstellar grains occurs
when the grains have been suddenly heated by a cosmic-ray (CR) particle or
other process. It results in thermal desorption of icy species, affecting the
chemical composition of interstellar clouds. Aims. We investigate details on
sublimation cooling, obtaining necessary knowledge before this process is
considered in astrochemical models. Methods. We employed a numerical code that
describes the sublimation of molecules from an icy grain, layer by layer, also
considering a limited diffusion of bulk-ice molecules toward the surface before
they sublimate. We studied a grain, suddenly heated to peak temperature T,
which cools via sublimation and radiation. Results. A number of questions were
answered. The choice of grain heat capacity C has a limited effect on the
number of sublimated molecules N, if the grain temperature T > 40K. For grains
with different sizes, CR-induced desorption is most efficient for rather small
grains with a core radius of a ~ 0.02 micron. CR-induced sublimation of CO2 ice
can occur only from small grains if their peak temperature is T > 80K and there
is a lack of other volatiles. The presence of H2 molecules on grain surface
hastens their cooling and thus significantly reduces N for other sublimated
molecules for T < 30K. Finally, if there is no diffusion and subsequent
sublimation of bulk-ice molecules (i.e., sublimation occurs only from the
surface layer), sublimation yields do not exceed 1-2 monolayers and, if T >
50K, N does not increase with increasing T. Conclusions. Important details
regarding the sublimation cooling of icy interstellar grains were clarified,
which will enable a proper consideration of this process in astrochemical
modeling.

operation in time series signals, can be interpreted as an operator which
assigns a coordinate structure to a graph. By using the graph domain extension

where precipitates impede dislocation motion, but the role of such obstacles in
determining the nature of collective dislocation dynamics remains to be
understood. Here, three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations
of FCC single crystals are performed with fully coherent spherical precipitates
from zero precipitate density upto $\rho_p = 10^{21}\,\text{m}^{-3}$ and at
various dislocation-precipitate interaction strengths. When the
dislocation-precipitate interactions do not play a major role the yielding is
qualitatively as for pure crystals, i.e., dominated by ""dislocation jamming"",
resulting in glassy dislocation dynamics exhibiting critical features at any
stress value. We demonstrate that increasing the precipitate density and/or the
dislocation-precipitate interaction strength creates a true yield or
dislocation assembly depinning transition, with a critical yield stress. This
is clearly visible in the statistics of dislocation avalanches observed when
quasistatically ramping up the external stress, and is also manifested in the
response of the system to constant applied stresses. The scaling of the
yielding with precipitates is discussed in terms of the Bacon-Kocks-Scattergood

bridge} of $G$ is an edge whose removal breaks all $s$-$t$ paths of $G$ (and
thus appears in all $s$-$t$ paths). Computing all $s$-$t$ bridges of $G$ is a
basic graph problem, solvable in linear time.
  In this paper, we consider a natural generalisation of this problem, with the
notion of ""safety"" from bioinformatics. We say that a walk $W$ is \emph{safe}
with respect to a set $\mathcal{W}$ of $s$-$t$ walks, if $W$ is a subwalk of
all walks in $\mathcal{W}$. We start by considering the maximal safe walks when
$\mathcal{W}$ consists of: all $s$-$t$ paths, all $s$-$t$ trails, or all
$s$-$t$ walks of $G$. We show that the first two problems are immediate
linear-time generalisations of finding all $s$-$t$ bridges, while the third
problem is more involved. In particular, we show that there exists a compact
representation computable in linear time, that allows outputting all maximal
safe walks in time linear in their length.
  We further generalise these problems, by assuming that safety is defined only
with respect to a subset of \emph{visible} edges. Here we prove a dichotomy
between the $s$-$t$ paths and $s$-$t$ trails cases, and the $s$-$t$ walks case:
the former two are NP-hard, while the latter is solvable with the same
complexity as when all edges are visible. We also show that the same complexity
results hold for the analogous generalisations of \emph{$s$-$t$ articulation
points} (nodes appearing in all $s$-$t$ paths).
  We thus obtain the best possible results for natural ""safety""-generalisations
of these two fundamental graph problems. Moreover, our algorithms are simple
and do not employ any complex data structures, making them ideal for use in

distribution is among the oldest types of problems in Statistics. Many such
tests have been developed and their performance studied. The general result has
been that while a certain test might perform well, aka have good power, in one
situation it will fail badly in others. This is not a surprise given the great
many ways in which a distribution can differ from the one specified in the null
hypothesis. It is therefore very difficult to decide a priori which test to
use. The obvious solution is not to rely on any one test but to run several of
them. This however leads to the problem of simultaneous inference, that is, if
several tests are done even if the null hypothesis were true, one of them is
likely to reject it anyway just by random chance. In this paper we present a
method that yields a p value that is uniform under the null hypothesis no
matter how many tests are run. This is achieved by adjusting the p value via
simulation. While this adjustment method is not new, it has not previously been
used in the context of goodness-of-fit testing. We present a number of
simulation studies that show the uniformity of the p value and others that show
that this test is superior to any one test if the power is averaged over a
large number of cases.

(features). Identifying a subset of meaningful features is often ignored in
unsupervised learning, despite its potential for unraveling clear patterns
hidden in the ambient space. In this paper, we present a method for
unsupervised feature selection, and we demonstrate its use for the task of
clustering. We propose a differentiable loss function that combines the
Laplacian score, which favors low-frequency features, with a gating mechanism
for feature selection. We improve the Laplacian score, by replacing it with a
gated variant computed on a subset of features. This subset is obtained using a
continuous approximation of Bernoulli variables whose parameters are trained to
gate the full feature space. We mathematically motivate the proposed approach
and demonstrate that in the high noise regime, it is crucial to compute the
Laplacian on the gated inputs, rather than on the full feature set.
Experimental demonstration of the efficacy of the proposed approach and its
advantage over current baselines is provided using several real-world examples.

best overall description of the experimental results, even though other models

The object was identified by cross-matching an intermediate SRG/eROSITA source
catalog with the Pan-STARRS1 distant quasar sample at 5.6 < z < 6.7. The
measured flux $\sim 8 \times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.3--2 keV
energy band corresponds to an X-ray luminosity of $2.6^{+1.7}_{-1.0}\times
10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 2--10 keV rest-frame energy band, which renders
CFHQS J142952+544717 the most X-ray luminous quasar ever observed at z > 6.
Combining our X-ray measurements with archival and new photometric measurements
in other wavebands (radio to optical), we estimate the bolometric luminosity of
this quasar at $\sim (2$--$3) \times 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Assuming Eddington
limited accretion and isotropic emission, we infer a lower limit on the mass of
the supermassive black hole of $\sim 2\times 10^9 M_\odot$. The most salient
feature of CFHQS J142952+544717 is its X-ray brightness relative to the
optical/UV emission. We argue that it may be linked to its radio-loudness
(although the object is not a blazar according to its radio properties),
specifically to a contribution of inverse Compton scattering of cosmic
microwave background photons off relativistic electrons in the jets. If so,
CFHQS J142952+544717 might be the tip of the iceberg of high-z quasars with
enhanced X-ray emission, and SRG/eROSITA may find many more such objects during
its 4 year all-sky survey.

scaling arguments we show that the phenomenology is governed by three
dimensionless groups, which characterize the level of confinement imposed on
the sheet, as well as its extensibility and bendability. Recognizing that
delamination emerges through a subcritical bifurcation from a planar, uniformly
compressed state, we predict that the dependence of the threshold confinement
level on the extensibility and bendability of the sheet, as well as the
delaminated shape at threshold, varies markedly between two asymptotic regimes
of these parameters. For sheets whose bendability is sufficiently high the
delaminated shape is a large-slope ""fold"", where the amplitude is proportional
to the imposed confinement. In contrast, for lower values of the bendability
parameter the delaminated shape is a small-slope ""ruck"", whose amplitude
increases more moderately upon increasing confinement. Realizing that the
instability of the fully laminated state requires a finite extensibility of the
sheet, we introduce a simple model that allows us to construct a bifurcation
diagram that governs the delamination process.

properties for photonic circuits fabrication and miniaturization, for surface
enhanced spectroscopies and imaging beyond the diffraction limit. However, the
excitation of these plasmonic modes by direct illumination is forbidden by
energy/momentum conservation rules. One strategy to overcome this limitation
relies on diffraction gratings to match the wavevector of the incoming photons
with that of propagating SPP excitations. The main limit of the approaches so
far reported in literature is that they rely on highly ordered diffraction
gratings fabricated by means of demanding nano-lithographic processes. In this
work we demonstrate that an innovative, fully self-organized method based on
wrinkling-assisted Ion Beam Sputtering can be exploited to fabricate large area
(cm^2 scale) nano-rippled soda-lime templates which conformally support
ultrathin Au films deposited by physical deposition. The self-organized
patterns act as quasi-1D gratings characterized by a remarkably high spatial
order which matches properly the transverse photon coherence length. The
gratings can thus enable the excitation of hybrid SPP modes confined at the
Au/dielectric interfaces, with a resonant wavelength which can be tuned either
by modifying the grating period, photon incidence angle or, potentially, the
choice of the thin film conductive material. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering
experiments show promising gains in the range of 10^3 which are competitive,
even before a systematic optimization of the sample fabrication parameters,
with state-of-the art lithographic systems, demonstrating the potential of such
templates for a broad range of optoelectronic applications aiming at
plasmon-enhanced photon harvesting for molecular or bio-sensing.

large dataset using tag retrieval followed by selecting the best clips with
visual similarities. Second, we learn generative adversarial networks that
generate video features of novel classes from their semantic embeddings.
Moreover, we find existing benchmarks are limited because they only focus on 5

comparison of observed versus expected numbers of events on one of the
treatment arms (the choice of which arm is arbitrary), where the expectation is
taken assuming that the true survival curves in the two arms are identical.
This concept is at the heart of the counting-process theory that provides a
rigorous basis for methods such as the log-rank test. It is natural, therefore,
to maintain this perspective when extending the log-rank test to deal with
non-proportional hazards, for example by considering a weighted sum of the
""observed - expected"" terms, where larger weights are given to time periods
where the hazard ratio is expected to favour the experimental treatment. In
doing so, however, one may stumble across some rather subtle issues, related to
the difficulty in ascribing a causal interpretation to hazard ratios, that may
lead to strange conclusions. An alternative approach is to view non-parametric
survival comparisons as permutation tests. With this perspective, one can
easily improve on the efficiency of the log-rank test, whilst thoroughly
controlling the false positive rate. In particular, for the field of
immuno-oncology, where researchers often anticipate a delayed treatment effect,
sample sizes could be substantially reduced without loss of power.

successfully used to denoise CT images. However, conventional deep learning

use a Joint Bilateral Filter (JBF) to denoise our CT images. The guidance image
of the JBF is estimated using a deep residual convolutional neural network
(CNN). The range smoothing and spatial smoothing parameters of the JBF are
tuned by a deep reinforcement learning task. Our actor first chooses a
parameter, and subsequently chooses an action to tune the value of the
parameter. A reward network is designed to direct the reinforcement learning
task. Our denoising method demonstrates good denoising performance, while
retaining structural information. Our method significantly outperforms state of

non-neural model for accuracy prediction. Specifically, as decision tree based

the search process, we propose to prune the search space gradually according to
important features derived from GBDT. In this way, NAS can be performed by
first pruning the search space and then searching a neural architecture, which
is more efficient and effective. Experiments on NASBench-101 and ImageNet
demonstrate the effectiveness of using GBDT as predictor for NAS: (1) On
NASBench-101, it is 22x, 8x, and 6x more sample efficient than random search,

often characterized by (1) the presence of private information and (2) opacity,
that is imperfect understanding between the decision makers. We prove that both
properties can complicate decision making considerably. A lower bound
quantifies the worst-case hardness of optimally advising a decision maker who
is opaque or has access to private information. An upper bound shows that a
simple coordination strategy is nearly minimax optimal. More efficient learning
is possible under certain assumptions on the problem, for example that both

in situations where the objective function is multi-modal and/or has saddle
points, that we term G-PFSO. The key element underpinning G-PFSO is a
probability distribution which (a) is shown to concentrate on the target
parameter value as the sample size increases and (b) can be efficiently
estimated by means of a standard particle filter algorithm. This distribution
depends on a learning rate, where the faster the learning rate the quicker it
concentrates on the desired element of the search space, but the less likely
G-PFSO is to escape from a local optimum of the objective function. In order to
achieve a fast convergence rate with a slow learning rate, G-PFSO exploits the
acceleration property of averaging, well-known in the stochastic gradient
literature. Considering several challenging estimation problems, the numerical
experiments show that, with high probability, G-PFSO successfully finds the
highest mode of the objective function and converges to its global maximizer at
the optimal rate. While the focus of this work is expected log-likelihood
maximization, the proposed methodology and its theory apply more generally for
optimizing a function defined through an expectation.

the so called regional fractional Lapacians $(-\Delta)^s_\Omega $, with
$\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$. Recall that the regional fractional Laplacians
are generated by symmetric stable processes which are not allowed to jump
outside $\Omega$. We consider weak solutions to the equation
$(-\Delta)^s_\Omega w(x)=p.v.\int_{\Omega}\frac{w(x)-w(y)}{|x-y|^{N+2s}}\,
dy=f(x)$, for $s\in (0,1)$, subject to zero Neumann or Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The boundary conditions are defined by considering $w$ as well as
the test functions in the fractional Sobolev spaces $H^s(\Omega)$ or
$H^s_0(\Omega)$ respectively.
  While the interior regularity is well understood for these problems, little
is known in the boundary regularity, mainly for the Neumann problem. Under
optimal regularity assumptions on $\Omega$ and provided $f\in L^p(\Omega)$, we
show that $w\in C^{2s-N/p}(\overline \Omega)$ in the case of zero Neumann
boundary conditions. As a consequence for $2s-N/p>1$, $w\in
C^{1,2s-\frac{N}{p}-1}(\overline{\Omega})$. As what concerned the Dirichlet
problem, we obtain ${w}/{\delta^{2s-1}}\in C^{1-N/p}(\overline\Omega)$,
provided $p>N$ and $s\in (1/2,1)$, where
$\delta(x)=\textrm{dist}(x,\partial\Omega)$.
  To prove these results, we first classify all solutions having a certain
growth at infinity when $\Omega$ is a half-space and the right hand side is
zero. We then carry over a fine blow up and some compactness arguments to get
the results.

Both the observation of negative magnetoresistance for magnetic field along the

submitting a contribution to a project with unfamiliar maintainers. Previous
studies suggest that the decision of accepting or rejecting a PR may be
influenced by a diverging set of technical and social factors, but often focus
on relatively few projects, do not consider ecosystem-wide measures, or the
possible non-monotonic relationships between the predictors and PR acceptance
probability. We aim to shed light on this important decision making process by
testing which measures significantly affect the probability of PR acceptance on
a significant fraction of a large ecosystem, rank them by their relative
importance in predicting PR acceptance, and determine the shape of the
functions that map each predictor to PR acceptance. We proposed seven
hypotheses regarding which technical and social factors might affect PR
acceptance and created 17 measures based on them. Our dataset consisted of
470,925 PRs from 3349 popular NPM packages and 79,128 GitHub users who created
those. We tested which of the measures affect PR acceptance and ranked the
significant measures by their importance in a predictive model. Our predictive
model had and AUC of 0.94, and 15 of the 17 measures were found to matter,
including five novel ecosystem-wide measures. Measures describing the number of
PRs submitted to a repository and what fraction of those get accepted, and
signals about the PR review phase were most significant. We also discovered
that only four predictors have a linear influence on the PR acceptance
probability while others showed a more complicated response.

We show that in the
stable region, the evolution is described by Mittag-Leffler functions and a
well defined effective Lyapunov exponent can be obtained in these cases. For
one-dimensional systems, this exponent can be related to the corresponding
fractional differential equation. A fractional equivalent of map $f(x)=ax$ is
stable for $a_c(\alpha)<a<1$ where $\alpha$ is a fractional order parameter and
$a_c(\alpha)\approx -\alpha$. For coupled linear fractional maps, we can obtain
`normal modes' and reduce the evolution to effectively one-dimensional system.
If the eigenvalues are real the stability of the coupled system is dictated by
the stability of effectively one-dimensional normal modes. For complex
eigenvalues, we obtain a much richer picture. However, in the stable region,
the evolution of modulus is dictated by Mittag-Leffler function and the
effective Lyapunov exponent is determined by modulus of eigenvalues. We extend
these studies to synchronized fixed points of fractional nonlinear maps.

that are very luminous at radio wavelengths. The majority of these galaxies
show collimated relativistic outflows known as jets, that extend over hundreds
of thousands of parsecs for the most powerful sources. Accretion of matter onto
the central super-massive black hole is believed to fuel these jets and power
their emission, with the radio emission being related to the synchrotron
radiation of relativistic electrons in magnetic fields. The origin of the
extended X-ray emission seen in the kiloparsec-scale jets from these sources is
still a matter of debate, although Cen A's X-ray emission has been suggested to
originate in electron synchrotron processes. The other possible explanation is
Inverse Compton (IC) scattering with CMB soft photons. Synchrotron radiation
needs ultra-relativistic electrons ($\sim50$ TeV), and given their short
cooling times, requires some continuous re-acceleration mechanism to be active.
IC scattering, on the other hand, does not require very energetic electrons,
but requires jets that stay highly relativistic on large scales ($\geq$1 Mpc)
and that remain well-aligned with the line of sight. Some recent evidence
disfavours inverse Compton-CMB models, although other evidence seems to be
compatible with them. In principle, the detection of extended gamma-ray
emission, directly probing the presence of ultra-relativistic electrons, could
distinguish between these options, but instruments have hitherto been unable to
resolve the relevant structures. At GeV energies there is also an unusual
spectral hardening in Cen A, whose explanation is unclear. Here we report
observations of Cen A at TeV energies that resolve its large-scale jet. We
interpret the data as evidence for the acceleration of ultra-relativistic
electrons in the jet, and favour the synchrotron explanation for the X-rays.

sequence modeling. However, computing the attention matrix, which is their key
component, has quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length, thus
making them prohibitively expensive for large sequences. To address this, we
propose clustered attention, which instead of computing the attention for every
query, groups queries into clusters and computes attention just for the
centroids. To further improve this approximation, we use the computed clusters
to identify the keys with the highest attention per query and compute the exact
key/query dot products. This results in a model with linear complexity with
respect to the sequence length for a fixed number of clusters. We evaluate our
approach on two automatic speech recognition datasets and show that our model
consistently outperforms vanilla transformers for a given computational budget.
Finally, we demonstrate that our model can approximate arbitrarily complex
attention distributions with a minimal number of clusters by approximating a
pretrained BERT model on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks with only 25 clusters and no

considering the entanglement between topological and temporal link patterns.
Here we propose an entropy-rate based framework, based on combined

demonstrating that it indeed captures the intrinsic topological-temporal

apply our framework on 18 real networks of different types and determine their

the following questions: Can we measure the multiple dimensions of high school
student's learning engagement including emotional, behavioural and cognitive
engagement with sensing data in the wild? Can we derive the activity,
physiological, and environmental factors contributing to the different
dimensions of student engagement? If yes, which sensors are the most useful in

difficult to handle new users on-the-fly. In this paper, we propose an

factorizes a group of key users' rating matrix to obtain meta latents. The
second model resorts to attention-based structure learning that estimates
hidden relations from query to key users and learns to leverage meta latents to
inductively compute embeddings for query users via neural message passing. Our
model enables inductive representation learning for users and meanwhile
guarantees equivalent representation capacity as matrix factorization.

non-convexity introduced by narrow passages. We address this shortcoming by
grounding the solution in differential geometry. We demonstrate through a

modeling explicitly the underlying Riemannian manifold leads to an efficient
interior-point non-linear programming solution.

  generation expansion planning",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On the path towards power systems with high renewable penetrations and
ultimately carbon-neutral, more and more synchronous generation is being
displaced by variable renewable generation that does not currently provide
system inertia nor reactive power support. This could create serious issues of
power system stability in the near future, and countries with high renewable
penetrations such as Ireland are already facing these challenges. Therefore,
this paper aims at answering the questions of whether and how explicitly
including inertia and reactive power constraints in generation expansion
planning would affect the optimal capacity mix of the power system of the
future. Towards this end, we propose the novel Low-carbon Expansion Generation
Optimization (LEGO) model, which explicitly accounts for: unit commitment
constraints, Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) inertia requirements and
virtual inertia provision, and, a second-order cone programming (SOCP)
approximation of the AC power flow, accounting for reactive power constraints.
An illustrative case study underlines that disregarding inertia and reactive
power constraints in generation expansion planning can result in additional
system cost, system infeasibilities, a distortion of optimal resource
allocation and inability to reach established policy goals.

interest to this end is the recently introduced uncrowded hypervolume (UHV)
indicator, which takes into account dominated solutions. In this work, we show
that the gradient of the UHV can often be computed, which allows for a direct
application of gradient ascent algorithms. We compare this new approach with
two EAs for UHV optimization as well as with one gradient-based algorithm for
optimizing the well-established hypervolume. On several bi-objective
benchmarks, we find that gradient-based algorithms outperform the tested EAs by
obtaining a better hypervolume with fewer evaluations whenever exact gradients
of the multiple objective functions are available and in case of small
evaluation budgets. For larger budgets, however, EAs perform similarly or
better. We further find that, when finite differences are used to approximate
the gradients of the multiple objectives, our new gradient-based algorithm is
still competitive with EAs in most considered benchmarks. Implementations are

is crucial for providing quality care and for enabling a larger spectrum of
health services. Health data sharing is dependent on obtaining individual
consent which, in turn, is hindered by a lack of resources. To this extend,
blockchain-based platforms facilitate data sharing by inherently creating a
trusted distributed network of users. These users are enabled to share their
data without depending on the time and resources of specific players (such as
the health services). In blockchain-based platforms, data governance mechanisms
become very important due to the need to specify and monitor data sharing and
data use conditions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based data sharing
consent model for access control over individual health data. We use smart
contracts to dynamically represent the individual consent over health data and
to enable data requesters to search and access them. The dynamic consent model
extends upon two ontologies: the Data Use Ontology (DUO) which models the
individual consent of users and the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix
(ADA-M) which describes queries from data requesters. We deploy the model on
Ethereum blockchain and evaluate different data sharing scenarios. The
contribution of this paper is to create an individual consent model for health
data sharing platforms. Such a model guarantees that individual consent is
respected and that there is accountability for all the participants in the data
sharing platform. The evaluation of our solution indicates that such a data
sharing model provides a flexible approach to decide how the data is used by
data requesters. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model is
efficient and adapts to personalized access control policies in data sharing.

operator in color space. Specializing our general gauge theory result to U(1),
we obtain the full QED four-loop angle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension.
While more complicated functions appear at intermediate steps, the analytic
answer depends only on multiple polylogarithms with singularities at fourth
roots of unity. It can be written in terms of four rational structures, and
contains functions of up to maximal transcendental weight seven. Despite this
complexity, we find that numerically the answer is tantalizingly close to the
appropriately rescaled one-loop formula, over most of the kinematic range. We
take several limits of our analytic result, which serves as a check and allows
us to obtain new, power-suppressed terms. In the anti-parallel lines limit,
which corresponds to production of two massive particles at threshold, we find
that the subleading power correction vanishes. Finally, we compute the quartic

results on the time dependence of average mass of the clusters and that of
average kinetic energy, obtained via event driven molecular dynamics
simulations, for a wide range of values for the coefficient of restitution

is independent of $e$, for uniform definition of cluster, onset of which has a
different $e$-dependence than the onset of above mentioned crossover. In other
words, not only the exponent but also the amplitude of the power-law growth,
which is widely believed to be the form of the evolution, is at the most very
weakly sensitive to the choice of $e$. While it is tempting to attribute this
fact to the similar feature in the decay of energy, we caution that our current

relevant features. However, it remains unclear whether these properties can
translate into real algorithmic advantages for artificial agents, especially in
dynamic environments. We design a model incorporating a self-attention
mechanism that implements task-state representations in semantic feature-space,
and test it on a battery of Atari games. To evaluate the agent's selective
properties, we add a large volume of task-irrelevant features to observations.
In line with neuroscience predictions, self-attention leads to increased
robustness to noise compared to benchmark models. Strikingly, this
self-attention mechanism is general enough, such that it can be naturally
extended to implement a transient working-memory, able to solve a partially
observable maze task. Lastly, we highlight the predictive quality of attended
stimuli. Because we use semantic observations, we can uncover not only which
features the agent elects to base decisions on, but also how it chooses to
compile more complex, relational features from simpler ones. These results
formally illustrate the benefits of attention in deep RL and provide evidence
for the interpretability of self-attention mechanisms.

analyzing functional units.~First, due to the complex and convoluted nature of
tongue structure and function, it is of great importance to develop a method
that can accurately decode complex muscle coordination patterns during speech.
Second, it is challenging to keep identified functional units across subjects
comparable due to their substantial variability. In this work, to address these
challenges, we develop a new deep learning framework to identify common and
subject-specific functional units of tongue motion during speech.~Our framework
hinges on joint deep graph-regularized sparse non-negative matrix factorization
(NMF) using motion quantities derived from displacements by tagged Magnetic
Resonance Imaging. More specifically, we transform NMF with sparse and graph
regularizations into modular architectures akin to deep neural networks by
means of unfolding the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm to learn
interpretable building blocks and associated weighting map. We then apply
spectral clustering to common and subject-specific weighting maps from which we
jointly determine the common and subject-specific functional units. Experiments
carried out with simulated datasets show that the proposed method achieved on
par or better clustering performance over the comparison methods. Experiments
carried out with in vivo tongue motion data show that the proposed method can
determine the common and subject-specific functional units with increased

cosmology, building on robust results regarding anti-de Sitter black holes

special emphasis on boundary conditions and integration contours. The
Hawking-Page transition is recovered and we find that below the minimum

finite distance, additional saddle points contribute to the partition function,

the no-boundary proposal in cosmology, because the anti-de Sitter calculation
can be brought into one-to-one correspondence with a path integral for de

(ZSL) recently. However, the underlying drawbacks of GANs and VAEs (e.g., the
hardness of training with ZSL-oriented regularizers and the limited generation
quality) hinder the existing generative ZSL models from fully bypassing the
seen-unseen bias. To tackle the above limitations, for the first time, this
work incorporates a new family of generative models (i.e., flow-based models)
into ZSL. The proposed Invertible Zero-shot Flow (IZF) learns factorized data
embeddings (i.e., the semantic factors and the non-semantic ones) with the
forward pass of an invertible flow network, while the reverse pass generates
data samples. This procedure theoretically extends conventional generative
flows to a factorized conditional scheme. To explicitly solve the bias problem,
our model enlarges the seen-unseen distributional discrepancy based on negative
sample-based distance measurement. Notably, IZF works flexibly with either a
naive Bayesian classifier or a held-out trainable one for zero-shot
recognition. Experiments on widely-adopted ZSL benchmarks demonstrate the
significant performance gain of IZF over existing methods, in both classic and

Stokes parameters associated to the magnetic part of the valley-Hall kink

films has attracted much attention, because their crystalline and electronic
structures are similar to high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. The upper
critical field can provide much information on superconductivity, but detailed
experimental data are still lacking in these films. Here we present temperature
and angle dependence of resistivity measured under different magnetic fields
($H$) in Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_{2}$ thin films. The onset superconducting
transition occurs at about 16.2 K at 0 T. Temperature dependent upper critical
fields determined by using a criterion very close to the onset transition show
a clear negative curvature near the critical transition temperature, which is
explained as the consequence of the paramagnetically limited effect on
superconductivity. The temperature dependent anisotropy of the upper critical
field is obtained from resistivity data, which yields a value decreasing from 3
to 1.2 with lowering temperature. This can be explained by a variable
contribution from the orbital limit effect on upper critical field. The angle
dependent resistivity at a fixed temperature and different magnetic fields
cannot be scaled to one curve, which deviates from the prediction of the
anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory. However, at low temperatures, the increased
resistivity by magnetic field can be scaled by the parameter $H^\beta
|\cos\theta|$ ($1<\beta<6$) with $\theta$ the angle enclosed between $c$-axis
and the applied magnetic field. As the first detailed study on the upper
critical field of the nickelate thin films, our results clearly indicate a
small anisotropy and paramagnetically limited effect of superconductivity in
nickelate superconductors.

state of this magnet turns out to be nonmagnetic singlet separated from the
excited triplet states by an energy gap. Low-temperature spin dynamics of the
collective paramagnets with gapped excitations spectrum (or spin-gap magnets)
can be described in terms of a dilute gas of the triplet excitations. Applied
magnetic field can suppress the energy gap, resulting in the formation of the
gapless spin-liquid state or even leading to the unusual phenomenon of
field-induced antiferromagnetic order. Introduction of defects in the
crystallographic structure of the spin-gap magnet can result either in the
formation of multi-spin paramagnetic center or in the formation of randomly

ability to coordinate between their multiple interacting components. Yet,
strikingly, real-world networks seem random and highly irregular, apparently
lacking any design for stability. What then are the naturally emerging
organizing principles of complex-system stability? Encoded within the system's
stability matrix, the Jacobian, the answer is obscured by the scale and
diversity of the relevant systems, their broad parameter space, and their
nonlinear interaction mechanisms. To make advances, here we uncover emergent
patterns in the structure of the Jacobian, rooted in the interplay between the
network topology and the system's intrinsic nonlinear dynamics. These patterns
help us analytically identify the few relevant control parameters that
determine a system's dynamic stability. Complex systems, we find, exhibit
discrete stability classes, from asymptotically unstable, where stability is
unattainable, to sensitive, in which stability abides within a bounded range of
the system's parameters. Most crucially, alongside these two classes, we
uncover a third class, asymptotically stable, in which a sufficiently large and
heterogeneous network acquires a guaranteed stability, independent of
parameters, and therefore insensitive to external perturbation. Hence, two of
the most ubiquitous characteristics of real-world networks - scale and
heterogeneity - emerge as natural organizing principles to ensure stability in
the face of changing environmental conditions.

transverse DWs, the other typical DW structure in soft tracks, propagate only
if the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is present. The SOT drive can
add to, and be more efficient than, spin-transfer torque (STT), and so may
greatly benefit applications that require in-plane DWs. Our analysis based on
the Thiele equation shows that the driving force arises from a cycloidal
distortion of the DW structure caused by geometrical confinement or DMI. This
distortion is higher, and the SOT more efficient, in narrower, thinner tracks.
These results show that the effects of SOT cannot be understood by simply
considering the effective field at the center of the structure, an ill-founded
but often-used estimation. We also show that the relative magnitude of STT and
DL SOT can be determined by comparing the motion of different vortex DW
structures in the same track.

allows one to obtain a nonlinear change of coordinates for expressing the
reduced-order dynamics in an invariant-based span of the phase space. The
second method is the modal derivative (MD) approach, and more specifically the
quadratic manifold defined in order to derive a second-order nonlinear change
of coordinates. Both methods share a common point of view, willing to introduce
a nonlinear mapping to better define a reduced order model that could take more
properly into account the nonlinear restoring forces. However the calculation
methods are different and the quadratic manifold approach has not the
invariance property embedded in its definition. Modal derivatives and static
modal derivatives are investigated, and their distinctive features in the
treatment of the quadratic nonlinearity is underlined. Assuming a slow/fast
decomposition allows understanding how the three methods tend to share
equivalent properties. While they give proper estimations for flat symmetric
structures having a specific shape of nonlinearities and a clear slow/fast
decomposition between flexural and in-plane modes, the treatment of the
quadratic nonlinearity makes the predictions different in the case of curved
structures such as arches and shells. In the more general case, normal form
approach appears preferable since it allows correct predictions of a number of
important nonlinear features, including for example the hardening/softening
behaviour, whatever the relationships between slave and master coordinates are.

plane graphs has received considerable attention in recent years. In
particular, given a graph $G$, a connected subgraph $H$ of $G$ and a drawing
$\mathcal{H}$ of $H$, the extension problem asks whether $\mathcal{H}$ can be
extended into a drawing of $G$ while maintaining some desired property of the
drawing (e.g., planarity).
  In their breakthrough result, Angelini et al. [ACM TALG 2015] showed that the
extension problem is polynomial-time solvable when the aim is to preserve
planarity. Very recently we considered this problem for partial 1-planar

have at most one crossing. The most important question identified and left open

can be obtained from $G$ by deleting a bounded number of vertices and edges. In
this work, we answer this question positively by providing a constructive
polynomial-time decision algorithm.

approximately constant on variation of an input $\mathcal{I}$. Homeostasis
occurs frequently in biochemical networks and in other networks of interacting
elements where mathematical models are based on differential equations
associated to the network. These networks can be abstracted as digraphs
$\mathcal{G}$ with a distinguished input node $\iota$, a different
distinguished output node $o$, and a number of regulatory nodes
$\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_n$. In these models the input-output map $x_o(\mathcal{I})$
is defined by a stable equilibrium $X_0$ at $\mathcal{I}_0$. Stability implies
that there is a stable equilibrium $X(\mathcal{I})$ for each $\mathcal{I}$ near
$\mathcal{I}_0$ and infinitesimal homeostasis occurs at $\mathcal{I}_0$ when
$(dx_o/d\mathcal{I})(\mathcal{I}_0) = 0$. We show that there is an
$(n+1)\times(n+1)$ homeostasis matrix $H(\mathcal{I})$ for which
$dx_o/d\mathcal{I} = 0$ if and only if $\det(H) = 0$. We note that the entries
in $H$ are linearized couplings and $\det(H)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of
degree $n+1$ in these entries. We use combinatorial matrix theory to factor the
polynomial $\det(H)$ and thereby determine a menu of different types of
possible homeostasis associated with each digraph $\mathcal{G}$. Specifically,
we prove that each factor corresponds to a subnetwork of $\mathcal{G}$. The
factors divide into two combinatorially defined classes: structural and
appendage. Structural factors correspond to feedforward motifs and appendage
factors correspond to feedback motifs. Finally, we discover an algorithm for
determining the homeostasis subnetwork motif corresponding to each factor of
$\det(H)$ without performing numerical simulations on model equations. The
algorithm allows us to classify low degree factors of $\det(H)$.

subdwarf transferring mass to a white dwarf (WD) companion. This 56 minute
binary was discovered using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility.
Spectroscopic observations reveal an He-sdOB star with an effective temperature
of $T_{\rm eff}=33,700\pm1000$ K and a surface gravity of $log(g)=5.54\pm0.11$.
The GTC+HiPERCAM light curve is dominated by the ellipsoidal deformation of the
He-sdOB star and shows an eclipse of the He-sdOB by an accretion disk as well
as a weak eclipse of the WD. We infer a He-sdOB mass of $M_{\rm
sdOB}=0.41\pm0.04$ M$_\odot$ and a WD mass of $M_{\rm WD}=0.68\pm0.05$
M$_\odot$. The weak eclipses imply a WD black-body temperature of
$63,000\pm10,000$ K and a radius $R_{\rm WD}=0.0148\pm0.0020$ M$_\odot$ as
expected for a WD of such high temperature.
  The He-sdOB star is likely undergoing hydrogen shell burning and will
continue transferring mass for $\approx1$ Myrs at a rate of $10^{-9} M_\odot
{\rm yr}^{-1}$ which is consistent with the high WD temperature. The hot
subdwarf will then turn into a WD and the system will merge in $\approx30$
Myrs. We suggest that Galactic reddening could bias discoveries towards
preferentially finding Roche lobe-filling systems during the short-lived shell
burning phase. Studies using reddening corrected samples should reveal a large
population of helium core-burning hot subdwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}\approx25,000$
K in binaries of 60-90 minutes with WDs. Though not yet in contact, these
binaries would eventually come into contact through gravitational wave emission
and explode as a sub-luminous thermonuclear supernova or evolve into a massive
single WD.

the problem, we develop a dynamic control algorithm using the Lyapunov

According to the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method, to solve the main problem
we need to solve an optimization problem in each time slot which is a mixed

via planetesimals from the belt. The study is accomplished by numerical
simulations of dynamical evolution of a hypothetical planetesimal belt. Our
results show that the inner part of the belt is dynamically unstable and
planetesimals located in this region are quickly scattered away, with many of
them entering the region around the planets. The main dynamical mechanism
responsible for the instability are close encounters with the outermost planet
Trappist-1h. A low-order mean-motion resonance 2:3 with Trappist-1h, located in
the same region, also contributes to the objects transport. In our nominal
model, the planets have received non-negligible amount of water, with the
smallest amount of $15$\% of the current Earth's water amount (EWA) being
delivered to the planet 1b, while the planets Trappist-1e and Trappist-1g have
received more than $60$\% of the EWA. We have found that while the estimated
efficiency of water transport to the planets is robust, the amount of water
delivered to each planet may vary significantly depending on the initial masses
and orbits of the planets. The estimated dynamical ""half-lives"" have shown that
the impactors' source region should be emptied in less then 1~Myr. Therefore,
the obtained results suggest that transport of planetesimals through the system

of sensory inputs, it constructs a symbolic causal theory that both explains
the sensory sequence and also satisfies a set of unity conditions. The unity
conditions insist that the constituents of the theory - objects, properties,
and laws - must be integrated into a coherent whole. Once a theory has been
constructed, it can be applied to predict future sensor readings, retrodict
earlier readings, or impute missing readings.
  In this paper, we evaluate the Apperception Engine in a diverse variety of
domains, including cellular automata, rhythms and simple nursery tunes,
multi-modal binding problems, occlusion tasks, and sequence induction
intelligence tests. In each domain, we test our engine's ability to predict
future sensor values, retrodict earlier sensor values, and impute missing
sensory data. The engine performs well in all these domains, significantly
outperforming neural net baselines and state of the art inductive logic
programming systems. These results are significant because neural nets
typically struggle to solve the binding problem (where information from
different modalities must somehow be combined together into different aspects
of one unified object) and fail to solve occlusion tasks (in which objects are
sometimes visible and sometimes obscured from view). We note in particular that
in the sequence induction intelligence tests, our system achieved human-level
performance. This is notable because our system is not a bespoke system
designed specifically to solve intelligence tests, but a general-purpose system
that was designed to make sense of any sensory sequence.

this paper studies the uplink (UL) performance of LIS-based communication with
matched filtering. We first investigate the new properties introduced by LIS.
In particular, the array gain, spatial resolution, and the capability of
interference suppression are theoretically presented and characterized. Then,
we study two possible LIS system layouts in terms of UL, i.e., centralized LIS
(C-LIS) and distributed LIS (D-LIS). Our analysis showcases that a centralized
system has strong capability of interference suppression; in fact, interference
can nearly be eliminated if the surface area is sufficient large or the
frequency band is sufficient high. For D-LIS, we propose a series of resource
allocation algorithms, including user association scheme, orientation control,
and power control, to extend the coverage area of a distributed system.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the
system performance, and even more importantly, we observe that D-LIS
outperforms CLIS in microwave bands, while C-LIS is superior to D-LIS in mmWave
bands. These observations serve as useful guidelines for practical LIS

communication channels in both indoor and outdoor environments. The design of
lattices for BF channels offers a challenging problem, which differs greatly
from its counterparts like AWGN channels. Recently, the original binary
Construction A for lattices, due to Forney, has been generalized to a lattice
construction from totally real and complex multiplication (CM) fields. This
generalized algebraic Construction A of lattices provides signal space
diversity, intrinsically, which is the main requirement for the signal sets
designed for fading channels. In this paper, we construct full-diversity
algebraic lattices for BF channels using Construction A over totally real
number fields. We propose two new decoding methods for these lattices which
have complexity that grows linearly in the dimension of the lattice. The first
decoder is proposed for generalized Construction A lattices with a binary LDPC
code as underlying code. This decoding method contains iterative and
non-iterative phases. In order to implement the iterative phase, we propose the
definition of a parity-check matrix and Tanner graph for Construction A
lattices. We also prove that using an underlying LDPC code that achieves the
outage probability limit over one-BF channel, the constructed algebraic LDPC
lattices together with the proposed decoding method admit diversity order n.
Then, we modify the proposed algorithm by removing its iterative phase which
enables full-diversity practical decoding of all generalized Construction A
lattices without any assumption about their underlying code. We provide some
instances showing that algebraic Construction A lattices obtained from binary
codes outperform the ones based on non-binary codes in BF channels. We
generalize algebraic Construction A lattices over a wider family of number
fields namely monogenic number fields.

large-scale social choice such as mitigating climate change, involve not only
many agents whose decisions interact in complicated ways, but also various
forms of uncertainty, including quantifiable risk and unquantifiable ambiguity.
In such problems, an assessment of individual and groupwise moral
responsibility for ethically undesired outcomes or their responsibility to
avoid such is challenging and prone to the risk of under- or overdetermination
of responsibility. In contrast to existing approaches based on strict causation
or certain deontic logics that focus on a binary classification of
`responsible' vs `not responsible', we here present several different
quantitative responsibility metrics that assess responsibility degrees in units
of probability. For this, we use a framework based on an adapted version of
extensive-form game trees and an axiomatic approach that specifies a number of
potentially desirable properties of such metrics, and then test the developed
candidate metrics by their application to a number of paradigmatic social
choice situations. We find that while most properties one might desire of such
responsibility metrics can be fulfilled by some variant, an optimal metric that
clearly outperforms others has yet to be found.

However, when the network structure has a certain type of symmetry, optimal

operation cannot overcome this problem. In this paper proposes a method to
avoid trapping of the local minima by applying a control input in a pump rate

Lie algebras such that their universal enveloping algebra satisfies a
non-trivial identical relation. Next, Passman and Petrogradsky solved a similar
problem in case of restricted enveloping algebras. Third, Farkas started to
study identical relations in Poisson algebras. On the other hand, Shestakov
proved that the symmetric algebra $S(L)$ of an arbitrary Lie algebra $L$
satisfies the identity $\{x,\{y,z\}\}\equiv 0$ if, and only if, $L$ is abelian.
We survey further results on existence of identical relations in (truncated)
Poisson symmetric algebras of Lie algebras. In particular, we report on recent
results on (strong) Lie nilpotency and (strong) solvability of (truncated)
Poisson symmetric algebras and related nilpotency classes. Also, we discuss

the related (dark) mass density noise into the Madelung quantum hydrodynamic
model. The paper shows that the classical dynamics can spontaneously emerge on
the cosmological scale allowing the realization of the classical
system-environment super system. The work shows that the dark matter-induced
noise is not spatially white and owns a well defined correlation function with
the intrinsic vacuum physical length given by the De Broglie one. The resulting
model, in the case of microscopic systems, whose dimension is much smaller than
the De Broglie length, leads to the Langevin-Schrodinger equation whose
friction coefficient is not constant. The derivation puts in evidence the range
of application of the Langevin-Schrodinger equation and the approximations
inherent to its foundation. The work shows that the classical physics can be
achieved in a description whose length scale is much bigger both than the De
Broglie length and the quantum potential range of interaction. The model shows
that the quantum-to-classical transition is not possible in linear systems, and
defines the long-distance characteristics as well as the range of interaction
of the non-local quantum potential in order to have a coarse-grained
large-scale classical phase. The theory also shows that the process of
measurement (by a large-scale classical observer) satisfies the minimum
uncertainty conditions if interactions and information do not travel faster
than the light speed, reconciling the quantum entanglement with the
relativistic macroscopic locality.

modeling, analysis and control. Understanding the structure and dynamics of
such networks entails creating a smaller representative network that preserves
its relevant topological and dynamical properties. While modern machine
learning methods have enabled identification of governing laws for complex
dynamical systems, their inability to produce white-box models with sufficient
physical interpretation renders such methods undesirable to domain experts. In
this paper, we introduce a hybrid black-box, white-box approach for the sparse
identification of the governing laws for complex, highly coupled dynamical
systems with particular emphasis on finding the influential reactions in
chemical reaction networks for combustion applications, using a data-driven
sparse-learning technique. The proposed approach identifies a set of
influential reactions using species concentrations and reaction rates,with
minimal computational cost without requiring additional data or simulations.
The new approach is applied to analyze the combustion chemistry of H2 and C3H8
in a constant-volume homogeneous reactor. The influential reactions determined
by the sparse-learning method are consistent with the current kinetics
knowledge of chemical mechanisms. Additionally, we show that a reduced version
of the parent mechanism can be generated as a combination of the significantly
reduced influential reactions identified at different times and conditions and
that for both H2 and C3H8 fuel, the reduced mechanisms perform closely to the
parent mechanisms as a function of the ignition delay time over a wide range of
conditions. Our results demonstrate the potential of the sparse-learning
approach as an effective and efficient tool for dynamical system analysis and
reduction. The uniqueness of this approach as applied to combustion systems
lies in the ability to identify influential reactions in specified conditions
and times during the evolution of the combustion process. This ability is of
great interest to understand chemical reaction systems.
