  arXiv:1507.01709",,,,"math.DS math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the asymptotic dynamics of the skew-product
semiflow generated by the following time almost-periodically forced scalar
reaction-diffusion equation \begin{equation}\label{eq0}
u_{t}=u_{xx}+f(t,u,u_{x}),\,\,t>0,\, 0<x<L \end{equation} with periodic
boundary condition \begin{equation} \label{bdc1} u(t,0)=u(t,L),\quad
u_x(t,0)=u_x(t,L), \end{equation} where $f$ is uniformly almost periodic in
$t$. In particular, we study the topological structure of the limit sets of the
skew-product semiflow. It is proved that any compact minimal invariant set
(throughout this paper, we refer to it as a minimal set) can be residually
embedded into an invariant set of some almost automorphically-forced flow on a
circle $S^1=\mathbb{R}/L\mathbb{Z}$. Particularly, if $f(t,u,p)=f(t,u,-p)$,
then the flow on a minimal set topologically conjugates to an almost
periodically-forced minimal flow on $\mathbb{R}$. Moreover, it is proved that
the $\omega$-limit set of any bounded orbit contains at most two minimal sets
that cannot be obtained from each other by phase translation.
  In addition, we further consider the asymptotic dynamics of the skew-product
semiflow generated by \eqref{eq0} with Neumann boundary condition
  \begin{equation*}
  \label{bcd2}
  u_x(t,0)=u_x(t,L)=0,
  \end{equation*}
  or Dirichlet boundary condition
  \begin{equation*}\label{bdc3}
  u(t,0)=u(t,L)=0.
  \end{equation*} Under certain direct assumptions on $f$, it is proved in this
paper that the flow on any minimal set of \eqref{eq0}, with Neumann boundary
condition or Dirichlet boundary condition, topologically conjugates to an
almost periodically-forced minimal flow on $\mathbb{R}$.
  Finally, a counterexample is given to show that even for quasi-periodic
equations, the results we obtain here cannot be further improved in general.

is found that the stability of symmetric QDs in such non-Hermitian system
depends critically on the competition of gain and loss $\gamma$, inter-core
coupling $\kappa$, and OL potential. In the absence of OL potential, the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QDs are unstable against symmetry-breaking
perturbations with the increase of the total condensate norm $N$, and they
retrieve the stability at larger $N$, in the weakly-coupled regime. As
expected, the stable region of the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QDs shrinks when
$\gamma$ increases, i.e., the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is prone to break the
stability of QDs. There is a critical value of $\kappa$ beyond which the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QDs are entirely stable in the unbroken
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase. In the presence of OL potential, the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric on-site QDs are still stable for relatively small and
large values of $N$. Nevertheless, it is demonstrated that the OL potential can
assist stabilization of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric on-site QDs for some moderate
values of $N$. On the other hand, it is worth noting that the relatively small
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric off-site QDs are unstable, and only the relatively
large ones are stable. Furthermore, collisions between stable
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QDs are considered too. It is revealed that the slowly
moving $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QDs tend to merge into breathers, while the
fast-moving ones display quasi-elastic collision and suffer fragmentation for
small and large values of $N$, respectively.

target with a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ inclined at a small angle, $ \alpha \ll
1$ (in radians), to the target. Adiabatic electrons are assumed, requiring
$\alpha\gg\sqrt{Zm_{\rm e}/m_{\rm i}} $ where $m_{\rm e}$ and $m_{\rm i}$ are
the electron and ion mass respectively, and $Z$ is the charge state of the ion.
An electric field $\vec{E}$ is present to repel electrons, and so the
characteristic size of the electrostatic potential $\phi$ is set by the
electron temperature $T_{\rm e}$, $e\phi \sim T_{\rm e}$, where $e$ is the
proton charge. An asymptotic scale separation between the Debye length,
$\lambda_{\rm D}=\sqrt{\epsilon_0 T_{\text{e}}/e^2 n_{\text{e}}}$, the ion
sound gyroradius $\rho_{\rm s}=\sqrt{ m_{\rm i}(ZT_{\rm e}+T_{\rm i})}/(ZeB)$,
and the size of the collisional region $d_{\rm c} = \alpha \lambda_{\rm mfp}$
is assumed, $\lambda_{\rm D} \ll \rho_{\rm s} \ll d_{\rm c}$. Here $\epsilon_0$
is the permittivity of free space, $n_{\rm e}$ is the electron density, $T_{\rm
i}$ is the ion temperature, $B= |\vec{B}|$ and $\lambda_{\rm mfp}$ is the
collisional mean free path of an ion. The form of the ion distribution function
is assumed at distances $x$ from the wall such that $\rho_{\rm s} \ll x \ll
d_{\rm c}$. A self-consistent solution of $\phi (x)$ is required to solve for
the ion trajectories and for the ion distribution function at the target. The
model presented here allows to bypass the numerical solution of $\phi (x)$ and
results in an analytical expression for the ion distribution function at the
target. It assumes that $\tau=T_{\rm i}/(ZT_{\rm e})\gg 1$, and ignores the
electric force on the ion trajectory until close to the target. For $\tau
\gtrsim 1$, the model provides a fast approximation to energy-angle
distributions of ions at the target. These can be used to make sputtering
predictions.

evolution of the large-system limit of the empirical age measure in the mean

fire model is a random graph process on $n$ vertices, whose dynamics combine
the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi dynamics with a Poisson rain of lightning strikes. All
edges in any connected component are deleted as soon as any of its vertices is
struck by lightning. Each vertex has an age, which increases at rate $1$ but is
reset to $0$ each time it burns. We consider the asymptotic lightning regime in
which the model displays self-organized criticality. Crane, R\'ath and Yeo
(arXiv:1811.07981) take the initial state to be an inhomogeneous random graph
whose edge probabilities depend on the ages of the vertices. They show that as
$n \to \infty$ the empirical age distribution converges as a process to the
solution of a deterministic autonomous differential equation. It is a nonlinear
age-dependent population dynamics model whose age-specific mortality modulus
involves the leading eigenfunction of the branching operator of an associated
multitype branching process. The differential equation displays self-organized
criticality in the sense that the leading eigenvalue of the branching operator
is held at $1$ without this being imposed as a boundary condition.

some vertex in $G$ is defined as $d(w,e)=\min(d(w,u),d(w,v))$. Now we can say
that vertex $w \in V$ resolves two elements $x,y \in V \cup E$ if $d(w,x) \neq
d(w,y)$. The mixed resolving set is a set of vertices $S$, $S\subseteq V$ if
and only if any two elements of $E \cup V$ are resolved by some element of $S$.
A minimal resolving set related to inclusion is called mixed resolving basis,
and its cardinality is called the mixed metric dimension of a graph $G$.
  This graph invariant is recently introduced and it is of interest to find its
general properties and determine its values for various classes of graphs.
Since the problem of finding mixed metric dimension is a minimization problem,
of interest is also to find lower bounds of good quality. This paper will
introduce three new general lower bounds. The exact values of mixed metric
dimension for torus graph is determined using one of these lower bounds.
Finally, the comparison between new lower bounds and those known in the
literature will be presented on two groups of instances:
  - all 21 conected graphs of order 5;
  - selected 12 well-known graphs with order from 10 up to 36.

methods to determine the nature of the compact object. Color-Color-Intensity
diagrams have been suggested as a means of distinguishing between systems
containing black holes from those containing neutron stars. However, this
technique has been verified with data from only one instrument (RXTE/ASM) with
a single set of X-ray colors defined using data available only in
pre-determined energy bands. We test a selection of X-ray colors with a more
sensitive instrument to determine the reliability of this method. We use data
from the MAXI Gas Slit Camera, which allows users to specify energy-bands. We
test X-ray colors that have been previously defined in the literature as well
as ones that we define specifically in this paper. A representative set of
systems are used to construct Color-Color-Intensity diagrams in each set of
colors to determine which are best for separating different classes. For
studying individual sources certain bands are more effective than others. For a
specified energy range, the separation of soft states in black hole binaries
was possible only where both soft and hard colors included information from the
lowest energy band. We confirm that Color-Color-Intensity diagrams can
distinguish between systems containing black holes or neutron stars in all
X-ray colors tested; this suggests an universality in the accretion processes
governing these different classes. We suggest possible physical processes
driving different classes of X-ray binaries to different locations in
Color-Color-Intensity diagrams.

  Industrial Wireless Networks","Accepted for publication in IEEE VTC Fall 2020",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has recently attracted significant
attention from both industrial and academic communities. The large bandwidth
availability as well as low interference nature of mmWave spectrum is
particularly attractive for industrial communication. However, inherent
challenges such as coverage and blockage of mmWave communication cause highly
fluctuated channel quality. This paper explores wireless medium access control
(MAC) schedulers for mmWave-based industrial wireless applications. Our
objective is to design a high-performance and enhanced fairness MAC scheduling
algorithm that responds rapidly to channel variations. The key contribution of
our work is a method to modify the standard proportional fair (SPF) scheduler.
It introduces more flexibility and dynamic properties. Compared to the SPF, our
enhanced proportional fair (EPF) scheduler not only improves the priority for
users in poor channel conditions but also accelerates the reaction time in
fluctuated channel conditions. By providing higher fairness for all users and
enhancing system robustness, it particularly adapts to the scatter-rich
industrial mmWave communication environment. Through extensive performance
evaluation based on the widely accepted network simulator (ns-3), we show that
the new scheduler achieves better performance in terms of delivering ultra-low
latency and reliable services over mmWave-based industrial communication.

the infinite dimensional Langevin dynamics. This enables us to analyze narrow
and wide networks in a unifying manner. Moreover, we give generalization gap
and excess risk bounds for the solution obtained by the dynamics. The excess
risk bound achieves the so-called fast learning rate. In particular, we show an
exponential convergence for a classification problem and a minimax optimal rate
for a regression problem.

that suprathermal electron PADs evolve from an almost isotropic outside the

transport becomes chaotic and non-adiabatic when electron gyroradius becomes
comparable to the size of the magnetic field line curvature, which determines
the upper energy limit of the flux variation. This study is based on Rosetta

detector to detect no object, fake objects, or mislabeled objects. With object
detection being used pervasively in many security-critical applications, such
as autonomous vehicles and smart cities, we argue that a holistic approach for
an in-depth understanding of adversarial attacks and vulnerabilities of deep

develop robust defense mechanisms. This paper presents a framework for
analyzing and evaluating vulnerabilities of the state-of-the-art object
detectors under an adversarial lens, aiming to analyze and demystify the attack
strategies, adverse effects, and costs, as well as the cross-model and
cross-resolution transferability of attacks. Using a set of quantitative
metrics, extensive experiments are performed on six representative deep object
detectors from three popular families (YOLOv3, SSD, and Faster R-CNN) with two
benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC and MS COCO). We demonstrate that the proposed
framework can serve as a methodical benchmark for analyzing adversarial
behaviors and risks in real-time object detection systems. We conjecture that
this framework can also serve as a tool to assess the security risks and the
adversarial robustness of deep object detectors to be deployed in real-world
applications.

causes, dietary intake, has proven particularly challenging to measure and
track. Current behavioral science suggests that family eating dynamics (FED)
have high potential to impact child and parent dietary intake, and ultimately
the risk of obesity. Monitoring FED requires information about when and where
eating events are occurring, the presence or absence of family members during
eating events, and some person-level states such as stress, mood, and hunger.
To date, there exists no system for real-time monitoring of FED. This paper
presents MFED, the first of its kind of system for monitoring FED in the wild
in real-time. Smart wearables and Bluetooth beacons are used to monitor and
detect eating activities and the location of the users at home. A smartphone is
used for the Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of a number of behaviors,
states, and situations. While the system itself is novel, we also present a

calculate the free energy per molecule in the micelle with accuracy better than
0.01 kT, which is a serious challenge. The problem could be solved if the
effects of mutual confinement of micelle counterion atmospheres, as well as the
effects of counterion binding, surface curvature and ionic interactions in the
electric double layer (EDL), are accurately described. Theory: The electric
field is calculated using an appropriate cell model, which takes into account
the aforementioned effects. Expressions for the activity coefficients have been
used, which vary across the EDL and describe the electrostatic, hard sphere,
and specific interactions between the ions. New approach for fast numerical
calculation of the electrostatic free energy is developed. Findings: The
numerical results demonstrate the variation of quantities characterizing the
EDL of cylindrical and spherical micelles with the rise of electrolyte
concentration. The effect of activity coefficients leads to higher values of
the free energy per surfactant molecule in the micelle as compared with the
case of neglected ionic interactions. The results are essential for the correct

can be extended to mixed micelles of ionic and nonionic surfactants for

inference' (CHI) framework. We present an implementation of CHI which naturally
mediates the balance between iterative and amortised inference. Using a
didactic experiment, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm operates in a
model-based manner at the onset of learning, before converging to a model-free
algorithm once sufficient data have been collected. We verify the scalability
of our algorithm on a continuous control benchmark, demonstrating that it
outperforms strong model-free and model-based baselines. CHI thus provides a
principled framework for harnessing the sample efficiency of model-based
planning while retaining the asymptotic performance of model-free policy
optimisation.

Indeed, we review evidence demonstrating that commonly used methods, such as

ribosomal proteins (RP) does not necessarily correspond to RP variability. Thus
protein remodeling of ribosomes should be investigated by methods that allow
direct quantification of RPs, ideally of isolated ribosomes. We review such
methods, focusing on mass spectrometry and emphasizing method-specific biases

complementary methods can help reduce the danger of interpreting reproducible

representations for sequential data that captures its implicit spatio-temporal

problem within the context of contrastive representation learning and to that
end propose a novel objective via optimal transport. Specifically, our
formulation seeks a low-dimensional subspace representation of the data that
jointly (i) maximizes the distance of the data (embedded in this subspace) from
an adversarial data distribution under the optimal transport, a.k.a. the
Wasserstein distance, (ii) captures the temporal order, and (iii) minimizes the
data distortion. To generate the adversarial distribution, we propose a novel
framework connecting Wasserstein GANs with a classifier, allowing a principled
mechanism for producing good negative distributions for contrastive learning,
which is currently a challenging problem. Our full objective is cast as a
subspace learning problem on the Grassmann manifold and solved via Riemannian
optimization. To empirically study our formulation, we provide experiments on
the task of human action recognition in video sequences. Our results
demonstrate competitive performance against challenging baselines.

adapted to new, unseen tasks after a few simple gradient updates. Motivated by
this terminology, we propose a novel meta-learning framework in the discrete

leads to (i) a personalized solution for each individual task, and (ii)
significantly reduced computational cost at test time compared to the case
where the solution is fully optimized once the new task is revealed. The
training procedure is performed by solving a challenging discrete optimization

of mankind's modern institutions and or survival of many individuals is at
stake. There is a need for treatments to significantly reduce the morbidity and
mortality of COVID-19. Hence, we delved deep into the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which
is the virus that has caused COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is from the same family as
SARS-CoV in which three small viral RNAs (svRNA) were recently identified;
those svRNAs play a significant role in the virus pathogenesis in mice.
  Contribution: In this paper, we report potential orthologs of those three
svRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Instead of off-the-shelf search and alignment
algorithms, which failed to discover the orthologs, we used a special alignment
scoring that does not penalize C/T and A/G mismatches as much as the other
mutations. RNA bases C and U both can bind to G; similarly, A and G both can
bind to U, hence, our scoring. We also validate this hypothesis using a novel,
independent computational experiment. To validate our results, we confirmed the
discovered orthologs are fully conserved in all the tested publicly available
genomes of various strains of SARS-CoV-2; the loci at which the SARS-CoV-2
orthologs occur are close to the loci at which SARS-CoV svRNAs occur. We also
report potential targets for these svRNAs. We hypothesize that the discovered
orthologs play a role in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore,
antagomir-mediated inhibition of these SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs inhibits COVID-19.

computation for Binary Polynomial Optimization (BPO), which is the problem of
maximizing a given polynomial function over all binary points. In our main
result we provide a novel class of BPO that can be solved efficiently both from
a theoretical and computational perspective. In fact, we give a strongly
polynomial-time algorithm for instances whose corresponding hypergraph is
beta-acyclic. We note that the beta-acyclicity assumption is natural in several
applications including relational database schemes and the lifted multicut

algorithm which is interesting also from a practical viewpoint. This is because
our algorithm is very simple to implement and the running time is a polynomial
of very low degree in the number of nodes and edges of the hypergraph. Our
result completely settles the computational complexity of BPO over acyclic
hypergraphs, since the problem is NP-hard on alpha-acyclic instances. Our
algorithm can also be applied to any general BPO problem that contains
beta-cycles. For these problems, the algorithm returns a smaller instance
together with a rule to extend any optimal solution of the smaller instance to
an optimal solution of the original instance.

study, in detail, the effects of the tunneling parameters, the Coulomb

role in the thermal entanglement and in the correlated coherence of the system.
The results also indicate that the Coulomb potential can be used for
significant enhancement of the thermal entanglement and quantum coherence. One
interesting aspect is that the correlated coherence capture all the thermal
entanglement at low temperatures, i.e, the local coherences are totally
transferred to the thermal entanglement. Finally, we focus on the role played
by thermal entanglement and the correlated coherence responsible for quantum
correlations. We show that in all cases, the correlated coherence is more
robust than the thermal entanglement so that quantum algorithms based only on

results also show that the entanglement can be tuned by varying the Coulomb

density and pressure can be preserved in an efficient way of exploiting the
advantage of discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume (DG/FV) hybrid
computation framework. We thus present an effective and simple method with
great practical significance to maintain the positivity of density and pressure
in solving the reactive Euler equations. The approach is able to maximize the
multiscale capability of the DG method by achieving both positivity-preserving
and oscillation-free solution in the subgrid level. In the designed scheme, a
priori detection and computation with hyperbolic tangent function prevent the
occurrence of negativity in the flux evaluation, while a posteriori detection
and computation with the first-order Godunov scheme guarantee the positivity of
subcell solution. The a priori computation achieves bounded reconstruction and
less oscillatory solution so that the a posteriori computation can be active in
few cells where the extremely complex computation condition appears.
Furthermore, the valuable information from the reconstruction process is
utilized to design the indication strategy that identifies the DG and FV cells,
and the technique of adaptively choosing reconstruction candidates is adopted
to overcome the excessive numerical dissipation in the shock-capturing scheme.
Numerical tests, including demanding examples in stiff detonation simulation,
demonstrate the positivity-preserving, non-oscillatory and subcell resolution
property of the present method.

solve the power allocation problem under fixed phase shifts of the RIS and

nodes in Integrated Circuit (IC) fabrication is constantly exposing new
manufacturability issues. One such issue, stemming from complex interaction
between design and process, is the problem of design hotspots. Such hotspots
are known to vary from design to design and, ideally, should be predicted early
and corrected in the design stage itself, as opposed to relying on the foundry
to develop process fixes for every hotspot, which would be intractable. In the
past, various efforts have been made to address this issue by using a known
database of hotspots as the source of information. The majority of these
efforts use either Machine Learning (ML) or Pattern Matching (PM) techniques to
identify and predict hotspots in new incoming designs. However, almost all of
them suffer from high false-alarm rates, mainly because they are oblivious to
the root causes of hotspots. In this work, we seek to address this limitation
by using a novel database enhancement approach through synthetic pattern
generation based on carefully crafted Design of Experiments (DOEs).
Effectiveness of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art is evaluated
on a 45nm process using industry-standard tools and designs.

data-driven approach to estimate an optimal nodal restoration sequence for
immediate recovery of the infrastructure networks after natural disasters such

optimal restoration strategies for interdependent networks, and employ deep
neural networks to approximate those strategies. Despite the fact that the
underlying problem is NP-complete, the restoration sequences obtained by our
method are observed to be nearly optimal. In addition, by training multiple
models---the so-called estimators---for a variety of resource availability
levels, our proposed method balances a trade-off between resource utilization
and restoration time. Decision-makers can use our trained models to allocate
resources more efficiently after contingencies, and in turn, improve the
community resilience. Besides their predictive power, such trained estimators
unravel the effect of interdependencies among different nodal functionalities
in the restoration strategies. We showcase our methodology by the real-world

a Siamese Neural Network that computes the similarity of the records. Using
data from the Avito Duplicate Advertisements Detection dataset, we train these

advertisements as similar more frequently if their average description is
bigger than 40 words. We conclude that the reason for this is that the longer

who are more prevalent in the dataset. In the end, we also conclude that
further research needs to be done with the Stacked Attention Network, to
further explore the effects of the visual data on the performance of the fusion

events such as black hole mergers or neutron star collisions take place. The
first Gravitational Wave (GW) detection (GW150914) was made by the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo Collaboration on
September 14, 2015. Furthermore, the proof of the existence of GWs had
countless implications from Stellar Evolution to General Relativity.
Gravitational waves detection requires multiple filters and the filtered data
has to be studied intensively to come to conclusions on whether the data is a
just a glitch or an actual gravitational wave detection. However, with the use
of Deep Learning the process is simplified heavily, as it reduces the level of
filtering greatly, and the output is more definitive, even though the model
produces a probabilistic result. Our technique, Deep Learning, utilizes a
different implementation of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network
(CNN). The model is trained by a composite of real LIGO noise, and injections
of GW waveform templates. The CNN effectively uses classification to
differentiate weak GW time series from non-gaussian noise from glitches in the
LIGO data stream. In addition, we are the first study to utilize fine-tuning as
a means to train the model with a second pass of data, while maintaining all
the learned features from the initial training iteration. This enables our
model to have a sensitivity of 100%, higher than all prior studies in this
field, when making real-time detections of GWs at an extremely low
Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), while still being less computationally expensive.
This sensitivity, in part, is also achieved through the use of deep signal
manifolds from both the Hanford and Livingston detectors, which enable the
neural network to be responsive to false positives.

determinants of match outcome. The decision to bat first after winning the toss
is often taken to make the best use of superior pitch conditions and set a big
target for the opponent. However, the opponent may fail to show their natural
batting performance in the second innings due to a number of factors, including
deteriorated pitch conditions and excessive pressure of chasing a high target
score. The advantage of batting first has been highlighted in the literature
and expert opinions, however, the effect of batting and bowling order on match
outcome has not been investigated well enough to recommend a solution to any
potential bias. This study proposes a probability theory-based model to study
venue-specific scoring and chasing characteristics of teams under different
match outcomes. A total of 1117 one-day international matches held in ten
popular venues are analyzed to show substantially high scoring advantage and
likelihood when the winning team bat in the first innings. Results suggest that
the same 'bat-first' winning team is very unlikely to score or chase such a
high score if they were to bat in the second innings. Therefore, the coin toss
decision may favor one team over the other. A Bayesian model is proposed to
revise the target score for each venue such that the winning and scoring
likelihood is equal regardless of the toss decision. The data and source codes
have been shared publicly for future research in creating competitive match
outcomes by eliminating the advantage of batting order in run scoring.

from rewards, it enables fast transfer to new reward functions. However,
learning an accurate Markov Decision Process (MDP) over high-dimensional states
(e.g., raw pixels) is extremely challenging because it requires function
approximation, which leads to compounding errors. Instead, to avoid compounding
errors, we propose learning an abstract MDP over abstract states:
low-dimensional coarse representations of the state (e.g., capturing agent
position, ignoring other objects). We assume access to an abstraction function
that maps the concrete states to abstract states. In our approach, we construct
an abstract MDP, which grows through strategic exploration via planning.
Similar to hierarchical RL approaches, the abstract actions of the abstract MDP
are backed by learned subpolicies that navigate between abstract states. Our
approach achieves strong results on three of the hardest Arcade Learning
Environment games (Montezuma's Revenge, Pitfall!, and Private Eye), including
superhuman performance on Pitfall! without demonstrations. After training on
one task, we can reuse the learned abstract MDP for new reward functions,
achieving higher reward in 1000x fewer samples than model-free methods trained

has a top crystalline Ge layer of 220 nm thickness and Buried Oxide layer (BOX)
layer of good quality crystalline Germanium oxide with thickness around 0.62
micron. The crystalline BOX layer has hexagonal crystal structure with lattice
constants close to the standard values. Raman Spectroscopy, cross-sectional
HRTEM with SAED and EDS established that the top Ge layer was recrystallized
during annealing with faceted crystallites. The top layer has a small tensile
strain of around +0.4\% and has estimated dislocation density of 2.7 x
10^{7}cm^{-2}. The thickness, crystallinity and electrical characteristics of
the top layer and the quality of the BOX layer of GeO_{2} are such that it can
be utilized for device fabrication.

  Transportation Systems","11 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.GT cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The operation of future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs),
communications infrastructure (CI), and power grids (PGs) will be highly
interdependent. In particular, autonomous connected vehicles require CI
resources to operate, and, thus, communication failures can result in
non-optimality in the ITS flow in terms of traffic jams and fuel consumption.
Similarly, CI components, e.g., base stations (BSs) can be impacted by failures
in the electric grid that is powering them. Thus, malicious attacks on the PG
can lead to failures in both the CI and the ITSs. To this end, in this paper,
the security of an ITS against indirect attacks carried out through the PG is
studied in an interdependent PG-CI-ITS scenario. To defend against such
attacks, the administrator of the interdependent critical infrastructure can
allocate backup power sources (BPSs) at every BS to compensate for the power
loss caused by the attacker. However, due to budget limitations, the
administrator must consider the importance of each BS in light of the PG risk
of failure, while allocating the BPSs. In this regard, a rigorous analytical
framework is proposed to model the interdependencies between the ITS, CI, and
PG. Next, a one-to-one relationship between the PG components and ITS streets
is derived in order to capture the effect of the PG components' failure on the
optimality of the traffic flow in the streets. Moreover, the problem of BPS
allocation is formulated using a Stackelberg game framework and the Stackelberg
equilibrium (SE) of the game is characterized. Simulation results show that the
derived SE outperforms any other BPS allocation strategy and can be scalable in
linear time with respect to the size of the interdependent infrastructure.

interacts when coupled into the normal dispersion regime of a highly nonlinear

generation of a temporally and spectrally delocalized high energy rogue wave in
the normal dispersion regime in the form of a strongly self-phase-modulation

both temporally and spectrally. We demonstrate that this novel form of rogue
wave is generated by inter-pulse Raman amplification between the SPM lobes of
the many pulses causing the initially most delayed pulse to swallow the energy
of all the other pulses. We further demonstrate that this novel type of rogue
wave generation is a key effect in efficient long-wavelength mid-IR SCG based
on the cascading of SC spectra and demonstrate how the mid-IR SC spectrum can

also to other GNN models. We conduct experiments on four pairs of datasets to
demonstrate the superior performance of the GFM. Besides, based on general
cross-domain recommendation experiments, we also demonstrate that our

the former study are not directly applicable due to the complex geometry of
particle configurations. To overcome these problems, we first thoroughly
examine the landscape of the transition rates to obtain a proper test function
of the equilibrium potential, which provides the upper bound for the
capacities. Then, we modify the induced test flow and precisely estimate the
equilibrium potential near the metastable valleys to obtain the correct lower
bound for the capacities.

electron from a point-like impurity. This is due to the Friedel oscillations of
the electron density around the impurity. These oscillations create an
additional scattering potential for incident electrons. The closer the energy
of the incident electron to the Fermi level, the stronger the additional
scattering. We study this effect for the case when the impurity is not
point-like but rather a hard disk, with a radius much bigger than the de
Broglie wavelength. We start with a careful examination of the full and
transport cross sections from an extended target. Both cross sections approach
their limiting values upon increasing the wave vector of the incident electron.
We establish that the transport cross section saturates much faster than the
full cross section. With regard to the interaction correction, we establish
that it vanishes for the full cross section, while for the transport cross
section, it is enhanced compared to the case of a point-like scatterer.

novel autoencoder (AE) designed, and it learns to generate a latent space.
Then, the constrained hosts/probes use the generated weights to lower the
dimension with a single operation. The compressed data is transferred to a
central IDS server to verify the traffic type. This scheme aims to lower the
needed bandwidth to transfer data by compressing it and also reduce the
overhead of the compression task in the hosts. The proposed scheme is evaluated
on three well-known network traffic datasets (UNSW-NB15, TON\_IoT20 and

teleoperation robotic endoscopic system that can be commanded by a surgeon

robotic flexible endoscope and two hand-controlled robotic endoscopic
instruments (a robotic grasper and a robotic cauterizing hook). A
foot-controlled human-machine interface maps the natural foot gestures to the
4-DoF movements of the endoscope, and two hand-controlled interfaces map the
movements of the two hands to the two instruments individually. The proposed
robotic system was validated in an ex-vivo experiment carried out by six
subjects, where foot control was also compared with a sequential clutch-based
hand control scheme. The participants could successfully teleoperate the
endoscope and the two instruments to cut the tissues at scattered target areas

required less mental effort as compared to the clutch-based hand control
scheme. The system introduced in this paper is intuitive for three-limb

one surgeon to intuitively control three endoscopic tools which normally

state where one of the two channels (physically, spin-up or -down) exhibits
non-Fermi liquid behavior while the other shows Fermi liquid behavior, before
entering the Fermi liquid regime in higher fields. This anomalous state appears
in a dome-shaped region which extends from inside the antiferroic-spin ordered

representations expression-undistinguished and the expression-related feature

AstroSat}. The HID created with the {\it LAXPC} data revealed a complete
Z-pattern of the source, showing all the three branches. We studied the
evolution of the broadband X-ray spectra in the energy range of $0.5-20.0$ keV
along the Z-track, a first such study of this source. The X-ray spectra of the
different parts of the Z-pattern were well described by an absorbed Comptonized
component. An absence of the accretion disc component suggests that the disc is
most probably obscured by a Comptonized region. The best fit electron
temperature ($kT_e$) was found to be in the range of $1.7-2.1$ keV and optical
depth ($\tau$) was found to be in the range of $13.2-17.5$. The optical depth
($\tau$) increased as the source moved from the normal/flaring branch (NB/FB)
vertex to the upper part of the FB, suggesting a possible outflow triggered by
a strong radiation pressure. The power density spectra (PDS) of HB and NB could
be fitted with a pure power-law of index $\alpha$ $\sim$ 1.68 and 0.83
respectively. We also found a weak evidence of QPO (2.8~$\sigma$) in the FB.
The intrinsic luminosity of the source varied between $(1.03-1.79)$ $\times$
10$^{38}$ ergs/s. We discuss our results by comparing with other Z-sources and
the previous observations of LMC X-2.

novel unified framework to simultaneously deal with the noise removal and noise
generation tasks. Instead of only inferring the posteriori distribution of the
latent clean image conditioned on the observed noisy image in traditional MAP
framework, our proposed method learns the joint distribution of the clean-noisy
image pairs. Specifically, we approximate the joint distribution with two
different factorized forms, which can be formulated as a denoiser mapping the
noisy image to the clean one and a generator mapping the clean image to the
noisy one. The learned joint distribution implicitly contains all the
information between the noisy and clean images, avoiding the necessity of
manually designing the image priors and noise assumptions as traditional.
Besides, the performance of our denoiser can be further improved by augmenting
the original training dataset with the learned generator. Moreover, we propose
two metrics to assess the quality of the generated noisy image, for which, to
the best of our knowledge, such metrics are firstly proposed along this
research line. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of our method over the state-of-the-arts both in the real noise

network theory (CRNT) is this: Does the system obtained from a reaction network
admit a positive equilibrium and if it does, can there be more than one within
a stoichiometric class? The higher deficiency algorithm (HDA) of Ji and
Feinberg provided a method of determining the multistationarity capacity of a
CRN with mass action kinetics (MAK). An extension of this, called
Multistationarity Algorithm (MSA), recently came into the scene tackling CRNs
with power law kinetics (PLK), a kinetic system which is more general (having
MAK systems as a special case). For this paper, we provide a computational
approach to study the multistationarity feature of reaction networks endowed
with kinetics which are non-negative linear combinations of power law functions
called poly-PL kinetics (PYK). The idea is to use MSA and combine it with a
transformation called STAR-MSC (i.e., $S$-invariant Termwise Addition of
Reactions via Maximal Stoichiometric Coefficients) producing PLKs that are
dynamically equivalent to PYKs. This leads us to being able to determinine the
multistationarity capacity of a much larger class of kinetic systems. We show
that if the transformed dynamically equivalent PLK system is multistationary
for a stoichiometric class for a set of particular rate constants, then so is
its original corresponding PYK system. Moreover, the monostationarity property
of the transformed PLK system also implies the monostationarity property of the
original PYK system.

be defined with respect to dynamical reference systems. However, I argue here
that there may be a symmetry that exchanges the degrees of freedom of the
physical frame of reference with the other degrees of freedom which are
measured relative to that frame. This symmetry expresses the fact that the
choice of frame of reference is arbitrary, but the same laws apply to all,
including observer and observed. It is then suggested that, in a canonical
description, this leads to an extension of the Born duality, which exchanges
coordinate and momentum variables to a triality that mixes both with the
temporal reference frame. This can also be expressed by extending 2n
dimensional symplectic geometry to a d= 2n+1 dimensional geometry with a cubic
invariant. The choice of a temporal reference frame breaks the triality of the
cubic invariant to the duality represented by the canonical two form. We
discover that a very elegant way to display this structure which encompasses
both classical and quantum mechanics, is in terms of matrix models based on a
cubic action. There we see explicitly in either case how a spontaneous symmetry
breaking leads to the emergence of a temporal reference frame.

Statistical methods-based agent algorithms can be improved in terms of
generalizability and interpretability using symbolic Artificial Intelligence
(AI) tools such as logic programming. In this study, we present a model-free RL
architecture that is supported with explicit relational representations of the
environmental objects. For the first time, we use the PrediNet network
architecture in a dynamic decision-making problem rather than image-based
tasks, and Multi-Head Dot-Product Attention Network (MHDPA) as a baseline for
performance comparisons. We tested two networks in two environments ---i.e.,
the baseline Box-World environment and our novel environment,
Relational-Grid-World (RGW). With the procedurally generated RGW environment,
which is complex in terms of visual perceptions and combinatorial selections,
it is easy to measure the relational representation performance of the RL
agents. The experiments were carried out using different configurations of the
environment so that the presented module and the environment were compared with
the baselines. We reached similar policy optimization performance results with
the PrediNet architecture and MHDPA; additionally, we achieved to extract the
propositional representation explicitly ---which makes the agent's statistical
policy logic more interpretable and tractable. This flexibility in the agent's
policy provides convenience for designing non-task-specific agent
architectures. The main contributions of this study are two-fold ---an RL agent
that can explicitly perform relational reasoning, and a new environment that
measures the relational reasoning capabilities of RL agents.

(Cell-based Crowd Evacuation, CellEVAC) that dynamically allocates colors to
cells in a cell-based pedestrian positioning infrastructure, to provide
efficient exit-choice indications. The operational module of CellEVAC
implements an optimized discrete-choice model that integrates the influential
factors that would make evacuees adapt their exit choice. To optimize the
model, we used a simulation-optimization modeling framework that integrates
microscopic pedestrian simulation based on the classical Social Force Model. We
paid particular attention to safety by using Pedestrian Fundamental Diagrams
that model the dynamics of the exit gates. CellEVAC has been tested in a
simulated real scenario (Madrid Arena) under different external pedestrian flow
patterns that simulate complex pedestrian interactions. Results showed that
CellEVAC outperforms evacuation processes in which the system is not used, with
an exponential improvement as interactions become complex. We compared our
system with an existing approach based on Cartesian Genetic Programming. Our
system exhibited a better overall performance in terms of safety, evacuation
time, and the number of revisions of exit-choice decisions. Further analyses
also revealed that Cartesian Genetic Programming generates less natural
pedestrian reactions and movements than CellEVAC. The fact that the decision
logic module is built upon a behavioral model seems to favor a more natural and
effective response. We also found that our proposal has a positive influence on
evacuations even for a low compliance rate (40%).

  Labels?",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Identification (GI) has long been researched in graph learning and is
essential in certain applications (e.g. social community detection).
Specifically, GI requires to predict the label/score of a target graph given
its collection of node features and edge connections. While this task is
common, more complex cases arise in practice---we are supposed to do the
inverse thing by, for example, grouping similar users in a social network given
the labels of different communities. This triggers an interesting thought: can
we identify nodes given the labels of the graphs they belong to? Therefore,
this paper defines a novel problem dubbed Inverse Graph Identification (IGI),
as opposed to GI. Upon a formal discussion of the variants of IGI, we choose a
particular case study of node clustering by making use of the graph labels and
node features, with an assistance of a hierarchical graph that further
characterizes the connections between different graphs. To address this task,
we propose Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Network (GMGCN), a simple yet
effective method that makes the node-level message passing process using Graph
Attention Network (GAT) under the protocol of GI and then infers the category
of each node via a Gaussian Mixture Layer (GML). The training of GMGCN is
further boosted by a proposed consensus loss to take advantage of the structure
of the hierarchical graph. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the
rationality of the formulation of IGI. We verify the superiority of the
proposed method compared to other baselines on several benchmarks we have built
up. We will release our codes along with the benchmark data to facilitate more
research attention to the IGI problem.

applications. In this work, we deal with the Budgeted Maximum Coverage Problem
(BMCP), which is a generalized 0-1 knapsack problem. Given a set of items with
nonnegative weights and a set of elements with nonnegative profits, where each
item is composed of a subset of elements, BMCP aims to pack a subset of items
in a capacity-constrained knapsack such that the total weight of the selected
items does not exceed the knapsack capacity, and the total profit of the
associated elements is maximized. Note that each element is counted once even
if it is covered multiple times. BMCP is closely related to the Set-Union
Knapsack Problem (SUKP) that is well studied in recent years. As the
counterpart problem of SUKP, however, BMCP was introduced early in 1999 but
since then it has been rarely studied, especially there is no practical
algorithm proposed. By combining the reinforcement learning technique to the
local search procedure, we propose a probability learning based tabu search

iterates through two distinct phases, namely a tabu search phase and a
probability learning based perturbation phase. As there is no benchmark
instances proposed in the literature, we generate 30 benchmark instances with
varied properties. Experimental results demonstrate that our PLTS algorithm

model-selection step and may lead to target dose estimates that are biased. In
this article, we propose two new MED estimation approaches based on weighted

professions. The design of robots that can effectively teach motor skills is an
important challenge in the robotics field. In particular, it is important to
understand whether the involvement in the training of a robot exhibiting social
behaviors impacts on the learning and the experience of the human pupils. In
this study, we addressed this question and we asked participants to learn a
complex task - stabilizing an inverted pendulum - by training with physical
assistance provided by a robotic manipulandum, the Wristbot. One group of
participants performed the training only using the Wristbot, whereas for
another group the same physical assistance was attributed to the humanoid robot
iCub, who played the role of an expert trainer and exhibited also some social
behaviors. The results obtained show that participants of both groups
effectively acquired the skill by leveraging the physical assistance, as they
significantly improved their stabilization performance even when the assistance
was removed. Moreover, learning in a context of interaction with a humanoid
robot assistant led subjects to increased motivation and more enjoyable
training experience, without negative effects on attention and perceived
effort. With the experimental approach presented in this study, it is possible
to investigate the relative contribution of haptic and social signals in the
context of motor learning mediated by human-robot interaction, with the aim of
developing effective robot trainers.

accelerator differs from the Reflexotron in a number of essential details: a
much more compact and more efficient C-band accelerating structure, optimized
for the high capture efficiency, narrow energy and phase spectra, and low
transverse emittance; magnetic mirror with fixed field based on rare-earth
permanent magnets; three-electrode electron gun with off-axis placement of the

  constant problem","7 pages, no figures",,,,"gr-qc cond-mat.other hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As distinct from the black hole physics, the de Sitter thermodynamics is not
determined by the cosmological horizon, the effective temperature differs from
the Hawking temperature. In particular, the atom in the de Sitter universe
experiences thermal activation corresponding to the local temperature, which is
twice larger than the Hawking temperature, $T_{\rm loc}=2T_{\rm Hawking}$. The
same double Hawking temperature describes the decay of massive scalar field in
the de Sitter universe. The reason, why the local temperature is exactly twice
the Hawking temperature, follows from the geometry of the de Sitter spacetime.
The weakening of the role of the cosmological horizon in de Sitter universe is
confirmed by considering Hawking radiation. We discuss the difference between
the radiation of particles in the de Sitter spacetime and the Schwinger pair
creation in the electric field. We use the stationary Painleve-Gullstrand
metric for the de Sitter spacetime, where the particles are created by Hawking
radiation from the cosmological horizon, and time independent gauge for the
electric field. In these stationary frames the Hamiltonians and the energy
spectra of massive particles look rather similar. However, the final results
are essentially different. In case of Schwinger pair production the number
density of the created pairs grows with time, while in the de Sitter vacuum the
number density of the created pairs is finite. The latter suggests that Hawking
radiation from the cosmological horizon does not lead to instability of the de
Sitter vacuum. The other mechanisms of instability are required for the
dynamical solution of the cosmological constant problem. We consider the
possible role of the local temperature $T_{\rm loc}=2T_{\rm H}$ in the decay of
the de Sitter space-time due to the energy exchange between the vacuum energy
and relativistic matter with this temperature.

threshold is set for each block and miners generate block hashes until one of
those values falls below the threshold. Although largely effective, this
mechanism produces blocks at a highly variable rate and also leaves a
blockchain susceptible to chain death, i.e. abandonment in the event that the
threshold is set too high to attract any miners. A recent innovation called
real-time block rate targeting, or RTT, fixes these problems by reducing the
target throughout the mining interval. RTT exhibits much less variable block
times and even features the ability to fully adjust the target after each
block. However, as we show in this paper, RTT also suffers from a critical
vulnerability whereby miners deviate form the protocol to increase their
profits. We introduce the Radium protocol, which mitigates this vulnerability
in RTT while retaining lower variance block times, responsive target
adjustment, and lowering the risk of chain death. We also show that Radium's
susceptibility to the doublespend attack and orphaned blocks remains similar to

three fusion modes of convolutional neural networks: straight, merge and split.
Then, an approach for generating efficient fused code is designed, which goes
deeper in multi-level memory usage for cross-layer data reuse. The
effectiveness of our method is evaluated with the network layers from
state-of-the-art CNNs on two different GPU platforms, NVIDIA TITAN Xp and Tesla

radiographic images. These features can then be used to determine prognosis,
for example, predicting the development of distant metastases (DM). Existing
radiomics methods, however, require complex manual effort including the design
of hand-crafted radiomic features and their extraction and selection. Recent
radiomics methods, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), also require
manual input in network architecture design and hyper-parameter tuning.
Radiomic complexity is further compounded when there are multiple imaging
modalities, for example, combined positron emission tomography - computed
tomography (PET-CT) where there is functional information from PET and
complementary anatomical localization information from computed tomography
(CT). Existing multi-modality radiomics methods manually fuse the data that are
extracted separately. Reliance on manual fusion often results in sub-optimal
fusion because they are dependent on an 'expert's' understanding of medical
images. In this study, we propose a multi-modality neural architecture search
method (MM-NAS) to automatically derive optimal multi-modality image features
for radiomics and thus negate the dependence on a manual process. We evaluated
our MM-NAS on the ability to predict DM using a public PET-CT dataset of
patients with soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs). Our results show that our MM-NAS had
a higher prediction accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art radiomics

we provide a general sufficient condition for a residual network to have the
power of universal approximation by asking the activation function, or one of
its derivatives, to satisfy a quadratic differential equation. Many activation
functions used in practice satisfy this assumption, exactly or approximately,
and we show this property to be sufficient for an adequately deep neural
network with $n+1$ neurons per layer to approximate arbitrarily well, on a

$\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. We further show this result to hold for very
simple architectures for which the weights only need to assume two values. The
first key technical contribution consists of relating the universal
approximation problem to controllability of an ensemble of control systems
corresponding to a residual network and to leverage classical Lie algebraic
techniques to characterize controllability. The second technical contribution
is to identify monotonicity as the bridge between controllability of finite
ensembles and uniform approximability on compact sets.

striking manifestation of magnetically-mediated superconducting pairing. After

in the orthorhombic paramagnet UTe$_2$. Under a magnetic field applied along
the hard magnetization axis b, superconductivity is reinforced on approaching
metamagnetism at $\mu_0H_m$ = 35 T, but it abruptly disappears beyond $H_m$. On
the contrary, field-induced superconductivity was reported beyond $\mu_0H_m$ =
40-50 T in a magnetic field tilted by $\simeq25-30\deg$ from b in the (b,c)
plane. Here we explore the phase diagram of UTe2 under these two magnetic-field
directions. Zero-resistance measurements permit to confirm unambiguously that
superconductivity is established beyond Hm in the tilted-field direction. While
superconductivity is locked exactly at fields either smaller (for a H || b), or
larger (for H tilted by $\simeq27\deg$ from b to c), than Hm, the variations of
the Fermi-liquid coefficient in the electrical resistivity and of the residual
resistivity are surprisingly similar for the two field directions. The
resemblance of the normal states for the two field directions puts constraints
for theoretical models of superconductivity and implies that some subtle
ingredients must be in play.

from the myriad potential forms of the Shapley value \textit{game formulation}.
Amongst the consequences of this flexibility is that there are now many types
of Shapley values being discussed, with such variety being a source of
potential misunderstanding. To the best of our knowledge, all existing game
formulations in the machine learning and statistics literature fall into a
category which we name the model-dependent category of game formulations. In
this work, we consider an alternative and novel formulation which leads to the
first instance of what we call model-independent Shapley values. These Shapley
values use a (non-parametric) measure of non-linear dependence as the
characteristic function. The strength of these Shapley values is in their
ability to uncover and attribute non-linear dependencies amongst features. We
introduce and demonstrate the use of the energy distance correlations,
affine-invariant distance correlation, and Hilbert-Shmidt independence
criterion as Shapley value characteristic functions. In particular, we
demonstrate their potential value for exploratory data analysis and model
diagnostics. We conclude with an interesting expository application to a

model of compressible multi-component flows with Mie-Gr\""uneisen equation of
state. The method mainly consists of three steps: firstly, the DG method with
the non-oscillatory kinetic flux is used to solve the conservative equations of
the model; secondly, inspired by Abgrall's idea, we derive a DG scheme for the
volume fraction equation which can avoid the unphysical oscillations near the
material interfaces; finally, a multi-resolution WENO limiter and a
maximum-principle-satisfying limiter are employed to ensure oscillation-free
near the discontinuities, and preserve the physical bounds for the volume
fraction, respectively. Numerical tests show that the method can achieve high
order for smooth solutions and keep non-oscillatory at discontinuities.

Government's ONS (Office of National Statistics) most recent report on deaths
by religion shows that Jews (very few of whom are classified as BAME) have a
much higher risk than those of religions (Hindu, Sikh, Muslim) with

to the ONS statistical analysis, implicitly explained by age as the report
claims that, when 'adjusted for age' Muslims have the highest fatality risk.
However, the report fails to provide the raw data to support this. There are
many factors other than just age that must be incorporated into any analysis of
the observed data before making definitive conclusions about risk based on
religion/ethnicity. We propose the need for a causal model for this. If we
discount unknown genetic factors, then religion and ethnicity have NO impact at

Previous approaches are mostly based on a two-step procedure: first learn an
inner-product model, and then use some approximate nearest neighbor (ANN)
search algorithm to find top candidates. In this paper, we present Deep
Retrieval (DR), to learn a retrievable structure directly with user-item
interaction data (e.g. clicks) without resorting to the Euclidean space
assumption in ANN algorithms. DR's structure encodes all candidate items into a
discrete latent space. Those latent codes for the candidates are model
parameters and learnt together with other neural network parameters to maximize
the same objective function. With the model learnt, a beam search over the
structure is performed to retrieve the top candidates for reranking.
Empirically, we first demonstrate that DR, with sub-linear computational
complexity, can achieve almost the same accuracy as the brute-force baseline on
two public datasets. Moreover, we show that, in a live production
recommendation system, a deployed DR approach significantly outperforms a
well-tuned ANN baseline in terms of engagement metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, DR is among the first non-ANN algorithms successfully deployed at

correspond to image space and Z to metric depth around the subject. To obtain
metric-scale predictions, 2.5D methods need a separate post-processing step to
resolve scale ambiguity. Further, they cannot localize body joints outside the
image boundaries, leading to incomplete estimates for truncated images. To
address these limitations, we propose metric-scale truncation-robust (MeTRo)
volumetric heatmaps, whose dimensions are all defined in metric 3D space,
instead of being aligned with image space. This reinterpretation of heatmap
dimensions allows us to directly estimate complete, metric-scale poses without
test-time knowledge of distance or relying on anthropometric heuristics, such
as bone lengths. To further demonstrate the utility our representation, we
present a differentiable combination of our 3D metric-scale heatmaps with 2D
image-space ones to estimate absolute 3D pose (our MeTRAbs architecture). We
find that supervision via absolute pose loss is crucial for accurate
non-root-relative localization. Using a ResNet-50 backbone without further

applying different layers. Experiments were conducted on ESC-50 and ESC-10

difficulty of similarity computing of notes that share the same note value yet
different tempos, in one or among MIDI files. In addition, the usage of single

with two novel methods to respectively track these two shortages, one is the
construction of time-valued note sequences that liberate note values from

note on to current note on, note on to note off, pitch, and velocity, for
jointly training of four Transformer-XL networks. Through training on a 23-hour

proposed by Tobin and analyse a supply shock, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, in
this Keynesian conceptual environment. The expansion allows us to propose the

relevant due to its theoretical and practical implications. A quantity or
Keynesian adjustment to the shock produces a depression through the effect on
aggregate demand. This depression worsens in the medium/long-term. It is
accompanied by increases in inflation, inflation expectations and the real
interest rate. A stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active
monetary policy to reduce real interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing
or Marshallian adjustment foresees a more severe and rapid depression in the
short-term. There would be a reduction in inflation and inflation expectations,
and an increase in the real interest rates. The tax or monetary stimulus
measures would only impact inflation. This result makes it possible to clarify

tested on a scenario with three simultaneous tasks: exploration, communication
network creation and geolocation of RF emitters. A repertoire is evolved,
consisting of a wide range of controllers, or behavior primitives, with
different characteristics and trade-offs in the different tasks. This
repertoire would enable the swarm to transition between behavior trade-offs
online, according to the situational requirements. Furthermore, the effect of
noise on the behavior characteristics in MAP-elites is investigated. A moderate
number of re-evaluations is found to increase the robustness while keeping the
computational requirements relatively low. A few selected controllers are
examined, and the dynamics of transitioning between these controllers are
explored. Finally, the study develops a methodology for analyzing the makeup of
the resulting controllers. This is done through a parameter variation study

problem, consisting of two synchronised and balanced datasets of 16,000 data
objects, encompassing 4.4 hours of video of 8 environments with varying degrees
of similarity. We first extract video frames and accompanying audio at one
second intervals. The image and the audio datasets are first classified
independently, using a fine-tuned VGG16 and an evolutionary optimised deep
neural network, with accuracies of 89.27% and 93.72%, respectively. This is
followed by late fusion of the two neural networks to enable a higher order
function, leading to accuracy of 96.81% in this multi-modality classifier with
synchronised video frames and audio clips. The tertiary neural network
implemented for late fusion outperforms classical state-of-the-art classifiers
by around 3% when the two primary networks are considered as feature
generators. We show that situations where a single-modality may be confused by
anomalous data points are now corrected through an emerging higher order
integration. Prominent examples include a water feature in a city misclassified
as a river by the audio classifier alone and a densely crowded street
misclassified as a forest by the image classifier alone. Both are examples
which are correctly classified by our multi-modality approach.
