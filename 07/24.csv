states by the $c \to s u\overline{d}$ transition. It can, however, also
disintegrate into a $\pi^-$ meson and a $\Lambda_c^+$ baryon via $s$ quark
decay or via $cs\to d c$ weak scattering. The interplay between the latter two
processes governs the size of the branching fraction ${\cal{B}}$$(\Xi_c^0\to
\pi^-\Lambda_c^+)$, first measured here to be $(0.55\pm 0.02 \pm 0.18)$%, where
the first uncertainty is statistical and second systematic. This result is
compatible with the larger of the theoretical predictions that connect models
of hyperon decays using partially conserved axial currents and SU(3) symmetry
with those involving the heavy-quark expansion and heavy-quark symmetry. In
addition, the branching fraction of the normalization channel,
${\cal{B}}(\Xi_c^+\to p K^- \pi^+) = (1.135 \pm 0.002 \pm 0.387)$% is measured.

based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Unlike previous approaches to
lineage tracing, Super-OT has the flexibility to integrate paired data. We
benchmark Super-OT based on single-cell RNA-seq data against Waddington-OT, a
popular approach for lineage tracing that also employs optimal transport. We
show that Super-OT achieves gains over Waddington-OT in predicting the class
outcome of cells during differentiation, since it allows the integration of
additional information during training.

plays a key role in various practical scenarios. Due to limitation of hardware,
it is often necessary to sacrifice accuracy to ensure the infer speed of the
detector in practice. Therefore, the balance between effectiveness and
efficiency of object detector must be considered. The goal of this paper is to
implement an object detector with relatively balanced effectiveness and
efficiency that can be directly applied in actual application scenarios, rather
than propose a novel detection model. Considering that YOLOv3 has been widely
used in practice, we develop a new object detector based on YOLOv3. We mainly
try to combine various existing tricks that almost not increase the number of
model parameters and FLOPs, to achieve the goal of improving the accuracy of
detector as much as possible while ensuring that the speed is almost unchanged.
Since all experiments in this paper are conducted based on PaddlePaddle, we
call it PP-YOLO. By combining multiple tricks, PP-YOLO can achieve a better
balance between effectiveness (45.2% mAP) and efficiency (72.9 FPS), surpassing
the existing state-of-the-art detectors such as EfficientDet and YOLOv4.Source

tasks, however, heavily rely on the large amounts of labeled samples. This may
require considerable annotation cost in real-world applications. Fortunately,
active learning is a promising methodology to train high-performing model with
minimal annotation cost. In the deep learning context, the critical question of
active learning is how to precisely identify the informativeness of samples for
DNN. In this paper, inspired by piece-wise linear interpretability in DNN, we
introduce the linearly separable regions of samples to the problem of active
learning, and propose a novel Deep Active learning approach by Model
Interpretability (DAMI). To keep the maximal representativeness of the entire
unlabeled data, DAMI tries to select and label samples on different linearly
separable regions introduced by the piece-wise linear interpretability in DNN.
We focus on modeling Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) for modeling tabular data.
Specifically, we use the local piece-wise interpretation in MLP as the
representation of each sample, and directly run K-Center clustering to select
and label samples. To be noted, this whole process of DAMI does not require any
hyper-parameters to tune manually. To verify the effectiveness of our approach,
extensive experiments have been conducted on several tabular datasets. The
experimental results demonstrate that DAMI constantly outperforms several
state-of-the-art compared approaches.

programs in a domain-specific language. Such programmatic models can offer
benefits such as composability and interpretability; however, learning them
requires optimizing over a combinatorial space of program ""architectures"". We
frame this optimization problem as a search in a weighted graph whose paths
encode top-down derivations of program syntax. Our key innovation is to view
various classes of neural networks as continuous relaxations over the space of
programs, which can then be used to complete any partial program. This relaxed
program is differentiable and can be trained end-to-end, and the resulting
training loss is an approximately admissible heuristic that can guide the
combinatorial search. We instantiate our approach on top of the A-star
algorithm and an iteratively deepened branch-and-bound search, and use these
algorithms to learn programmatic classifiers in three sequence classification
tasks. Our experiments show that the algorithms outperform state-of-the-art
methods for program learning, and that they discover programmatic classifiers
that yield natural interpretations and achieve competitive accuracy.

examples, which remains a challenging research problem yet to be explored.
Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of self-learned top-down attention
mechanisms in object detection and other vision tasks. The top-down attention,
however, is less effective at improving the performance of few-shot detectors.
Due to the insufficient training data, object detectors cannot effectively
generate attention maps for few-shot examples. To improve the performance and
interpretability of few-shot object detectors, we propose an attentive few-shot
object detection network (AttFDNet) that takes the advantages of both top-down
and bottom-up attention. Being task-agnostic, the bottom-up attention serves as
a prior that helps detect and localize naturally salient objects. We further
address specific challenges in few-shot object detection by introducing two
novel loss terms and a hybrid few-shot learning strategy. Experimental results
and visualization demonstrate the complementary nature of the two types of
attention and their roles in few-shot object detection. Codes are available at

the present work, we take into account the contributions of pion exchanges via

indirectly produced in the final state interactions of the $\Lambda_b^0$ decay

these states as $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$ molecules. Based on the fit results obtained,
we study the partial decay widths/branching ratios to other decay channels,
$\bar{D}^* \Lambda_c$, $\bar{D} \Lambda_c$, and $\eta_c N$, and the
corresponding invariant mass distributions. The resonances with
$J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$, $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and the one of $\bar{D}^*

exploits the revolution in the processing capabilities of vehicles to provide
energy efficient services and low delay for Internet of Things (IoT)-based
systems. Edge computing relies on a set of distributed processing nodes (i.e.
vehicles) that are located close to the end user. In this paper, we consider a
vehicular edge cloud (VEC) consisting of a set of vehicle clusters that form a
temporal vehicular cloud by combining their computational resources in the
cluster. We tackle the problem of processing allocation in the proposed
vehicular edge architecture by developing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) optimization model that jointly minimizes power consumption, propagation
delay, and queuing delay. The results show that the closer the processing node
(PN) is to the access point (AP), the lower the power consumption and delay, as
the distance and number of hops affect the propagation delay and queuing delay.
However, the queuing delay at the AP becomes a limiting factor when it operates
at a low service rate compared to the traffic arrival rate. Thus, processing
tasks at the vehicular nodes (VN) was avoided whenever the objective function
included queueing delay and the AP operated at a low service rate. Increase in
the AP service rate results in a lower queuing delay and better VN utilization.

self-consistent sequence of radiative transfer models (using TARDIS) and
determine that the ejecta material is dominated by intermediate-mass elements
(O, Mg and Si), with a photospheric velocity of $\sim$12000-14500km/s. The
early spectra have the unusual combination of being blue but dominated by
strong FeII and FeIII absorption features. We show that this combination is
only possible with a high Fe content (3.5%). This implies a high Fe/(Ni+Co)
ratio. Given the short time from the transient's proposed explosion epoch, the
Fe cannot be $^{56}$Fe resulting from the decay of radioactive $^{56}$Ni
synthesised in the explosion. Instead, we propose that this is stable
$^{54}$Fe, and that the transient is unusually rich in this isotope. We further
identify an additional, high-velocity component of ejecta material at
$\sim$20000-26000km/s, which is mildly asymmetric and detectable through the
CaII NIR triplet. We discuss our findings with reference to a range of
plausible progenitor systems and compare with published theoretical work. We
conclude that AT2018kzr is most likely the result of a merger between an ONe
white dwarf and a neutron star or black hole. As such, it would be the second
plausible candidate with a good spectral sequence for the electromagnetic
counterpart of a compact binary merger, after AT2017gfo.

studied and applied to many PDEs, there are less results on refined behavior of

higher d. Furthermore for each $m\ge 2$ and arbitrarily given combination of

larger variety of behaviors than for the Fujita eqn. We introduce a method

need for disposing of a mathematically well defined and justified shape
vectorization process, which in addition provides a minimal set of control
points with geometric meaning. In this paper we propose a silhouette
vectorization method which extracts the outline of a 2D shape from a raster
binary image, and converts it to a combination of cubic B\'{e}zier polygons and
perfect circles. Starting from the boundary curvature extrema computed at
sub-pixel level, we identify a set of control points based on the affine
scale-space induced by the outline. These control points capture similarity
invariant geometric features of the given silhouette and give precise locations
of the shape's corners.of the given silhouette. Then, piecewise B\'{e}zier
cubics are computed by least-square fitting combined with an adaptive splitting
to guarantee a predefined accuracy. When there are no curvature extrema
identified, either the outline is recognized as a circle using the
isoperimetric inequality, or a pair of the most distant outline points are
chosen to initiate the fitting. Given their construction, most of our control
points are geometrically stable under affine transformations. By comparing with
other feature detectors, we show that our method can be used as a reliable
feature point detector for silhouettes. Compared to state-of-the-art image
vectorization software, our algorithm demonstrates superior reduction on the
number of control points, while maintaining high accuracy.

satisfying $\max\{1,2-c\} \le r < t$. $W$ is an irreducible algebraic set.
First of all, we compute an upper $r$-independent bound for the dimension of

($a_j = 1, b_i=0$) and cases sufficiently close, we conjecture and to a certain

weak numerical assumptions on the integers $a_j$ and $b_i$ (or under some depth

homogeneous coordinate ring of $(X)\in W$ and of a closely related module. We
conjecture, and in some cases prove, that their codepth is often 1 (resp. $r$).
These results extend previous results on standard determinantal schemes to
determinantal schemes; i.e. previous results of the authors on
$W(\underline{b};\underline{a};1)$ to $W$ with $1\le r < t$ and $c\ge 2-r$.
Finally, deformations of exterior powers of the cokernel of the map determined
by $\mathcal A$ are studied and proven to be given as deformations of $X

these problems.
  In this work we focus on sparse digraphs. First, we recall known approaches
for Undirected Hamiltonicity and TSP in sparse graphs and we analyse their
consequences for Directed Hamiltonicity and ATSP in sparse digraphs, either by
adapting the algorithm, or by using reductions. In this way, we get a number of
running time upper bounds for a few classes of sparse digraphs, including
$O^*(2^{n/3})$ for digraphs with both out- and indegree bounded by 2, and
$O^*(3^{n/2})$ for digraphs with outdegree bounded by 3.
  Our main results are focused on digraphs of bounded average outdegree $d$.
The baseline for ATSP here is a simple enumeration of cycle covers which can be
done in time bounded by $O^*(\mu(d)^n)$ for a function
$\mu(d)\le(\lceil{d}\rceil!)^{1/{\lceil{d}\rceil}}$. One can also observe that
Directed Hamiltonicity can be solved in randomized time $O^*((2-2^{-d})^n)$ and
polynomial space, by adapting a recent result of Bj\""{o}rklund [ISAAC 2018]
stated originally for Undirected Hamiltonicity in sparse bipartite graphs.
  We present two new deterministic algorithms for ATSP: the first running in
time $O(2^{0.441(d-1)n})$ and polynomial space, and the second in exponential
space with running time of $O^*(\tau(d)^{n/2})$ for a function $\tau(d)\le d$.

we considered a self-consistent numerical galaxy model where a typical B/PS

the galaxy model onto the bar and non-bar components. We used the extracted 3D

subject to linear temporal logic (LTL) constraints. The environment is dynamic
in the sense of containing mobile obstacles and time-varying areas of interest
(i.e., time-varying reward and workspace properties) to be visited by the
agent. Since user-specified tasks may not be fully realized (i.e., partially
infeasible), this work considers hard and soft LTL constraints, where hard
constraints enforce safety requirement (e.g. avoid obstacles) while soft
constraints represent tasks that can be relaxed to not strictly follow user
specifications. The motion planning of the agent is to generate policies, in
decreasing order of priority, to 1) formally guarantee the satisfaction of
safety constraints; 2) mostly satisfy soft constraints (i.e., minimize the
violation cost if desired tasks are partially infeasible); and 3) optimize the
objective of rewards collection (i.e., visiting dynamic areas of more
interests). To achieve these objectives, a relaxed product automaton, which
allows the agent to not strictly follow the desired LTL constraints, is
constructed. A utility function is developed to quantify the differences
between the revised and the desired motion plan, and the accumulated rewards
are designed to bias the motion plan towards those areas of more interests.
Receding horizon control is synthesized with an LTL formula to maximize the
accumulated utilities over a finite horizon, while ensuring that safety
constraints are fully satisfied and soft constraints are mostly satisfied.
Simulation and experiment results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness

the largest scales mapped by cosmological surveys. Forthcoming 21cm intensity
mapping experiments will aim to probe these scales by surveying neutral
hydrogen (HI) within galaxies. However, foreground signals dominate the faint
21cm emission, meaning foreground cleaning is required to recover the
cosmological signal. The effect this has is to damp the HI power spectrum on
the largest scales, especially along the line-of-sight. Whilst there is
agreement that this contamination is potentially problematic for probing PNG,
it is yet to be fully explored and quantified. In this work we carry out the
first forecasts on $f_\text{NL}$ that incorporate simulated foreground maps
that are removed using techniques employed in real data. Using an MCMC
analysis, we demonstrate that foreground cleaned data recovers hugely biased
values ($f_\text{NL} = -102.1_{-7.96}^{+8.39}$ [68% CL]) on our $f_\text{NL}=0$
fiducial input. Introducing a model with fixed parameters for the foreground
contamination allows us to recover unbiased results ($f_\text{NL} =
-2.94_{-11.9}^{+11.4}$). However, it is not clear that we will have sufficient
understanding of foreground contamination to allow for such rigid models.
Treating the main parameter $k_\parallel^\text{FG}$ in our foreground model as
a nuisance parameter and marginalizing over it, still recovers unbiased results
but at the expense of much larger errors ($f_\text{NL} =
0.75^{+40.2}_{-44.5}$), that can only be reduced by imposing the Planck 2018
prior. Our results show that significant progress on understanding and
controlling foreground removal effects is necessary in order to study PNG with
HI intensity mapping.

create and solve, i.e., find any core partitions, of millions of hedonic games.
Our Monte Carlo experiment generated games with up to thirteen players. The
results discuss the distribution form of the core size of the games of a given

2014ab, obtained through $\sim 200$ days after peak brightness. SN 2014ab was a
luminous Type IIn SN ($M_V < -19.14$ mag) discovered after peak brightness near
the nucleus of its host galaxy, VV 306c. Prediscovery upper limits constrain
the time of explosion to within 200 days prior to discovery. While SN 2014ab
declined by $\sim 1$ mag over the course of our observations, the observed
spectrum remained remarkably unchanged. Spectra exhibit an asymmetric
emission-line profile with a consistently stronger blueshifted component,
suggesting the presence of dust or a lack of symmetry between the far side and
near side of the SN. The Pa$\beta$ emission line shows a profile very similar
to that of H$\alpha$, implying that this stronger blueshifted component is
caused either through obscuration by large dust grains, occultation by
optically thick material, or a lack of symmetry between the far side and near
side of the interaction region. Despite these asymmetric line profiles, our
spectropolarimetric data show that SN 2014ab has little detected polarization
after accounting for the interstellar polarization. This suggests that we are
seeing emission from a photosphere that has only small deviation from circular
symmetry face-on. We are likely seeing a SN IIn with nearly circular symmetry
in the plane normal to our line of sight, but with either large-grain dust or
significant asymmetry in the density of circumstellar material or SN ejecta
along our line of sight. We suggest that SN 2014ab and SN 2010jl (as well as
other SNe IIn) may be similar events viewed from different directions.

  Behavior Data",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Native ad is a popular type of online advertisement which has similar forms
with the native content displayed on websites. Native ad CTR prediction is
useful for improving user experience and platform revenue. However, it is
challenging due to the lack of explicit user intent, and users' behaviors on
the platform with native ads may not be sufficient to infer their interest in
ads. Fortunately, user behaviors exist on many online platforms and they can
provide complementary information for user interest mining. Thus, leveraging
multi-platform user behaviors is useful for native ad CTR prediction. However,
user behaviors are highly privacy-sensitive and the behavior data on different
platforms cannot be directly aggregated due to user privacy concerns and data
protection regulations like GDPR. Existing CTR prediction methods usually
require centralized storage of user behavior data for user modeling and cannot
be directly applied to the CTR prediction task with multi-platform user
behaviors. In this paper, we propose a federated native ad CTR prediction
method named FedCTR, which can learn user interest representations from their
behaviors on multiple platforms in a privacy-preserving way. On each platform a
local user model is used to learn user embeddings from the local user behaviors
on that platform. The local user embeddings from different platforms are
uploaded to a server for aggregation, and the aggregated user embeddings are
sent to the ad platform for CTR prediction. Besides, we apply LDP and DP
techniques to the local and aggregated user embeddings respectively for better
privacy protection. Moreover, we propose a federated framework for model
training with distributed models and user behaviors. Extensive experiments on
real-world dataset show that FedCTR can effectively leverage multi-platform
user behaviors for native ad CTR prediction in a privacy-preserving manner.

information update systems. Age of information (AoI) is a fundamentally
important metric to characterize information freshness, defined as the time
elapsed since the generation of the last successfully received update. When
multiple devices share the same wireless channel to send updates to a common
receiver, an interesting question is whether dividing the whole channel into
several subchannels will lead to better AoI performance. Given the same
frequency band, dividing it into different numbers of subchannels lead to
different transmission times and packet error rates (PER) of short update
packets, thus affecting information freshness. We focus on a multichannel
access system where different devices take turns to transmit with a cyclic
schedule repeated over time. We first derive the average AoI by estimating the
PERs of short packets. Then we examine bounded AoI, for which the instantaneous
AoI is required to be below a threshold a large percentage of the time.
Simulation results indicate that multichannel access can provide low average
AoI and uniform bounded AoI simultaneously across different received powers.
Overall, our investigations provide insights into practical designs of
multichannel access systems with AoI requirements.

(VRH) conductivity of a two dimensional electron-glass (EG) system. The VRH
conductivity is known to have a stretched exponential dependence on
temperature, with an exponent $p$ that depends on the shape of the EG's single
particle density of states (DOS). For constant DOS $p=1/3$ and for linear DOS
$p=1/2$, also known as Mott's and Efros-Shklovskii's VRH respectively. The
presence of the plate causes two effects on the EG system, static and dynamic.
The well known static effect accounts for the additional screening of the
Coulomb repulsion in the EG and for the partial filling of the Coulomb gap in
the DOS. This in turn causes an increase of the conductivity at very low
temperatures. Here we investigate the complementary dynamical effect, which is
related to the polaronic phenomena. Our main result is the dynamical
suppression of the standard phonon assisted hopping and, thus, suppression of
the conductivity in a much wider range of temperatures as compared to the low
temperature static effect. The relation to experiments is discussed.

pressing human needs: clean air, clean water and the sustainable production of
food and energy. This article focuses on a subset of multiphase flows called
particle-laden suspensions involving non-deforming particles in a carrier
fluid. The hydrodynamic interactions in these flows result in rich multiscale
physics, such as clustering and pseudo-turbulence, with important practical
implications. Theoretical formulations to represent, explain and predict these
phenomena encounter peculiar challenges that multiphase flows pose for
classical statistical mechanics. A critical analysis of existing approaches
leads to the identification of key desirable characteristics that a formulation
must possess in order to be successful at representing these physical
phenomena. The need to build accurate closure models for unclosed terms that
arise in statistical theories has motivated the development of
particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR--DNS) for model-free
simulation at the microscale. A critical perspective on outstanding questions
and potential limitations of PR-DNS for model development is provided. Selected
highlights of recent progress using PR-DNS to discover new multiphase flow
physics and develop models are reviewed. Alternative theoretical formulations
and extensions to current formulations are outlined as promising future
research directions. The article concludes with a summary perspective on the
importance of integrating theoretical, modeling, computational, and
experimental efforts at different scales.

key hypothesis that guarantees the existence and uniqueness (up to system
isomorphisms) of canonical realizations for causal and time-invariant
input/output systems with semi-infinite inputs. Additionally, the notion of
optimal reduction coming from the theory of symmetric Hamiltonian systems is
implemented in our setup to construct canonical realizations out of input
forgetting but not necessarily canonical ones. These two procedures are studied
in detail in the framework of linear fading memory input/output systems.
Finally, the notion of implicit reduction using reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RKHS) is introduced which allows, for systems with linear readouts, to
achieve dimension reduction without the need to actually compute the reduced

existing IQA methods objectively evaluate recent IR algorithms? (2) When focus
on beating current benchmarks, are we getting better IR algorithms? To answer
these questions and promote the development of IQA methods, we contribute a
large-scale IQA dataset, called Perceptual Image Processing Algorithms (PIPAL)

which are missing in previous datasets. We collect more than 1.13 million human

both architecture search and post-processing on curve lane predictions via
point blending. It consists of three search modules: a) a feature fusion search
module to find a better fusion of the local and global context for multi-level
hierarchy features; b) an elastic backbone search module to explore an
efficient feature extractor with good semantics and latency; c) an adaptive
point blending module to search a multi-level post-processing refinement
strategy to combine multi-scale head prediction. The unified framework ensures
lane-sensitive predictions by the mutual guidance between NAS and adaptive

inner product of one function with a translated version of another, but with
the adoption of an alternative translation operator on the sphere. This
translation operator follows by analogy with the Euclidean translation when
viewed in harmonic space. The sifting convolution satisfies a variety of
desirable properties that are lacking in alternate definitions, namely: it
supports directional kernels; it has an output which remains on the sphere; and
is efficient to compute. An illustration of the sifting convolution on a
topographic map of the Earth demonstrates that it supports directional kernels
to perform anisotropic filtering, while its output remains on the sphere.

and quality of Genetic and Evolutionary Algorithms (GEAs). Prior work has
analyzed the effects of these operators on genotypic variation, often using
locality metrics that measure the sensitivity and stability of
genotype-phenotype representations to these operators.
  In this paper, we focus on an important subset of representations, namely
nonredundant bitstring-to-integer representations, and analyze them through the
lens of Rothlauf's widely used locality metrics. We first define locality
metrics equivalent to Rothlauf's that are tailored to our domain: the
\textit{point locality} for single-bit mutation and \textit{general locality}
for recombination. With these definitions, we derive tight bounds and a closed
form expected value for point locality. For general locality we show that it is
asymptotically equivalent across all representations and operators. We also
recreate three established GEA experiments to understand the predictive power
of point locality on GEA performance, focusing on two popular and often
juxtaposed representations: standard binary and binary reflected Gray.
  We show that standard binary has provably no worse locality than any Gray
encoding, including binary reflected Gray. We discuss this result in the
context of previous studies that found binary reflected Gray to outperform
standard binary, and we argue that locality cannot be the explanation for
strong performance. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that weak point
locality representations can be beneficial to performance in the exploration
phase of the GEA, while strong point locality representations are more
beneficial in the exploitation phase.

robustly to outliers and to adapt quickly to changes in the underlying data
generating mechanism. In this paper, we refer to the former attribute of online
learning algorithms as robustness and to the latter as adaptivity. There is an
obvious tradeoff between the two attributes. It is a fundamental issue to
quantify and evaluate the tradeoff because it provides important information on
the data generating mechanism. However, no previous work has considered the
tradeoff quantitatively. We propose a novel algorithm called the stochastic
approximation-based robustness-adaptivity algorithm (SRA) to evaluate the
tradeoff. The key idea of SRA is to update parameters of distribution or
sufficient statistics with the biased stochastic approximation scheme, while
dropping data points with large values of the stochastic update. We address the
relation between the two parameters: one is the step size of the stochastic
approximation, and the other is the threshold parameter of the norm of the
stochastic update. The former controls the adaptivity and the latter does the
robustness. We give a theoretical analysis for the non-asymptotic convergence
of SRA in the presence of outliers, which depends on both the step size and
threshold parameter. Because SRA is formulated on the majorization-minimization
principle, it is a general algorithm that includes many algorithms, such as the
online EM algorithm and stochastic gradient descent. Empirical experiments for
both synthetic and real datasets demonstrated that SRA was superior to previous
methods.

of state, we find the two-parameter family of solutions with a regular centre
and finite total mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ (rigidly rotating stars).
For analytic equations of state, the solution is analytic except at the

in the region $|\tilde J|-1<M<|\tilde J|$, which consists of parts of the point

an adjacent compact part of the black hole region $|\tilde J|<M$ (whose extent

considerable interest for constructing computationally efficient counterparts

provide a low-dimensional emulation framework for systems that may be
intrinsically high-dimensional. This is accomplished by utilizing a
construction algorithm that is purely data-driven. It is no surprise,
therefore, that the algorithmic advances of machine learning have led to
non-intrusive ROMs with greater accuracy and computational gains. However, in
bypassing the utilization of an equation-based evolution, it is often seen that
the interpretability of the ROM framework suffers. This becomes more
problematic when black-box deep learning methods are used which are notorious
for lacking robustness outside the physical regime of the observed data. In
this article, we propose the use of a novel latent-space interpolation
algorithm based on Gaussian process regression. Notably, this reduced-order
evolution of the system is parameterized by control parameters to allow for
interpolation in space. The use of this procedure also allows for a continuous
interpretation of time which allows for temporal interpolation. The latter
aspect provides information, with quantified uncertainty, about full-state
evolution at a finer resolution than that utilized for training the ROMs. We
assess the viability of this algorithm for an advection-dominated system given

character in the case when on each level of the network the lobby size is
different, resulting in two parameters $q_1$ and $q_2$. We find evidence of

using weak gravitational lensing and large-scale structure of galaxy catalogs
to study cosmology. Spectroscopic redshifts for the dim and numerous galaxies
of next-generation weak-lensing surveys are expected to be unavailable, making
photometric redshift (photo-$z$) probability density functions (PDFs) the
next-best alternative for comprehensively encapsulating the nontrivial
systematics affecting photo-$z$ point estimation. The established stacked
estimator of $n(z)$ avoids reducing photo-$z$ PDFs to point estimates but
yields a systematically biased estimate of $n(z)$ that worsens with decreasing
signal-to-noise, the very regime where photo-$z$ PDFs are most necessary. We
introduce Cosmological Hierarchical Inference with Probabilistic Photometric
Redshifts (CHIPPR), a statistically rigorous probabilistic graphical model of
redshift-dependent photometry, which correctly propagates the redshift
uncertainty information beyond the best-fit estimator of $n(z)$ produced by
traditional procedures and is provably the only self-consistent way to recover
$n(z)$ from photo-$z$ PDFs. We present the $\texttt{chippr}$ prototype code,
noting that the mathematically justifiable approach incurs computational
expense. The CHIPPR approach is applicable to any one-point statistic of any
random variable, provided the prior probability density used to produce the
posteriors is explicitly known; if the prior is implicit, as may be the case
for popular photo-$z$ techniques, then the resulting posterior PDFs cannot be
used for scientific inference. We therefore recommend that the photo-$z$
community focus on developing methodologies that enable the recovery of
photo-$z$ likelihoods with support over all redshifts, either directly or via a
known prior probability density.

Milky Way's bulge by exploiting the constraining power of its stellar [Fe/H]
and [Mg/Fe] distribution functions. Using APOGEE data, we confirm the
previously-established bimodal [Mg/Fe]--[Fe/H] distribution within 3 kpc of the
inner Galaxy. Compared to that in the solar vicinity, the high-$\alpha$
population in the bulge peaks at a lower [Fe/H]. To fit these observations, we
use a simple but flexible star formation framework, which assumes two distinct
stages of gas accretion and star formation, and systematically evaluate a wide
multi-dimensional parameter space. We find that the data favor a three-phase
SFH that consists of an initial starburst, followed by a rapid star formation
quenching episode and a lengthy, quiescent secular evolution phase. The
metal-poor, high-$\alpha$ bulge stars ([Fe/H]<0.0 and [Mg/Fe]>0.15) are formed
rapidly (<2 Gyr) during the early starburst. The density gap between the high-
and low-$\alpha$ sequences is due to the quenching process. The metal-rich,
low-$\alpha$ population ([Fe/H]>0.0 and [Mg/Fe]<0.15) then accumulates
gradually through inefficient star formation during the secular phase. This is
qualitatively consistent with the early SFH of the inner disk. Given this
scenario, a notable fraction of young stars (age<5 Gyr) is expected to persist
in the bulge. Combined with extragalactic observations, these results suggest
that a rapid star formation quenching process is responsible for bimodal
distributions in both the Milky Way's stellar populations and in the general
galaxy population and thus plays a critical role in galaxy evolution.

galaxies remains to be fully explored, especially at high redshift. While often
understood as a consequence of self-regulation via AGN feedback, it can also be
explained by alternative SMBH accretion models. Here, we expand on previous
work by studying the growth of SMBHs with the help of a large suite of
cosmological zoom-in simulations (MassiveFIRE) that are part of the Feedback in
Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. The growth of SMBHs is modelled in
post-processing with different black hole accretion models, placements, and
merger treatments, and validated by comparing to on-the-fly calculations.
Scaling relations predicted by the gravitational torque driven accretion (GTDA)
model agree with observations at low redshift without the need for AGN
feedback, in contrast to models in which the accretion rate depends strongly on
SMBH mass. At high redshift, we find deviations from the local scaling
relations in line with previous theoretical results. In particular, SMBHs are
under-massive, presumably due to stellar feedback, but start to grow
efficiently once their host galaxies reach $M_* \sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We
analyse and explain these findings in the context of a simple analytic model.
Finally, we show that the predicted scaling relations depend sensitively on the
SMBH location and the efficiency of SMBH merging, particularly in low-mass
systems. These findings highlight the relevance of understanding the evolution
of SMBH-galaxy scaling relations to predict the rate of gravitational wave
signals from SMBH mergers across cosmic history.

correlated photon pairs entangled in polarization degree of freedom. The total
dimension of Hilbert space of the generated states grows exponentially as two
players take turns to place the stones in time series. As nondeterministic and
imperfect information games are more difficult to solve using nowadays
technology, we excitedly find that the inherent randomness in quantum physics
can bring the game nondeterministic trait, which does not exist in the
classical counterpart. Some quantum resources, like coherence or entanglement,
can also be encoded to represent the state of quantum stones. Adjusting the
quantum resource may vary the average imperfect information (as comparison
classical Go is a perfect information game) of a single game. We further verify
its non-deterministic feature by showing the unpredictability of the time
series data obtained from different classes of quantum state. Finally, by
comparing quantum Go with a few typical games that are widely studied in
artificial intelligence, we find that quantum Go can cover a wide range of game
difficulties rather than a single point. Our results establish a paradigm of
inventing new games with quantum-enabled difficulties by harnessing inherent

phase. However, this state can compete with more conventional spherical
harmonic pairings, such as an $s$-wave. We here demonstrate, within the
framework of the weak coupling mean-field BCS theory, that the monopole and a
conventional spherical harmonic SC quite generically coexist, while the
repulsion can take place when the absolute value of the monopole charge matches
the angular momentum quantum number of the spherical harmonic. As we show, this
feature is a direct consequence of the topological nature of the monopole SC,
and we dub it \emph{topological repulsion}. We illustrate the above principle
with the example of the conventional $s-$ and $(p_x\pm ip_y)-$wave pairings
competing with the monopole SC $Y_{-1,1,0}(\theta,\phi)$, which coexist in a
finite region of the parameter space, and repel, respectively. Furthermore, the
s-wave pairing is more stable both when the chemical potentials at the nodes
are unequal, and in the presence of point-like charged impurities. Since the
phase transition is discontinuous, close to the phase boundary, we predict that
the Majorana surface modes at the interfaces between domains featuring the
monopole and the trivial phases, such as an $s-$wave, will be the experimental
signature of the monopole SC.

Photoionization models demonstrate that the spread in CIII] among systems with
large sSFRs ([OIII]+H$\beta$ EW $>1500$ \r{A}) is driven by variations in
metallicity, a result of the extreme sensitivity of CIII] to electron

generally linked to low luminosity systems ($M_{\rm{UV}}>-19.5$) where low

super-massive black hole (SMBH) under feeding conditions that change over
timescales of days or months. However, the primary mechanism for generating
luminosity during the flares remains debated. Despite the increasing number of
observed TDEs, it is unclear whether most of the energy in the initial flare
comes from accretion near the gravitational radius or from circularizing debris
at larger distances from the SMBH. The energy dissipation efficiency increases
with decreasing radii, therefore by measuring the total energy emitted and
estimating the efficiency we can derive clues about the nature of the emission
mechanism. Here we calculate the integrated energy, emission timescales, and
average efficiencies for the TDEs using the Modular Open Source Fitter for
Transients ({\tt MOSFiT}). Our calculations of the total energy generally yield
higher values than previous estimates. This is predominantly because, if the
luminosity follows the mass fallback rate, TDEs release a significant fraction
of their energy long after their light curve peaks. We use {\tt MOSFiT} to
calculate the conversion efficiency from mass to radiated energy, and find that
for many of the events it is similar to efficiencies inferred for active
galactic nuclei. There are, however, large systematic uncertainties in the
measured efficiency due to model degeneracies between the efficiency and the
mass of the disrupted star, and these must be reduced before we can
definitively resolve the emission mechanism of individual TDEs.

However, such quantitative techniques require long acquisition times and
therefore cannot be straightforwardly translated to in utero brain
developmental studies. In clinical fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging
routine, 2D low-resolution T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences are used to
minimize the effects of unpredictable fetal motion during acquisition. As
super-resolution techniques make it possible to reconstruct a 3D
high-resolution volume of the fetal brain from clinical low-resolution images,
their combination with quantitative acquisition schemes could provide fast and
accurate T2 measurements. In this context, the present work demonstrates the
feasibility of using super-resolution reconstruction from conventional
T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences for 3D isotropic T2 mapping. A
quantitative magnetic resonance phantom was imaged using a clinical T2-weighted
fast spin echo sequence at variable echo time to allow for super-resolution
reconstruction at every echo time and subsequent T2 mapping of samples whose
relaxometric properties are close to those of fetal brain tissue. We
demonstrate that this approach is highly repeatable, accurate and robust when
using six echo times (total acquisition time under 9 minutes) as compared to
gold-standard single-echo spin echo sequences (several hours for one single 2D

two extraordinary phenomena in science: large-scale and high-throughput data
collection coupled with the creation and implementation of complex statistical
algorithms for data analysis. Together, these two phenomena have brought about
tremendous advances in scientific discovery but have also raised two serious
concerns, one relatively new and one quite familiar. The complexity of modern
data analyses raises questions about the reproducibility of the analyses,
meaning the ability of independent analysts to re-create the results claimed by
the original authors using the original data and analysis techniques. While
seemingly a straightforward concept, reproducibility of analyses is typically
thwarted by the lack of availability of the data and computer code that were
used in the analyses. A much more general concern is the replicability of
scientific findings, which concerns the frequency with which scientific claims
are confirmed by completely independent investigations. While the concepts of
reproduciblity and replicability are related, it is worth noting that they are
focused on quite different goals and address different aspects of scientific
progress. In this review, we will discuss the origins of reproducible research,
characterize the current status of reproduciblity in public health research,
and connect reproduciblity to current concerns about replicability of
scientific findings. Finally, we describe a path forward for improving both the
reproducibility and replicability of public health research in the future.

disentangle a clean saliency predictor from noisy training examples, where the
noisy labels are generated by unsupervised handcrafted feature-based methods.
The proposed model consists of two sub-models parameterized by neural networks:
(1) a saliency predictor that maps input images to clean saliency maps, and (2)
a noise generator, which is a latent variable model that produces noises from
Gaussian latent vectors. The whole model that represents noisy labels is a sum
of the two sub-models. The goal of training the model is to estimate the
parameters of both sub-models, and simultaneously infer the corresponding
latent vector of each noisy label. We propose to train the model by using an
alternating back-propagation (ABP) algorithm, which alternates the following
two steps: (1) learning back-propagation for estimating the parameters of two
sub-models by gradient ascent, and (2) inferential back-propagation for
inferring the latent vectors of training noisy examples by Langevin Dynamics.
To prevent the network from converging to trivial solutions, we utilize an
edge-aware smoothness loss to regularize hidden saliency maps to have similar
structures as their corresponding images. Experimental results on several
benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

that network quivers gently adapt to common neural network concepts such as
fully-connected layers, convolution operations, residual connections, batch
normalization, pooling operations and even randomly wired neural networks. We
show that this mathematical representation is by no means an approximation of
what neural networks are as it exactly matches reality. This interpretation is
algebraic and can be studied with algebraic methods. We also provide a quiver
representation model to understand how a neural network creates representations
from the data. We show that a neural network saves the data as quiver
representations, and maps it to a geometrical space called the moduli space,
which is given in terms of the underlying oriented graph of the network, i.e.,
its quiver. This results as a consequence of our defined objects and of
understanding how the neural network computes a prediction in a combinatorial

impact of antisite defects on the magnetism and electronic structure is studied
in MnSb$_2$Te$_4$. Mn-Sb site mixing leads to complex magnetic structures and
tunes the interlayer magnetic coupling between antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic. The detailed nonstoichiometry and site-mixing of MnSb$_2$Te$_4$

Single crystal neutron diffraction and electron microscopy studies show nearly
random distribution of the antisite defects. Band structure calculations
suggest that the Mn-Sb site-mixing favors a FM interlayer coupling, consistent
with experimental observation, but is detrimental to the band inversion
required for a nontrivial topology. Our results suggest a long range magnetic
order of Mn ions sitting on Bi sites in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. The effects of site

distribution function. To this end, we show that the relative cross-entropy of
the pair distribution function between a ""cold"" and a ""hot"" reference structure
correlates with their caloric curves, thus also presenting a quasi-first order
transition at the melting temperature. Finally, we demonstrate the fruitful
application of the proposed structural characterization method to identify the
melting temperature of nanoparticles in a strongly interacting environment,

a hazardous event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires the integration of a
multiplicity of scientific disciplines. The dynamics emerging from infodemics
have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns. In order to react
appropriately, it is of ultimate importance for the fields of Business and
Economics to understand the dynamics emerging from it. In the short run,
dynamics might lead to an adaptation in household spending or to a shift in
buying behavior towards online providers. In the long run, changes in
investments, consumer behavior, and markets are to be expected. We argue that
the dynamics emerge from complex interactions among multiple factors, such as
information and misinformation accessible for individuals and the formation and
revision of beliefs. (Mis)information accessible to individuals is, amongst
others, affected by algorithms specifically designed to provide personalized
information, while automated fact-checking algorithms can help reduce the
amount of circulating misinformation. The formation and revision of individual
(and probably false) beliefs and individual fact-checking and interpretation of
information are heavily affected by linguistic patterns inherent to information
during pandemics and infodemics and further factors, such as affect, intuition

this work, we propose the SeismoFlow a flow-based generative model to create

while not hurting the metric value for the other classes and thus observing the
overall accuracy improvement. Our empirical findings indicate that our method
can generate high-quality synthetic seismograms with realistic looking and
sufficient plurality to help the Miniception model to overcome the class

both the task of seismogram signal quality classification and class imbalance.

  Recommendation Through Calibration",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Popularity bias is a well-known phenomenon in recommender systems: popular
items are recommended even more frequently than their popularity would warrant,
amplifying long-tail effects already present in many recommendation domains.
Prior research has examined various approaches for mitigating popularity bias
and enhancing the recommendation of long-tail items overall. The effectiveness
of these approaches, however, has not been assessed in multistakeholder
environments where in addition to the users who receive the recommendations,
the utility of the suppliers of the recommended items should also be
considered. In this paper, we propose the concept of popularity calibration
which measures the match between the popularity distribution of items in a
user's profile and that of the recommended items. We also develop an algorithm
that optimizes this metric. In addition, we demonstrate that existing
evaluation metrics for popularity bias do not reflect the performance of the
algorithms when it is measured from the perspective of different stakeholders.
Using music and movie datasets, we empirically show that our approach
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in addressing popularity
bias by calibrating the recommendations to users' preferences. We also show
that our proposed algorithm has a secondary effect of improving supplier
fairness.

radiation in DLAs is varied in the wide range ($0.1-100$ units of Mathis

Methods have been developed to reduce FIB-induced strain, however these
protocols need to be evaluated for their effectiveness. Here we use
non-destructive Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to study the in situ
annealing of FIB-milled gold microcrystals. We simultaneously measure two
non-collinear reflections for two different crystals during a single annealing
cycle, demonstrating the ability to reliably track the location of multiple
Bragg peaks during thermal annealing. The thermal lattice expansion of each
crystal is used to calculate the local temperature. This is compared to
thermocouple readings, which are shown to be substantially affected by thermal
resistance. To evaluate the annealing process, we analyse each reflection by
considering facet area evolution, cross-correlation maps of displacement field
and binarised morphology, and average strain plots. The crystal's strain and
morphology evolve with increasing temperature, which is likely to be caused by
the diffusion of gallium in gold below ~280{\deg}C and the self-diffusion of
gold above ~280{\deg}C. The majority of FIB-induced strains are removed by
380-410\degree C, depending on which reflection is being considered. Our
observations highlight the importance of measuring multiple reflections to
unambiguously interpret material behaviour.

hybrid event occurs, the saltation matrix plays an analogous role as that of
the system dynamics, subsequently inducing a discrete modification to both the
prediction and update steps. The SKF outperforms a naive variational update -
the Jacobian of the reset map - by having a reduced mean squared error in state
estimation, especially immediately after a hybrid transition event. Compared a
hybrid particle filter, the particle filter outperforms the SKF in mean squared
error only when a large number of particles are used, likely due to a more
accurate accounting of the split distribution near a hybrid transition.

stiffness set to follow an unusual temperature dependence (decreasing with
decreasing temperature), this model fits all of our resistivity data well

slowly with increasing Fe content, similarly to the gap detected by inelastic
neutron scattering at Q1 = (1.4, 0, 0), suggesting a common origin. Such a

however, the explanation for such phenomenon is yet to be completed, as this
paper demonstrates that it is possible to overcome such disadvantage through
managerial planning and intervention (tactics), an effect so far absent in the
literature. To accomplish that, this study develops an integrative theoretical
model of team performance to explain HA based on prior literature, pushing its
limits to unfold the manager role in such a persistent pattern of performance
in soccer. Data on one decade of the national tournament of Brazil was obtained
from public sources, including information about matches and coaches of all 12
teams who played these competitions. Our conceptual modeling allows an
empirical analysis of HA and performance that covers the effects of tactics,
presence of supporters in matches and team fatigue via logistic regression. The
results confirm the HA in the elite division of Brazilian soccer across all
levels of comparative technical quality, a new variable introduced to control
for a potential technical gap between teams (something that would turn the
managerial influence null). Further analysis provides evidence that highlights
managerial capacity to block the HA effect above and beyond the influences of
fatigue (distance traveled) and density of people in the matches. This is the
case of coaches Abel Braga, Marcelo Fernandes and Roger Machado, who were
capable to reverse HA when playing against teams of similar quality. Overall,
the home advantage diminishes as the comparative quality increases but
disappears only when the two teams are of extremely different technical
quality.

them in the regime of hypercompact HII regions (HC HII's). Their
continuum-derived electron densities are in the range $n_{\rm e} \sim 10^4$ to

outflow. Similarly, 5 and 3 out of the 8 HC HII's still embedded in a compact

profiles of 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O), for barred and unbarred galaxies
separately, and find that the differences in slope between barred and unbarred
galaxies depend on galaxy luminosity. This is due to a different dependence of
the abundance gradients (in dex/kpc) on luminosity for the two types of
galaxies: In the galaxy sample that we consider the gradients appear to be
considerably shallower for strongly barred galaxies in the whole luminosity
range, while profile slopes for unbarred galaxies become steeper with
decreasing luminosity. Therefore, we only detect differences in slope for the
lower luminosity (lower mass) galaxies (M_B >~ -19.5 or M_* <~ 10^{10.4}
M_sun). We discuss the results in terms of the disc evolution and radial mixing
induced by bars and spiral arms. Our results reconcile previous discrepant

Understanding the nanopatterning of elemental semiconductors, particularly

and technological interest itself. This is the second component of a two-part
investigation of the kinetics and fluctuation dynamics of self-organized
nanoscale ripple development on silicon during 1 keV Ar$^+$ (Part I) and Kr$^+$
bombardment. Here, it's found that the ion-enhanced viscous flow relaxation is
essentially equal for Kr$^+$-induced patterning as previously found for Ar$^+$
patterning. The magnitude of the surface curvature dependent roughening rate in
the early stage kinetics is larger for Kr$^+$ than for Ar$^+$, qualitatively
consistent with expectations for erosive and mass redistributive contributions
to the initial surface instability. As with the Ar$^+$ case, fluctuation
dynamics in the late stage show a peak in correlation time at the length scale
corresponding to the dominant structural feature on the surface -- the ripples.
Analogy is made to the phenomenon of de Gennes narrowing in liquids, but
significant differences are also pointed out. Finally, it's shown that speckle
motion during the surface evolution can be analyzed to determine spatial
inhomogeneities in erosion rate and ripple velocity on the surface. This allows
the direction and speed of ripple motion to be measured in real time, a unique
capability for measuring these fundamental parameters outside the specialized
environment of FIB/SEM systems.

single image super resolution (SR). Unlike previous loss functions used to
train SR models, which are all calculated in the pixel (spatial) domain, FDPL
is computed in the frequency domain. By working in the frequency domain we can
encourage a given model to learn a mapping that prioritizes those frequencies
most related to human perception. While the goal of FDPL is not to maximize the
Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), we found that there is a correlation between
decreasing FDPL and increasing PSNR. Training a model with FDPL results in a
higher average PSRN (30.94), compared to the same model trained with pixel loss
(30.59), as measured on the Set5 image dataset. We also show that our method
achieves higher qualitative results, which is the goal of a perceptual loss
function. However, it is not clear that the improved perceptual quality is due
to the slightly higher PSNR or the perceptual nature of FDPL.

initial factorization assumptions.
  I apply these techniques to a study of voter behavior using a
high-dimensional application of the popular approach of multilevel regression
and post-stratification (MRP). Existing estimation took hours whereas the

eruptions of a small (30\arcsec) filament (SF) and its consequences while
interacting with the ambient magnetic features including a large (300\arcsec)
filament (LF). The eruptions of the SF drive a two-side-loop jet that is a
result of magnetic reconnection between the SF threads and an over-lying
magnetic channel. As a consequence of the eruption, the heating in the
footpoints of the SF destabilises the barbs of the LF rooted nearby. Supersonic
chromospheric plasma flows along the barbs of the LF are then observed in the
\halpha\ passband and they apparently feed materials to the LF. We suggest they
are shock-driven plasma flows or chromospheric evaporations, which both can be
the consequences of the heating in the chromosphere by nonthermal particles
generated in the magnetic reconnection associated with the two-side-loop jet.
Our observations demonstrate that the destabilisation in the vicinity of the
footpoints of a barb can drive chromospheric plasma feeding to the filament.

outbreak in more than 200 countries around the world, leading to a severe
impact on the health and life of many people globally. As of mid-July 2020,
more than 12 million people were infected, and more than 570,000 death were
reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as an alternative to the
time-consuming RT-PCR test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we propose a
segmentation framework to detect chest regions in CT images, which are infected
by COVID-19. We use an architecture similar to U-Net model, and train it to
detect ground glass regions, on pixel level. As the infected regions tend to
form a connected component (rather than randomly distributed pixels), we add a
suitable regularization term to the loss function, to promote connectivity of
the segmentation map for COVID-19 pixels. 2D-anisotropic total-variation is
used for this purpose, and therefore the proposed model is called ""TV-UNet"".
Through experimental results on a relatively large-scale CT segmentation
dataset of around 900 images, we show that adding this new regularization term
leads to 2\% gain on overall segmentation performance compared to the U-Net
model. Our experimental analysis, ranging from visual evaluation of the
predicted segmentation results to quantitative assessment of segmentation
performance (precision, recall, Dice score, and mIoU) demonstrated great
ability to identify COVID-19 associated regions of the lungs, achieving a mIoU
rate of over 99\%, and a Dice score of around 86\%.

phenomenological model suited to all $SU(3)$ mesonic two-body final state
interactions up to energies around 2 GeV. It is aimed at replacing those
entering the old isobar model, produced in the 1960's, long before the
development of QCD. The only similarity between our new proposal and amplitudes
used in the isobar model concern vector resonances in the elastic regime. In
other situations, especially those involving scalar resonances and coupled
channels, the isobar model is not compatible with post-QCD dynamics. In order
to support these claims convincingly and to motivate our approach, we consider
applications to the $\pi \pi $ amplitude and compare our version with the
isobar model in several different instances. We also show that the new model
provides a clear indication of the mechanism responsible for the sharp rise
observed in the $\pi\pi$ phase around $1\,$ GeV. The phenomenological
amplitudes proposed here are suited to any number of resonances in a given
channel and rely just on masses and coupling constants as free parameters.
Concerning theory, they incorporate chiral symmetry at low energies, include
coupled channels and respect unitarity whenever appropriate.

based on tree rearrangement operations. Under any such operation, the problem
is reduced to searching a graph where vertices are trees and (undirected) edges
are given by pairs of trees connected by one rearrangement operation (sometimes
called a move). Most popular are the classical nearest neighbour interchange,
subtree prune and regraft, and tree bisection and reconnection moves. The
problem of computing distances, however, is NP-hard in each of these graphs,
making tree inference and comparison algorithms challenging to design in
practice.
  Although ranked phylogenetic trees are one of the central objects of interest
in applications such as cancer research, immunology, and epidemiology, the
computational complexity of the shortest path problem for these trees remained
unsolved for decades. In this paper, we settle this problem for the ranked
nearest neighbour interchange operation by establishing that the complexity
depends on the weight difference between the two types of tree rearrangements
(rank moves and edge moves), and varies from quadratic, which is the lowest
possible complexity for this problem, to NP-hard, which is the highest. In
particular, our result provides the first example of a phylogenetic tree
rearrangement operation for which shortest paths, and hence the distance, can
be computed efficiently. Specifically, our algorithm scales to trees with
thousands of leaves (and likely hundreds of thousands if implemented
efficiently).
  We also connect the problem of computing distances in our graph of ranked
trees with the well-known version of this problem on unranked trees by
introducing a parameter for the weight difference between move types. We
propose to study a family of shortest path problems indexed by this parameter
with computational complexity varying from quadratic to NP-hard.

of the molecular content in planetary nebulae (PNe). As these lines are
produced in different regions, the slit configuration used in spectroscopic
observations may have an important effect on their ratio. In this work,
observations and numerical simulations are used to demonstrate and quantify
such effect in PNe. The study aims to assist the interpretation of observations
and their comparison to models. The analysis shows that observed R(Br$\gamma$)
ratios reach only values up to 0.3 when the slit encompasses the entire nebula.
Values higher than that are only obtained when the slit covers a limited region
around the H$_2$ peak emission and the Br$\gamma$ emission is then minimised.
The numerical simulations presented show that, when the effect of the slit
configuration is taken into account, photoionization models can reproduce the
whole range of observed R(Br$\gamma$) in PNe, as well as the behaviour
described above. The argument that shocks are needed to explain the higher
values of R(Br$\gamma$) is thus not valid. Therefore, this ratio is not a good
indicator of the H$_2$ excitation mechanism as suggested in the literature.

on the topic, we do not require sparsity of the regression coefficients;
instead, our main structural assumption is a decay of eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix of the data. We propose a new family of estimators, called
the canonical thresholding estimators, which pick largest regression
coefficients in the canonical form. The estimators admit an explicit form and
can be linked to LASSO and Principal Component Regression (PCR). A theoretical
analysis for both fixed design and random design settings is provided. Obtained
bounds on the mean squared error and the prediction error of a specific
estimator from the family allow to clearly state sufficient conditions on the
decay of eigenvalues to ensure convergence. In addition, we promote the use of
the relative errors, strongly linked with the out-of-sample $R^2$. The study of
these relative errors leads to a new concept of joint effective dimension,
which incorporates the covariance of the data and the regression coefficients
simultaneously, and describes the complexity of a linear regression problem.
Some minimax lower bounds are established to showcase the optimality of our
procedure. Numerical simulations confirm good performance of the proposed
estimators compared to the previously developed methods.

information on the environment properties and whether Lyalpha emitters show
different characteristics as a function of their environment. We estimated
local densities in the VANDELS Chandra Deep Field-South (CDFS) and UKIDSS Ultra
Deep Survey (UDS) fields, by using a three-dimensional algorithm which works in
the RA-dec-redshift space. We selected a sample of 131 Lyalpha-emitting
galaxies (EW(Lyalpha)>0 A), unbiased with respect to environmental density, to
study their location with respect to the over- or under-dense environment. We
identify 13 (proto)cluster candidates in the CDFS and nine in the UDS at 2<z<4,
based on photometric and spectroscopic redshifts from VANDELS and from all the
available literature. No significant difference is observed in the rest-frame
U-V color between field and galaxies located within the identified
overdensities. We find that VANDELS Lyalpha emitters (LAEVs) lie preferentially
outside of overdense regions as the majority of the galaxies with spectroscopic
redshifts from VANDELS. The LAEVs in overdense regions tend to have low Lyalpha
equivalent widths and low specific SFRs, and they also tend to be more massive
than the LAEVs in the field. Their stacked Lyalpha profile shows a dominant red
peak and a hint of a blue peak. Our results show that LAEVs are likely to be
influenced by the environment and favour a scenario with outflows of low
expansion velocities and high HI column densities for galaxies in overdense
regions. An outflow with low expansion velocity could be related to the way
galaxies are forming stars in overdense regions; the high HI column density can
be a consequence of the gravitational potential of the overdensity. Therefore,
Lyalpha-emitting galaxies can provide useful insights on the environment in
which they reside.

an agent should take when outside the state distribution of the demonstrations.
Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) can enable generalization to new states by
learning a parameterized reward function, but these approaches still face
uncertainty over the true reward function and corresponding optimal policy.
Existing safe imitation learning approaches based on IRL deal with this
uncertainty using a maxmin framework that optimizes a policy under the
assumption of an adversarial reward function, whereas risk-neutral IRL
approaches either optimize a policy for the mean or MAP reward function. While
completely ignoring risk can lead to overly aggressive and unsafe policies,
optimizing in a fully adversarial sense is also problematic as it can lead to
overly conservative policies that perform poorly in practice. To provide a
bridge between these two extremes, we propose Bayesian Robust Optimization for
Imitation Learning (BROIL). BROIL leverages Bayesian reward function inference
and a user specific risk tolerance to efficiently optimize a robust policy that
balances expected return and conditional value at risk. Our empirical results
show that BROIL provides a natural way to interpolate between return-maximizing
and risk-minimizing behaviors and outperforms existing risk-sensitive and
risk-neutral inverse reinforcement learning algorithms. Code is available at

luminous and embedded in sufficiently dense ISM, they will be surrounded by
extended nebular emission. These nebulae should persist even long after a SN Ia
explosion, due to the long recombination and cooling times involved. With this
in mind, we searched for nebular [O III] emission around four SSSs and three
SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using the 6.5m Baade telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory and the IMACS camera. We confirm that, out of the four SSS
candidates, only CAL 83 can be associated with an [O III] nebula. The [O III]
luminosity for the other objects are constrained to $\lesssim 17\%$ of that of
CAL 83 at 6.8 pc from the central source. Models computed with the
photoionization code CLOUDY indicate that either the ISM densities in the
environments of CAL 87, RX J0550.0-7151 and RX J0513.9-6951 must be
significantly lower than surrounding CAL 83, or the average X-ray luminosities

N$_2$D$^+$, DNC) have high detection rates, suggesting that most of the cores
are chemically evolved. The deuterium fraction (D/H) is found to decrease with
increasing distance, indicating that it suffers from differential beam dilution
between the D/H pair of lines for distant cores ($>$1 kpc). For $\lambda$
Orionis, Orion A, and B located at similar distances, D/H is not significantly
different, suggesting that there is no systematic difference in the observed
chemical properties among these three regions. We identify at least eight high
D/H cores in the Orion region and two at high latitudes, which are most likely
to be close to the onset of star formation. There is no clear evidence of the

sophisticated attackers. Although APT activities are stealthy, they interact
with the system components and these interactions lead to information flows.
Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) has been proposed as one of the
effective ways to detect APTs using the information flows. However, wide range
security analysis using DIFT results in a significant increase in performance
overhead and high rates of false-positives and false-negatives generated by
DIFT. In this paper, we model the strategic interaction between APT and DIFT as
a non-cooperative stochastic game. The game unfolds on a state space
constructed from an information flow graph (IFG) that is extracted from the
system log. The objective of the APT in the game is to choose transitions in
the IFG to find an optimal path in the IFG from an entry point of the attack to
an attack target. On the other hand, the objective of DIFT is to dynamically
select nodes in the IFG to perform security analysis for detecting APT. Our
game model has imperfect information as the players do not have information
about the actions of the opponent. We consider two scenarios of the game (i)
when the false-positive and false-negative rates are known to both players and
(ii) when the false-positive and false-negative rates are unknown to both
players. Case (i) translates to a game model with complete information and we
propose a value iteration-based algorithm and prove the convergence. Case (ii)
translates to a game with unknown transition probabilities. In this case, we
propose Hierarchical Supervised Learning (HSL) algorithm that integrates a
neural network, to predict the value vector of the game, with a policy
iteration algorithm to compute an approximate equilibrium. We implemented our

Building physical systems with collective computational ability and distributed

present a continuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) approach where the
ground-state solution appears as stable points or attractor states of the CTDS.
We harness the emergent dynamics of a network of phase-transition
nano-oscillators (PTNO) to build an Ising Hamiltonian solver. The hardware
fabric comprises of electrically coupled injection-locked stochastic PTNOs with
bi-stable phases emulating artificial Ising spins. We demonstrate the ability
of the stochastic PTNO-CTDS to progressively find more optimal solution by
increasing the strength of the injection-locking signal - akin to performing
classical annealing. We demonstrate in silico that the PTNO-CTDS prototype
solves a benchmark non-deterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard Max-Cut problem
with high probability of success. Using experimentally calibrated numerical
simulations and incorporating non-idealities, we investigate the performance of
our Ising Hamiltonian solver on dense Max-Cut problems with increasing graph
size. We report a high energy-efficiency of 1.3x10^7 solutions/sec/Watt for
100-node dense Max-cut problems which translates to a 5x improvement over the
recently demonstrated memristor-based Hopfield network and several orders of
magnitude improvement over other candidates such as CPU and GPU, quantum
annealer and photonic Ising solver approaches. Such an energy efficient
hardware exhibiting high solution-throughput/Watt can find applications in
industrial planning and manufacturing, defense and cyber-security,

understanding the behaviour of optimization algorithms and can even provide a

image-based visualization framework, without dimension reduction, that
visualizes the solutions to large-scale global optimization problems as images
is proposed. In the proposed framework, the pixels visualize decision variables
while the entire image represents the overall solution quality. This framework
affords a number of benefits over existing visualization techniques including
enhanced scalability (in terms of the number of decision variables),
facilitation of standard image processing techniques, providing nearly infinite
benchmark cases, and explicit alignment with human perception. Furthermore,
image-based visualization can be used to visualize the optimization process in
real-time, thereby allowing the user to ascertain characteristics of the search
process as it is progressing. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is
the first realization of a dimension-preserving, scalable visualization
framework that embeds the inherent relationship between decision space and
objective space. The proposed framework is utilized with 10 different mapping
schemes on an image-reconstruction problem that encompass continuous, discrete,
binary, combinatorial, constrained, dynamic, and multi-objective optimization.
The proposed framework is then demonstrated on arbitrary benchmark problems
with known optima. Experimental results elucidate the flexibility and
demonstrate how valuable information about the search process can be gathered
via the proposed visualization framework.

qualitatively different behavior under intervention: cycles cause feedback
loops when the downstream effect of an intervention propagates back to the
source variable. We present three theoretical observations about probability
distributions with self-referential factorizations, i.e. distributions that
could be graphically represented with a cycle. First, we prove that
self-referential distributions in two variables are, in fact, independent.
Second, we prove that self-referential distributions in N variables have zero

well-known adversarial input example attack. Recently, another dimension of
adversarial attack, namely, attack on DNN weight parameters, has been shown to
be very powerful. As a representative one, the Bit-Flip-based adversarial
weight Attack (BFA) injects an extremely small amount of faults into weight
parameters to hijack the executing DNN function. Prior works of BFA focus on
un-targeted attack that can hack all inputs into a random output class by
flipping a very small number of weight bits stored in computer memory. This
paper proposes the first work of targeted BFA based (T-BFA) adversarial weight
attack on DNNs, which can intentionally mislead selected inputs to a target
output class. The objective is achieved by identifying the weight bits that are
highly associated with classification of a targeted output through a
class-dependent weight bit ranking algorithm. Our proposed T-BFA performance is
successfully demonstrated on multiple DNN architectures for image
classification tasks. For example, by merely flipping 27 out of 88 million
weight bits of ResNet-18, our T-BFA can misclassify all the images from 'Hen'
class into 'Goose' class (i.e., 100 % attack success rate) in ImageNet dataset,
while maintaining 59.35 % validation accuracy. Moreover, we successfully
demonstrate our T-BFA attack in a real computer prototype system running DNN

sized 4-pentyl-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (5CB) droplets in an aqueous solution of
tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) as surfactant is considered. It is
shown that addition of glycerol causes the active 5CB droplet to exhibit a
transition from smooth to jittery motion. The motion is found to be independent
of the droplet size and the nematic state of 5CB. Analogous experiments with
Polyacrylamide (PAAm), Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA),
as solutes confirm that such a transition cannot merely be explained solely
based on the viscosity or Peclet number of the system. We propose that the
specific nature of physicochemical interactions between the solute and the
droplet interface is at the root of this transition. The experiments show that
the time-scales associated with the influx and redistribution of surfactants at
the interface are altered in the presence of solutes. Glycerol and PVP
significantly enhance the rate of solubilization of the 5CB droplets resulting
in a quicker re-distribution of the adsorbed TTAB molecules on the interface,
causing the droplet to momentarily stop and then restart in an independent
direction. On the other hand, low solubilization rates in the presence of PAAm
and PVA lead to smooth trajectories. Our hypothesis is supported by the time
evolution of droplet size and interfacial velocity measurements in the presence
and absence of solute. Overall, our results provide fundamental insights into
the complex interactions emerging due to the presence of solutes.

crossing region and as a first application of this development, high-spin band
structures recently observed in odd-odd $^{194-200}$Tl isotopes are
investigated. In some of these isotopes, the doublet band structures observed

needs on e-commerce websites. Products are typically annotated with one of
several broad categorical tags, such as ""Clothing"" or ""Electronics"", as well as
finer-grained categories like ""Refrigerator"" or ""TV"", both under ""Electronics"".
These tags are used to construct a hierarchy of query categories. Distributions
of features such as price and brand popularity vary wildly across query
categories. In addition, feature importance for the purpose of CTR/CVR
predictions differs from one category to another. In this work, we leverage the
Mixture of Expert (MoE) framework to learn a ranking model that specializes for
each query category. In particular, our gate network relies solely on the
category ids extracted from the user query. While classical MoE's pick expert
towers spontaneously for each input example, we explore two techniques to
establish more explicit and transparent connections between the experts and
query categories. To help differentiate experts on their domain specialties, we
introduce a form of adversarial regularization among the expert outputs,
forcing them to disagree with one another. As a result, they tend to approach
each prediction problem from different angles, rather than copying one another.
This is validated by a much stronger clustering effect of the gate output
vectors under different categories. In addition, soft gating constraints based
on the categorical hierarchy are imposed to help similar products choose
similar gate values. and make them more likely to share similar experts. This
allows aggregation of training data among smaller sibling categories to
overcome data scarcity.

to create geo-magnetic disturbances. Substorms are geo-magnetic disturbances of
shorter duration (few hours or less) which are mainly concentrated in the
auroral region and originates due to the ionospheric current injection at high
latitudes. Supersubstorm are intense substorms as identified by peak activities
in geo-magnetic indices. In this thesis, we have investigated the energy
dynamics during the supersubstorm and analyzed the relation of the energy
components with different geo-magnetic indices and interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF) components. In particular, the solar wind energy levels and the
energy coupled into the magnetosphere as captured by the Akasofu parameter are
studied. A qualitative analysis of the computed energy and its relationship
with different geo-magnetic indices is presented. Correlation and
cross-correlation analysis have been used to get insights into the nature of
the relationship between the energy components and indices. This for example
uncovered the negative relationship between the solar wind energy and the
Akasofu parameter. A summary analysis of the supersubstorm event in comparison
with the quiet phases are made. This has led to insights for example showing
the higher energy levels during supersubstorm and different energy ratios

the empirical Bellman dynamics in distributional reinforcement learning (RL), a
class of state-of-the-art methods that estimate the distribution, as opposed to
only the expectation, of the total return. We formulate a method that learns a
finite set of statistics from each return distribution via neural networks, as
in (Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos 2017; Dabney et al. 2018b). Existing
distributional RL methods however constrain the learned statistics to
\emph{predefined} functional forms of the return distribution which is both
restrictive in representation and difficult in maintaining the predefined
statistics. Instead, we learn \emph{unrestricted} statistics, i.e.,
deterministic (pseudo-)samples, of the return distribution by leveraging a
technique from hypothesis testing known as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD),
which leads to a simpler objective amenable to backpropagation. Our method can
be interpreted as implicitly matching all orders of moments between a return
distribution and its Bellman target. We establish sufficient conditions for the
contraction of the distributional Bellman operator and provide finite-sample
analysis for the deterministic samples in distribution approximation.
Experiments on the suite of Atari games show that our method outperforms the
standard distributional RL baselines and sets a new record in the Atari games

a machine learning prediction model that works universally well across

proprietary, i.e., neither the model parameter nor the data set used for model
training is accessible. In consequence, leveraging the knowledge hidden in the
available model (aka. the hypothesis) and adapting it to a local data set
becomes extremely challenging. Motivated by this situation, in this paper we
aim to address such a specific case within the hypothesis transfer learning
framework, in which 1) the source hypothesis is a black-box model and 2) the
source domain data is unavailable. In particular, we introduce a novel
algorithm called dynamic knowledge distillation for hypothesis transfer
learning (dkdHTL). In this method, we use knowledge distillation with
instance-wise weighting mechanism to adaptively transfer the ""dark"" knowledge
from the source hypothesis to the target domain.The weighting coefficients of
the distillation loss and the standard loss are determined by the consistency
between the predicted probability of the source hypothesis and the target
ground-truth label.Empirical results on both transfer learning benchmark

Coordination is required also for identifying discovered and disclosed software

observes the historical time delays between the assignment of CVEs on a mailing
list and the later appearance of these in the National Vulnerability Database
(NVD). Drawing from research on software engineering coordination, software
vulnerabilities, and bug tracking, the delays are modeled through three
dimensions: social networks and communication practices, tracking
infrastructures, and the technical characteristics of the CVEs coordinated.
Method: Given a period between 2008 and 2016, a sample of over five thousand
CVEs is used to model the delays with nearly fifty explanatory metrics.
Regression analysis is used for the modeling. Results: The results show that
the CVE coordination delays are affected by different abstractions for noise
and prerequisite constraints. These abstractions convey effects from the social
network and infrastructure dimensions. Particularly strong effect sizes are
observed for annual and monthly control metrics, a control metric for weekends,
the degrees of the nodes in the CVE coordination networks, and the number of
references given in NVD for the CVEs archived. Smaller but visible effects are
present for metrics measuring the entropy of the emails exchanged, traces to
bug tracking systems, and other related aspects. The empirical signals are
weaker for the technical characteristics. Conclusion: [...]

as a convex relaxation of the non-convex rank minimization. However, NNM tends
to over-shrink the rank components and treats the different rank components
equally, limiting its flexibility in practical applications. We use a more
flexible model, namely the Weighted Schatten p-Norm Minimization (WSNM), to
generalize the NNM to the Schatten p-norm minimization with weights assigned to
different singular values. The proposed WSNM not only gives a better
approximation to the original low-rank assumption but also considers the
importance of different rank components. In this paper, a comparison of the
low-rank recovery performance of two LRMA algorithms- RPCA and WSNM is brought
out on occluded human facial images. The analysis is performed on facial images
from the Yale database and over own database , where different facial
expressions, spectacles, varying illumination account for the facial
occlusions. The paper also discusses the prominent trends observed from the
experimental results performed through the application of these algorithms. As
low-rank images sometimes might fail to capture the details of a face
adequately, we further propose a novel method to use the image-histogram of the
sparse images thus obtained to identify the individual in any given image.
Extensive experimental results show, both qualitatively and quantitatively,
that WSNM surpasses RPCA in its performance more effectively by removing facial
occlusions, thus giving recovered low-rank images of higher PSNR and SSIM.

algorithms. This procedure allows a shortcut in designing new PSDMF algorithms,
as it allows to leverage some of the useful numerical properties of existing PR

new family of PSDMF algorithms based on iterative hard thresholding (IHT). This
family subsumes previously-proposed projected gradient PSDMF methods. We show
that there is high variability among PSDMF optimization problems that makes it
beneficial to try a number of methods based on different principles to tackle

independence-comonotonicity balance (IC-balance) and the price for validity. In
particular, IC-balanced methods always produce an identical critical value for
independent and perfectly positively dependent p-values, a specific type of
insensitivity to a family of dependence assumptions. We show that, among two

both supervised and unsupervised tasks: the parents point out few important
concepts, but then the children fill in the gaps on their own. This is
particularly effective, because supervised learning can never be exhaustive and
thus learning autonomously allows to discover invariances and regularities that
help to generalize. In this paper we propose to apply a similar approach to the
problem of object recognition across domains: our model learns the semantic
labels in a supervised fashion, and broadens its understanding of the data by
learning from self-supervised signals on the same images. This secondary task
helps the network to focus on object shapes, learning concepts like spatial
orientation and part correlation, while acting as a regularizer for the
classification task over multiple visual domains. Extensive experiments confirm
our intuition and show that our multi-task method combining supervised and
self-supervised knowledge shows competitive results with respect to more
complex domain generalization and adaptation solutions. It also proves its
potential in the novel and challenging predictive and partial domain adaptation
scenarios.

variational hybrid quantum-classical scheme, which remains largely unknown due
to the non-convex optimization landscape, the measurement error, and the
unavoidable gate errors introduced by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
machines. Our contributions in this paper are multi-fold. First, we derive the
utility bounds of QNN towards empirical risk minimization, and show that large
gate noise, few quantum measurements, and deep circuit depth will lead to the
poor utility bounds. This result also applies to the variational quantum
circuits with gradient-based classical optimization, and can be of independent
interest. We then prove that QNN can be treated as a differentially private
(DP) model. Thirdly, we show that if a concept class can be efficiently learned
by QNN, then it can also be effectively learned by QNN even with gate noise.
This result implies the same learnability of QNN whether it is implemented on
noiseless or noisy quantum machines. We last exhibit that the quantum
statistical query (QSQ) model can be effectively simulated by noisy QNN. Since
the QSQ model can tackle certain tasks with runtime speedup, our result
suggests that the modified QNN implemented on NISQ devices will retain the
quantum advantage. Numerical simulations support the theoretical results.

the onset of a weak resistivity upturn below 2 K which is linked to the onset

establish that a cross-over from PTC to NTC on cooling does not necessarily

\sigma_{0} though small (<10 S/cm) is finite, signalling the existence of a bad

imprecisions. Using parameters to control the degree of imprecision, imprecise

a group of measures are defined to evaluate the different impacts

evaluations to compare prediction results based on the data from the original
dataset and the corresponding ones generated from the proposed precision model

AntLer chooses the control parameters such that the expected cost of the

detection to segmentation, or cluster shape priors for segmenting novel

Specifically, we parse two types of commonalities: 1) shape commonalities which
are learned by performing supervised learning on instance boundary prediction;
and 2) appearance commonalities which are captured by modeling pairwise
affinities among pixels of feature maps to optimize the separability between
instance and the background. Incorporating both the shape and appearance

how AI technologies are used: i) content creation, ii) information analysis,
iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, iv) information

successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these

its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near

successes of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is
the `creator', remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win
awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also
limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the

its focus is human centric -- where it is designed to augment, rather than

frame as well as hidden and memory features that are passed to the next frame.
Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that our algorithm outperforms the
traditional frame by frame approach by 7.5% mAP@0.7 and other multi-frame

magnetic equilibrium configurations have been shown to be unstable on a short
time scale against an infinitesimal perturbation. Given this instability, it is
relevant to consider how more realistic neutron star physics affects the
outcome. In particular, it makes sense to ask if elasticity, which provides an
additional restoring force on the perturbations, may stabilise the system. It
is well-known that the matter in the neutron star crust forms an ionic crystal.
The interactions between the crystallized nuclei can generate shear stress
against any applied strain. To incorporate the effect of the crust on the

relationships between human and objects in an image. It is challenging because
an enormous number of possible combinations of objects and verbs types forms a
long-tail distribution. We devise a deep Visual Compositional Learning (VCL)
framework, which is a simple yet efficient framework to effectively address
this problem. VCL first decomposes an HOI representation into object and verb
specific features, and then composes new interaction samples in the feature
space via stitching the decomposed features. The integration of decomposition
and composition enables VCL to share object and verb features among different
HOI samples and images, and to generate new interaction samples and new types
of HOI, and thus largely alleviates the long-tail distribution problem and
benefits low-shot or zero-shot HOI detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed VCL can effectively improve the generalization of HOI
detection on HICO-DET and V-COCO and outperforms the recent state-of-the-art
methods on HICO-DET. Code is available at https://github.com/zhihou7/VCL.

spectral efficiency of multi-user wireless networks than orthogonal multiples
access (OMA). Previous work has established the condition, referred to
quasi-degradation (QD) probability, under which NOMA has no performance loss
compared to the capacity-achieving dirty paper coding for the two-user case.
Existing results assume Rayleigh fading channels without line-of-sight (LOS).
In many practical scenarios, the channel LOS component is critical to the link
quality where the channel gain follows a Rician distribution instead of a
Rayleigh distribution. In this work, we analyze the QD probability over
multi-input and single-output (MISO) channels subject to Rician fading. The QD
probability heavily depends on the angle between two user channels, which
involves a matrix quadratic form in random vectors and a stochastic matrix.
With the deterministic LOS component, the distribution of the matrix quadratic
form is non-central that dramatically complicates the derivation of the QD
probability. To remedy this difficulty, a series of approximations is proposed
that yields a closed-form expression for the QD probability over MISO Rician
channels. Numerical results are presented to assess the analysis accuracy and
get insights into the optimality of NOMA over Rician fading channels.

to some stochastic dynamics, undergoes random interruptions that bring it to a
selected domain, and then, the process recommences. Hitherto, the resetting
mechanism has been introduced as a symmetric reset about the preferred
location. However, in nature, there are several instances where a system can
only reset from certain directions, e.g., catastrophic events. Motivated by
this, we consider a continuous stochastic process on the positive real line.
The process is interrupted at random times occurring at a constant rate, and
then, the former relocates to a value only if the current one exceeds a
threshold; otherwise, it follows the trajectory defined by the underlying
process without resetting. We present a general framework to obtain the exact
non-equilibrium steady state of the system and the mean first passage time for
the system to reach the origin. Employing this framework, we obtain the
explicit solutions for two different model systems. Some of the classical
results found in symmetric resetting such as the existence of an optimal
resetting, are strongly modified. Finally, numerical simulations have been
performed to verify the analytical findings, showing an excellent agreement.

the regime in which a model binary soft matter mixture forms quasicrystals. The
system is described using classical density functional theory combined with
integral equation theory. Quasicrystal formation requires particle ordering
with two characteristic lengthscales in certain particular ratios. How the
lengthscales are related to the form of the pair interactions is reasonably
well understood for one component systems, but less is known for mixtures. In
our model mixture of big and small colloids confined to an interface, the two
lengthscales stem from the range of the interactions between pairs of big
particles and from the cross big-small interactions, respectively. The
small-small lengthscale is not significant. Our strategy for finding
quasicrystals involves tuning locations of maxima in the dispersion relation,
or equivalently in the liquid state partial static structure factors.

plan trajectories in uncertain environments, e.g., for autonomous vehicles.
Chance constraints ensure that the probability of collision is bounded by a
predefined risk parameter. However, considering chance constraints in an
optimization problem can be challenging and computationally demanding. In this
paper, we present a grid-based Stochastic Model Predictive Control approach.
This approach allows to determine a simple deterministic reformulation of the
chance constraints and reduces the computational effort, while considering the
stochastic nature of the environment. Within the proposed method, we first
divide the environment into a grid and, for each predicted step, assign each
cell a probability value, which represents the probability that this cell will
be occupied by surrounding vehicles. Then, the probabilistic grid is
transformed into a binary grid of admissible and inadmissible cells by applying
a threshold, representing a risk parameter. Only cells with an occupancy
probability lower than the threshold are admissible for the controlled vehicle.
Given the admissible cells, a convex hull is generated, which can then be used
for trajectory planning. Simulations of an autonomous driving highway scenario
show the benefits of the proposed grid-based Stochastic Model Predictive
Control method.

lightest element in the periodic table, hydrogen. One of the most striking
properties of molecular hydrogen is the coupling between molecular rotational
properties and nuclear spin orientations, giving rise to the spin isomers
ortho- and para-hydrogen. At high pressure, as intermolecular interactions
increase significantly, the free rotation of H2 molecules is increasingly
hindered, and consequently a modification of the coupling between molecular
rotational properties and the nuclear spin system can be anticipated. To date,
high-pressure experimental methods have not been able to observe nuclear spin
states at pressures approaching 100 GPa and consequently the effect of high
pressure on the nuclear spin statistics could not be directly measured. Here,
we present in-situ high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance data on molecular
hydrogen in its hexagonal phase I up to 123 GPa at room temperature. While our
measurements confirm the presence of I=1 ortho-hydrogen at low pressures, above
70 GPa, where inter- and intramolecular distances become comparable, we observe
a crossover in the nuclear spin statistics from a spin-1 quadrupolar to a
spin-1/2 dipolar system, evidencing the loss of spin isomer distinction. These
observations represent a unique case of a nuclear spin crossover phenomenon in
quantum solids.

many systems undergo phase transitions related to an electronic instability, in
the absence of a symmetry-breaking and eventually described through the
evolution of a totally symmetric order parameter q linearly coupled to volume
change. Analyzing the coupling of a non-symmetry-breaking electronic
instability, responsible for volume strain, to symmetry-breaking phenomena is
of importance for many systems in nature and here we show that the
symmetry-allowed qh2 coupling plays a central role. We use as case study the
rubidium manganese hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue analogue, exhibiting phase
transitions with hysteresis that may exceed 100 K, and based on intermetallic
charge transfer (CT). During the phase transition, the intermetallic CT
described through the evolution of q is coupled to cubic-tetragonal
ferroelastic symmetry-breaking described through the evolution of h. In this
system, the symmetry-breaking and non-symmetry breaking deformations have
similar amplitudes but the large volume strain is mainly due to CT. We analyze
both the ferroelastic and the CT features of the phase transition within the
frame of the Landau theory, taking into account the qh2 coupling, stabilizing
concomitant CT and Jahn-Teller distortion. The phase diagrams obtained with
this model are in good qualitative agreement with various experimental findings
and apply to diverse families of materials undergoing Mott transition,
spin-crossover, neutral-ionic transition, for which isostructural electronic
instability driving volume strain can couple to symmetry-breaking or not,
create phase transition lines and drive cooperative phenomena.

the detection and the expansion of exploding granules at several wavelengths

temporal sequences, two methods of image segmentation are applied to select the
granules. The first allows us to follow individually the exploding granules
observed simultaneously by THEMIS, IRIS, and SDO. The second uses long time
independent sequences from THEMIS, IRIS, SDO, Hinode, and a simulation. In the
first method (called manual) the segmentation isolates the cell of the granules
(bright granules and intergranular parts), while in the second method (called
statistical) only the bright part of the granules are isolated. The results
obtained with simultaneous or distinct temporal observations using the two
methods of segmentation are in good agreement. The granule area evolves
linearly with an expansion velocity that decreases with the radius. A rapid
decrease in the velocity expansion in the first two minutes is observed. The
detection and measurement of the dynamics of the explosive granules can be
performed from ground- and space-based instruments. Our work reveals the
usefulness of SDO data, with low spatial resolution, to study the dynamics of

analytical methods of source representation and coupled mode theory, we
investigated the optical forces induced by a plane wave on two chiral particles
coupling with each other via the evanescent near fields. We found that the
induced electric and magnetic dipoles of the chiral particles have complicated
couplings that give rise to dark and bright modes. The interaction force
between the particles can be either attractive or repulsive, and its magnitude
can be significantly enhanced by the resonance modes. The attractive force is
much stronger if two particles are of opposite handedness compared with the
case of same handedness. The electric dipole force and the magnetic dipole
force have the same sign for two particles with the same handedness, while they
are of different signs for two particles with opposite handedness. The results
can lead to a better understanding of chirality-induced optical forces with
potential applications in optical manipulations and chiral light-matter

problem in deep learning, and studying whether different models capture similar
features is an initial step to achieve this goal. Previous works sought to
define metrics over the feature matrices to measure the difference between two
models. However, different metrics sometimes lead to contradictory conclusions,
and there has been no consensus on which metric is suitable to use in practice.
In this work, we propose a novel metric that goes beyond previous approaches.
Recall that one of the most practical scenarios of using the learned
representations is to apply them to downstream tasks. We argue that we should
design the metric based on a similar principle. For that, we introduce the
transferred discrepancy (TD), a new metric that defines the difference between
two representations based on their downstream-task performance. Through an
asymptotic analysis, we show how TD correlates with downstream tasks and the
necessity to define metrics in such a task-dependent fashion. In particular, we
also show that under specific conditions, the TD metric is closely related to
previous metrics. Our experiments show that TD can provide fine-grained
information for varied downstream tasks, and for the models trained from
different initializations, the learned features are not the same in terms of
downstream-task predictions. We find that TD may also be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of different training strategies. For example, we demonstrate
that the models trained with proper data augmentations that improve the
generalization capture more similar features in terms of TD, while those with
data augmentations that hurt the generalization will not. This suggests a
training strategy that leads to more robust representation also trains models
that generalize better.

nonlinear systems are intriguing and important phenomena in nature. Advancing
such research to new nonlinear optical regimes is of much interest for both
fundamental physics and practical applications. Here we propose a scheme to
realize optical pattern formation in a cold Rydberg atomic gas via
electromagnetically induced transparency. We show that, by coupling two Rydberg
states with a microwave field (microwave dressing), the nonlocal Kerr
nonlinearity of the Rydberg gas can be enhanced significantly and may be tuned
actively. Based on such nonlocal Kerr nonlinearity, we demonstrate that a
plane-wave state of probe laser field can undergo a modulation instability (MI)
and hence spontaneous symmetry breaking, which may result in the emergence of
various self-organized optical patterns. Especially, we find that a hexagonal
lattice pattern (which is the only optical pattern when the microwave dressing
is absent) may develop into several types of square lattice ones when the
microwave dressing is applied; moreover, as a outcome of the MI the formation
of nonlocal optical solitons is also possible in the system. Different from
earlier studies, the optical patterns and nonlocal optical solitons found here
can be flexibly manipulated by adjusting the effective probe-field intensity,
nonlocality degree of the Kerr nonlinearity, and the strength of the microwave
field. Our work opens a route for versatile controls of self-organizations and
structural phase transitions of laser light, which may have potential
applications in optical information processing and transmission.

strategy to describe the overall behaviour of materials with coarse
mesostructure. In this approach, the effect of the mesostructure is described
by the use of three elasticity tensors whose orders vary from 4 to 6.
Higher-order constitutive tensors make it possible to describe rich physical
phenomena. However, these objects have intricate algebraic structures that
prevent us from having a clear picture of their modeling capabilities. The
harmonic decomposition is a fundamental tool to investigate the anisotropic
properties of constitutive tensor spaces. For higher-order tensors (i.e.
tensors of order $n\geq$3), its establishment is generally a difficult task. In
this paper a novel procedure to obtain this decomposition is introduced. This
method, that we have called the \textit{Clebsch-Gordan Harmonic Algorithm},
allows to obtain \emph{explicit} harmonic decompositions satisfying good
properties such as orthogonality and unicity. The elements of the decomposition
also have a precise geometrical meaning simplifying their physical
interpretation. This new algorithm is here developed in the specific case of 2D
space and applied to Mindlin's Strain-Gradient Elasticity. We provide, for the
first time, the harmonic decompositions of the fifth- and sixth-order
elasticity tensors involved in this constitutive law.

changes of the interior. We investigate the coupled thermal-orbital evolution
of differentiated rocky exoplanets governed by the Andrade viscoelastic
rheology. The coupled evolution is treated by a semi-analytical model, 1d
parametrized heat transfer and self-consistently calculated tidal dissipation.
First, we conduct several parametric studies, exploring the effect of the
rheological properties, the planet's size, and the orbital eccentricity on the
tidal locking and dissipation. These tests show that the role of tidal locking
into high spin-orbit resonances is most prominent on low eccentric orbits,
where it results in substantially higher tidal heating than the synchronous
rotation. Second, we calculate the long-term evolution of three currently known
low-mass exoplanets with nonzero orbital eccentricity and absent or yet unknown
eccentricity forcing (namely GJ 625 b, GJ 411 b, and Proxima Centauri b). The
tidal model incorporates the formation of a stable magma ocean and a
consistently evolving spin rate. We find that the thermal state is strongly
affected by the evolution of eccentricity and spin state and proceeds as a
sequence of thermal equilibria. Final despinning into synchronous rotation
slows down the orbital evolution and helps to maintain long-term stable orbital

challenge because standard enhanced sampling methods do not apply to
irreversible dynamics. We overcome this non-equilibrium rare-event problem by
developing an algorithm generalizing transition-path sampling to active
Brownian dynamics. This method is exemplified and benchmarked for a
paradigmatic two-dimensional potential with a high barrier. We find that even
in such a simple landscape the structure and kinetics of the ensemble of
transition paths change drastically in the presence of activity. Indeed, active
Brownian particles reach the target more frequently than passive Brownian
particles, following longer and counterintuitive search patterns.

interaction between a privately-informed agent, called the sender, and an
ignorant but rational agent, called the receiver. The goal is typically to
design a (near-)optimal communication (or signaling) scheme for the sender. It
enables the sender to disclose information to the receiver in a way as to
incentivize her to take an action that is preferred by the sender. Finding the
optimal signaling scheme is known to be computationally difficult in general.
This hardness is further exacerbated when there is also a constraint on the
size of the message space, leading to NP-hardness of approximating the optimal
sender utility within any constant factor.
  In this paper, we show that in several natural and prominent cases the
optimization problem is tractable even when the message space is limited. In
particular, we study signaling under a symmetry or an independence assumption
on the distribution of utility values for the actions. For symmetric
distributions, we provide a novel characterization of the optimal signaling
scheme. It results in a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an optimal scheme
for many compactly represented symmetric distributions. In the independent
case, we design a constant-factor approximation algorithm, which stands in
marked contrast to the hardness of approximation in the general case.

quantum many-particle systems. However, for fermions, these simulations are
hampered by the sign problem that prohibits simulations in the regime of strong
degeneracy. The situation changed with the development of configuration path
integral Monte Carlo (CPIMC) by Schoof \textit{et al.} [T. Schoof \textit{et
al.}, Contrib. Plasma Phys. \textbf{51}, 687 (2011)] that allowed for the first
\textit{ab initio} simulations for dense quantum plasmas. CPIMC also has a sign
problem that occurs when the density is lowered, i.e. in a parameter range that
is complementary to traditional QMC formulated in coordinate space. Thus, CPIMC
simulations for the warm dense electron gas are limited to small values of the
Brueckner parameter -- the ratio of the interparticle distance to the Bohr
radius -- $r_s=\bar{r}/a_B \lesssim 1$. In order to reach the regime of
stronger coupling (lower density) with CPIMC, here we investigate additional
restrictions on the Monte Carlo procedure. In particular, we introduce two
different versions of ""restricted CPIMC"" where certain sign changing Monte
Carlo updates are being omitted. Interestingly, one of the methods (RCPIMC) has
no sign problem at all, but it is less accurate than RCPIMC+ which neglects
only a smaller class of the Monte Carlo steps. Here we report extensive
simulations for the ferromagnetic uniform electron gas with which we
investigate the properties and accuracy of RCPIMC and RCPIMC+. Further, we
establish the parameter range in the density-temperature plane where these
simulations are both feasible and accurate. The conclusion is that RCPIMC and
RCPIMC+ work best at temperatures in the range of $\Theta \sim 0.1\dots 0.5$
allowing to reach density parameters up to $r_s \sim 3\dots 5$, thereby
partially filling a gap left open by existing \textit{ab initio} QMC methods.

which contains appropriateness labels of robot actions annotated by humans. To
be able to control but vary the configurations of the scenes and the social

uniformly sampling relevant contextual attributes. Secondly, we train and
evaluate a baseline Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) that estimates social

understanding of (social) appropriateness of actions, with respect to the
social context they operate in. To facilitate reproducibility and further
progress in this area, the MANNERS-DB, the trained models and the relevant code

initiative proposes the use of partially stripped ions as a driver of a new
type of high-intensity photon source in CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In
2018, the LHC accelerated and stored partially stripped $^{208}\text{Pb}^{81+}$
ions for the first time. The collimation system efficiency recorded during this
test was found to be prohibitively low, so that only a very low-intensity beam
could be stored without the risk of triggering a beam dump when regular, minor
beam losses occur. The worst losses were localised in the dispersion suppressor
of the betatron-cleaning insertion. This article presents an analysis to
understand in detail the source of these losses. Based on this understanding,
possible mitigation measures that could significantly improve the cleaning
efficiency and enable regular operation with partially-stripped ions in the
future are developed.

promising candidate combining the complete event information provided by the
TPC technique to the high sensitivity and granularity of last generation

with Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) was tested at the Laboratori Nazionali di
Frascati. Photons and neutrons from radioactive sources were employed to induce
recoiling nuclei and electrons with kinetic energy in the range [1-100] keV. A
He-CF4 (60/40) gas mixture was used at atmospheric pressure and the light
produced during the multiplication in the GEM channels was acquired by a high
position resolution and low noise scientific CMOS camera and a photomultiplier.
A multi-stage pattern recognition algorithm based on an advanced clustering
technique is presented here. A number of cluster shape observables are used to
identify nuclear recoils induced by neutrons originated from a AmBe source
against X-ray 55Fe photo-electrons. An efficiency of 18% to detect nuclear
recoils with an energy of about 6 keV is reached obtaining at the same time a
96% 55Fe photo-electrons suppression. This makes this optically readout gas TPC
a very promising candidate for future investigations of ultra-rare events as
directional direct Dark Matter searches.

Measurements were carried out on a Bruker Avance 500 NMR pulse spectrometer for
two orientations of the crystalline c axis, parallel and perpendicular to

varied depending on the sample position in magnetic field and frequency offset.
The relaxation rate increased about linearly with temperature below 70 K

which charge excitations are quickly created and can exist beyond the duration
of the external driving. Despite the fruitful experimental explorations,
theoretical studies on the microscopic models face the challenge to
simultaneously deal with exponentially separated time scales, especially in
multi-band systems, where the long-time behaviors are often well beyond the
reach of state-of-the-art numerical tools. Here, we address this difficulty by
introducing a steady-state description of photodoped Mott insulators using an
open-system setup, where the photodoped system is stabilized as a
non-equilirium steady-state (NESS) by a weak external driving. Taking advantage
of the stationarity, we implement and discuss the details of an efficient
numerical tool using the steady-state Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT),
combined with the non-crossing approximation (NCA). We demonstrate that these
stationary photodoped states exhibit the same properties of their transient
counterparts, while being solvable with reasonable computational efforts.
Furthermore, they can be parametrized by just few physical quantities,
including the effective temperature and the density of charge excitations,
which confirms the universal nature of photodoped states indeed independent of
the excitation protocols. As a first application, we consider the stationary
photodoped states in a two-band Hubbard model with intertwined spin-and-orbital
ordering and find a family of hidden phases unknown from the previous studies,
implying an apparently unexplored time regime of the relaxation of the
intertwined orders.

Deformation function, as a type of deformation operator, can improve the
generalization performance. Moreover, various deformation functions are
designed, and their contributions to the loss surface are further provided.
Then, the original stochastic gradient descent optimizer is theoretically
proved to be a flat minima filter that owns the talent to filter out the sharp

proposed deformation functions, which is verified on CIFAR-100, with
visualizations of loss landscapes near the critical points obtained by both the
original optimizer and optimizer enhanced by deformation functions. The
experimental results show that deformation functions do find flatter regions.
Moreover, on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, popular convolutional neural
networks enhanced by deformation functions are compared with the corresponding

affects the prediction of the flow of interest by numerical simulations. We
evaluate this impact using uncertainty quantification. A method is developed
and applied to the simulation of the drag generated by the flow past a cylinder
installed in the transonic S3Ch ONERA mid-scale facility. The inflow
uncertainty results from the imperfect knowledge and variability of the flow in
the settling chamber. It is taken into account via the inlet boundary condition
in the numerical companion setup and evaluated experimentally by measuring the
inflow using a hot-wire rake. The propagation of the input uncertainties is
carried \alert{out} through a two-dimensional RANS model of the experiment. A
polynomial surrogate model is developed to infer the uncertainty associated
with the drag of the cylinder. Following observations of Gaussian inputs, the
parameters of the stochastic model are constructed in two ways, first through a
projection approach, based on the Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule, and then using
a sparsity based regression approach, based on compressed sensing. The latter
drastically reduces the number of deterministic numerical simulations. The drag
is most influenced by the central part of the inflow but the overall
uncertainty remains low.

code. Static code analysis tools can draw attention to code that is difficult
for developers to understand. However, most of the findings are based on
non-validated metrics, which can lead to confusion and code, that is hard to
understand, not being identified.
  Aims: In this work, we validate a metric called Cognitive Complexity which
was explicitly designed to measure code understandability and which is already
widely used due to its integration in well-known static code analysis tools.
  Method: We conducted a systematic literature search to obtain data sets from
studies which measured code understandability. This way we obtained about
24,000 understandability evaluations of 427 code snippets. We calculated the
correlations of these measurements with the corresponding metric values and
statistically summarized the correlation coefficients through a meta-analysis.
  Results: Cognitive Complexity positively correlates with comprehension time
and subjective ratings of understandability. The metric showed mixed results
for the correlation with the correctness of comprehension tasks and with
physiological measures.
  Conclusions: It is the first validated and solely code-based metric which is
able to reflect at least some aspects of code understandability. Moreover, due
to its methodology, this work shows that code understanding is currently
measured in many different ways, which we also do not know how they are
related. This makes it difficult to compare the results of individual studies

facets.

unsupervised methods by learning the distribution of healthy images and
identifying anomalies as outliers. In presence of an additional dataset of
unlabelled data containing also anomalies, the task can be framed as a
semi-supervised task with negative and unlabelled sample points. Recently, in
Albu et al., 2020, we have proposed a slice-wise semi-supervised method for
tumour detection based on the computation of a dissimilarity function in the
latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder, trained on unlabelled data. The
dissimilarity is computed between the encoding of the image and the encoding of
its reconstruction obtained through a different autoencoder trained only on
healthy images. In this paper we present novel and improved results for our
method, obtained by training the Variational AutoEncoders on a subset of the
HCP and BRATS-2018 datasets and testing on the remaining individuals. We show
that by training the models on higher resolution images and by improving the
quality of the reconstructions, we obtain results which are comparable with
different baselines, which employ a single VAE trained on healthy individuals.
As expected, the performance of our method increases with the size of the
threshold used to determine the presence of an anomaly.

acts on the leading order parameter of the system. Effective model parameters
of this new theory are determined from the variational principle, which allows
to resolve the Fierz ambiguity in decoupling of the local interaction term. In
the saddle-point approximation for the fluctuating field our method reproduces
the mean-field result. The exact numerical integration over this field allows
to consider nonlinear fluctuations of the global order parameter of the system

We apply our method to the magnetic susceptibility of finite Hubbard systems at
half-filling and demonstrate that the introduced technique leads to a superior
improvement of results with respect to parental mean-field approaches without

number of highly specialized single-task networks. However, two common
challenges in developing multi-task models are often overlooked in literature.
First, enabling the model to be inherently incremental, continuously
incorporating information from new tasks without forgetting the previously
learned ones (incremental learning). Second, eliminating adverse interactions
amongst tasks, which has been shown to significantly degrade the single-task
performance in a multi-task setup (task interference). In this paper, we show
that both can be achieved simply by reparameterizing the convolutions of
standard neural network architectures into a non-trainable shared part (filter
bank) and task-specific parts (modulators), where each modulator has a fraction
of the filter bank parameters. Thus, our reparameterization enables the model
to learn new tasks without adversely affecting the performance of existing
ones. The results of our ablation study attest the efficacy of the proposed
reparameterization. Moreover, our method achieves state-of-the-art on two
challenging multi-task learning benchmarks, PASCAL-Context and NYUD, and also
demonstrates superior incremental learning capability as compared to its close

The gauge freedom makes uniqueness problems in perturbation theory particularly
hard as one needs to understand in depth the process of gauge fixing before
attempting any uniqueness proof. This is the first paper of a series of two
aimed at deriving an existence and uniqueness result for rigidly rotating stars
to second order in perturbation theory in General Relativity. A necessary step
is to show the existence of a suitable choice of gauge and to understand the
differentiability and regularity properties of the resulting gauge tensors in
some ""canonical form"", particularly at the centre of the star. With a wider
range of applications in mind, in this paper we analyse the fixing and
regularity problem in a more general setting. In particular we tackle the
problem of the Hodge-type decomposition into scalar, vector and tensor
components on spheres of symmetric and axially symmetric tensors with finite
differentiability down to the origin, exploiting a strategy in which the loss

which the nodes of a network are occupied in degree-descending order. This rule
is the opposite of the much studied degree-ascending protocol, used to
investigate resilience of networks under intentional attack, and has received
limited attention so far. The interest in DOP is also motivated by its
connection with the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model for epidemic
spreading, since a variation of DOP is related to the vanishing of the SIS
transition for random power-law degree-distributed networks $P(k) \sim
k^{-\gamma}$. By using the generating function formalism, we investigate the
behavior of the DOP model on networks with generic value of $\gamma$ and we
validate the analytical results by means of numerical simulations. We find that
the percolation threshold vanishes in the limit of large networks for $\gamma
\le 3$, while it is finite for $\gamma>3$, although its value for $\gamma$
between 3 and 4 is exceedingly small and preasymptotic effects are huge. We
also derive the critical properties of the DOP transition, in particular how
the exponents depend on the heterogeneity of the network, determining that DOP
does not belong to the universality class of random percolation for $\gamma \le
3$.

poorly understood in General Relativity (GR). Apart from the limiting case of
infinitely thin disks, the only known global results in the stationary rotating
case (Heilig [14] and Makino [21] [arXiv:1705.07392]) show existence in GR
nearby a Newtonian configuration (under suitable additional restrictions). In
this work we prove existence and uniqueness of rigidly (slowly) rotating fluid
bodies in equilibrium to second order in perturbation theory in GR. The most
widely used perturbation framework to describe slowly rigidly rotating stars in
the strong field regime is the Hartle-Thorne model. The model involves a number
of hypotheses, some explicit, like equatorial symmetry or that the perturbation
parameter is proportional to the rotation, but some implicit, particularly on
the structure and regularity of the perturbation tensors and the conditions of
their matching at the surface. In this work, with basis on the gauge results
obtained in [25], the Hartle-Thorne model is fully derived from first
principles and only assuming that the perturbations describe a rigidly rotating
finite perfect fluid ball (with no layer at the surface) with the same
barotropic equation of state as the static ball. Rigidly rotating fluid balls
are analyzed consistently in second order perturbation theory by imposing only
basic differentiability requirements and boundedness. Our results prove in
particular that, at this level of approximation, the spacetime must be indeed
equatorially symmetric and is fully determined by two parameters, namely the
central pressure and the uniform angular velocity of the fluid.

further and adapt the gesturing style to follow a specific speaker? Gestures
that are naturally timed with corresponding speech during human communication
are called co-speech gestures. A key challenge, called gesture style transfer,
is to learn a model that generates these gestures for a speaking agent 'A' in
the gesturing style of a target speaker 'B'. A secondary goal is to
simultaneously learn to generate co-speech gestures for multiple speakers while
remembering what is unique about each speaker. We call this challenge style
preservation. In this paper, we propose a new model, named Mix-StAGE, which
trains a single model for multiple speakers while learning unique style
embeddings for each speaker's gestures in an end-to-end manner. A novelty of
Mix-StAGE is to learn a mixture of generative models which allows for
conditioning on the unique gesture style of each speaker. As Mix-StAGE
disentangles style and content of gestures, gesturing styles for the same input
speech can be altered by simply switching the style embeddings. Mix-StAGE also
allows for style preservation when learning simultaneously from multiple
speakers. We also introduce a new dataset, Pose-Audio-Transcript-Style (PATS),
designed to study gesture generation and style transfer. Our proposed Mix-StAGE
model significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach for
gesture generation and provides a path towards performing gesture style
transfer across multiple speakers. Link to code, data, and videos:

surface of films grown with the Clarke-Vvedensky (CV) model in simple cubic
lattices. The distributions of this number, $N$, are determined in films with
average thicknesses close to $50$ and $100$ monolayers for a broad range of
values of the diffusion-to-deposition ratio $R$ and of the probability
$\epsilon$ that lowers the diffusion coefficient for each lateral neighbor. The
mobility of subsurface atoms and the energy barriers for crossing step edges
are neglected. Simulations show that the adatoms execute uncorrelated diffusion
during the time in which they move on the film surface. In a low temperature
regime, typically with $R\epsilon\lesssim 1$, the attachment to lateral
neighbors is almost irreversible, the average number of hops scales as $\langle
N\rangle \sim R^{0.38\pm 0.01}$, and the distribution of that number decays
approximately as $\exp\left[-\left({N/\langle N\rangle}\right)^{0.80\pm
0.07}\right]$. Similar decay is observed in simulations of random walks in a
plane with randomly distributed absorbing traps and the estimated relation
between $\langle N\rangle$ and the density of terrace steps is similar to that
observed in the trapping problem, which provides a conceptual explanation of
that regime. As the temperature increases, $\langle N\rangle$ crosses over to
another regime when $R\epsilon^{3.0\pm 0.3}\sim 1$, which indicates high
mobility of all adatoms at terrace borders. The distributions $P\left(
N\right)$ change to simple exponential decays, due to the constant probability
for an adatom to become immobile after being covered by a new deposited layer.
At higher temperatures, the surfaces become very smooth and $\langle N\rangle
\sim R\epsilon^{1.85\pm 0.15}$, which is explained by an analogy with
submonolayer growth.

primary. To compensate this shortcoming, we present here the results of
UBVRIJHK photometric, VRI polarimetric and optical spectral observations of RW
Aur B. The star demonstrates chaotic brightness variations in the optical band
with irregular short (~ 1 day) dimmings with an amplitude $\Delta V$ up to
$1.3^{\rm m}.$ The dimmings are accompanied with an increase in the linear
polarization (up to 3 per cent in the I band), presumably due to the scattering
of the stellar radiation by dust in the circumstellar disc that means that RW
Aur B can be classified as a UX Ori type star. We concluded that the observed
excess emission at $\lambda \lesssim 0.45$ $\mu$m and longward $\approx$ 2
$\mu$m as well as a variability of fluxes and profiles of HI, HeI and NaI D
emission lines are due to the accretion process. At the same time, emission
components of Ca II lines indicate that RW Aur B has a powerful chromosphere.
Assuming the solar elemental abundances, we found the following parameters of
the star: $T_{\rm eff} = 4100-4200$ K, $A_{\rm V}=0.6 \pm 0.1$ (out of the
dimming events), $L_* \approx 0.6$ $L_\odot,$ $R_* \approx 1.5$ $R_\odot,$
$M\approx 0.85$ M$_\odot,$ $\dot M_{\rm acc}<5\times 10^{-9}$ M$_\odot$

accretion activity of RW Aur binary components and present arguments in favour
of the fact that they are gravitationally bound.

outputs the optimal vehicle velocity using model predictive control technique
and receives the power split control from the lower-level con-troller. These
two levels communicate with each other via a controller area network in the

method is built upon the idea of blending two predictions: a prediction based
on disparity estimation, and a prediction based on direct minimization in

computational solutions usually suffer from this critical issue. To address the
issue of color variations in histopathology images, this study proposes two
stain style transfer models, SSIM-GAN and DSCSI-GAN, based on the generative
adversarial networks. By cooperating structural preservation metrics and
feedback of an auxiliary diagnosis net in learning, medical-relevant
information presented by image texture, structure, and chroma-contrast features
is preserved in color-normalized images. Particularly, the smart treat of
chromatic image content in our DSCSI-GAN model helps to achieve noticeable
normalization improvement in image regions where stains mix due to histological
substances co-localization. Extensive experimentation on public histopathology
image sets indicates that our methods outperform prior arts in terms of
generating more stain-consistent images, better preserving histological
information in images, and obtaining significantly higher learning efficiency.

abrupt and enforced work-from-home context has resulted in an unprecedented

This design allowed us to identify the variables that explained unique variance
in well-being and productivity. Results include (1) the quality of social
contacts predicted positively, and stress predicted an individual's well-being
negatively when controlling for other variables consistently across both waves;
(2) boredom and distractions predicted productivity negatively; (3)
productivity was less strongly associated with all predictor variables at time
two compared to time one, suggesting that software engineers adapted to the

assignment of instances to a set of outcomes. Classification models support the
optimization of managerial decision-making across a variety of operational
business processes. For instance, customer churn prediction models are adopted
to increase the efficiency of retention campaigns by optimizing the selection
of customers that are to be targeted. Cost-sensitive and causal classification
methods have independently been proposed to improve the performance of
classification models. The former considers the benefits and costs of correct
and incorrect classifications, such as the benefit of a retained customer,
whereas the latter estimates the causal effect of an action, such as a
retention campaign, on the outcome of interest. This study integrates
cost-sensitive and causal classification by elaborating a unifying evaluation
framework. The framework encompasses a range of existing and novel performance
measures for evaluating both causal and conventional classification models in a
cost-sensitive as well as a cost-insensitive manner. We proof that conventional
classification is a specific case of causal classification in terms of a range
of performance measures when the number of actions is equal to one. The
framework is shown to instantiate to application-specific cost-sensitive
performance measures that have been recently proposed for evaluating customer
retention and response uplift models, and allows to maximize profitability when
adopting a causal classification model for optimizing decision-making. The
proposed framework paves the way toward the development of cost-sensitive
causal learning methods and opens a range of opportunities for improving
data-driven business decision-making.

long ago, and the total amount lost remains unknown. Clues to the amount lost
can be found by studying hydrogen (H) and its isotope deuterium (D), which are
produced when atmospheric water molecules H$_2$O and HDO dissociate. The
difference in escape efficiencies of H and D (which leads to} an enhanced D/H
ratio) is referred to as the fractionation factor $f$. Both the D/H ratio and
$f$ are necessary to estimate water loss; thus, if we can constrain the range
of $f$ and understand what controls it, we will be able to estimate water loss
more accurately. In this study, we use a 1D photochemical model of the neutral
Martian atmosphere to determine how $f$ depends on assumed temperature and
water vapor profiles. We find that the exobase temperature most strongly
controls the value of $f$ for thermal escape processes. When we include
estimates of non-thermal escape from other studies, we find that the tropopause
temperature is also important. Overall, for the standard Martian atmosphere,
$f=0.002$ for thermal escape, and $f=0.06$ for thermal + non-thermal escape. We
estimate that Mars has lost at minimum 66-122 m GEL of water. Importantly, our
results demonstrate that the value of $f$ depends critically on non-thermal
escape of D, and that modeling studies that include D/H fractionation must
model both neutral and ion processes throughout the atmosphere.

clinically relevant scenarios. In this study we proposed a knowledge-guided DRL
(KgDRL) that incorporated knowledge from human planners to guide the training
process to improve the training efficiency. Using prostate cancer intensity
modulated radiation therapy as a testbed, we first summarized a number of rules
of operating our in-house TPS. In training, in addition to randomly navigating
the state-action space, as in the DRL using the epsilon-greedy algorithm, we
also sampled actions defined by the rules. The priority of sampling actions
from rules decreased over the training process to encourage VTPN to explore new
policy that was not covered by the rules. We trained a VTPN using KgDRL and
compared its performance with another VTPN trained using DRL. Both VTPNs
trained via KgDRL and DRL spontaneously learned to operate the TPS to generate
high-quality plans, achieving plan quality scores of 8.82 and 8.43,
respectively. Both VTPNs outperformed treatment planning purely based on the
rules, which had a plan score of 7.81. VTPN trained with 8 episodes using KgDRL
was able to perform similarly to that trained using DRL with 100 episodes. The
training time was reduced from more than a week to 13 hours. The proposed KgDRL
framework accelerated the training process by incorporating human knowledge,
which will facilitate the development of VTPN for more complicated treatment
planning scenarios.

rotated unit-length complex coefficients in the Fourier domain. The similarity

Applications of the technique to the evaluation of the Laplace layer potentials

owing to the unprecedented broadband penetration rate in recent years. Visible
light communications (VLC) has recently emerged as a possible solution to
enable high-speed short-range communications. However, VLC systems suffer from
several limitations, including the limited modulation bandwidth of
light-emitting diodes. Consequently, several multiple access techniques (MA),
e.g., space-division multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA), have been considered for VLC networks. Despite their promising
multiplexing gains, their performance is somewhat limited. In this article, we
first provide an overview of the key MA technologies used in VLC systems. Then,
we introduce rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), which was initially
proposed for RF systems and discuss its potentials in VLC systems. Through
system modeling and simulations of an RSMA-based two-use scenario, we
illustrate the flexibility of RSMA in generalizing NOMA and SDMA, as well as
its superiority in terms of weighted sum rate (WSR) in VLC. Finally, we discuss
challenges, open issues, and research directions, which will enable the
practical realization of RSMA in VLC.

Many countries have adopted policies of complete but gradual transformation to
electric vehicles (EVs). However, mass EV adoption also means a spike in load
(kW), which in turn can disrupt existing electricity infrastructure. Smart or
controlled charging is widely seen as a potential solution to alleviate this
stress on existing networks. Learning from the recent EV trials in the UK and
elsewhere we take into account two key aspects which are largely ignored in
current research: EVs actually charging at any given time and wide range of EV
types, especially battery capacity-wise. Taking a minimalistic scenario-based
approach, we study forecasting models for mean number of active chargers and
mean EV consumption for distinct scenarios. Focusing on residential charging
the models we consider range from simple regression models to more advanced
machine and deep learning models such as XGBoost and LSTMs. We then use these
models to evaluate the impacts of different levels of future EV penetration on
a specimen distribution transformer that captures typical real-world scenarios.
In doing so, we also initiate the study of different types of controlled
charging when fully controlled charging is not possible. This aligns with the
outcomes from recent trials which show that a sizeable proportion of EV owners
may not prefer fully controlled centralized charging. We study two possible
control regimes and show that one is more beneficial from load-on-transformer
point of view, while the other may be preferred for other objectives. We show
that a minimum of 60% control is required to ensure that transformers are not
overloaded during peak hours.

(mmWave) frequencies. In particular, a mmWave transmitter, referred to as
Alice, attempts to reliably communicate to a receiver, referred to as Bob,
while hiding the existence of communication from a warden, referred to as
Willie.
  In this regard, operating over the mmWave bands not only increases the
covertness thanks to directional beams, but also increases the transmission
data rates given much more available bandwidths and enables ultra-low form
factor transceivers due to the lower wavelengths used compared to the
conventional radio frequency (RF) counterpart. We first assume that the
transmitter Alice employs two independent antenna arrays in which one of the
arrays is to form a directive beam for data transmission to Bob. The other
antenna array is used by Alice to generate another beam toward Willie as a
jamming signal while changing the transmit power independently across the
transmission blocks in order to achieve the desired covertness. For this
dual-beam setup, we characterize Willie's detection error rate with the optimal
detector and the closed-form of its expected value from Alice's perspective. We
then derive the closed-form expression for the outage probability of the
Alice-Bob link, which enables characterizing the optimal covert rate that can
be achieved using the proposed setup. We further obtain tractable forms for the
ergodic capacity of the Alice-Bob link involving only one-dimensional integrals
that can be computed in closed forms for most ranges of the channel parameters.
Finally, we highlight how the results can be extended to more practical
scenarios, particularly to the cases where perfect information about the
location of the passive warden is not available.

by estimating the lateral distribution function (LDF) at very high energies of
various cosmic ray particles. LDF was simulated for charged particles such as
the electron and positron pair production, gamma, muons and all charged
particles at very high energies 10^16, 10^18 and 10^19 eV. The simulation was
performed using air shower simulator system (AIRES) version 2.6.0. The effect
of primary particles, energies, thinning energy and zenith angle on the charged
LDF particles produced in the EAS was taken into account. The comparison of the
estimated LDF of charged particles such as the electron and positron pair
production and muons with the simulated results by Sciutto and experimental
results by Yakutsk EAS observatory gives a good acceptance at the energy 10^19
eV for 0 and 10 zenith angles.

they have the power to entangle, hide and reveal explanatory factors embedded
within datasets. Hence, they influence the quality of recommendations.
Specifically, in Visual Art (VA) recommendations the complexity of the concepts
embodied within paintings, makes the task of capturing semantics by machines
far from trivial. In VA recommendation, prominent works commonly use manually
curated metadata to drive recommendations. Recent works in this domain aim at
leveraging visual features extracted using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However,
such data representation approaches are resource demanding and do not have a
direct interpretation, hindering user acceptance. To address these limitations,
we introduce an approach for Personalised Recommendation of Visual arts based
on learning latent semantic representation of paintings. Specifically, we
trained a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model on textual descriptions of
paintings. Our LDA model manages to successfully uncover non-obvious semantic
relationships between paintings whilst being able to offer explainable
recommendations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method tends to
perform better than exploiting visual features extracted using pre-trained Deep
Neural Networks.

wearable sensor data, smart devices, or IoT data is a vital preprocessing step
in applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), trajectory

ESPRESSO (Entropy and ShaPe awaRe timE-Series SegmentatiOn), a hybrid
segmentation model for multi-dimensional time-series that is formulated to
exploit the entropy and temporal shape properties of time-series. ESPRESSO
differs from existing methods that focus upon particular statistical or
temporal properties of time-series exclusively. As part of model development, a
novel temporal representation of time-series $WCAC$ was introduced along with a
greedy search approach that estimate segments based upon the entropy metric.
ESPRESSO was shown to offer superior performance to four state-of-the-art
methods across seven public datasets of wearable and wear-free sensing. In
addition, we undertake a deeper investigation of these datasets to understand
how ESPRESSO and its constituent methods perform with respect to different
dataset characteristics. Finally, we provide two interesting case-studies to
show how applying ESPRESSO can assist in inferring daily activity routines and
the emotional state of humans.

a wide variety of designs and implementations have been presented within the

capabilities in a single robot remains a challenging problem. This paper
explains the design and implementation of Karo, a mobile robot that exhibits a
high degree of mobility at the side of maintaining required dexterity and
exploration capabilities for urban search and rescue (USAR) missions. We first
elicit the system requirements of a standard rescue robot from the frameworks
of Rescue Robot League (RRL) of RoboCup and then, propose the conceptual design
of Karo by drafting a locomotion and manipulation system. Considering that,
this work presents comprehensive design processes along with detail mechanical
design of the robot's platform and its 7-DOF manipulator. Further, we present
the design and implementation of the command and control system by discussing
the robot's power system, sensors, and hardware systems. In conjunction with
this, we elucidate the way that Karo's software system and human-robot
interface are implemented and employed. Furthermore, we undertake extensive
evaluations of Karo's field performance to investigate whether the principal
objective of this work has been satisfied. We demonstrate that Karo has
effectively accomplished assigned standardized rescue operations by evaluating
all aspects of its capabilities in both RRL's test suites and training suites
of a fire department. Finally, the comprehensiveness of Karo's capabilities has
been verified by drawing quantitative comparisons between Karo's performance
and other leading robots participating in RRL.

The present research adopts the experimental aspects of quantum entanglement
and quantum cryptography, and integrates these established quantum capabilities
into distributed robotic platforms, to explore the possibility of achieving
increased autonomy for the control of multi-agent robotic systems engaged in
cooperative tasks. Experimental quantum capabilities are realized by producing
single photons (using spontaneous parametric down-conversion process),
polarization of photons, detecting vertical and horizontal polarizations, and
single photon detecting/counting. Specifically, such quantum aspects are
implemented on network of classical agents, i.e., classical aerial and ground
robots/unmanned systems. With respect to classical systems for robotic
applications, leveraging quantum technology is expected to lead to guaranteed
security, very fast control and communication, and unparalleled quantum
capabilities such as entanglement and quantum superposition that will enable
novel applications.

working distance of ~1.1 meters for the potential of glucose sensing.
Non-contact diffuse reflectance over 1.1-1.3 micrometers was developed
according to a center-illumination-area-detection (CIAD) geometry. The modeled
response of diffuse reflectance in the CIAD geometry was examined with phantoms
by altering independently the size of the collection geometry and the reduced
scattering and absorption properties of the medium. When applied to aqueous
turbid medium containing glucose control solutions with the cumulative volume
varying over three orders of magnitude, a linear relationship expected for the
diffuse reflectance as a function of the medium absorption/reduced-scattering
property was observed for four conditions of the glucose-medium composition
that differed either in the effective glucose concentration or the host medium
scattering property. The cumulation of glucose up to 17.8mg/dL and 8.9mg/dL in
the host medium having the same optical properties resulted in linear
regression slopes of 0.0032 and 0.0030, respectively. The cumulation of the
glucose up to 17.8mg/dL in an aqueous host medium that differed two folds in
the reduced scattering property caused the linear regression slope to differ
between 0.0032 and 0.0019. The R^2 values of all cases were all greater than
0.987. A provisional patent (US#63/053,004) has been obtained for this work.
