  Based on Green's Theorem Applied to Vector Fields",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a physics-based analytical characterization of
the free-space path-loss of a wireless link in the presence of a reconfigurable
intelligent surface. The proposed approach is based on the vector
generalization of Green's theorem. The obtained path-loss model can be applied
to two-dimensional homogenized metasurfaces, which are made of sub-wavelength
scattering elements and that operate either in reflection or transmission mode.
The path-loss is formulated in terms of a computable integral that depends on
the transmission distances, the polarization of the radio waves, the size of
the surface, and the desired surface transformation. Closed-form expressions
are obtained in two asymptotic regimes that are representative of far-field and
near-field deployments. Based on the proposed approach, the impact of several
design parameters and operating regimes is unveiled.

Big Data, online music streaming services allow us to capture ecologically

to be an indirect representation of internal states including internalized
symptomatology and depression. The current study aims at unearthing patterns
and trends in the individuals at risk for depression as it manifests in
naturally occurring music listening behavior. Mental well-being scores, musical
engagement measures, and listening histories of Last.fm users (N=541) were
acquired. Social tags associated with each listener's most popular tracks were
analyzed to unearth the mood/emotions and genres associated with the users.
Results revealed that social tags prevalent in the users at risk for depression
were predominantly related to emotions depicting Sadness associated with genre
tags representing neo-psychedelic-, avant garde-, dream-pop. This study will
open up avenues for an MIR-based approach to characterizing and predicting risk
for depression which can be helpful in early detection and additionally provide

four-dimensional clasp number and the slice genus can be arbitrarily large.
This question is answered affirmatively by studying a knot invariant derived
from equivariant singular instanton theory, and which is closely related to the
Chern--Simons functional. This also answers a conjecture of Livingston about
slicing numbers. Also studied is the singular instanton Fr{\o}yshov invariant
of a knot. If defined with integer coefficients, this gives a lower bound for
the unoriented slice genus, and is computed for quasi-alternating and torus
knots. In contrast, for certain other coefficient rings, the invariant is
identified with a multiple of the knot signature. This result is used to
address a conjecture by Poudel and Saveliev about traceless $SU(2)$
representations of torus knots. Further, for a concordance between knots with
non-zero signature, it is shown that there is a traceless representation of the
concordance complement which restricts to non-trivial representations of the
knot groups. Finally, some evidence towards an extension of the slice-ribbon
conjecture to torus knots is provided.

for kinetic equations. They are based on the conservative reconstruction
technique introduced in [S. Y. Cho, et al., Conservative semi-Lagrangian
schemes for kinetic equations Part I: Reconstruction, 2020]. The methods are
high order accurate both in space and time. Because of the semi-Lagrangian
nature, the time step is not restricted by a CFL-type condition. Applications
are presented to rigid body rotation, Vlasov Poisson system and the BGK model
of rarefied gas dynamics. In the first two cases operator splitting is adopted,
to obtain high order accuracy in time, and a conservative reconstruction that
preserves the maximum and minimum of the function is used. For initially
positive solutions, in particular, this guarantees exact preservation of the
L1-norm. Conservative schemes for the BGK model are constructed by coupling the
conservative reconstruction with a conservative treatment of the collision
term. High order in time is obtained by either Runge-Kutta or BDF time
discretization of the equation along characteristics. Because of L-stability
and exact conservation, the resulting scheme for the BGK model is asymptotic
preserving for the underlying fluid dynamic limit. Several test cases in one
and two space dimensions confirm the accuracy and robustness of the methods,
and the AP property of the schemes when applied to the BGK model.

biological; there is also the potential for three psycho-social epidemics: of
fear, moralization, and action. This work empirically tests Strong's model at
scale by studying the use of language of 122M tweets related to the COVID-19
pandemic posted in the U.S. during the whole year of 2020. On Twitter, we
identified three distinct phases. Each of them is characterized by different
regimes of the three psycho-social epidemics. In the refusal phase, users
refused to accept reality despite the increasing number of deaths in other
countries. In the anger phase (started after the announcement of the first
death in the country), users' fear translated into anger about the looming
feeling that things were about to change. Finally, in the acceptance phase,
which began after the authorities imposed physical-distancing measures, users
settled into a ""new normal"" for their daily activities. Overall, refusal of
accepting reality gradually died off as the year went on, while acceptance
increasingly took hold. During 2020, as cases surged in waves, so did anger,
re-emerging cyclically at each wave. Our real-time operationalization of
Strong's model is designed in a way that makes it possible to embed epidemic
psychology into real-time models (e.g., epidemiological and mobility models).

a variety of traditional machine learning tasks, e.g., speech recognition,
image classification, and segmentation. The ability of DNNs to efficiently
approximate high-dimensional functions has also motivated their use in
scientific applications, e.g., to solve partial differential equations (PDE)
and to generate surrogate models. In this paper, we consider the supervised
training of DNNs, which arises in many of the above applications. We focus on
the central problem of optimizing the weights of the given DNN such that it
accurately approximates the relation between observed input and target data.
Devising effective solvers for this optimization problem is notoriously
challenging due to the large number of weights, non-convexity, data-sparsity,
and non-trivial choice of hyperparameters. To solve the optimization problem
more efficiently, we propose the use of variable projection (VarPro), a method
originally designed for separable nonlinear least-squares problems. Our main
contribution is the Gauss-Newton VarPro method (GNvpro) that extends the reach
of the VarPro idea to non-quadratic objective functions, most notably,
cross-entropy loss functions arising in classification. These extensions make
GNvpro applicable to all training problems that involve a DNN whose last layer
is an affine mapping, which is common in many state-of-the-art architectures.
In our four numerical experiments from surrogate modeling, segmentation, and
classification GNvpro solves the optimization problem more efficiently than
commonly-used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) schemes. Also, GNvpro finds
solutions that generalize well, and in all but one example better than
well-tuned SGD methods, to unseen data points.

the state-of-the-art image search approach based on match kernels. Compared to
existing local descriptors, the proposed ones perform better in two

zero, where $\zeta_n = e^{2\pi i/n}$ is a primitive complex $n$-th root of

measuring the properties of protons, electrons, and heavy ions in the
accelerating solar wind. The large coronal holes that expand up from the north
and south poles at solar minimum are low-density collisionless regions in which
it is possible to detect departures from one-fluid thermal equilibrium. An
accurate characterization of these departures is helpful in identifying the
kinetic processes ultimately responsible for coronal heating. In this paper,
Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) measurements of the H I Lyman alpha
line are analyzed to constrain values for the solar wind speed, electron
density, electron temperature, proton temperature (parallel and perpendicular
to the magnetic field) and Alfven-wave amplitude. The analysis procedure
involves creating a large randomized ensemble of empirical models, simulating
their Lyman alpha profiles, and building posterior probability distributions
for only the models that agree with the UVCS data. The resulting temperatures
do not exhibit a great deal of radial variation between heliocentric distances
of 1.4 and 4 solar radii. Typical values for the electron, parallel proton, and
perpendicular proton temperatures are 1.2, 1.8, and 1.9 MK, respectively.
Resulting values for the ""nonthermal"" Alfven wave amplitude show evidence for
weak dissipation, with a total energy-loss rate that agrees well with an
independently derived total heating rate for the protons and electrons. The
moderate Alfven-wave amplitudes appear to resolve some tension in the
literature between competing claims of both higher (undamped) and lower
(heavily damped) values.

power constraints (IPC), in addition to the total transmit power constraint
(TPC). Algorithms for \textit{global} maximization of its secrecy rate are
proposed. Their convergence to the secrecy capacity is rigorously proved and a
number of properties are established analytically. Unlike known algorithms, the
proposed ones are not limited to the MISO case and are proved to converge to a
\textit{global} rather than local optimum in the general MIMO case, even when
the channel is not degraded. In practice, the convergence is fast as only a
small to moderate number of Newton steps is required to achieve a high
precision level. The interplay of TPC and IPC is shown to result in an unusual
property when an optimal point of the max-min problem does not provide an
optimal transmit covariance matrix in some (singular) cases. To address this
issue, an algorithm is developed to compute an optimal transmit covariance
matrix in those singular cases. It is shown that this algorithm also solves the
dual (nonconvex) problems of \textit{globally} minimizing the total transmit
power subject to the secrecy and interference constraints; it provides the
minimum transmit power and respective signaling strategy needed to achieve the
secrecy capacity, hence allowing power savings.

improving our understanding of issues of solvability of boundary value problems
for scalar complex valued elliptic PDEs. In particular, the presence of
$p$-ellipticity ensures higher regularity of solutions of such equations.
  In this work we extend the notion of $p$-ellipticity to second order elliptic
systems. Recall that for systems, there is no single notion of ellipticity,
rather a more complicated picture emerges with ellipticity conditions of
varying strength such as the Legendre, Legendre-Hadamard and integral
conditions. A similar picture emerges when $p$-ellipticity is considered. In
this paper, we define three new notions of $p$-ellipticity, establish
relationships between them and show that each of them does play an important
role in solving boundary value problems.
  These important roles are demonstrated by establishing extrapolation results
for solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for elliptic systems, followed
by applications of this result in two different scenarios: one for the Lam\'e
system of linear elasticity and another in the theory of homogenization.

techniques with many connections to other methods. In our paper we derive a
family of partial differential equations (PDEs) that result in one, two, and
three dimensions as limiting processes from M-smoothers which are based on
local order-$p$ means within a ball the radius of which tends to zero. The
order $p$ may take any nonzero value $>-1$, allowing also negative values. In
contrast to results from the literature, we show in the space-continuous case
that mode filtering does not arise for $p \to 0$, but for $p \to -1$. Extending
our filter class to $p$-values smaller than $-1$ allows to include e.g. the
classical image sharpening flow of Gabor. The PDEs we derive in 1D, 2D, and 3D
show large structural similarities. Since our PDE class is highly anisotropic
and may contain backward parabolic operators, designing adequate numerical
methods is difficult. We present an $L^\infty$-stable explicit finite
difference scheme that satisfies a discrete maximum--minimum principle, offers
excellent rotation invariance, and employs a splitting into four fractional
steps to allow larger time step sizes. Although it approximates parabolic PDEs,
it consequently benefits from stabilisation concepts from the numerics of
hyperbolic PDEs. Our 2D experiments show that the PDEs for $p<1$ are of
specific interest: Their backward parabolic term creates favourable sharpening
properties, while they appear to maintain the strong shape simplification
properties of mean curvature motion.

new econometric approaches to simultaneously learn the parameters of a player's

significantly outperform machine learning methods when there is a co-variate
shift between the training and test periods. This portrays the importance of
using structural econometric approaches in predicting how players will respond
to changes in the market. Moreover, we show that among structural econometric
methods, approaches based on no-regret learning outperform more traditional,

Adversarial Networks (CANs), an extension of GANs in which the constraints are
embedded into the model during training. This is achieved by penalizing the
generator proportionally to the mass it allocates to invalid structures. In
contrast to other generative models, CANs support efficient inference of valid
structures (with high probability) and allows to turn on and off the learned
constraints at inference time. CANs handle arbitrary logical constraints and
leverage knowledge compilation techniques to efficiently evaluate the
disagreement between the model and the constraints. Our setup is further
extended to hybrid logical-neural constraints for capturing very complex
constraints, like graph reachability. An extensive empirical analysis shows
that CANs efficiently generate valid structures that are both high-quality and

based on speaker embedding extractors. These architectures are commonly
composed of a feature extractor front-end together with a pooling layer to
encode variable-length utterances into fixed-length speaker vectors. In this
paper we present Double Multi-Head Attention pooling, which extends our
previous approach based on Self Multi-Head Attention. An additional self
attention layer is added to the pooling layer that summarizes the context
vectors produced by Multi-Head Attention into a unique speaker representation.
This method enhances the pooling mechanism by giving weights to the information
captured for each head and it results in creating more discriminative speaker
embeddings. We have evaluated our approach with the VoxCeleb2 dataset. Our
results show 6.09% and 5.23% relative improvement in terms of EER compared to
Self Attention pooling and Self Multi-Head Attention, respectively. According
to the obtained results, Double Multi-Head Attention has shown to be an
excellent approach to efficiently select the most relevant features captured by
the CNN-based front-ends from the speech signal.

devices, because they can be miniaturized, mass produced, and integrated with
circuitry. Unfortunately, progress in the development of such platforms has
been hindered by the fact that mobile ions present in biological samples screen
charges from the target molecule, greatly reducing sensor sensitivity. Under
physiological conditions, the thickness of the resulting electric double layer
is less than 1 nm, and it has generally been assumed that electronic detection
beyond this distance is virtually impossible. However, a few recently-described
sensor design strategies seem to defy this conventional wisdom, exploiting the
physics of electrical double layers in ways that traditional models do not
capture. In the first strategy, charge screening is decreased by constraining
the space in which double layers can form. The second strategy uses external
stimuli to prevent double layers from reaching equilibrium, thereby effectively
reducing charge screening. The goal of this article is to describe these
relatively new concepts, and to offer theoretical insights into mechanisms that
may enable electronic biosensing beyond the double-layer. If these concepts can
be further developed and translated into practical electronic biosensors, we
foresee exciting opportunities for the next generation of diagnostic
technologies.

approach to improving the computational cost of planning. A general
meta-planning strategy is to learn to impose constraints on the states
considered and actions taken by the agent. We observe that (1) imposing a
constraint can induce context-specific independences that render some aspects
of the domain irrelevant, and (2) an agent can take advantage of this fact by
imposing constraints on its own behavior. These observations lead us to propose
the context-specific abstract Markov decision process (CAMP), an abstraction of
a factored MDP that affords efficient planning. We then describe how to learn
constraints to impose so the CAMP optimizes a trade-off between rewards and
computational cost. Our experiments consider five planners across four domains,
including robotic navigation among movable obstacles (NAMO), robotic task and
motion planning for sequential manipulation, and classical planning. We find

instability leads to a breakup of the quasi-1D breather in a chain of
interacting 2D radial breathers that appear to be fairly robust in the
dynamics. The stability and dynamics of radial breathers in a finite domain are
studied in detail by means of numerical methods. Different families of such
solutions are identified. They develop small-amplitude spatially oscillating
tails (""nanoptera"") through a resonance of higher-order breather's harmonics
with linear modes (""phonons"") belonging to the continuous spectrum. These
results demonstrate the ability of the 2D sG model within our finite domain
computations to localize energy in long-lived, self-trapped breathing
excitations.

to develop methods that not only overcome the heavy memory and computation

set of volume uniformizing methods to address the aforementioned issues. The
first method involves sampling information evenly from a subset of the volume.
Another method exploits the full geometry of the 3D volume by interpolating
over the z-axis. We demonstrate performance improvements using controlled

$h_{\rm c}$'s dependence on frequency is shaped by the pericenter distribution
of events within the tidal radius, and under standard assumptions $h_{\rm c}
\propto f^{-1/2}$. This is because the TDE signal is a burst of gravitational
waves at the orbital frequency of the closest approach. In addition, we compare
the background characteristic strains with the sensitivity curves of the
upcoming generation of space-based gravitational wave interferometers: the
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin, ALIA, the DECI-hertz
inteferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the Big Bang Observer

just detected by BBO in its lowest frequency coverage, but it is too weak for
all the other instruments. On the other hand, the background signal from TDEs
with white dwarfs will be within reach of ALIA, and especially of DECIGO and
BBO, while it is below the LISA and TianQin sensitive curves. This background
signal detection will not only provide evidence for the existence of IMBHs up

Pan, Atlas, and Daphnis from material in Saturn's rings. Accretion of complex
shaped ridges from ring material should be possible when the torque from
accreted material does not exceed the tidal torque from Saturn that ordinarily
maintains tidal lock. This gives a limit on the maximum accretion rate and the
minimum duration for equatorial ridge growth. We explore the longitude
distribution of ridges accreted from ring material, initially in circular
orbits, onto a moon that is on a circular, inclined or eccentric orbit. Sloped
and lobed ridges can be accreted if the moon tidally realigns during accretion
due to its change in shape or because the disk edge surface density profile
allows ring material originating at different initial semi-major axes to impact
the moon at different locations on its equatorial ridge. We find that accretion
from an asymmetric gap might account for a depression on Atlas's equatorial
ridge. Accretion from an asymmetric gap at orbital eccentricity similar to the
Hill eccentricity, might allow accretion of multiple lobes, as seen on Pan. Two
possibly connected scenarios are promising for growth of ornamental equatorial
ridges. The moon migrates through the ring, narrowing its gap and facilitating
accretion. The moon's orbital eccentricity could increase due to orbital
resonance with another moon, pushing it into its gap edges and facilitating
accretion.

formulation is: if experimenters possess free will, then so do particles. In
more modest terms, the theorem says that individual pairs of spacelike
separated particles cannot be described by deterministic systems provided their
mixture is the same for all choices of measurement settings. We reformulate and
generalize the Free Will Theorem theorem in terms of systems of random
variables, and show that the proof is based on two observations: (1) some
compound systems are contextual (non-local), and (2) any deterministic system
with spacelike separated components is non-signaling. The contradiction between
the two is obtained by showing that a mixture of non-signaling deterministic
systems, if they exist, is always noncontextual. The ""experimenters' free will""
(independence) assumption is not needed for the proof: it is made redundant by
the assumption (1) above, critical for the proof. We next argue that the reason
why an individual pair of particles is not described by a deterministic system
is more elementary than in the Free Will Theorem. A system, contextual or not
and deterministic or not, includes several choices of settings, each of which
can be factually used without changing the system. An individual pair of
particles can only afford a single realization of random variables for a single
choice of settings. With this conceptualization, the ""free will of

are two promising technologies to enable 5G and 6G services and achieve cost
reduction, network scalability, and deployment flexibility.
  However, migration to full SDN/NFV networks in order to serve these services
is a time consuming process and costly for mobile operators. This paper focuses
on energy efficiency during the transition of mobile core networks (MCN) to
full SDN/NFV networks, and explores how energy efficiency can be addressed
during such migration. We propose a general system model containing a
combination of legacy nodes and links, in addition to newly introduced NFV and
SDN nodes. We refer to this system model as partial SDN and hybrid NFV MCN
which can cover different modes of SDN and NFV implementations. Based on this
framework, we formulate energy efficiency by considering joint routing and
function placement in the network. Since this problem belongs to the class of
non-linear integer programming problems, to solve it efficiently, we present a
modified Viterbi algorithm (MVA) based on multi-stage graph modeling and a
modified Dijkstra's algorithm. We simulate this algorithm for a number of
network scenarios with different fractions of NFV and SDN nodes, and evaluate
how much energy can be saved through such transition. Simulation results
confirm the expected performance of the algorithm which saves up to 70% energy
compared to network where all nodes are always on. Interestingly, the amount of
energy saved by the proposed algorithm in the case of hybrid NFV and partial
SDN networks can reach up to 60-90% of the saved energy in full NFV/SDN

simulate the spatiotemporal spread of SARS-CoV2 disease, known as COVID-19. Our
SARS-CoV2-based ABM framework (CoV-ABM) simulates the spread at any
geographical scale, ranging from a village to a country and considers unique
characteristics of SARS-CoV2 viruses such as its persistence in the
environment. Therefore, unlike other simulators, CoV-ABM computes the density
of active viruses inside each location space to get the virus transmission
probability for each agent. It also uses the local census and health data to
create health and risk factor profiles for each individual. The proposed model
relies on a flexible timestamp scale to optimize the computational speed and
the level of detail. In our framework each agent represents a person
interacting with the surrounding space and other adjacent agents inside the
same space. Moreover, families stochastic daily tasks are formulated to get
tracked by the corresponding family members. The model also formulates the
possibility of meetings for each subset of friendships and relatives. The main
aim of the proposed framework is threefold: to illustrate the dynamics of
SARS-CoV diseases, to identify places which have a higher probability to become
infection hubs and to provide a decision-support system to design efficient
interventions in order to fight against pandemics. The framework employs SEIHRD
dynamics of viral diseases with different intervention scenarios. The paper
simulates the spread of COVID-19 in the State of Delaware, United States, with
near one million stochastic agents. The results achieved over a period of 15
weeks with a timestamp of 1 hour show which places become the hubs of
infection. The paper also illustrates how hospitals get overwhelmed as the
outbreak reaches its pick.

distance is an NP-hard problem and computationally expensive, making the
application of graph similarity techniques to complex software programs
impractical. This study intends to examine the effectiveness of graph neural
networks to estimate program similarity, by analysing the associated control
flow graphs. We introduce funcGNN, which is a graph neural network trained on
labeled CFG pairs to predict the GED between unseen program pairs by utilizing
an effective embedding vector. To our knowledge, this is the first time graph
neural networks have been applied on labeled CFGs for estimating the similarity
between high-level language programs. Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness
of funcGNN to estimate the GED between programs and our experimental analysis
demonstrates how it achieves a lower error rate (0.00194), with faster (23

scalability compared with the state of the art methods. funcGNN posses the
inductive learning ability to infer program structure and generalise to unseen

Re-Identification (Re-ID), which trains the model using labels from the source

without model updating. However, existing DG approaches are usually disturbed
by serious domain variations due to significant dataset variations.
Subsequently, DG highly relies on designing domain-invariant features, which is
however not well exploited, since most existing approaches directly mix
multiple datasets to train DG based models without considering the local
dataset similarities, i.e., examples that are very similar but from different
domains. In this paper, we present a Dual Distribution Alignment Network
(DDAN), which handles this challenge by mapping images into a domain-invariant
feature space by selectively aligning distributions of multiple source domains.
Such an alignment is conducted by dual-level constraints, i.e., the domain-wise
adversarial feature learning and the identity-wise similarity enhancement. We
evaluate our DDAN on a large-scale Domain Generalization Re-ID (DG Re-ID)

align the distributions of various source domains, and significantly

neural networks for semantic segmentation, it is possible to use higher-level
information in the form of bounding boxes, or image tags. In the imaging
sciences, many applications do not have an object-background structure and
bounding boxes are not available. Any available annotation typically comes from
ground truth or domain experts. A direct way to train without masks is using
prior knowledge on the size of objects/classes in the segmentation. We present
a new algorithm to include such information via constraints on the network
output, implemented via projection-based point-to-set distance functions. This
type of distance functions always has the same functional form of the
derivative, and avoids the need to adapt penalty functions to different
constraints, as well as issues related to constraining properties typically
associated with non-differentiable functions. Whereas object size information
is known to enable object segmentation from bounding boxes from datasets with
many general and medical images, we show that the applications extend to the
imaging sciences where data represents indirect measurements, even in the case
of single examples. We illustrate the capabilities in case of a) one or more
classes do not have any annotation; b) there is no annotation at all; c) there
are bounding boxes. We use data for hyperspectral time-lapse imaging, object
segmentation in corrupted images, and sub-surface aquifer mapping from
airborne-geophysical remote-sensing data. The examples verify that the

under uncertainty and develop scalable approximation and optimization methods
to solve this problem. The design variable is taken as an infinite-dimensional
spatially-varying field that represents the material property, while an
additive infinite-dimensional random field represents the variability of the
material property or the manufacturing error. Discretization of this optimal
design problem results in high-dimensional design variables and uncertain
parameters. To solve this problem, we develop a computational approach based on
a Taylor approximation and an approximate Newton method for optimization, which
is based on a Hessian derived at the mean of the random field. We show our
approach is scalable with respect to the dimension of both the design variables
and uncertain parameters, in the sense that the necessary number of acoustic
wave propagations is essentially independent of these dimensions, for numerical
experiments with up to one million design variables and half a million
uncertain parameters. We demonstrate that, using our computational approach, an
optimal design of the acoustic cloak that is robust to material uncertainty is
achieved in a tractable manner. The optimal design under uncertainty problem is
posed and solved for the classical circular obstacle surrounded by a
ring-shaped cloaking region, subjected to both a single-direction
single-frequency incident wave and multiple-direction multiple-frequency
incident waves. Finally, we apply the method to a deterministic large-scale
optimal cloaking problem with complex geometry, to demonstrate that the
approximate Newton method's Hessian computation is viable for large, complex
problems.

trends, namely restaurant and bars, on daily positive cases in top-10

trends, we used Pearson correlation. Our results showed for states/territories
with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical trends in search queries
related to bars and restaurants, which mainly happened after re-opening,
significantly affect the daily new cases, on average. California, for example,
had most searches for restaurants on June 7th, 2020, which affected the number
of new cases within two weeks after the peak with the P-value of .004 for
Granger's causality test. Although a limited number of search queries were
considered, Google search trends for restaurants and bars showed a significant
effect on daily new cases for regions with higher numbers of daily new cases in

as additional information for prediction tasks in new cases of each region.
This prediction can help healthcare leaders manage and control the impact of

is a field that aims to pinpoint evidence-based management strategies. It
provides a framework for scientists to directly impact decisions or to
understand how their work will fit into a decision process. Decision science is
more than undertaking targeted and relevant scientific research or providing
tools to assist policy makers; it is an approach to problem formulation,
bringing together mathematical modelling, stakeholder values and logistical
constraints to support decision making. In this paper we describe decision
science, its use in different contexts, and highlight current gaps in

models into the public spotlight, but it is one of innumerable examples in
which modelling informs decision making. Other examples include models of storm
systems (eg. cyclones, hurricanes) and climate change. Although the decision

requires not only the semantic understanding of both images and questions, but
also the sound perception of a step-by-step reasoning process that would lead
to the correct answer. So far, most successful attempts in VQA have been
focused on only one aspect, either the interaction of visual pixel features of
images and word features of questions, or the reasoning process of answering
the question in an image with simple objects. In this paper, we propose a deep
reasoning VQA model with explicit visual structure-aware textual information,
and it works well in capturing step-by-step reasoning process and detecting a
complex object-relationship in photo-realistic images. REXUP network consists
of two branches, image object-oriented and scene graph oriented, which jointly
works with super-diagonal fusion compositional attention network. We
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate REXUP on the GQA dataset and conduct
extensive ablation studies to explore the reasons behind REXUP's effectiveness.
Our best model significantly outperforms the precious state-of-the-art, which

critical temperature of ~ 4 K can be described as a magnonic version of the
superradiant phase transition (SRPT). The role of photons in the
quantum-optical SRPT is played by Fe magnons, while that of two-level atoms is
played by Er spins. Our spin model, which is reduced to an extended Dicke
model, takes into account the short-range, direct exchange interactions between
Er spins in addition to the long-range Er-Er interactions mediated by Fe
magnons. By using realistic parameters determined by recent terahertz
magnetospectroscopy and magnetization experiments, we demonstrate that it is
the cooperative, ultrastrong coupling between Er spins and Fe magnons that
causes the phase transition. This work thus proves ErFeO3 to be a unique system
that exhibits a SRPT in thermal equilibrium, in contrast to previous
observations of laser-driven non-equilibrium SRPTs.

  Domain Adaptation","9 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to address the domain-shift problem
between a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain. Many efforts
have been made to address the mismatch between the distributions of training
and testing data, but unfortunately, they ignore the task-oriented information
across domains and are inflexible to perform well in complicated open-set
scenarios. Many efforts have been made to eliminate the mismatch between the
distributions of training and testing data by learning domain-invariant
representations. However, the learned representations are usually not
task-oriented, i.e., being class-discriminative and domain-transferable
simultaneously. This drawback limits the flexibility of UDA in complicated
open-set tasks where no labels are shared between domains. In this paper, we
break the concept of task-orientation into task-relevance and task-irrelevance,
and propose a dynamic task-oriented disentangling network (DTDN) to learn
disentangled representations in an end-to-end fashion for UDA. The dynamic
disentangling network effectively disentangles data representations into two
components: the task-relevant ones embedding critical information associated
with the task across domains, and the task-irrelevant ones with the remaining
non-transferable or disturbing information. These two components are
regularized by a group of task-specific objective functions across domains.
Such regularization explicitly encourages disentangling and avoids the use of
generative models or decoders. Experiments in complicated, open-set scenarios
(retrieval tasks) and empirical benchmarks (classification tasks) demonstrate
that the proposed method captures rich disentangled information and achieves
superior performance.

type of adversary. In this paper, we consider a CPS that has to satisfy a
linear temporal logic (LTL) objective in the presence of two kinds of
adversaries. The first adversary has the ability to tamper with inputs to the
CPS to influence satisfaction of the LTL objective. The interaction of the CPS
with this adversary is modeled as a stochastic game. We synthesize a controller
for the CPS to maximize the probability of satisfying the LTL objective under
any policy of this adversary. The second adversary is an eavesdropper who can
observe labeled trajectories of the CPS generated from the previous step. It
could then use this information to launch other kinds of attacks. A labeled
trajectory is a sequence of labels, where a label is associated to a state and
is linked to the satisfaction of the LTL objective at that state. We use
differential privacy to quantify the indistinguishability between states that
are related to each other when the eavesdropper sees a labeled trajectory. Two
trajectories of equal length will be differentially private if they are
differentially private at each state along the respective trajectories. We use
a skewed Kantorovich metric to compute distances between probability
distributions over states resulting from actions chosen according to policies
from related states in order to quantify differential privacy. Moreover, we do
this in a manner that does not affect the satisfaction probability of the LTL
objective. We validate our approach on a simulation of a UAV that has to

Measuring similarity of entities is one of the important tasks, which can

traditional methods based on the aggregated network can bring unwanted
in-directed relationship. To cope with this issue, we propose a similarity
measure based on the ego network of each entity, which effectively considers
the change of an entity's centrality from one ego network to another. The index
proposed is easy to calculate and has a clear physical meaning. Using two
different data sets, we compare the new index with other existing ones. We find
that the new index outperforms the traditional network-based similarity
measures, and it can sometimes surpass the embedding method. In the meanwhile,
the measure by the new index is weakly correlated with those by other methods,
hence providing a different dimension to quantify similarities in co-occurrence
data. Altogether, our work makes an extension in the network-based similarity
measure and can be potentially applied in several related tasks.

for the elastic tensor. Unfortunately, the deformation gradient can only be
recovered from the stress up to a choice of rotation matrix. Hence it is not
possible in general to express the elastic tensor as a unique function of the
equilibrium stress. By considering material symmetries, though, it is shown
that the degree of non-uniqueness can sometimes be reduced, and in some cases
even removed entirely. These results are illustrated through a range numerical
calculations, and we also obtain linearised relations applicable to small
perturbations in equilibrium stress. Finally, we make a comparison with
previous studies, before considering implications for geophysical forward- and
inverse-modelling.

system enabled by aerial IRS (AIRS). Compared to the conventional terrestrial
IRS, AIRS enjoys more deployment flexibility as well as wider-range signal
reflection, thanks to its high altitude and thus more likelihood of
establishing line-of-sight (LoS) links with ground source/destination nodes.
Specifically, we aim to maximize the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
over all locations in a target area by jointly optimizing the transmit
beamforming for the source node and the placement as well as 3D passive
beamforming for the AIRS. The formulated problem is non-convex and thus
difficult to solve. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case
of maximizing the SNR at a given target location, for which the optimal
solution is obtained in closed-form. The result shows that the optimal
horizontal AIRS placement only depends on the ratio between the
source-destination distance and the AIRS altitude. Then for the general case of
AIRS-enabled area coverage, we propose an efficient solution by decoupling the
AIRS passive beamforming design to maximize the worst-case array gain, from its
placement optimization by balancing the resulting angular span and the cascaded
channel path loss. Our proposed solution is based on a novel 3D beam broadening
and flattening technique, where the passive array of the AIRS is divided into
sub-arrays of appropriate size, and their phase shifts are designed to form a
flattened beam pattern with adjustable beamwidth catering to the size of the
coverage area. Both the uniform linear array (ULA)-based and uniform planar
array (UPA)-based AIRSs are considered in our design, which enable
two-dimensional (2D) and 3D passive beamforming, respectively. Numerical
results show that the proposed designs achieve significant performance gains
over the benchmark schemes.

to share emails, given the risk of leakage of commercially sensitive
information. So, it is uncommon to obtain sufficient emails to train a global
AI model efficiently. Accordingly, privacy-preserving distributed and
collaborative machine learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), is a
desideratum. Already prevalent in the healthcare sector, questions remain
regarding the effectiveness and efficacy of FL-based phishing detection within
the context of multi-organization collaborations. To the best of our knowledge,
the work herein is the first to investigate the use of FL in email
anti-phishing. This paper builds upon a deep neural network model, particularly
RNN and BERT for phishing email detection. It analyzes the FL-entangled
learning performance under various settings, including balanced and
asymmetrical data distribution. Our results corroborate comparable performance
statistics of FL in phishing email detection to centralized learning for
balanced datasets, and low organization counts. Moreover, we observe a
variation in performance when increasing organizational counts. For a fixed
total email dataset, the global RNN based model suffers by a 1.8% accuracy drop
when increasing organizational counts from 2 to 10. In contrast, BERT accuracy
rises by 0.6% when going from 2 to 5 organizations. However, if we allow
increasing the overall email dataset with the introduction of new organizations
in the FL framework, the organizational level performance is improved by
achieving a faster convergence speed. Besides, FL suffers in its overall global
model performance due to highly unstable outputs if the email dataset
distribution is highly asymmetric.

method for hyper-polarizing nuclear spins, thereby enhancing their Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signals by orders of magnitude. In SABRE experiments,
non-equilibrium spin order is transferred from parahydrogen to a substrate in a
transient organometallic complex. Applicability of SABRE is expanded by the
methodology of SABRE-relay, in which polarization can be relayed to a second
substrate either by direct chemical exchange of hyperpolarized nuclei or by
polarization transfer between two substrates in a second organometallic
complex. To understand the mechanism of the polarization transfer and study the
transfer efficiency, we propose a theoretical approach to SABRE-relay, which
can treat both spin dynamics and chemical kinetics as well as the interplay
between them. The approach is based on a set of equations for the spin density
matrices of the spin systems involved (i.e., SABRE substrates and complexes),
which can be solved numerically. Using this method, we perform a detailed study
of polarization formation and analyse in detail the dependence of attainable
polarization level on various chemical kinetic and spin dynamic parameters. We

show that -- in our setting -- popular estimators are considerably more

we leverage our generative assumptions to propose a consistent estimator in a

Till now, there is no remedy for this
epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective
preventive measures to control this pandemic. Therefore, in this paper, an
optimization problem is formulated that accommodates both isolation and social
distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we solve
the formulated problem by applying a noncooperative game that can provide an
incentive for maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is interpreted with the
help of our proposed game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social
distancing where there exists a Nash equilibrium. Finally, we perform an
extensive numerical analysis that shows the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in terms of achieving the desired social-distancing to prevent the
outbreak of the COVID-19 in a noncooperative environment. Numerical results
show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing
percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The
numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home
isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of
individuals.

sentiment toward solar energy in the United States using data from Twitter, a
micro-blogging platform in which people post messages, known as tweets. We
filtered tweets specific to solar energy and performed a classification task
using Robustly optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (RoBERTa). Analyzing 71,262 tweets during the period of late
January to early July 2020, we find public sentiment varies significantly
across states. Within the study period, the Northeastern U.S. region shows more
positive sentiment toward solar energy than did the Southern U.S. region. Solar
radiation does not correlate to variation in solar sentiment across states. We
also find that public sentiment toward solar correlates to renewable energy
policy and market conditions, specifically, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)
targets, customer-friendly net metering policies, and a mature solar market.

variations within individual instances. It aims to combine the advantages of
inter-instance discrimination by learning discriminative features to
distinguish between different instances, as well as intra-instance variations
by matching queries against the variants of augmented samples over instances.
Particularly, for each instance, it constructs an instance subspace to model
the configuration of how the significant factors of variations in $K$-shot
augmentations can be combined to form the variants of augmentations. Given a
query, the most relevant variant of instances is then retrieved by projecting
the query onto their subspaces to predict the positive instance class. This
generalizes the existing contrastive learning that can be viewed as a special
one-shot case. An eigenvalue decomposition is performed to configure instance
subspaces, and the embedding network can be trained end-to-end through the
differentiable subspace configuration. Experiment results demonstrate the
proposed $K$-shot contrastive learning achieves superior performances to the
state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

  Perspective for Recognising Visual Patches","ACM MM 2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is commonly used to address the very pervasive
problem of predicting unseen classes in fine-grained image classification and
other tasks. One family of solutions is to learn synthesised unseen visual
samples produced by generative models from auxiliary semantic information, such
as natural language descriptions. However, for most of these models,
performance suffers from noise in the form of irrelevant image backgrounds.
Further, most methods do not allocate a calculated weight to each semantic
patch. Yet, in the real world, the discriminative power of features can be
quantified and directly leveraged to improve accuracy and reduce computational
complexity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called
multi-patch generative adversarial nets (MPGAN) that synthesises local patch
features and labels unseen classes with a novel weighted voting strategy. The
process begins by generating discriminative visual features from noisy text
descriptions for a set of predefined local patches using multiple specialist
generative models. The features synthesised from each patch for unseen classes
are then used to construct an ensemble of diverse supervised classifiers, each
corresponding to one local patch. A voting strategy averages the probability
distributions output from the classifiers and, given that some patches are more
discriminative than others, a discrimination-based attention mechanism helps to
weight each patch accordingly. Extensive experiments show that MPGAN has
significantly greater accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.

of the lattice Kerker effect in regular plasmonic Al nanostructures. Collective
lattice oscillations emerging from delicate interplay between Rayleigh
anomalies and localized surface plasmon resonances both of electric and
magnetic dipoles, and electric and magnetic quadrupoles result in suppression
of the backscattering in a broad spectral range. Variation of geometrical
parameters of Al arrays allows for tailoring lattice Kerker effect throughout

the ground for wide ramifications in the plasmonics and further application of

observation, assuming perfect foreground subtraction, a $5\sigma$ detection of
a stacked HII region can be made with 30 images around some of the brightest
galaxies in \textsc{bluetides} (brighter than $M_{UV} < -22.75$) at $z=9$
(corresponding to a neutral fraction of 90.1 \% in our model). We present
simulated relationships between the UV magnitude of galaxies, the sizes of the

number of flow simulations often required, and by the need to preserve
geological realism in the calibrated (posterior) models. In this work we
present a deep-learning-based surrogate model for two-phase flow in 3D
subsurface formations. This surrogate model, a 3D recurrent residual U-Net
(referred to as recurrent R-U-Net), consists of 3D convolutional and recurrent
(convLSTM) neural networks, designed to capture the spatial-temporal
information associated with dynamic subsurface flow systems. A CNN-PCA
procedure (convolutional neural network post-processing of principal component
analysis) for parameterizing complex 3D geomodels is also described. This
approach represents a simplified version of a recently developed
supervised-learning-based CNN-PCA framework. The recurrent R-U-Net is trained
on the simulated dynamic 3D saturation and pressure fields for a set of random
`channelized' geomodels (generated using 3D CNN-PCA). Detailed flow predictions
demonstrate that the recurrent R-U-Net surrogate model provides accurate
results for dynamic states and well responses for new geological realizations,
along with accurate flow statistics for an ensemble of new geomodels. The 3D
recurrent R-U-Net and CNN-PCA procedures are then used in combination for a
challenging data assimilation problem involving a channelized system. Two
different algorithms, namely rejection sampling and an ensemble-based method,
are successfully applied. The overall methodology described in this paper may
enable the assessment and refinement of data assimilation procedures for a
range of realistic and challenging subsurface flow problems.

to reliably convey an identification (ID) message to a set of receivers via a
binary-input discrete memoryless channel (BDMC), and simultaneously to
guarantee that the communication is covert with respect to a warden who
monitors the communication via another independent BDMC. We prove a square-root
law for the covert identification problem. This states that an ID message of

then characterize the exact pre-constant in the \Theta(.) notation. This
constant is referred to as the covert identification capacity. We show that it
equals the recently developed covert capacity in the standard covert
communication problem, and somewhat surprisingly, the covert identification
capacity can be achieved without any shared key between the sender and
receivers. The achievability proof relies on a random coding argument with
pulse-position modulation (PPM), coupled with a second stage which performs
code refinements. The converse proof relies on an expurgation argument as well
as results for channel resolvability with stringent input constraints.

$MV_{max}$ = -9.30 ${\pm}$0.57 using the new $MV_{max}$ - t$_{3}$ ""universal""

determined the colour excess $E_{B-V}$ = 0.90$\pm$0.09 and distance to the nova
$d$ = 3.55$\pm$0.6 kpc. The optical spectrum obtained in brightness maximum
resembles that of the F2 supergiant. Its bolometric luminosity computed by
fitting the continuum by atmospheric and black-body models is in agreement with
the luminosity, that we have found from photometry. We estimated the mass of
the ONe white dwarf in V392 Per as $M_{wd}$ = 1.21 M$_{\odot}$. The CN Per 2018
can be classified as a fast super-Eddington nova with an outburst LC of plateau
type. Nova displayed He/N spectrum classification, large expansion velocities,
and triple-peaked emission-line profiles during the decline, explained by
equatorial ring seen nearly face on and a bipolar flow aligned almost with the
line of sight. The post maximum spectra of CN Per 2018 and available radio data
were used to estimate the inclination angle of the system as $i\sim$
9$^{\circ}$. The difference in intensity of redward and blueward emission bumps
is possible to explain by about 1.5 times higher density of the receding
outtflow. The rapid increase of the bipolar outflow radial velocities by
$\sim$300 km/s around day 5 after the maximum was caused by the fast bipolar
winds from the burning white dwarf after shrinking of its pseudophotosphere.

various cosmological parameters, compared to the two-point correlation

linearly changing the reference point specification during its execution

measurements of the matter power spectrum from the CMB only constrain this on

values of $k$) can provide new constraints on non-Gaussianity. A powerful way
to do this is by measuring the $\textrm{H}\textrm{I}$ matter power spectrum at

for the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), which can achieve $\lesssim$1$''$

algebraic Witt vectors $\widehat{f}$ by their special values, and conversely,

shifted to larger angles by up to ~ 4 degrees compared with the data. These

EXOFAST modelling are broadly consistent with those of the default parameter
values listed in the NASA Exoplanet Archive. An updated orbital period of

is consistent with recent studies of the system using larger telescopes. Using
this updated ephemeris, the predicted mid-transit time for a notional

1.4 min compared with the discovery ephemeris and is ~8 times more precise.

multi-component reactions of second and higher orders, in a condition close to

the turbulent flow is highly developed. In such a state a competition exists
between the chemical reaction that tends to dump reactant concentration
fluctuations and enhance their correlation intensity and the turbulent mixing
that on the contrary increases fluctuations and remove relative correlations.
We show that a unique control parameter, the Damkh\""{o}ler number ($Da_\theta$)
that can be constructed from the scalar Taylor micro-scale, the reactant
diffusivity and the reaction rate characterises the functional dependence of
fluctuations and correlations in a variety of conditions, i.e., at changing the
reaction order, the Reynolds and the Schmidt numbers. The larger is such a
Damkh\""{o}ler number the more depleted are the scalar fluctuations as compared
to the fluctuations of a passive scalar field in the same conditions, and
vice-versa the more intense are the correlations. A saturation in this
behaviour is observed beyond $Da_\theta \simeq \mathcal{O}(10)$. We provide an
analytical prediction for this phenomenon which is in excellent agreement with
direct numerical simulation results.

Eukaryotes in particular, evolved radically new ways to sense and react to
their environment. These advances enabled new and more complex forms of
cellular behavior in eukaryotes, including directional movement, active
feeding, mating, or responses to predation. But what are the key events and
innovations during eukaryogenesis that made all of this possible? Here we
describe the ancestral repertoire of eukaryotic excitability and discuss five
major cellular innovations that enabled its evolutionary origin. The
innovations include a vastly expanded repertoire of ion channels, endomembranes
as intracellular capacitors, a flexible plasma membrane, the emergence of cilia
and pseudopodia, and the relocation of chemiosmotic ATP synthesis to
mitochondria that liberated the plasma membrane for more complex electrical
signaling involved in sensing and reacting. We conjecture that together with an
increase in cell size, these new forms of excitability greatly amplified the
degrees of freedom associated with cellular responses, allowing eukaryotes to
vastly outperform prokaryotes in terms of both speed and accuracy. This
comprehensive new perspective on the evolution of excitability enriches our
view of eukaryogenesis and emphasizes behaviour and sensing as major

quantum Fisher information (QFI) of acceleration, which indicates that the
optimal precision of estimation is achieved when choosing an appropriate

periodicity fades away with the evolution of time, which means that the initial

QFI fluctuates, and there may exist two peak values with a certain moment,
which expands the detection range of the acceleration. Therefore, we can
enhance the estimation precision of acceleration by choosing an appropriate

initial state parameter $\theta$ lasts a longer time than the previous
unbounded case, which indicates that the initial state is protected by the

equilibrium tidal flows, driving spin and orbital evolution in close convective
binary systems. Compared to mixing-length predictions, this viscosity ought to
be reduced when the tidal frequency $|\omega_t|$ exceeds the turnover frequency
$\omega_{c\nu}$ of the dominant convective eddies, but the efficiency of this
reduction has been disputed. We reexamine this long-standing controversy using
direct numerical simulations of an idealized global model. We simulate thermal
convection in a full sphere, and externally forced by the equilibrium tidal
flow, to measure the effective viscosity $\nu_E$ acting on the tidal flow when
$|\omega_t|/\omega_{c\nu} \gtrsim 1$. We demonstrate that the frequency
reduction of $\nu_E$ is correlated with the frequency spectrum of the
(unperturbed) convection. For intermediate frequencies below those in the
turbulent cascade ($|\omega_t|/\omega_{c\nu} \sim 1-5$), the frequency spectrum
displays an anomalous $1/\omega^\alpha$ power law that is responsible for the
frequency-reduction $\nu_E \propto 1/|\omega_t|^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha < 1$
depends on the model parameters. We then get $|\nu_E| \propto
1/|\omega_t|^{\delta}$ with $\delta > 1$ for higher frequencies, and $\delta=2$
is obtained for a Kolmogorov turbulent cascade. A generic $|\nu_E| \propto
1/|\omega_t|^{2}$ suppression is next found for higher frequencies within the
dissipation range of the convection (but with negative values). Our results
indicate that a better knowledge of the frequency spectrum of convection is
necessary to accurately predict the efficiency of tidal dissipation in stars

in FastPM, enabling computation of the CDM and total matter power spectra to
percent-level accuracy in the non-linear regime. The CDM-neutrino cross-power
can also be computed at a sufficient accuracy to constrain cosmological
observables. To avoid the shot noise that typically plagues neutrino particle
simulations, we employ a quasi-random algorithm to sample the relevant
Fermi-Dirac distribution when setting the initial neutrino thermal velocities.
We additionally develop an effective distribution function to describe a set of
non-degenerate neutrinos as a single particle to speed up non-degenerate
simulations. The simulation is accurate for the full range of physical
interest, $M_\nu \lesssim 0.6$eV, and applicable to redshifts $z\lesssim2$.
Such accuracy can be achieved by initializing particles with the two-fluid
approximation transfer functions (using the REPS package). Convergence can be
reached in $\sim 25$ steps, with a starting redshift of $z=99$. Probing
progressively smaller scales only requires an increase in the number of CDM
particles being simulated, while the number of neutrino particles can remain
fixed at a value less than or similar to the number of CDM particles. In turn,
the percentage increase in runtime-per-step due to neutrino particles is
between $\sim 5-20\%$ for runs with $1024^3$ CDM particles, and decreases as
the number of CDM particles is increased. The code has been made publicly

channel. Here, enlightened by the Rice-Male topological pumping, we find that
the staggered periodic next-nearest neighbor hoppings can also separate the
initial mixed edge states, which ensures the state transfer between topological
left and right edge states. Significantly, we construct an unique topological
state transfer channel by introducing the staggered periodic on-site potentials
and the periodic next-nearest neighbor hoppings added only on the odd sites
simultaneously, and find that the state initially prepared at the last site can
be transfered to the first two sites with the same probability distribution.
This special topological state transfer channel is expected to realize a
topological beam splitter, whose function is to make the initial photon at one

we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the topological beam splitter

we use the PLUTO code, to perform $3$D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a
gravitationally stratified straight flux tube in a coronal environment, in the
presence of a weak flow around the loop, perpendicular to its axis. Once this
flow is firmly set up, a transverse oscillation is initiated, dominated by the
fundamental kink mode of a standing wave, while the existence of a second
harmonic is revealed, with a frequency ratio to the fundamental mode near the
observed ones in decay-less oscillations. The presence of vortex shedding is
also established in our simulations, which is connected to the ""slippery""

  Photonic Crystal for Sensing Applications",,,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our theoretical study reveals the opportunity to develop an electric field
sensor basedon the exploitation of Symmetry Protected Mode (SPM) that we excite
within an electro-opticalmaterial, namely lithium niobate (LN). The SPM
consists of a dark Fano-like resonance thatresults from the combination of a
discrete Bloch mode of a Photonic Crystal (PhC) with acontinuum mode of a
membrane, both of them made in LN. The dark character is linked tothe structure
geometry having a high degree of symmetry. The SPM excitation is then
madepossible thanks to an illumination under small oblique incidence which
breaks the symmetry ofthe configuration. This results in several
ultra-sensitive and tunable Fano-like resonances withhigh quality factors up to
10^5 in the telecoms spectral range. Some of these resonances providemodes with
a highly confined electric field inside LN. This confinement allows the
enhancementof the electro-optic Pockels effect by a factor up to 4x10^5, thus
exacerbating the detectionsensitivity of the designed sensor.

  Camera Applications",,,"10.1049/iet-cvi.2019.0897",,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Deep Learning-based object detectors can enhance the capabilities of smart
camera systems in a wide spectrum of machine vision applications including
video surveillance, autonomous driving, robots and drones, smart factory, and
health monitoring. Pedestrian detection plays a key role in all these
applications and deep learning can be used to construct accurate
state-of-the-art detectors. However, such complex paradigms do not scale easily
and are not traditionally implemented in resource-constrained smart cameras for
on-device processing which offers significant advantages in situations when
real-time monitoring and robustness are vital. Efficient neural networks can
not only enable mobile applications and on-device experiences but can also be a
key enabler of privacy and security allowing a user to gain the benefits of
neural networks without needing to send their data to the server to be
evaluated. This work addresses the challenge of achieving a good trade-off
between accuracy and speed for efficient deployment of deep-learning-based
pedestrian detection in smart camera applications. A computationally efficient
architecture is introduced based on separable convolutions and proposes
integrating dense connections across layers and multi-scale feature fusion to
improve representational capacity while decreasing the number of parameters and
operations. In particular, the contributions of this work are the following: 1)
An efficient backbone combining multi-scale feature operations, 2) a more
elaborate loss function for improved localization, 3) an anchor-less approach
for detection, The proposed approach called YOLOpeds is evaluated using the
PETS2009 surveillance dataset on 320x320 images. Overall, YOLOpeds provides
real-time sustained operation of over 30 frames per second with detection rates
in the range of 86% outperforming existing deep learning models.

oscillatory activities in the network for strong coupling strength. We
demonstrate that our proposed mechanism is independent of coupling topology.
For a globally coupled network, we provide numerical and analytical treatment

our scheme, we validate our results for both Stuart-Landau limit cycle

We propose a novel method for synthesizing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)

introduced using the 4D eXtended Cardiac and Torso (XCAT) computerized human
phantom. We investigate two conditional image synthesis approaches grounded on
a semantically-consistent mask-guided image generation technique: 4-class and
8-class XCAT-GANs. The 4-class technique relies on only the annotations of the
heart; while the 8-class technique employs a predicted multi-tissue label map
of the heart-surrounding organs and provides better guidance for our
conditional image synthesis. For both techniques, we train our conditional
XCAT-GAN with real images paired with corresponding labels and subsequently at
the inference time, we substitute the labels with the XCAT derived ones.
Therefore, the trained network accurately transfers the tissue-specific
textures to the new label maps. By creating 33 virtual subjects of synthetic
CMR images at the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases, we evaluate the
usefulness of such data in the downstream cardiac cavity segmentation task
under different augmentation strategies. Results demonstrate that even with
only 20% of real images (40 volumes) seen during training, segmentation
performance is retained with the addition of synthetic CMR images. Moreover,
the improvement in utilizing synthetic images for augmenting the real data is
evident through the reduction of Hausdorff distance up to 28% and an increase
in the Dice score up to 5%, indicating a higher similarity to the ground truth

technical debt at selective granularity levels. In this paper we aim to study
the evolution and characteristics of technical debt in open-source software. We
carry out a longitudinal study that covers the entire development history of
several complex applications. We study how technical debt is introduced in
software, as well as identify how developers handle its accumulation over the
long term. We carried out our evaluation using three complex, open-source Java
applications. All 110 released versions, covering more than 10 years of
development history for each application were analyzed using SonarQube. We
studied how the amount, composition and history of technical debt changed
during development, compared our results across the studied applications and
present our most important findings. For each application, we identified key
versions during which large amounts of technical debt were added, removed or
both. This had significantly more impact when compared to the lines of code or
class count increases that generally occurred during development. Within each
version, we found high correlation between file lines of code and technical
debt. We observed that the Pareto principle was satisfied for the studied
applications, as 20% of issue types generated around 80% of total technical
debt. Early application versions showed greater fluctuation in the amount of
existing technical debt. Application size appeared to be an unreliable
predictor for the quantity of technical debt. Most debt was introduced in
applications as part of milestone releases that expanded their feature set. We
also discovered that technical debt issues persist for a long time in source
code, and their removal did not appear to be prioritized according to type or
severity.

define two families of non-local, non-linear averaging operators, parametrised
by $\epsilon$ and defined for all bounded, Borel functions $u:\mathbb{R}^N\to

$\epsilon^{2s}$-order coefficient in the expansion of the deviation of each
$\epsilon$-average from the value $u(x)$, in the limit of the domain of
averaging exhausting an appropriate cone in $\mathbb{R}^N$ at the rate
$\epsilon\to 0$.
  Second, we consider the $\epsilon$-dynamic programming principles modeled on
the first average, and show that their solutions converge uniformly as
$\epsilon\to 0$, to viscosity solutions of the homogeneous non-local Dirichlet
problem for $\Delta_p^s$, when posed in a domain $\mathcal{D}$ that satisfies
the external cone condition and subject to bounded, uniformly continuous data

  Finally, we interpret such $\epsilon$-approximating solutions as values to
the non-local Tug-of-War game with noise. In this game, players choose
directions while the game position is updated randomly within the infinite cone

$>$3.5-$\sigma$. The Na line exhibits a broad line profile that can be
attributed to pressure broadening, indicating a mostly clear planetary

determination of $\theta_{13}$ and the total background rates without relying

reactor in operation. The oscillation results are enhanced by the use of 24.06
days (12.74 days) of reactor-off data in the far (near) detector. The analysis
considers the \nue interactions up to a visible energy of 8.5 MeV, using the
events at higher energies to build a cosmogenic background model considering
fast-neutrons interactions and $^{9}$Li decays. The
background-model-independent determination of the mixing angle yields
sin$^2(2\theta_{13})=0.094\pm0.017$, being the best-fit total background rates
fully consistent with the cosmogenic background model. A second oscillation
analysis is also performed constraining the total background rates to the
cosmogenic background estimates. While the central value is not significantly
modified due to the consistency between the reactor-off data and the background
estimates, the addition of the background model reduces the uncertainty on
$\theta_{13}$ to 0.015. Along with the oscillation results, the normalization
of the anti-neutrino rate is measured with a precision of 0.86\%, reducing the

techniques are indispensable. The aim of this work is the development and
comparison of novel ultrasonic and capacitive measurement setups, sharing a
common hardware platform. Both measurement techniques that are implemented and
compared are based on the detection of minor chest wall vibrations in
millimeter ranges, due to geometrical thorax changes during respiration and
heartbeat activities. After examining the physical measurement conditions and
simulating the capacitive sensor, a problem-specific measurement setup is
proposed. The system is characterized to be capable of detecting distance
changes below 2 {\mu}m via the ultrasonic sensor and below 800 {\mu}m via the
capacitive sensor. First subject measurements show that the detection of heart
activities is possible under ideal conditions and exclusively with the proposed
ultrasonic approach. However, the capacitive sensor works reliably for
respiration monitoring, even when the subject is fully-clothed and covered with
a blanket. The chosen ultrasonic approach is sensitive regarding minor changes
of the reflecting surface and therefore has high uncertainty. In contrast,
capacitive respiration detection is very reliable. It is conceivable that
improvements in the capacitive sensor circuitry will also enable the detection
of heart activities. The proposed ultrasonic approach presents current problems

field of information retrieval in academic and production systems. The existing
gaps in our current understanding are numerous, even on fundamental questions
such as whether consistent and high-quality recipe recommendation can be
delivered across languages. In this paper, we introduce the multi-language
recipe recommendation setting and present grounding results that will help to
establish the potential and absolute value of future work in this area. Our
work draws on several billion events from millions of recipes and users from
Arabic, English, Indonesian, Russian, and Spanish. We represent recipes using a
combination of normalised ingredients, standardised skills and image embeddings
obtained without human intervention. In modelling, we take a classical approach
based on optimising an embedded bi-linear user-item metric space towards the
interactions that most strongly elicit cooking intent. For users without
interaction histories, a bespoke content-based cold-start model that predicts
context and recipe affinity is introduced. We show that our approach to
personalisation is stable and easily scales to new languages. A robust
cross-validation campaign is employed and consistently rejects baseline models
and representations, strongly favouring those we propose. Our results are
presented in a language-oriented (as opposed to model-oriented) fashion to
emphasise the language-based goals of this work. We believe that this is the
first large-scale work that comprehensively considers the value and potential
of multi-language recipe recommendation and personalisation as well as
delivering scalable and reliable models.

partitioning of a eukaryotic cell into two daughter cells. This involves flows
of actin filaments and myosin motors in the growing membrane interface at the
mid-plane of the dividing cell. Assuming boundary driven alignment of the

resulting active stresses influence the flow. Using the continuum gel theory
framework, we obtain exact axisymmetric solutions of the dynamical equations.
These solutions are consistent with experimental observations on closure rate.
Using these solutions we perform linear stability analysis for the contracting
ring under non-axisymmetric deformations. Our analysis shows that few low wave
number modes, which are unstable during onset of the constriction, later on
become stable when the ring shrinks to smaller radii, which is a generic
feature of actomyosin ring closure. Our theory also captures how the effective
tension in the ring decreases with its radius causing significant slow down in
the contraction process at later times.

and change throughout the lifespan, and how these trajectories are affected by
genetic and environmental factors. Estimation of these lifespan trajectories is
statistically challenging, since their shapes are typically highly nonlinear,
and although true change can only be quantified by longitudinal examinations,
as follow-up intervals in neuroimaging studies typically cover less than 10 \%
of the lifespan, use of cross-sectional information is necessary. Linear mixed
models (LMMs) and structural equation models (SEMs) commonly used in
longitudinal analysis rely on assumptions which are typically not met with
lifespan data, in particular when the data consist of observations combined
from multiple studies. While LMMs require a priori specification of a
polynomial functional form, SEMs do not easily handle data with unstructured
time intervals between measurements. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs)
offer an attractive alternative, and in this paper we propose various ways of
formulating GAMMs for estimation of lifespan trajectories of 12 brain regions,
using a large longitudinal dataset and realistic simulation experiments. We
show that GAMMs are able to more accurately fit lifespan trajectories,
distinguish longitudinal and cross-sectional effects, and estimate effects of
genetic and environmental exposures. Finally, we discuss and contrast questions
related to lifespan research which strictly require repeated measures data and
questions which can be answered with a single measurement per participant, and
in the latter case, which simplifying assumptions that need to be made. The
examples are accompanied with R code, providing a tutorial for researchers
interested in using GAMMs.

this notion and shakiness. We use this and the techniques in [PaPe] to prove

relay network with $N$ parallel decode-and-forward (DF) relays. Due to the
distributed nature of this network, it is practically very challenging to
fulfill the requirement of instantaneous channel state information for coherent
detection. To bypass this requirement, we consider the use of non-coherent DF
relaying based on a generalized differential modulation (GDM) scheme, in which
transmission power allocation over the $M$-ary phase shift keying symbols is
exploited when performing differential encoding. In this paper, a novel
detector at the destination of such a non-coherent DF relay network is
proposed. It is an accurate approximation of the state-of-the-art detector,
called the almost maximum likelihood detector (AMLD), but the detection
complexity is considerably reduced from $\mathcal{O}(M^2N)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(MN)$. By characterizing the dominant error terms, we derive an
accurate approximate symbol error rate (SER) expression. An optimized power
allocation scheme for GDM is further designed based on this SER expression. Our
simulation demonstrates that the proposed non-coherent scheme can perform close
to the coherent counterpart as the block length increases. Additionally, we
prove that the diversity order of both the proposed detector and the AMLD is
exactly $\lceil N/2 \rceil + 1$. Extensive simulation results further verify
the accuracy of our results in various scenarios.

matrix Lie groups. The underlying system is assumed to be perturbed by
exogenous unmeasured bounded disturbances, and the control problem is posed as
a min-max optimal control wherein the disturbance is the adversary and tries to
maximise a cost that the control tries to minimise. Assuming the existence of a
saddle point in the problem, we present a version of the Pontryagin maximum
principle (PMP) that encapsulates first-order necessary conditions that the
optimal control and disturbance trajectories must satisfy. This PMP features a
saddle point condition on the Hamiltonian and a set of backward difference
equations for the adjoint dynamics. We also present a special case of our
result on Euclidean spaces. We conclude with applying the PMP to robust version
of single axis rotation of a rigid body.

the foundation for a large body of BFT protocols. While many successors to PBFT
have been developed, there is no general technique to compare these protocols
under realistic network conditions such as unreliable links. In this paper, we
introduce a probabilistic model for evaluating BFT protocols in the presence of
dynamic link and crash failures. Based on modeling techniques from
communication theory, the network state of replicas is captured and used to
derive the success probability of the protocol execution. To this end, we
examine the influence of link and crash failure rates as well as the number of
replicas. The model is derived from the communication pattern, making it
implementation-independent and facilitating an adaptation to other BFT
protocols. The model is validated with a simulation of PBFT and BFT-SMaRt.
Further, a comparison in protocol behavior of PBFT, Zyzzyva and SBFT is
performed and critical failure thresholds are identified.e thresholds are

asymptotic theory predicts a waveless free-surface at every order. This is due
to the fact that the waves are in fact exponentially small---that is, beyond
all algebraic orders of the Froude number. Solutions containing exponentially
small terms exhibit a peculiarity known as the Stokes phenomenon, whereby waves
can 'switch-on' seemingly instantaneously across so-called Stokes lines,
partitioning the fluid domain into wave-free regions and regions with waves. In
three dimensions, the Stokes line concept must extend to what are analogously
known as 'Stokes-surfaces'. This paper is concerned with the archetypal problem
of uniform flow over a point source---reminiscent of, but separate to, the
famous Kelvin wave problem. In theory, there exist Stokes surfaces i.e.
manifolds in space that divide wave-free regions from regions with waves.
Previously, in Lustri & Chapman (2013) the intersection of the Stokes surface
with the free-surface, z=0, was found for the case of a linearised point-source
obstruction. Here we demonstrate how the Stokes surface can be computed in
three-dimensional space, particularly in a manner that can be extended to the
case of nonlinear bodies.

$\sim10^{-3}$, we derive that the total mass accreted is $\sim3.9~M_\odot$. The

concept of degeneracy inherent in linear programming, in strong contrast to
well-known results for smooth stochastic optimization programs. In particular,
if the corresponding dual linear program is degenerate the asymptotic limit law

investigate the kinematic structure of molecular clouds. However, measurements
of cloud velocity dispersions with different lines, even in the same region,
often yield inconsistent results. The reasons for this disagreement are not
entirely clear since molecular line observations are subject to a number of
biases. In this paper, we untangle and investigate various factors that drive
linewidth measurement biases by constructing synthetic
position-position-velocity cubes for a variety of tracers from a suite of
self-gravitating magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds. We
compare linewidths derived from synthetic observations of these data cubes to
the true values in the simulations. We find that differences in linewidth as
measured by different tracers are driven by a combination of density-dependent
excitation, whereby tracers that are sensitive to higher densities sample
smaller regions with smaller velocity dispersions, opacity broadening,
especially for highly optically thick tracers such as CO, and finite resolution
and sensitivity, which suppress the wings of emission lines. We find that, at
fixed signal to noise ratio, three commonly-used tracers, the J=4->3 line of
CO, the J=1->0 line of C^{18}O and the (1,1) inversion transition of NH_3,
generally offer the best compromise between these competing biases, and produce

assemble two models for ion-molecule collisions: an independent atom model
(IAM) based on the Bragg additivity rule (labeled IAM-AR), and also the
so-called pixel-counting method (IAM-PCM) which introduces dependence on the
orientation of the molecule during impact. The IAM-PCM leads to significantly
reduced capture cross sections relative to IAM-AR at low energies, since it
takes into account the overlap of effective atomic cross sectional areas. We
compare our results with available experimental and other theoretical data
focusing on water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4) and uracil (C4H4N2O2). For the
water molecule target we also provide results from a classical-trajectory Monte
Carlo approach that includes dynamical screening effects on projectile and
target. For small molecules dominated by a many-electron atom, such as carbon
in methane, or oxygen in water we find a saturation phenomenon for higher
projectile charges (Q = 3) and low energies, where the net capture cross
section for the molecule is dominated by the net cross section for the

states, is an essential principle of the topological phases. However, the
bulk-boundary correspondence is broken down in general non-Hermitian systems.
In this paper, we construct one-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model with periodic driving that exhibits non-Hermitian skin effect: all the
eigenstates are localized at the boundary of the systems, whether the bulk
states or the zero and the $\pi$ modes. To capture the topological properties,
the non-Bloch winding numbers are defined by the non-Bloch periodized evolution
operators based on the generalized Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the
non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence is established: the non-Bloch
winding numbers ($W_{0,\pi}$) characterize the edge states with quasienergies
$\epsilon=0, \pi$. In our non-Hermitian system, a novel phenomenon can emerge
that the robust edge states can appear even when the Floquet bands are
topological trivial with zero non-Bloch band invariant, which is defined in
terms of the non-Bloch effective Hamiltonian. We also show that the relation
between the non-Bloch winding numbers ($W_{0,\pi}$) and the non-Bloch band
invariant ($\mathcal{W}$): $\mathcal{W}= W_{0}- W_{\pi}$.

combination with more complex modules such as attention, and/or techniques such

surpassed VGG by a large margin in other domains -- are rarely used in MIR. One
of the main reasons for this, as we will show, is the lack of generalization of
deeper CNNs in the music domain. In this paper, we present a principled way to
make deep architectures like ResNet competitive for music-related tasks, based
on well-designed regularization strategies. In particular, we analyze the
recently introduced Receptive-Field Regularization and Shake-Shake, and show
that they significantly improve the generalization of deep CNNs on

(1975) we consider a branching

generation. In contrast to above mentioned paper we assume that the environment
is long-tailed, that is that the distribution $F$ of $\xi_n := \log

distribution is light-tailed, the environment itself can produce extremely
heavy tails of the distribution of the population size in the n-th generation

for any n, the distribution tail $\mathbb{P}(Z_n > m)$ of the $n$-th population

correction derived from the white light curve, reaching typical uncertainties
in transit depth of $\approx$ 2x10$^{-4}$ in wavelength bins of 15 nm. After
correction for flux contamination from a blended companion star, our
observations reveal a featureless spectrum across the full range of the FORS2
observations and we are unable to confirm the Na absorption previously inferred
using Gemini/GMOS or the strong Rayleigh scattering observed using broad-band
light curves. We performed a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval on the full
optical-infrared transmission spectrum using the additional data from
Gemini/GMOS, HST/WFC3 and Spitzer observations and recover evidence for H$_2$O
absorption at the 4.0$\sigma$ level. However, our observations are not able to
completely rule out the presence of Na, which is found at 2.0$\sigma$ in our
retrievals. This may in part be explained by patchy/inhomogeneous clouds or
hazes damping any absorption features in our FORS2 spectrum, but an inherently
small scale height also makes this feature challenging to probe from the
ground. Our results nonetheless demonstrate the continuing potential of
ground-based observations for investigating exoplanet atmospheres and emphasise

wave-functions in which the local bond-dimensions can evolve to capture growing

restructure itself as the complexity of the dynamics grows across time and

complicated architectures like LSTM are used to integrate the seasonal

opens up new applications for neural networks in electricity trading, such as
the generation of price forward curves. Besides the theoretical foundation,
this paper also provides an empirical multi-year study on the German

the embedding layer. The study shows that in short-term price-forecasting the
mean absolute error of the proposed neural networks with an embedding layer is
better than the LSTM and time-series benchmark models and even slightly better
as our best benchmark model with a sophisticated hyperparameter optimization.

and its labels is not only smaller than those distances between the image and
its labels' nearest neighbors, but also smaller than the distances between the
labels and other images corresponding to the labels' nearest neighbors.
Moreover, a reconstruction module for recovering correct labels is incorporated
into the whole framework as a regularization term, such that the label
embedding space is more representative. Our model can be trained in an

via an adaptive differentiable pooling operation. Afterwards, the decoder
infers the underlying manifold by transforming each sampled point along with
the embedded feature of its neighborhood to a local surface centered around the

cloud. Further, we design an unsupervised training loss, so that our network
can be trained in either an unsupervised or supervised fashion. Experiments

the heated dust itself. The model consists of an AGN and an infrared radiating
dusty disk, the latter being the primary mass reservoir for the outflow. We
calculate the trajectories of dusty gas clumps in this environment, accounting
for both gravity and the AGN radiation as well as the re-radiation by the hot

launched at the inner edge of the dusty disk. This is consistent with
high-angular resolution infrared and sub-mm observations of some local Seyfert

and the surface roughness which exists on all solid surfaces, if no plastic
deformation would occur one expects in most cases large fluid flow channels
between the contacting metallic bodies, and large fluid leakage. However, in
most applications plastic deformation occurs, at least at the asperity level,
which allows the surfaces to approach each other to such an extent that fluid
leakage often can be neglected. In this study, we present an experimental
set-up for studying the fluid leakage in metallic seals. We study the water
leakage between a steel sphere and a steel body (seat) with a conical surface.
The experimental results are found to be in good quantitative agreement with a

widely applied to train the collected data in industrial IoT. However, for
privacy issues, traditional data-gathering centralized learning is not
applicable to industrial scenarios sensitive to training sets. Recently,
federated learning has received widespread attention, since it trains a model
by only relying on gradient aggregation without accessing training sets. But
existing researches reveal that the shared gradient still retains the sensitive
information of the training set. Even worse, a malicious aggregation server may
return forged aggregated gradients. In this paper, we propose the VFL,
verifiable federated learning with privacy-preserving for big data in
industrial IoT. Specifically, we use Lagrange interpolation to elaborately set
interpolation points for verifying the correctness of the aggregated gradients.
Compared with existing schemes, the verification overhead of VFL remains
constant regardless of the number of participants. Moreover, we employ the
blinding technology to protect the privacy of the gradients submitted by the
participants. If no more than n-2 of n participants collude with the
aggregation server, VFL could guarantee the encrypted gradients of other
participants not being inverted. Experimental evaluations corroborate the
practical performance of the presented VFL framework with high accuracy and
efficiency.

last twenty years, researchers from the field started using research methods
common in social sciences such as case study, ethnography, and grounded theory.
More recently, case survey, another imported research method, has seen its
increasing use in SE studies. It is based on existing case studies reported in
the literature and intends to harness the generalizability of survey and the
depth of case study. However, little is known on how case survey has been
applied in SE research, let alone guidelines on how to employ it properly.
Aims: This article aims to provide a better understanding of how case survey
has been applied in Software Engineering research. Method: To address this
knowledge gap, we performed a systematic mapping study and analyzed 12 Software
Engineering studies that used the case survey method. Results: Our findings
show that these studies presented a heterogeneous understanding of the approach
ranging from secondary studies to primary inquiries focused on a large number
of instances of a research phenomenon. They have not applied the case survey
method consistently as defined in the seminal methodological papers.
Conclusions: We conclude that a set of clearly defined guidelines are needed on

chemistry. Most estimations of the ionization fraction have relied on
deuterated species such as DCO+, whose detection is limited to dense cores
representing an extremely small fraction of the volume of the giant molecular
clouds they are part of. As large field-of-view hyperspectral maps become
available, new tracers may be found. We search for the best observable tracers
of the ionization fraction based on a grid of astrochemical models. We build
grids of models that sample randomly a large space of physical conditions
(unobservable quantities such as gas density, temperature, etc.) and compute
the corresponding observables (line intensities, column densities) and the
ionization fraction. We estimate the predictive power of each potential tracer
by training a Random Forest model to predict the ionization fraction from that
tracer, based on these model grids. In both translucent medium and cold dense
medium conditions, several observable tracers with very good predictive power
for the ionization fraction are found. Several tracers in cold dense medium
conditions are found to be better and more widely applicable than the
traditional DCO+/HCO+ ratio. We also provide simpler analytical fits for
estimating the ionization fraction from the best tracers, and for estimating
the associated uncertainties. We discuss the limitations of the present study
and select a few recommended tracers in both types of conditions. The method
presented here is very general and can be applied to the measurement of any
other quantity of interest (cosmic ray flux, elemental abundances, etc.) from
any type of model (PDR models, time-dependent chemical models, etc.).

droplets of initial diameter between $10-50 \mu m$ have the highest infection
probability. However, by the time they are inhaled, the diameters reduce to
about $1/6^{th}$ of their initial diameters. While the initially near unity
infection probability due to droplets rapidly decays within the first $25s$,
the small yet persistent infection probability of desiccated nuclei decays
appreciably only by $\mathcal{O} (1000s)$, assuming the virus sustains equally
well within the dried droplet nuclei as in the droplets. Combined with
molecular collision theory adapted to calculate frequency of contact between
the susceptible population and the droplet/nuclei cloud, infection rate
constants are derived ab-initio, leading to a SEIR model applicable for any
respiratory event - vector combination. Viral load, minimum infectious dose,
sensitivity of the virus half-life to the phase of its vector and dilution of
the respiratory jet/puff by the entraining air are shown to mechanistically
determine specific physical modes of transmission and variation in the basic
reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$, from first principle calculations.

only inductive or only capacitative) are known to have real poles and zeros,
and further, with the zeros interlacing poles (ZIP). Due to a variety of
definitions of the notion of a system zero, and due to other reasons described
in the paper, results involving ZIP have not been extended to MIMO systems.
This paper formulates conditions under which MIMO systems too have interlaced
poles and zeros.
  This paper next focusses on the notion of a `spectral zero' of a system,
which has been well-studied in various contexts: for example, spectral
factorization, optimal charging/discharging of a dissipative system, and even
model order reduction. We formulate conditions under which the spectral zeros
of a MIMO system are real, and further, conditions that guarantee that the
system-zeros, spectral zeros, and the poles are all interlaced.
  The techniques used in the proofs involve new results in Algebraic Riccati
equations (ARE) and Hamiltonian matrices, and these results help in formulating
new notions of positive-real balancing, and inter-relations with the existing
notion of positive-real balancing; we also relate the positive-real singular
values with the eigenvalues of the extremal ARE solutions in the proposed
`quasi-balanced' forms.

described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr space-times; however, there is no direct
evidence to assert this. Moreover, there are various solutions in general
relativity that can be alternatives to black holes, usually called black hole
mimickers. In this work, we study the shadow produced by a compact object
described by the q-metric, which is the simplest static and axially symmetric
solution of Einstein equations with a non-vanishing quadrupole moment. This
particular spacetime has the property of containing an independent parameter
$q$, which is related to the compact object deformation. The solution
corresponds to naked singularities for some specific values of this parameter.
Additionally, we analyze the eigenvalues of the Riemann tensor using the
$SO(3,C)$ representation, which allows us to find, in an invariant way, regions
where there may be repulsive effects. Furthermore, we numerically solve the
motion equations to show the shadow, the Einstein ring, and the gravitational
lensing to establish a possible signature of such repulsive effects. We found
that as $q$ is smaller, the Einstein ring decreases, but the shape is the same
as the Schwarzschild black hole case. However, for values of $q$ lower or equal
than $-0.5$, repulsive gravitational effects appear in the gravitational
lensing close to the compact object, where a strong dependence of the system to
the initial conditions seems to take place.

avoid coarse fuzzy partitions, which group data into large clusters that do not
adapt to their local behaviour, or a too dense fuzzy partition, which generally
has cells that are not covered by the data, thus being redundant and resulting
in a higher computational cost. To this end, the data-driven membership

Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the input data. Finally, we introduce
the space of continuous Fuzzy transforms, which is useful for the comparison of

  fixed typos, general grammar improvements, updated 2 references",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predictive clustering trees (PCTs) are a well established generalization of
standard decision trees, which can be used to solve a variety of predictive
modeling tasks, including structured output prediction. Combining them into
ensembles yields state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the ensembles of
PCTs can be interpreted by calculating feature importance scores from the
learned models. However, their learning time scales poorly with the
dimensionality of the output space. This is often problematic, especially in
(hierarchical) multi-label classification, where the output can consist of
hundreds of potential labels. Also, learning of PCTs can not exploit the
sparsity of data to improve the computational efficiency, which is common in
both input (molecular fingerprints, bag of words representations) and output
spaces (in multi-label classification, examples are often labeled with only a
fraction of possible labels). In this paper, we propose oblique predictive
clustering trees, capable of addressing these limitations. We design and
implement two methods for learning oblique splits that contain linear
combinations of features in the tests, hence a split corresponds to an
arbitrary hyperplane in the input space. The methods are efficient for high
dimensional data and capable of exploiting sparse data. We experimentally
evaluate the proposed methods on 60 benchmark datasets for 6 predictive
modeling tasks. The results of the experiments show that oblique predictive
clustering trees achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art methods and
are orders of magnitude faster than standard PCTs. We also show that meaningful
feature importance scores can be extracted from the models learned with the
proposed methods.

viscoelastic moduli, etc., under certain ideal flow conditions. Nevertheless,
they fail in providing reliable data when characterising the response of
complex fluids at short time scales, due to artefacts induced by either
instrument or fluid inertia. This is crucial in the analysis of the rheological
properties of new formulations of shear thickening fluids specifically
developed for protective applications, in which the performance is extremely
linked to the time dependent structural changes provoked by the sudden impact
loads. Thus, the necessity of providing a reliable experimental tool able to

vertex expansion $\sim\frac{d}{2}$ and complemented this with construction of
near-Ramanujan graphs with vertex expansion no better than $\frac{d}{2}$.
However, the construction of Kahale encounters highly local obstructions to
better vertex expansion. In particular, the poorly expanding sets are
associated with short cycles in the graph. Thus, it is natural to ask whether
high-girth Ramanujan graphs have improved vertex expansion. Our results are
two-fold:
  1. For every $d = p+1$ for prime $p$ and infinitely many $n$, we exhibit an
$n$-vertex $d$-regular graph with girth $\Omega(\log_{d-1} n)$ and vertex
expansion of sublinear sized sets bounded by $\frac{d+1}{2}$ whose nontrivial
eigenvalues are bounded in magnitude by $2\sqrt{d-1}+O\left(\frac{1}{\log

  2. In any Ramanujan graph with girth $C\log n$, all sets of size bounded by
$n^{0.99C/4}$ have vertex expansion $(1-o_d(1))d$.
  The tools in analyzing our construction include the nonbacktracking operator
of an infinite graph, the Ihara--Bass formula, a trace moment method inspired
by Bordenave's proof of Friedman's theorem, and a method of Kahale to study

problems, but density estimation is notoriously difficult for high-dimensional
signals such as photographic images. Deep neural networks have provided
state-of-the-art solutions for problems such as denoising, which implicitly
rely on a prior probability model of natural images. Here, we develop a robust
and general methodology for making use of this implicit prior. We rely on a
statistical result due to Miyasawa (1961), who showed that the least-squares
solution for removing additive Gaussian noise can be written directly in terms
of the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density. We use this fact to
develop a stochastic coarse-to-fine gradient ascent procedure for drawing
high-probability samples from the implicit prior embedded within a CNN trained
to perform blind (i.e., with unknown noise level) least-squares denoising. A
generalization of this algorithm to constrained sampling provides a method for
using the implicit prior to solve any linear inverse problem, with no
additional training. We demonstrate this general form of transfer learning in
multiple applications, using the same algorithm to produce state-of-the-art
levels of unsupervised performance for deblurring, super-resolution,
inpainting, and compressive sensing.

evaporation. In this work, we observe and study the crystallization of sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) within an evaporating glycerol-water mixture droplet. The
crystallization is induced by the preferential evaporation of water, which
decreases the solubility of SDS in the mixture. As a consequence, the crystals
shield the droplet surface and cease the evaporation. The universality of the
evaporation characteristics for a range of droplet sizes is revealed by
applying a diffusion model, extended by Raoult's law. To describe the
nucleation and growth of the crystals, we employ the 2-dimensional
crystallization model of Weinberg [J. Non-Cryst. Solids 1991, 134, 116]. The
results of this model compare favorably to our experimental results. Our

critical strength $k = k_c$ above which resetting becomes disadvantageous. The
point of continuous transition may be exactly found even in cases where the
problem with resetting is not solvable, provided the first two moments of the
problem without resetting are known. We find the dimensionless critical
strength $\kappa_{c,n}(k_c)$ exactly when $d/n$ and $2/n$ take positive

\ln\big(\frac{R}{a}\big)$, we find the corresponding transition points
$\kappa_{c,\infty}$ and $\kappa_{c,l}$ exactly for any dimension $d$. The

therefore improves the power efficiency, as compared with the coherent
modulation. However, performance analysis results are not yet available for the
state-of-the-art detectors such as the maximum-likelihood detector (MLD) and
approximate MLD. Existing works rely on the Monte-Carlo simulation method to
show the existence of an optimal PS ratio that minimizes the overall SER. In
this work, we propose a near-optimal detector with linear complexity with
respect to the modulation size. We derive an approximate SER expression and
prove that the proposed detector achieves the full diversity order. Based on
our expression, the optimal PS ratio can be accurately estimated without
requiring any Monte-Carlo simulation. We also extend the proposed detector and
its SER analysis for adopting the time switching (TS) protocol at the relay.

mobile health interventions to individuals. A novel intervention framework that
emerges from such advancements is the just-in-time adaptive intervention
(JITAI), where it aims to suggest the right support to the individual ""just in

micro-randomized trial (MRT) design was proposed recently to test the proximal
effects of these JITAIs. In an MRT, participants are repeatedly randomized to
one of the intervention options of various in the intervention components, at a
scale of hundreds or thousands of decision time points over the course of the
study. However, the extant MRT framework only tests the proximal effect of
two-level intervention components (e.g. control vs intervention). In this
paper, we propose a novel version of MRT design with multiple levels per
intervention component, which we call ""multi-level micro-randomized trial""

multi-level intervention components, and the addition of more levels to the

novel test statistics for assessing the proximal effects and deriving the

high-rise buildings in Singapore, this paper examines a novel application of 3D
city models to identify suitable farming micro-locations in buildings. We
specifically investigate whether the vertical spaces of these buildings
comprising outdoor corridors, fa\c{c}ades and windows receive sufficient
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for growing food crops and do so at a
high resolution. We also analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of PAR,
and the impact of shadows and different weather conditions on PAR in the
building. Environmental simulations on the 3D model of the study area indicated
that the cumulative daily PAR or Daily Light Integral (DLI) at a location in
the building was dependent on its orientation and shape, sun's diurnal and
annual motion, weather conditions, and shadowing effects of the building's
fa\c{c}ades and surrounding buildings. The DLI in the study area generally
increased with building's levels and, depending on the particular
micro-location, was found suitable for growing moderately light-demanding crops
such as lettuce and sweet pepper. These variations in DLI at different
locations of the same building affirmed the need for such simulations. The
simulations were validated with field measurements of PAR, and correlation
coefficients between them exceeded 0.5 in most cases thus, making a case that
3D city models offer a promising practical solution to identifying suitable
farming locations in residential buildings, and have the potential for
urban-scale applications.

For the
log-concave distribution function, the method converges exponentially fast, up
to a controllable discretization error. However, the method requires the
evaluation of a full gradient in each iteration, and for a problem on
$\mathbb{R}^d$, this amounts to $d$ times partial derivative evaluations per
iteration. The cost is high when $d\gg1$. In this paper, we investigate how to
enhance computational efficiency through the application of RCD (random
coordinate descent) on LMC. There are two sides of the theory:
  1 By blindly applying RCD to LMC, one surrogates the full gradient by a
randomly selected directional derivative per iteration. Although the cost is
reduced per iteration, the total number of iteration is increased to achieve a
preset error tolerance. Ultimately there is no computational gain;
  2 We then incorporate variance reduction techniques, such as SAGA (stochastic
average gradient) and SVRG (stochastic variance reduced gradient), into
RCD-LMC. It will be proved that the cost is reduced compared with the classical
LMC, and in the underdamped case, convergence is achieved with the same number
of iterations, while each iteration requires merely one-directional derivative.
This means we obtain the best possible computational cost in the
underdamped-LMC framework.

method, the names of the digital quadruplets are first given, which are
descriptive, predictive, prescriptive and real vehicles. The objectives of the
three virtual digital vehicles are interacting, guiding, simulating and
improving with the real vehicles. Then, the three virtual components of the
digital quadruplets are introduced in detail and their applications are also
illustrated. Finally, the real vehicles in the parallel driving system and the
research process of the digital quadruplets are depicted. The presented digital
quadruplets in parallel driving are expected to make the future connected

explosives mixed with gaseous products of combustion, a well-developed
two-phase mixture model is the compressible Baer-Nunziato (BN) model,
containing solid and gas phases. If this model is numerically simulated by a
conservative Godunov-type scheme, spurious oscillations are likely to generate
from porosity interfaces, which may result from the average process of
conservative variables that violates the continuity of Riemann invariants
across porosity interfaces. In order to suppress the oscillations, this paper
proposes a staggered-projection Godunov-type scheme over a fixed gas-solid
staggered grid, by enforcing that solid contacts with porosity jumps are always
inside gaseous grid cells and other discontinuities appear at gaseous cell
interfaces. This scheme is based on a standard Godunov scheme for the
Baer-Nunziato model on gaseous cells and guarantees the continuity of the
Riemann invariants associated with the solid contact discontinuities across
porosity jumps. While porosity interfaces are moving, a projection process
fully takes into account the continuity of associated Riemann invariants and
ensure that porosity jumps remain inside gaseous cells. This
staggered-projection Godunov-type scheme is well-balanced with good numerical
performance not only on suppressing spurious oscillations near porosity
interfaces but also capturing strong discontinuities such as shocks.

model for the dynamics and potential control of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
The novelty in this work is two-fold. First, the population is divided
according to its compliance with disease control directives (lockdown,
shelter-in-place, masks/face coverings, physical distancing, etc.) into those
who fully comply and those who follow the directives partially, or are
necessarily mobile (such as medical staff). This split, indirectly, reflects on
the quality and consistency of these measures. This allows the assessment of
the overall effectiveness of the control measures and the impact of their
relaxing or tightening on the disease spread. Second, the adequate contact
rate, which directly affects the infection rate, is one of the model unknowns,
as it keeps track of the changes in the population behavior and the
effectiveness of various disease treatment modalities via a differential
inclusion. Existence, uniqueness and positivity results are proved using a
nonstandard convex analysis-based approach. As a case study, the pandemic
outbreak in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) is simulated. The model
parameters were found by minimizing the deviation of the model prediction from
the reported data over the first 100 days of the pandemic in South Korea.The
simulations show that the model captures accurately the pandemic dynamics in
the subsequent 75 days, which provides confidence in the model predictions and
its future use. In particular, the model predicts that about 40% of the
infections were not documented, which implies that asymptomatic infections
contribute silently but substantially to the spread of the disease indicating
that more widespread asymptomatic testing is necessary.

several different fields. There are several methods to estimate the parameters
of a linear regression model. These methods usually perform under normally
distributed and uncorrelated errors with zero mean and constant variance.
However, for some data sets error terms may not satisfy these or some of these
assumptions. If error terms are correlated, such as the regression models with
autoregressive (AR(p)) error terms, the Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML)
under normality assumption or the Least Square (LS) methods are often used to
estimate the parameters of interest. For CML estimation a distributional
assumption on error terms is needed to carry on estimation, but, in practice,
such distributional assumptions on error terms may not be plausible. Therefore,
in such cases some alternative distribution free methods are needed to conduct
the parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose to estimate the parameters
of a linear regression model with AR(p) error term using the Empirical
Likelihood (EL) method, which is one of the distribution free estimation
methods. A small simulation study and a numerical example are provided to
evaluate the performance of the proposed estimation method over the CML method.
The results of simulation study show that the proposed estimators based on EL
method are remarkably better than the estimators obtained from the CML method
in terms of mean squared errors (MSE) and bias in almost all the simulation
configurations. These findings are also confirmed by the results of the
numerical and real data examples.

  national (Danish) and European law perspective","43 pages, 3 figures, forthcoming in CLSR",,,,"cs.CY cs.CR cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last decade, surgical robots have risen in prominence and usage. For
surgical robots, connectivity is necessary to accept software updates, accept
instructions, and transfer sensory data, but it also exposes the robot to
cyberattacks, which can damage the patient or the surgeon. These injuries are
normally caused by safety failures, as seen in accidents with industrial
robots, but cyberattacks are caused by security failures instead. We create a
taxonomy for both types of failures in this paper specifically for surgical
robots. These robots are increasingly sold and used in the European Union (EU);
we therefore consider how surgical robots are viewed and treated by EU law.
Specifically, which rights regulators and manufacturers have, and which legal
remedies and actions a patient or manufacturer would have in a single national
legal system in the union, if injuries were to occur from a security failure
caused by an adversary that cannot be unambiguously identified. We find that
the selected national legal system can adequately deal with attacks on surgical
robots, because it can on one hand efficiently compensate the patient. This is
because of its flexibility; secondly, a remarkable absence of distinction
between safety vs security causes of failure and focusing instead on the
detrimental effects, thus benefiting the patient; and third, liability can be
removed from the manufacturer by withdrawing its status as party if the patient
chooses a separate public law measure to recover damages. Furthermore, we find
that current EU law does consider both security and safety aspects of surgical
robots, without it mentioning it through literal wording, but it also adds
substantial liabilities and responsibilities to the manufacturers of surgical
robots, gives the patient special rights and confers immense powers on the
regulators.

  migration modes via binary interactions","24 pages, 2 figures",,,,"q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Experimental results on the immune response to cancer indicate that
activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) through interactions with
dendritic cells (DCs) can trigger a change in CTL migration patterns. In
particular, while CTLs in the pre-activation state move in a non-local search
pattern, the search pattern of activated CTLs is more localised. In this paper,
we develop a kinetic model for such a switch in CTL migration modes. The model
is formulated as a coupled system of balance equations for the one-particle
distribution functions of CTLs in the pre-activation state, activated CTLs and
DCs. CTL activation is modelled via binary interactions between CTLs in the
pre-activation state and DCs. Moreover, cell motion is represented as a
velocity-jump process, with the running time of CTLs in the pre-activation
state following a long-tailed distribution, which is consistent with a L\'evy
walk, and the running time of activated CTLs following a Poisson distribution,
which corresponds to Brownian motion. We formally show that the macroscopic
limit of the model comprises a coupled system of balance equations for the cell
densities whereby activated CTL movement is described via a classical diffusion
term, whilst a fractional diffusion term describes the movement of CTLs in the
pre-activation state. The modelling approach presented here and its possible
generalisations are expected to find applications in the study of the immune
response to cancer and in other biological contexts in which switch from
non-local to localised migration patterns occurs.
