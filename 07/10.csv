that limits one's ability to learn a function with a training data set. With
the recent rise of quantum machine learning, it is natural to ask whether there
is a quantum analog of the NFL theorem, which would restrict a quantum
computer's ability to learn a unitary process (the quantum analog of a
function) with quantum training data. However, in the quantum setting, the
training data can possess entanglement, a strong correlation with no classical
analog. In this work, we show that entangled data sets lead to an apparent
violation of the (classical) NFL theorem. This motivates a reformulation that
accounts for the degree of entanglement in the training set. As our main
result, we prove a quantum NFL theorem whereby the fundamental limit on the
learnability of a unitary is reduced by entanglement. We employ Rigetti's
quantum computer to test both the classical and quantum NFL theorems. Our work
establishes that entanglement is a commodity in quantum machine learning.

RGB-D SOD. Specifically, three RGB-depth interaction modules, named CMW-L,
CMW-M and CMW-H, are developed to deal with respectively low-, middle- and
high-level cross-modal information fusion. These modules use Depth-to-RGB
Weighing (DW) and RGB-to-RGB Weighting (RW) to allow rich cross-modal and
cross-scale interactions among feature layers generated by different network
blocks. To effectively train the proposed Cross-Modal Weighting Network
(CMWNet), we design a composite loss function that summarizes the errors
between intermediate predictions and ground truth over different scales. With
all these novel components working together, CMWNet effectively fuses
information from RGB and depth channels, and meanwhile explores object
localization and details across scales. Thorough evaluations demonstrate CMWNet
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods on seven popular
benchmarks.

annealing is effective at maintaining thermal noise of silicon APDs within a
range suitable for quantum key distribution throughout the nominal mission

time, and annealing only when the thermal noise exceeds a pre-defined limit. We
find both strategies exhibit similar thermal noise at end-of-life, with a
slight overall advantage to annealing conditionally. We also observe that
afterpulsing probability of the detector increases with cumulative proton
irradiation. This knowledge helps guide design and tasking decisions for future
space-borne quantum communication applications.

learning. Previous methods rely on dropout layers which are not present in
modern deep architectures or batch normalization which is sensitive to batch
sizes. In this work, we address the problem of uncertainty quantification in
deep residual networks by using a regularization technique called stochastic
depth. We show that training residual networks using stochastic depth can be
interpreted as a variational approximation to the intractable posterior over
the weights in Bayesian neural networks. We demonstrate that by sampling from a
distribution of residual networks with varying depth and shared weights,
meaningful uncertainty estimates can be obtained. Moreover, compared to the
original formulation of residual networks, our method produces well-calibrated
softmax probabilities with only minor changes to the network's structure. We
evaluate our approach on popular computer vision datasets and measure the
quality of uncertainty estimates. We also test the robustness to domain shift
and show that our method is able to express higher predictive uncertainty on
out-of-distribution samples. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach
could be used to obtain uncertainty estimates in facial verification

coupled explicitly to the well-known Holst extension of the Riemann-Cartan

focus on a geometric unification of the cosmological dark sector, and show that
a super-accelerating regime in the course of evolution of the universe is
always feasible. From the observational perspective, assuming the cosmological
evolution profile to be very close to that for $\L$CDM, we further show that
there could be a smooth crossing of the so-called phantom barrier at a low

as low as $D1 < 1$ in the cocoon and up to $D1 > 800$ in the supercluster.
Recently quenched galaxies lie in the cocoon mainly in one region and their

full analysis, we consider the entire region of the liquid electrolyte and use
the ultraspherical spectral method to numerically solve the eigenvalue
problems. Both studies show that the imposed flow significantly affects the
electroconvective instability. The imposed flow generates a shielding effect by
deforming the perturbed ion concentration field and hinders the ion transfer
from low- to high- concentration regions which causes the instability. It fully
suppresses the electroconvective instability at small wavenumbers and reduces
the growth rate of the perturbations at large wavenumbers. The direct effect of
the flow on the morphological instability is minor, while the suppression of
the electroconvective instability may change the wavenumber of the most
unstable mode of the coupled instabilities. For the electroconvective

magnetic fields via tracing of the polarized emission from dust grains that are
partially aligned with the direction of the field. The advent of high quality
polarimetric data has permitted the use of statistical methods to extract both
the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field. In this work, the
Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique is used to make maps of the plane-of-sky
(POS) component of the magnetic field in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC-1) by
combining polarization maps at 53, 89, 154 and 214 \micron\ from HAWC+/SOFIA
with maps of density and velocity dispersion. In addition, maps of the local
dispersion of polarization angles are used in conjuction with Zeeman
measurements to estimate a map of the strength of the line-of-sight (LOS)
component of the field. Combining these maps, information about the
three-dimensional magnetic field configuration (integrated along the
line-of-sight) is inferred over the OMC-1 region. POS magnetic field strengths
of up to 2 mG are observed near the BN/KL object, while the OMC-1 bar shows
strengths of up to a few hundred $\mu$G. These estimates of the magnetic field
components are used to produce maps of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio
($M/\Phi$) -- a metric for probing the conditions for star formation in
molecular clouds -- and determine regions of sub- and super-criticality in
OMC-1. Such maps can provide invaluable input and comparison to MHD simulations
of star formation processes in filamentary structures of molecular clouds.

tissue. Image-assistance in safety-critical vision applications requires a
dense tracking of tissue motion. This can be done using optical flow (OF).
Accurate motion predictions at high processing rates lead to higher patient
safety. Current deep learning OF models show the common speed vs. accuracy
trade-off. To achieve high accuracy at high processing rates, we propose
patient-specific fine-tuning of a fast model. This minimizes the domain gap
between training and application data, while reducing the target domain to the
capability of the lower complex, fast model. We propose to obtain training
sequences pre-operatively in the operation room. We handle missing ground
truth, by employing teacher-student learning. Using flow estimations from
teacher model FlowNet2 we specialize a fast student model FlowNet2S on the
patient-specific domain. Evaluation is performed on sequences from the Hamlyn
dataset. Our student model shows very good performance after fine-tuning.
Tracking accuracy is comparable to the teacher model at a speed up of factor
six. Fine-tuning can be performed within minutes, making it feasible for the
operation room. Our method allows to use a real-time capable model that was
previously not suited for this task. This method is laying the path for
improved patient-specific motion estimation in CAS.

practice, edges are used both to represent intrinsic structure (e.g., abstract

downstream task (e.g., results of relevant program analyses). In this work, we
study the problem of learning to derive abstract relations from the intrinsic

relations defined by paths on the base graph accepted by a finite-state

then training these policies using implicit differentiation. The result is a
differentiable Graph Finite-State Automaton (GFSA) layer that adds a new edge
type (expressed as a weighted adjacency matrix) to a base graph. We demonstrate
that this layer can find shortcuts in grid-world graphs and reproduce simple
static analyses on Python programs. Additionally, we combine the GFSA layer
with a larger graph-based model trained end-to-end on the variable misuse
program understanding task, and find that using the GFSA layer leads to better
performance than using hand-engineered semantic edges or other baseline methods

guessing 3 appropriate elements of an optimal solution, and then executing a
greedy algorithm, one can obtain the optimal approximation ratio of $\alpha
=1-1/e\approx 0.632$ for BSM. However, the need to guess (by enumeration) 3
elements makes the algorithm of Sviridenko impractical as it leads to a time
complexity of $O(n^5)$ (which can be slightly improved using the thresholding
technique of Badanidiyuru & Vondrak (2014), but only to roughly $O(n^4)$). Our
main results in this paper show that fewer guesses suffice. Specifically, by
making only 2 guesses, we get the same optimal approximation ratio of $\alpha$
with an improved time complexity of roughly $O(n^3)$. Furthermore, by making
only a single guess, we get an almost as good approximation ratio of
$0.6174>0.9767\alpha$ in roughly $O(n^2)$ time.
  Prior to our work, the only algorithms that were known to obtain an
approximation ratio close to $\alpha$ for BSM were the algorithm of Sviridenko

$(\alpha-\epsilon)$-approximation. However, the algorithm of Ene & Nguyen
requires ${(1/\epsilon)}^{O(1/\epsilon^4)}n\log^2 n$ time, and hence, is of
theoretical interest only as ${(1/\epsilon)}^{O(1/\epsilon^4)}$ is huge even
for moderate values of $\epsilon$. In contrast, all the algorithms we analyze
are simple and parallelizable, which makes them good candidates for practical
use.
  Recently, Tang et al. (2020) studied a simple greedy algorithm that already
has a long research history, and proved that its approximation ratio is at

(Ti$_2$C, Ti$_2$N, Nb$_2$C, Mo$_2$TiC$_2$, and Ti$_3$CN) approximately from
defect formation energies. We evaluated sputtering cross section and sputtering
rates, and based on those the evolution of the surface composition. We find
that at the exit surface and for ""low"" TEM energies H and F sputter at equal
rates, but at ""high"" TEM energies the F is sputtered most strongly. In the
enter surface, H sputtering dominates. The results were found to be largely
similar for all studied MXenes, and although the displacement thresholds varied
between the different metal atoms the thresholds were always too high to lead
to significant sputtering of the metal atoms. We simulated electron microscope
images at the successive stages of sputtering, and found that while it is
likely difficult to identify surface groups based on the spot intensities, the
local contraction of lattice around O groups should be observable. We also
studied MXenes encapsulated with graphene and found them to provide efficient
protection from the knock-on damage for all surface group atoms except H.

lightweight embedded hardware, work in very challenging situations (e.g.
handling occlusions) and preferably work real-time. We solve this challenge by
implementing a real-time TensorRT optimized YOLOv3-based pedestrian detector,
on a Jetson TX2 hardware platform. By combining the detector with a sparse
optical flow tracker we assign a unique ID to each customer and tackle the
problem of loosing partially occluded customers. Our detector-tracker based

First, we show the evolution of the
vortex filament equation (VFE) for a regular planar polygon in the hyperbolic
space. Unlike in the Euclidean space, the planar polygon is open and both of
its ends grow exponentially, which makes the problem more challenging from a
numerical point of view. However, with fixed boundary conditions, a finite
difference scheme and a fourth-order Runge--Kutta method in time, we show that
the numerical solution is in complete agreement with the one obtained from
algebraic techniques. Second, as in the Euclidean case, we claim that, at
infinitesimal times, the evolution of VFE for a planar polygon as the initial
datum can be described as a superposition of several one-corner initial data.
As a consequence, not only can we compute the speed of the center of mass of
the planar polygon, but the relationship also allows us to compare the time
evolution of any of its corners with that in the Euclidean case.

angular power spectrum by $\sim 30\%$ at low $\ell$ when comparing two
different speeds of sound for dark energy. Weak gravitational lensing, Shapiro

arXiv:1912.07089 [hep-th] we proposed that the global doubled space is not a
manifold, but the total space of a bundle gerbe. This would mean that DFT is a
field theory on a bundle gerbe, in analogy with ordinary Kaluza-Klein Theory
being a field theory on a principal bundle. In this paper we make the original
construction by arXiv:1912.07089 [hep-th] significantly more immediate. This is
achieved by introducing an atlas for the bundle gerbe. This atlas is naturally
equipped with $2d$-dimensional local charts, where $d$ is the dimension of
physical spacetime. We argue that the local charts of this atlas should be
identified with the usual coordinate description of DFT. In the last part we
will discuss aspects of the global geometry of tensor hierarchies in this
bundle gerbe picture. This allows to identify their global non-geometric
properties and explain how the picture of non-abelian String-bundles emerges.
We interpret the abelian T-fold and the Poisson-Lie T-fold as global tensor
hierarchies.

by the properties of small regions of the Fermi surface called `hot spots'

an antiferromagnetic critical point, and magnetoresistance measurements provide
a route to quantify this link.

DM must be created, for example, in a previous annihilation or decay of a
heavier component of DM. Remarkably, boosted DM annihilating into gamma-rays at
a specific point in a galaxy could actually have traveled from its source at

aspect of this model is that the signal from dwarf galaxies relative to the

  Texture Learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pulmonary emphysema overlaps considerably with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), and is traditionally subcategorized into three subtypes
previously identified on autopsy. Unsupervised learning of emphysema subtypes
on computed tomography (CT) opens the way to new definitions of emphysema
subtypes and eliminates the need of thorough manual labeling. However, CT-based
emphysema subtypes have been limited to texture-based patterns without
considering spatial location. In this work, we introduce a standardized spatial
mapping of the lung for quantitative study of lung texture location, and
propose a novel framework for combining spatial and texture information to
discover spatially-informed lung texture patterns (sLTPs) that represent novel
emphysema subtypes. Exploiting two cohorts of full-lung CT scans from the MESA
COPD and EMCAP studies, we first show that our spatial mapping enables
population-wide study of emphysema spatial location. We then evaluate the
characteristics of the sLTPs discovered on MESA COPD, and show that they are
reproducible, able to encode standard emphysema subtypes, and associated with
physiological symptoms.

and stellar mass ($M_\bigstar$) or star formation rate (SFR) is an
oversimplification of BH-galaxy co-evolution, and that morphological and
structural properties of host galaxies must also be considered. Particularly, a
possible connection between BH growth and host-galaxy compactness was
identified among star-forming (SF) galaxies. Utilizing $\approx 6300$ massive
galaxies with $I_{\rm 814W}~<~24$ at $z$ $<$ 1.2 in the COSMOS field, we
perform systematic partial-correlation analyses to investigate how
sample-averaged BH accretion rate ($\rm \overline{BHAR}$) depends on
host-galaxy compactness among SF galaxies, when controlling for morphology and
$M_\bigstar$ (or SFR). The projected central surface-mass density within 1 kpc,
$\Sigma_{1}$, is utilized to represent host-galaxy compactness in our study. We
find that the $\rm \overline{BHAR}$-$\Sigma_{1}$ relation is stronger than
either the $\rm \overline{BHAR}$-$M_\bigstar$ or $\rm \overline{BHAR}$-SFR
relation among SF galaxies, and this $\rm \overline{BHAR}$-$\Sigma_{1}$
relation applies to both bulge-dominated galaxies and galaxies that are not
dominated by bulges. This $\rm \overline{BHAR}$-$\Sigma_{1}$ relation among SF
galaxies suggests a link between BH growth and the central gas density of host
galaxies on the kpc scale, which may further imply a common origin of the gas
in the vicinity of the BH and in the central $\sim$ kpc of the galaxy. This
$\rm \overline{BHAR}$-$\Sigma_{1}$ relation can also be interpreted as the
relation between BH growth and the central velocity dispersion of host galaxies
at a given gas content, indicating the role of the host-galaxy potential well
in regulating accretion onto the BH.

galaxy properties (stellar masses, star formation rates, and UV luminosities),
galaxy-halo relationships, and galaxy-galaxy clustering. Mock observables are
also provided for different model parameters spanning observational
uncertainties at $z<10$. We predict that Cycle 1 JWST surveys will very likely
detect galaxies with $M_*>10^7 M_\odot$ and/or $M_{1500}<-17$ out to at least
$z\sim 13.5$. Number density uncertainties at $z>12$ expand dramatically, so
efforts to detect $z>12$ galaxies will provide the most valuable constraints on
galaxy formation models. The faint-end slopes of the stellar mass/luminosity
functions at a given mass/luminosity threshold steepen as redshift increases.
This is because observable galaxies are hosted by haloes in the exponentially
falling regime of the halo mass function at high redshifts. Hence, these
faint-end slopes are robustly predicted to become shallower below current
observable limits ($M_\ast < 10^7M_\odot$ or $M_\mathrm{1500}>-17$). For
reionization models, extrapolating luminosity functions with a constant
faint-end slope from $M_{1500}=-17$ down to $M_{1500}=-12$ gives the most
reasonable upper limit for the total UV luminosity and cosmic star formation
rate up to $z\sim 12$. We compare to three other empirical models and one
semi-analytic model, showing that the range of predicted observables from our
approach encompasses predictions from other techniques. Public catalogues and

  Methods: We use several colour-colour diagrams with empirical photospheric
sequences to detect the sources with an infrared excess. Independently, we also

the Virtual Observatory SED analyser (VOSA) which is capable of automatically
detecting infrared excesses and provides effective temperature estimates.
  Results: We find six candidates debris disc host-stars (five with MIPS and
one with WISE) and two of them are new candidates. We estimate a disc fraction
of 24$\pm$10\% for the B-A stars, where our sample is expected to be complete.
This is similar to what has been reported in other clusters of similar ages

neutrino mass scale. Within the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM), the
Planck collaboration reports $\sum m_\nu < 0.12\,\text{eV}$ at 95% CL. This
bound, taken at face value, excludes many neutrino mass models. However,
unstable neutrinos, with lifetimes shorter than the age of the universe
$\tau_\nu \lesssim t_U$, represent a particle physics avenue to relax this
constraint. Motivated by this fact, we present a taxonomy of neutrino decay
modes, categorizing them in terms of particle content and final decay products.
Taking into account the relevant phenomenological bounds, our analysis shows
that 2-body decaying neutrinos into BSM particles are a promising option to
relax cosmological neutrino mass bounds. We then build a simple extension of
the type I seesaw scenario by adding one sterile state $\nu_4$ and a Goldstone
boson $\phi$, in which $\nu_i \to \nu_4 \, \phi$ decays can loosen the neutrino
mass bounds up to $\sum m_\nu \sim 1\,\text{eV}$, without spoiling the light
neutrino mass generation mechanism. Remarkably, this is possible for a large
range of the right-handed neutrino masses, from the electroweak up to the GUT
scale. We successfully implement this idea in the context of minimal neutrino
mass models based on a $U(1)_{\mu-\tau}$ flavor symmetry, which are otherwise
in tension with the current bound on $\sum m_\nu$.

(Sigma_SFR-Sigma_M) relation gives important insights on how galaxies assemble
at different spatial scales. Here we present the analysis of the
Sigma_SFR-Sigma_M of 40 local cluster galaxies undergoing ram pressure
stripping drawn from the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies (GASP) sample.
Considering their integrated properties, these galaxies show a SFR enhancement
with respect to undisturbed galaxies of similar stellar mass; we now exploit
spatially resolved data to investigate the origin and location of the excess.
Even on ~1kpc scales, stripping galaxies present a systematic enhancement of
Sigma_SFR (~0.35 dex at Sigma_M =108^M_sun/kpc^2) at any given Sigma_M compared
to their undisturbed counterparts. The excess is independent on the degree of
stripping and of the amount of star formation in the tails and it is visible at
all galactocentric distances within the disks, suggesting that the star
formation is most likely induced by compression waves from ram pressure. Such
excess is larger for less massive galaxies and decreases with increasing mass.
As stripping galaxies are characterised by ionised gas beyond the stellar disk,
we also investigate the properties of 411 star forming clumps found in the
galaxy tails. At any given stellar mass density, these clumps are
systematically forming stars at a higher rate than in the disk, but differences
are reconciled when we just consider the mass formed in the last few 10^8yr
ago, suggesting that on these timescales the local mode of star formation is
similar in the tails and in the disks.

with the merger. A gamma-ray burst seen along its jet's axis is disfavoured by
the multi-wavelength dataset, whereas the presence of a burst seen at larger

improved in recent years owing to large efforts in multi-wavelength
observations and hydrodynamical simulations. However, it is much less clear how
feedback operates in galaxy groups, which have shallower gravitational
potentials. In this work, using very deep VLA and new MeerKAT observations from
the MIGHTEE survey, we compiled a sample of 247 X-ray selected galaxy groups
detected in the COSMOS field. We have studied the relation between the X-ray
emission of the intra-group medium and the 1.4 GHz radio emission of the
central radio galaxy. For comparison, we have also built a control sample of
142 galaxy clusters using ROSAT and NVSS data. We find that clusters and groups
follow the same correlation between X-ray and radio emission. Large radio
galaxies hosted in the centres of groups and merging clusters increase the
scatter of the distribution. Using statistical tests and Monte-Carlo
simulations, we show that the correlation is not dominated by biases or
selection effects. We also find that galaxy groups are more likely than
clusters to host large radio galaxies, perhaps owing to the lower ambient gas
density or a more efficient accretion mode. In these groups, radiative cooling
of the ICM could be less suppressed by AGN heating. We conclude that the
feedback processes that operate in galaxy clusters are also effective in
groups.

SASI) when it emerges for non-exploding models. In addition, we determine that
there can be a large angular asymmetry in the event rate ($\gtrsim 50 \%$), but
that the time-integrated signal has a relatively modest asymmetry ($\lesssim 20
\%$). Both features are associated with the lepton-number emission
self-sustained asymmetry (LESA) and the spiral SASI. Moreover, our analysis
suggests that there is an interesting correlation between the total neutrino
energy (TONE) and the cumulative number of neutrino events in each detector, a
correlation that can facilitate data analyses of real observations. We
demonstrate the retrieval of neutrino energy spectra for all flavors of

multiple detectors. We find that this new method is capable of estimating the
TONE within the error of $\sim$20\% if the distance to the CCSN is $\lesssim 6$

based on graph neural networks, but they often perform poorly unless a sizeable

cognizant logistic regression, equivalent to a linearized graph convolutional

reduction in the query phase. To reduce the delay experienced by a labeller
interacting with the system, we derive a preemptive querying system that
calculates a new query during the labelling process, and to address the setting

algorithm that performs adaptive model averaging of label propagation and
linearized GCN inference. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark

investigations on the role of the superposition of trajectories in enhancing
communication, which revealed that the use of quantum control of parallel
communication channels, or of channels in series with quantum-controlled

findings, here we experimentally and numerically compare different ways in
which two trajectories through a pair of noisy channels can be superposed. We
observe that, within the framework of quantum interferometry, the use of

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The classification of Antibody Mediated Rejection (AMR) in kidney transplant
remains challenging even for experienced nephropathologists; this is partly
because histological tissue stain analysis is often characterized by low
inter-observer agreement and poor reproducibility. One of the implicated causes
for inter-observer disagreement is the variability of tissue stain quality
between (and within) pathology labs, coupled with the gradual fading of
archival sections. Variations in stain colors and intensities can make tissue
evaluation difficult for pathologists, ultimately affecting their ability to
describe relevant morphological features. Being able to accurately predict the
AMR status based on kidney histology images is crucial for improving patient
treatment and care. We propose a novel pipeline to build robust deep neural
networks for AMR classification based on StyPath, a histological data
augmentation technique that leverages a light weight style-transfer algorithm
as a means to reduce sample-specific bias. Each image was generated in 1.84 +-
0.03 seconds using a single GTX TITAN V gpu and pytorch, making it faster than
other popular histological data augmentation techniques. We evaluated our model
using a Monte Carlo (MC) estimate of Bayesian performance and generate an
epistemic measure of uncertainty to compare both the baseline and StyPath
augmented models. We also generated Grad-CAM representations of the results
which were assessed by an experienced nephropathologist; we used this
qualitative analysis to elucidate on the assumptions being made by each model.
Our results imply that our style-transfer augmentation technique improves
histological classification performance (reducing error from 14.8% to 11.5%)

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (or DNNs) must constantly cope with distribution changes
in the input data when the task of interest or the data collection protocol
changes. Retraining a network from scratch to combat this issue poses a
significant cost. Meta-learning aims to deliver an adaptive model that is
sensitive to these underlying distribution changes, but requires many tasks
during the meta-training process. In this paper, we propose a tAsk-auGmented
actIve meta-LEarning (AGILE) method to efficiently adapt DNNs to new tasks by
using a small number of training examples. AGILE combines a meta-learning
algorithm with a novel task augmentation technique which we use to generate an
initial adaptive model. It then uses Bayesian dropout uncertainty estimates to
actively select the most difficult samples when updating the model to a new
task. This allows AGILE to learn with fewer tasks and a few informative
samples, achieving high performance with a limited dataset. We perform our
experiments using the brain cell classification task and compare the results to
a plain meta-learning model trained from scratch. We show that the proposed
task-augmented meta-learning framework can learn to classify new cell types
after a single gradient step with a limited number of training samples. We show
that active learning with Bayesian uncertainty can further improve the
performance when the number of training samples is extremely small. Using only
1% of the training data and a single update step, we achieved 90% accuracy on
the new cell type classification task, a 50% points improvement over a
state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithm.

the complexity and multiscale nature of events of interest. Highly non-uniform
sampling of measurements from different sensors with different levels of
accuracy, as is typical for measurements of ice sheet elevations, makes the
problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a spline-based
approximation framework (ALPS - Approximation by Localized Penalized Splines)
for modeling time series of land ice changes. The localized support of the
B-spline basis functions enable robustness to non-uniform sampling, a
considerable improvement over other global and piecewise local models. With
features like, discrete-coordinate-difference-based penalization and two-level
outlier detection, ALPS further guarantees the stability and quality of
approximations. ALPS incorporates rigorous model uncertainty estimates with all
approximations. As demonstrated by examples, ALPS performs well for a variety
of data sets, including time series of ice sheet thickness, elevation,
velocity, and terminus locations. The robust estimation of time series and
their derivatives facilitates new applications, such as the reconstruction of
high-resolution elevation change records by fusing sparsely sampled time series
of ice sheet thickness changes with modeled firn thickness changes, and the
analysis of the relationship between different outlet glacier observations to
gain new insight into processes and forcing.

galaxy cluster about 2-3 Gyr ago. Considering this special condition, these
nine dEs may provide a test bed for distinguishing between the influence of the
Virgo galaxy cluster and the effects of the previous host halo on their current
properties. Specifically, we use VLT/MUSE integral-field unit spectra to derive
their kinematics and specific angular momentum ($\lambda_{R}$) profiles. We
observe a spread in the $\lambda_{R}$ profiles of our sample dEs, finding that
the $\lambda_{R}$ profiles of half of them are as high as those of low-mass
field galaxies. The remaining dEs exhibit $\lambda_{R}$ profiles as low as
those of Virgo dEs that were likely accreted longer ago. Moreover, we detect
nebular emission in one dE with a gas velocity offset suggesting ongoing gas
stripping in Virgo. We suggest that the low-$\lambda_{R}$ dEs in our sample

CMZoom is the first blind, high-resolution survey of the Central Molecular Zone
(CMZ; the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way) at wavelengths sensitive to the
pre-cursors of high-mass stars. CMZoom is a 500-hour Large Program on the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) that mapped at 1.3 mm all of the gas and dust in the
CMZ above a molecular hydrogen column density of 10^23 cm^-2 at a resolution of
~3"" (0.1 pc). In this paper, we focus on the 1.3 mm dust continuum and its data
release, but also describe CMZoom spectral line data which will be released in
a forthcoming publication. While CMZoom detected many regions with rich and
complex substructure, its key result is an overall deficit in compact
substructures on 0.1 - 2 pc scales (the compact dense gas fraction: CDGF). In
comparison with clouds in the Galactic disk, the CDGF in the CMZ is
substantially lower, despite having much higher average column densities. CMZ
clouds with high CDGFs are well-known sites of active star formation. The
inability of most gas in the CMZ to form compact substructures is likely
responsible for the dearth of star formation in the CMZ, surprising considering
its high density. The factors responsible for the low CDGF are not yet
understood but are plausibly due to the extreme environment of the CMZ, having
far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the star formation process
across the cosmos.

virtual photons, as described by the Jaynes-Cummings model. Here we present a
theory bridging these two limits and illustrate, with several examples, its
necessity for a general description of quantum circuits readout.

photonic devices on-a-chip, thanks to its superior nonlinear optical
properties. We propose a new AlGaAs waveguide geometry, called half-core
etched, which represents a compromise between two previously studied
geometries, namely the nanowire and strip-loaded waveguides, combining their
best qualities. We performed tunable four-wave mixing (FWM) experiments in all
three of these geometries in the telecommunications C-band (wavelengths around
1550 nm), with a pulsed pump beam and a continuous-wave (CW) signal beam. The
maximum FWM peak efficiencies achieved in the nanowire, strip-loaded and
half-core geometries were about -5 dB, -8 dB and -9 dB, respectively. These
values are among the highest reported in AlGaAs waveguides. The signal-to-idler
conversion ranges were also remarkable: 161 nm for the strip-loaded and
half-core waveguides and 152 nm for the nanowire. Based on our findings, we
conclude that the half-core geometry is an alternative approach to the nanowire
geometry, which has been earlier deemed the most efficient geometry, to perform
wavelength conversion in the spectral region above the half-bandgap. Moreover,
we show that the half-core geometry exhibits fewer issues associated with
multiphoton absorption than the nanowire geometry.

use molecular dynamics to understand TC changes in monolayer (1L) and bilayer

of monolayer MoS$_2$ is reduced from ~117 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ when suspended, to
~31 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ when supported by SiO$_2$, at 300 K. Encasing 1L MoS$_2$
in SiO$_2$ further reduces its TC down to ~22 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. In contrast,
the TC of 2L MoS$_2$ is not as drastically reduced, being >50% higher than 1L
both when supported and encased. These effects are due to phonon scattering
with remote vibrational modes of the substrate, which are partly screened in 2L
MoS$_2$. We also examine the TC of 1L MoS$_2$ across a wide range of
temperatures (300 to 700 K) and defect densities (up to 5$\times$10$^{13}$

authoring, a textual representation offers a representation for understanding

approximating real-time quantum correlation functions in condensed-phase
nonadiabatic systems, called spin-PLDM. Within a classical trajectory picture,
partially linearized methods treat the electronic dynamics along forward and
backward paths separately by explicitly evolving two sets of mapping variables.
Unlike previously derived partially linearized methods based on the
Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss mapping, spin-PLDM uses the Stratonovich-Weyl
transform to describe the electronic dynamics for each path within the
spin-mapping space; this automatically restricts the Cartesian mapping
variables to lie on a hypersphere and means that the classical equations of
motion can no longer propagate the mapping variables out of the physical
subspace. The presence of a rigorously derived zero-point energy parameter also
distinguishes spin-PLDM from other partially linearized approaches. These new
features appear to give the method superior accuracy for computing dynamical
observables of interest, when compared with other methods within the same
class. The superior accuracy of spin-PLDM is demonstrated within this paper
through application of the method to a wide range of spin-boson models, as well
as to the Fenna-Matthews-Olsen complex.

J.~Chem.~Phys.~xxx, xxxxx (xxxx)] we derived a new partially linearized
mapping-based classical-trajectory technique, called spin-PLDM. This method
describes the dynamics associated with the forward and backward electronic path
integrals, using a Stratonovich-Weyl approach within the spin-mapping space.
While this is the first example of a partially linearized spin mapping method,
fully linearized spin mapping is already known to be capable of reproducing
dynamical observables for a range of nonadiabatic model systems reasonably
accurately. Here we present a thorough comparison of the terms in the
underlying expressions for the real-time quantum correlation functions for
spin-PLDM and fully linearized spin mapping in order to ascertain the relative
accuracy of the two methods. In particular, we show that spin-PLDM contains an
additional term within the definition of its real-time correlation function,
which diminishes many of the known errors that are ubiquitous for fully
linearized approaches. One advantage of partially linearized methods over their
fully linearized counterparts is that the results can be systematically
improved by re-sampling the mapping variables at intermediate times. We derive
such a scheme for spin-PLDM and show that for systems for which the
approximation of classical nuclei is valid, numerically exact results can be
obtained using only a few `jumps'. Additionally, we implement focused initial
conditions for the spin-PLDM method, which reduces the number of classical
trajectories that are needed in order to reach convergence of dynamical
quantities, with seemingly little difference to the accuracy of the result.

definition of the conditional R\'enyi entropy is the most natural one among the
multiple forms which exist in the literature, since it satisfies two desirable
properties of a conditional entropy, namely, the fact that conditioning reduces
entropy, and that the associated reduction in uncertainty cannot exceed the
information gained by conditioning. Furthermore, it has found interesting
applications in various information theoretic tasks such as guessing with side
information and sequential decoding. This conditional entropy reduces to the
conditional Shannon entropy in the limit $\alpha \to 1$, and this in turn
allows us to recover the recently obtained tight uniform continuity bound for
the latter from our result. Finally, we apply our result to obtain a tight
uniform continuity bound for the conditional $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy of a

Recently there have been active discussions on enhanced communication

through an arbitrary process cannot outperform a causally separable process,
i.e., we can send at most one bit per qubit. Next, we study bi-directional

taken full advantage of promising opportunities inherent to this data, the
potential to forecast psychological processes at the individual level. To
address this gap in the literature we present a novel modeling framework that
addresses a number of topical challenges and open questions in the
psychological literature on modeling dynamic processes. First, how can we model
and forecast ILD when the length of individual time series and the number of
variables collected are roughly equivalent, or when time series lengths are
shorter than what is typically required for time series analyses? Second, how
can we best take advantage of the cross-sectional (between-person) information
inherent to most ILD scenarios while acknowledging individuals differ both
quantitatively (e.g. in parameter magnitude) and qualitatively (e.g. in
structural dynamics)? Despite the acknowledged between-person heterogeneity in
many psychological processes is it possible to leverage group-level information
to support improved forecasting at the individual level? In the remainder of
the manuscript, we attempt to address these and other pressing questions
relevant to the forecasting of multiple-subject ILD.

state is usually described by its variance, when the state is mixed, the
variance is a hybrid of quantum and classical uncertainties. Besides that,
complementarity relations are saturated only for pure, single-quanton, quantum
states. For mixed states, the wave-particle quantifiers never saturate the
complementarity relation and can even reach zero for a maximally mixed state.
So, to fully characterize a quanton it is not sufficient to consider its
wave-particle aspect; one has also to regard its correlations with other
systems. In this paper, we discuss the relation between quantum correlations
and local classical uncertainty measures, as well as the relation between
quantum coherence and quantum uncertainty quantifiers. We obtain a complete
complementarity relation for quantum uncertainty, classical uncertainty, and
predictability. The total quantum uncertainty of a d-paths interferometer is
shown to be equivalent to the Wigner-Yanase coherence and the corresponding
classical uncertainty is shown to be a quantum correlation quantifier. The
duality between complementarity and uncertainty is used to derive quantum
correlations measures that complete the complementarity relations for
$l_1$-norm and $l_2$-norm coherences. Besides, we show that Brukner-Zeilinger's
invariant information quantifies both the wave and particle characters of a
quanton and we obtain a sum uncertainty relation for the generalized Gell
Mann's matrices.

Here, we complement the previous studies by computing the entropy of the

a suppression in the composite ordered phase. The doping dependent phase

automatically inferring two key components of infection risk: the proximity to
an individual who may be infected, and the duration of proximity. The former
component, proximity, relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal
Strength Indicator(RSSI) as a distance sensor, and this has been shown to be
problematic; not least because of unpredictable variations caused by different
device types, device location on-body, device orientation, the local
environment and the general noise associated with radio frequency propagation.
In this paper, we present an approach that infers posterior probabilities over
distance given sequences of RSSI values. Using a single-dimensional Unscented
Kalman Smoother (UKS) for non-linear state space modelling, we outline several
Gaussian process observation transforms, including: a generative model that
directly captures sources of variation; and a discriminative model that learns
a suitable observation function from training data using both distance and

risk prediction can be achieved in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time on real-world data

Prior work resolves this ambiguity by using various inductive biases, such as a
preference for simpler programs. This work introduces a new inductive bias
derived by modeling the program synthesis task as rational communication,
drawing insights from recursive reasoning models of pragmatics. Given a
specification, we score a candidate program both on its consistency with the
specification, and also whether a rational speaker would chose this particular
specification to communicate that program. We develop efficient algorithms for
such an approach when learning from input-output examples, and build a
pragmatic program synthesizer over a simple grid-like layout domain. A user
study finds that end-user participants communicate more effectively with the
pragmatic program synthesizer over a non-pragmatic one.

mechanical configuration, and they are therefore difficult to accurately
resolve using uncoupled methods. In recent years, significant research has
focused on discretization strategies for these coupled systems, particularly in
the presence of complicated fracture network geometries. In this work, we
explore a finite-volume discretization for the multiphase flow equations
coupled with a finite-element scheme for the mechanical equations. Fractures
are treated as lower dimensional surfaces embedded in a background grid.
Interactions are captured using the Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) and
the Embedded Finite Element Method (EFEM) for the flow and the mechanics,
respectively. This non-conforming approach significantly alleviates meshing
challenges. EDFM considers fractures as lower dimension finiten volumes which
exchange fluxes with the rock matrix cells. The EFEM method provides, instead,
a local enrichment of the finite-element space inside each matrix cell cut by a
fracture element. Both the use of piecewise constant and piecewise linear
enrichments are investigated. They are also compared to an Extended Finite
Element (XFEM) approach. One key advantage of EFEM is the element-based nature
of the enrichment, which reduces the geometric complexity of the implementation
and leads to linear systems with advantageous properties. Synthetic numerical
tests are presented to study the convergence and accuracy of the proposed
method. It is also applied to a realistic scenario, involving a heterogeneous
reservoir with a complex fracture distribution, to demonstrate its relevance
for field applications.

sensor, placed in a previously unseen search area, utilizes an
information-theoretic navigation cost function to dynamically select the next
sensing action, i.e., location from which to take a measurement, to efficiently
detect and classify objects of interest within the area. The
information-theoretic cost function proposed in this paper consist of two
\textit{information gain} terms, one for detection and localization of objects
and the other for sequential classification of the detected objects. We present
a novel closed-form representation for the cost function, derived from the
definition of mutual information. We evaluate three different policies for
choosing the next sensing action: lawn mower, greedy, and non-greedy. For these
three policies, we compare the results from our information-theoretic cost
functions to the results of other information-theoretic inspired cost
functions. Our simulation results show that search efficiency is greater using
the proposed cost functions compared to those of the other methods, and that
the greedy and non-greedy policies outperform the lawn mower policy.

have lived up to the promise, particularly of reusability. Reusable Learning
Objects have actually been discussed in the literature for the last 20 years
and yet true large scale sharing of learning and teaching materials remains
relatively rare and challenging. This paper argues that part of the reason is
that the granularity of the learning objects that are in use today is not
conducive to true reuse. Certainly whole PowerPoint slide decks and word
documents are kept in individual files and folders. It is not an ideal
situation. As a result, educators, teachers, course designers, are constantly
reinventing the wheel, or searching for where that one excellent assignment,
explanation, definition was last seen so it can be copied forward. This paper
argues that to achieve effective reuse of Learning Objects, the following are
required: smaller, more granular (micro) learning objects; means to combine
them into larger presentation products; and modern revision and version
control. The paper proposes applying approaches originating in the software
engineering community, such as agile methodology, version control and
management, markup languages, and agile publishing, which together form the
Agile Approach of the title of the paper. With that foundation laid, the paper
examines CourseGen, an open source software platform designed for creating,
sharing, reusing and publishing reusable course content. CourseGen uses a
modified markdown format augmented by CourseGen specific directives, such as
$link to and $include topic. The CourseGen compiler converts a collection of
CourseGen files into the final format such as a web site or a PowerPoint.

machine learning based approach for reliable detection and characterization of
highway traffic congestion events from hundreds of hours of traffic speed data.
Indeed, the proposed approach is a generic approach for detection of changes in
any given time series, which is the wireless traffic sensor data in the present
study. The speed data is initially time-windowed by a ten-hour long sliding
window and fed into three Neural Networks that are used to detect the existence
and duration of congestion events (slowdowns) in each window. The sliding
window captures each slowdown event multiple times and results in increased
confidence in congestion detection. The training and parameter tuning are
performed on 17,483 hours of data that includes 168 slowdown events. This data
is collected and labeled as part of the ongoing probe data validation studies
at the Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies (CATT) at the University
of Maryland. The Neural networks are carefully trained to reduce the chances of
over-fitting to the training data. The experimental results show that this
approach is able to successfully detect most of the congestion events, while
significantly outperforming a heuristic rule-based approach. Moreover, the
proposed approach is shown to be more accurate in estimation of the start-time
and end-time of the congestion events.

half-unit-cell-height steps separating a sequence of terraces having
alternating large and small widths. This can be explained by the $\alpha \beta
\alpha \beta$ stacking sequence of the wurtzite crystal structure, which
results in steps with alternating $A$ and $B$ edge structures for the lowest
energy step azimuths, i.e. steps normal to $[0 1 \bar{1} 0]$ type directions.
Predicted differences in the adatom attachment kinetics at $A$ and $B$ steps
would lead to alternating $\alpha$ and $\beta$ terrace widths. However, because
of the difficulty of experimentally identifying which step is $A$ or $B$, it
has not been possible to determine the absolute difference in their behavior,
e.g. which step has higher adatom attachment rate constants. Here we show that
surface X-ray scattering can measure the fraction of $\alpha$ and $\beta$
terraces, and thus unambiguously differentiate the growth dynamics of $A$ and
$B$ steps. We first present calculations of the intensity profiles of GaN
crystal truncation rods (CTRs) that demonstrate a marked dependence on the
$\alpha$ terrace fraction $f_\alpha$. We then present surface X-ray scattering
measurements performed \textit{in situ} during homoepitaxial growth on (0001)
GaN by vapor phase epitaxy. By analyzing the shapes of the $(1 0 \bar{1} L)$
and $(0 1 \bar{1} L)$ CTRs, we determine that the steady-state $f_\alpha$
increases at higher growth rate, indicating that attachment rate constants are
higher at $A$ steps than at $B$ steps. We also observe the dynamics of
$f_\alpha$ after growth conditions are changed. The results are analyzed using
a Burton-Cabrera-Frank model for a surface with alternating step types, to
extract values for the kinetic parameters of $A$ and $B$ steps. These are
compared with predictions for GaN (0001).

adversarial attacks in the form of backdoors during training. The goal of a
backdoor is to corrupt the performance of the trained model on specific
sub-tasks (e.g., by classifying green cars as frogs). A range of FL backdoor
attacks have been introduced in the literature, but also methods to defend
against them, and it is currently an open question whether FL systems can be
tailored to be robust against backdoors. In this work, we provide evidence to
the contrary. We first establish that, in the general case, robustness to
backdoors implies model robustness to adversarial examples, a major open
problem in itself. Furthermore, detecting the presence of a backdoor in a FL
model is unlikely assuming first order oracles or polynomial time. We couple
our theoretical results with a new family of backdoor attacks, which we refer
to as edge-case backdoors. An edge-case backdoor forces a model to misclassify
on seemingly easy inputs that are however unlikely to be part of the training,
or test data, i.e., they live on the tail of the input distribution. We explain
how these edge-case backdoors can lead to unsavory failures and may have
serious repercussions on fairness, and exhibit that with careful tuning at the
side of the adversary, one can insert them across a range of machine learning
tasks (e.g., image classification, OCR, text prediction, sentiment analysis).

boundaries lead to improved performance, while thin decision boundaries lead to

improve robustness against adversarial examples (e.g., improving the robust

after treatment conclusion and become resistant to docetaxel. This situation
calls for new delivery strategies and drug compounds enabling an improved
therapeutic outcome. Combination of docetaxel with antiangiogenic therapy has
been considered a promising strategy. Bevacizumab is the most common
antiangiogenic drug, but clinical studies have not revealed a clear benefit
from its combination with docetaxel. Here, we capitalize on our prior work on
mathematical modeling of prostate cancer growth subjected to combined cytotoxic

robustly compute the drug-independent cytotoxic and antiangiogenic effects
enabling an optimal therapeutic control of tumor dynamics. We describe the

extremely bright (fluence $\sim$MJy$\,$ms) radio burst from the Galactic

fluences of $112\pm22\mathrm{\,Jy\,ms}$ and $24\pm5\mathrm{\,Jy\,ms}$,

measure significant linear and circular polarisation for the fainter burst. The
bursts are separated in time by $\sim$1.4$\,$s, suggesting a non-Poissonian,
clustered emission process -- similar to what has been seen in some repeating
FRBs. Together with the burst reported by CHIME/FRB and STARE2, as well as a
much fainter burst seen by FAST (fluence 60$\mathrm{\,mJy\,ms}$), our
observations demonstrate that SGR 1935+2154 can produce bursts with apparent

Yet, accurate localization of the walls and the cancer regions in the

this issue, we propose a new class of hollow kernels that learn to 'mimic' the

algorithm that reliably adapts learning rates to large-batch training. By
continually adapting to the gradient's variance, AdaScale automatically
achieves speed-ups for a wide range of batch sizes. We formally describe this
quality with AdaScale's convergence bound, which maintains final objective
values, even as batch sizes grow large and the number of iterations decreases.
In empirical comparisons, AdaScale trains well beyond the batch size limits of
popular ""linear learning rate scaling"" rules. This includes large-batch
training with no model degradation for machine translation, image
classification, object detection, and speech recognition tasks. AdaScale's
qualitative behavior is similar to that of ""warm-up"" heuristics, but unlike
warm-up, this behavior emerges naturally from a principled mechanism. The
algorithm introduces negligible computational overhead and no new
hyperparameters, making AdaScale an attractive choice for large-scale training

less important, is amplified by a factor of the mass ratio of strange to light

  2020), Vancouver, Canada",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning depends on changes in synaptic connections deep inside the brain. In
multilayer networks, these changes are triggered by error signals fed back from
the output, generally through a stepwise inversion of the feedforward
processing steps. The gold standard for this process -- backpropagation --
works well in artificial neural networks, but is biologically implausible.
Several recent proposals have emerged to address this problem, but many of
these biologically-plausible schemes are based on learning an independent set
of feedback connections. This complicates the assignment of errors to each
synapse by making it dependent upon a second learning problem, and by fitting
inversions rather than guaranteeing them. Here, we show that feedforward
network transformations can be effectively inverted through dynamics. We derive
this dynamic inversion from the perspective of feedback control, where the
forward transformation is reused and dynamically interacts with fixed or random
feedback to propagate error signals during the backward pass. Importantly, this
scheme does not rely upon a second learning problem for feedback because
accurate inversion is guaranteed through the network dynamics. We map these
dynamics onto generic feedforward networks, and show that the resulting
algorithm performs well on several supervised and unsupervised datasets.
Finally, we discuss potential links between dynamic inversion and second-order
optimization. Overall, our work introduces an alternative perspective on credit
assignment in the brain, and proposes a special role for temporal dynamics and
feedback control during learning.

However, in real applications, the curve texts are more scarce than the

Among the multi-oriented detection methods, direct regression for the geometry
of scene text shares a simple yet powerful pipeline and gets popular in
academic and industrial communities, but it may produce imperfect detections,
especially for long texts due to the limitation of the receptive field. In this
work, we aim to improve this while keeping the pipeline simple. A fully
convolutional corner refinement network (FC2RN) is proposed for accurate
multi-oriented text detection, in which an initial corner prediction and a
refined corner prediction are obtained at one pass. With a novel quadrilateral
RoI convolution operation tailed for multi-oriented scene text, the initial
quadrilateral prediction is encoded into the feature maps which can be further
used to predict offset between the initial prediction and the ground-truth as
well as output a refined confidence score. Experimental results on four public

inaccurate filtering estimates and forecast predictions. Results demonstrate
the importance of choosing an observation function that well interprets the
available data on the corresponding EnKF estimates in several filtering

theory models to tackle multi-objective application problems. The main idea is
to exploit a specific type of simultaneous move games, called congestion games.
Congestion games offer numerous advantages ranging from being succinctly
represented to possessing Nash equilibrium that is reachable in a
polynomial-time. The proposed algorithm has three main steps: 1) it starts by
identifying the initial players (or the cluster-heads), 2) it establishes the
initial clusters' composition by constructing the game and try to find the
equilibrium of the game. The third step consists of merging close clusters to
obtain the final clusters. The experimental results show that the proposed
clustering approach obtains good results and it is very promising in terms of

and are a vital component of personalized medicine. Statistical models make use
of longitudinal data to capture the temporal aspect of disease progression;
however, these models require prior feature extraction. Deep learning avoids
explicit feature extraction, meaning we can develop models for images where
features are either unknown or impossible to quantify accurately. Previous
prognostic models using deep learning with imaging data require annotation
during training or only utilize a single time point. We propose a novel deep
learning method to predict the progression of diseases using longitudinal
imaging data with uneven time intervals, which requires no prior feature
extraction. Given previous images from a patient, our method aims to predict
whether the patient will progress onto the next stage of the disease. The
proposed method uses InceptionV3 to produce feature vectors for each image. In
order to account for uneven intervals, a novel interval scaling is proposed.
Finally, a Recurrent Neural Network is used to prognosticate the disease. We
demonstrate our method on a longitudinal dataset of color fundus images from
4903 eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), taken from the
Age-Related Eye Disease Study, to predict progression to late AMD. Our method

systems of hydraulic structures in the violent transition from supercritical to

turbulence and strong fluctuations of the free surface and the jump toe. For
free surface measurements, fast-sampling, fixed-point instruments such as
acoustic displacement meters (ADMs) and wire gauges (WGs) are commonly used,
while LIDAR technology is a relatively new method for recording instantaneous
free surface motions of aerated flows. While each of these instruments has been
shown previously to provide reasonable results for basic and advanced free
surface properties, differences between instruments and experiments remain
unexplained. To systematically analyse these differences, simultaneous

been discussed. Lenses have been introduced as formal objects to study
increasingly precise measurements around the singularity and a specific family
of lenses called Exterior probabilities have been investigated. It has been
shown that under such probabilities, measurement variance of a measurable
function around a 1st order pole on a complex manifold, consists of two
separable parts - one that decreases with diminishing scale of the lenses, and
the other that increases. It has been discussed how this framework can lend
mathematical support to ideas of non-deterministic uncertainty prevalent at a
quantum scale. In fact, the aforementioned variance decomposition allows for a
minimum possible variance for such a system irrespective of how close the
measurements are. This inequality is structurally similar to Heisenberg
uncertainty relationship if one considers energy/momentum to be a meromorphic
function of a complex spacetime.

parametrization of the probabilities in discriminative classifiers affects the

in misleadingly high confidences on OOD data and under covariate shift. We
investigate alternative ways of formulating probabilities using (1) a

any existing scheduling technique. In this paper, we present LINTS^RT, a
learning-based testbed for intelligent real-time scheduling, which has the
potential to handle various complexities seen in practice. The design of
LINTS^RT is fundamentally motivated by AlphaGo Zero for playing the board game

the basic case: scheduling sporadic workloads on a homogeneous multiprocessor,

an information-theoretic privacy problem that arises when sharing genomic data:
a user wants to share his or her genome sequence while keeping the genotypes at
certain positions hidden, which could otherwise reveal critical health-related
information. A straightforward solution of erasing (masking) the chosen
genotypes does not ensure privacy, because the correlation between nearby
positions can leak the masked genotypes. We introduce an erasure-based privacy
mechanism with perfect information-theoretic privacy, whereby the released
sequence is statistically independent of the sensitive genotypes. Our mechanism
can be interpreted as a locally-optimal greedy algorithm for a given processing
order of sequence positions, where utility is measured by the number of
positions released without erasure. We show that finding an optimal order is
NP-hard in general and provide an upper bound on the optimal utility. For
sequences from hidden Markov models, a standard modeling approach in genetics,
we propose an efficient algorithmic implementation of our mechanism with
complexity polynomial in sequence length. Moreover, we illustrate the
robustness of the mechanism by bounding the privacy leakage from erroneous
prior distributions. Our work is a step towards more rigorous control of
privacy in genomic data sharing.

well-documented to be superior in handling constraints and complex
communication environments simultaneously. Two new decentralized dual averaging
(DDA) algorithms are proposed. In the first one, a second-order dynamic average
consensus protocol is tailored for DDA-type algorithms, which equips each agent
with a provably more accurate estimate of the global dual variable than
conventional schemes. We rigorously prove that the proposed algorithm attains
$\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ convergence for general convex and smooth problems, for
which existing DDA methods were only known to converge at
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ prior to our work. In the second one, we use the
extrapolation technique to accelerate the convergence of DDA. Compared to
existing accelerated algorithms, where typically two different variables are
exchanged among agents at each time, the proposed algorithm only seeks
consensus on local gradients. Then, the extrapolation is performed based on two
sequences of primal variables which are determined by the accumulations of
gradients at two consecutive time instants, respectively. The algorithm is
proved to converge at
$\mathcal{O}(1)\left(\frac{1}{t^2}+\frac{1}{t(1-\beta)^2}\right)$, where
$\beta$ denotes the second largest singular value of the mixing matrix. We
remark that the condition for the algorithmic parameter to guarantee
convergence does not rely on the spectrum of the mixing matrix, making itself
easy to satisfy in practice. Finally, numerical results are presented to
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

approach integrates the latest advances in object detection and noise reduction
in Computer Vision. Specifically, DMAR employs a two-stage approach: in the
first, degraded regions are detected using the Single Shot Multibox Detector
(SSD), and in the second, the artifacts within the found regions are reduced
using a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). We further introduce a set of novel
data augmentation techniques to address the high dimensionality of MRI images
and the scarcity of available data. As a result, our model was trained on a
large synthetic dataset of 225,000 images generated from 375 whole brain
T1-weighted MRI scans. DMAR visibly reduces image artifacts when applied to
both synthetic test images and 55 real-world motion-affected slices from 18
subjects from the multi-center Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)
study. Quantitatively, depending on the level of degradation, our model
achieves a 27.8%-48.1% reduction in RMSE and a 2.88--5.79 dB gain in PSNR on a
5000-sample set of synthetic images. For real-world artifact-affected scans
from ABIDE, our model reduced the variance of image voxel intensity within

consider a terahertz pump optical probe experiment in the hybrid systems where
the terahertz pump pulse couples to the exciton degrees of freedom on the

that the response of the characteristic frequency shifts according to the

phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AVdominated, and the pure AVs. This
paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. It is the
first-of-its-kind survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both
transportation engineering and AI for mixed traffic modeling. Models used for
each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep (reinforcement)
learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we
primarily focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving
policies are to control a large number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of
human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate human driver
behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled
in the environment? (4) How are the interactions between human drivers and
autonomous vehicles characterized? Hopefully this paper will not only inspire
our transportation community to rethink the conventional models that are

particular robotics and machine learning, to join forces towards creating a
safe and efficient mixed traffic ecosystem.

distribution in target tissues. We report a parametric numerical study of the
thermal response and corresponding of thermal dose in a bio-tissue in response
to ultrasound. We compared the predictions of tissue models with two, three and
seven layers, to ultrasound induced heating at duty cycles ranging from 0.6 and
0.9. Further, two tumor sizes and transducer powers (10 W and 15 W) were
considered. Inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation was coupled with Penne's bioheat
equation to predict heating in response to pulsed ultrasound. Necrotic lesion
size was calculated using the cumulative equivalent minute (CEM) thermal dose
function. In-vitro experiments were performed with agar-based tissue phantoms
as a preliminary validation of the numerical results. The simulations conducted
with the seven layered model predicted up to 33.5% lower peak pressure
amplitude than the three-layered model. As the ultrasound pulse width decreased
with the equivalent sonication time fixed, the corresponding magnitude of the
peak temperature and the rate of temperature rise decreased. Pulsed ultrasound
resulted in increased the volume of necrotic lesions for equivalent time of
sonication. The findings of this study highlight the dependence of HIFU-induced
heating on target geometry and acoustic properties, and could help guide the
choice of suitable ultrasound exposure parameters for further studies.

  We show that going barely beyond this, even to matroid-based valuations (a

Variational inference based on neural autoregressive models respects the

a cost: such models are expensive to train in high-dimensional regimes and can
be slow to produce samples. In this work, we introduce an orthogonal solution,

self-reflective inference achieves state-of-the art performance without
resorting to complex, computationally expensive components such as
autoregressive layers. Moreover, we design a variational normalizing flow that
employs the proposed architecture, yielding predictive benefits compared to its
purely generative counterpart. Our proposed modification is quite general and
complements the existing literature; self-reflective inference can naturally
leverage advances in distribution estimation and generative modeling to improve
the capacity of each layer in the hierarchy.

crucial to perform analysis for better accuracy. The visibility can be affected
by several atmospheric interferences in challenging weather-one of them is the
appearance of rain streak. In recent time, rain streak removal achieves lots of
interest to the researchers as it has some exciting applications such as
autonomous car, intelligent traffic monitoring system, multimedia, etc. In this
paper, we propose a novel and simple method by combining three novel extracted
features focusing on temporal appearance, wide shape and relative location of
the rain streak and we called it TAWL (Temporal Appearance, Width, and
Location) method. The proposed TAWL method adaptively uses features from
different resolutions and frame rates. Moreover, it progressively processes
features from the up-coming frames so that it can remove rain in the real-time.
The experiments have been conducted using video sequences with both real rains
and synthetic rains to compare the performance of the proposed method against
the relevant state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by removing
more rain streaks while keeping other moving regions.

Most of the studies, however, have performed frame-by-frame estimation based on
independent static images. In this paper, we attempt to not only consider the
appearance of a hand but incorporate the temporal movement information of a
hand in motion into the learning framework for better 3D hand pose estimation
performance, which leads to the necessity of a large scale dataset with
sequential RGB hand images. We propose a novel method that generates a
synthetic dataset that mimics natural human hand movements by re-engineering
annotations of an extant static hand pose dataset into pose-flows. With the
generated dataset, we train a newly proposed recurrent framework, exploiting
visuo-temporal features from sequential images of synthetic hands in motion and
emphasizing temporal smoothness of estimations with a temporal consistency
constraint. Our novel training strategy of detaching the recurrent layer of the
framework during domain finetuning from synthetic to real allows preservation
of the visuo-temporal features learned from sequential synthetic hand images.
Hand poses that are sequentially estimated consequently produce natural and
smooth hand movements which lead to more robust estimations. We show that
utilizing temporal information for 3D hand pose estimation significantly
enhances general pose estimations by outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
experiments on hand pose estimation benchmarks.

bilevel optimization. Bilevel optimization is a class of problems which exhibit
a two-level structure, and its goal is to minimize an outer objective function
with variables which are constrained to be the optimal solution to an (inner)
optimization problem. We consider the case when the inner problem is
unconstrained and strongly convex, while the outer problem is constrained and
has a smooth objective function. We propose a two-timescale stochastic
approximation (TTSA) algorithm for tackling such a bilevel problem. In the
algorithm, a stochastic gradient update with a larger step size is used for the
inner problem, while a projected stochastic gradient update with a smaller step
size is used for the outer problem. We analyze the convergence rates for the
TTSA algorithm under various settings: when the outer problem is strongly
convex (resp.~weakly convex), the TTSA algorithm finds an
$\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/3})$-optimal (resp.~$\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/5})$-stationary)
solution, where $K$ is the total iteration number. As an application, we show
that a two-timescale natural actor-critic proximal policy optimization
algorithm can be viewed as a special case of our TTSA framework. Importantly,
the natural actor-critic algorithm is shown to converge at a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(K^{-1/4})$ in terms of the gap in expected discounted reward
compared to a global optimal policy.

thus removing the heretofore necessary assumption of the Doob-Meyer

is an overstability phenomenon associated with an exponentially growing mode of

downstream within the shock and subsequently decay in the post-shock region.
The maximum total growth (MTG) for such an unstable wave before it is damped is
estimated in typical environments of star-forming clouds, which is
approximately 10-30 times larger than the initial perturbation at the modest

practical applications. To address the above issues, this paper presents an
affine non-negative collaborative representation (ANCR) model for pattern
classification. To be more specific, ANCR imposes a regularization term on the

frequency-division duplex mode, downlink channel state information (CSI)
acquisition will incur large overhead. This overhead is substantially reduced
when sparse channel estimation techniques are employed, owing to the channel
sparsity in the angular domain. When a sparse channel estimation method is
implemented, the measurement matrix, which is related to the pilot matrix, is
essential to the channel estimation performance. Existing sparse channel
estimation schemes widely adopt random measurement matrices, which have been
criticized for their suboptimal reconstruction performance. This paper proposes
novel data-driven solutions to design the measurement matrix. Model-based
autoencoders are customized to optimize the measurement matrix by unfolding the
classical basis pursuit algorithm. The obtained data-driven measurement
matrices are applied to existing sparse reconstruction algorithms, leading to
flexible hybrid data-driven implementations for sparse channel estimation.
Numerical results show that the proposed data-driven measurement matrices can
achieve more accurate reconstructions and use fewer measurements than the
existing random matrices, thereby leading to a higher achievable rate for CSI
acquisition. Moreover, compared with existing pure deep learning-based sparse
reconstruction methods, the proposed hybrid data-driven scheme, which uses the
novel data-driven measurement matrices with conventional sparse reconstruction
algorithms, can achieve higher reconstruction accuracy.

interactions are considered. The payoffs of the agents depend on their benefits
from their social interactions, as well as on the costs to their health due to
their possible contamination. The information available to the agents during

growth, and credit cards are the most popular consumer loan. One of the most
essential parts in credit cards is the credit limit management. Traditionally,
credit limits are adjusted based on limited heuristic strategies, which are
developed by experienced professionals. In this paper, we present a data-driven
approach to manage the credit limit intelligently. Firstly, a conditional
independence testing is conducted to acquire the data for building models.
Based on these testing data, a response model is then built to measure the
heterogeneous treatment effect of increasing credit limits (i.e. treatments)
for different customers, who are depicted by several control variables (i.e.
features). In order to incorporate the diminishing marginal effect, a carefully
selected log transformation is introduced to the treatment variable. Moreover,
the model's capability can be further enhanced by applying a non-linear
transformation on features via GBDT encoding. Finally, a well-designed metric
is proposed to properly measure the performances of compared methods. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

refining strong labels as sequential labels with inaccurate timestamps removed.
In AED, strong labels contain the occurrence of a specific event and its
timestamps corresponding to the start and end of the event in an audio clip.
The timestamps depend on subjectivity of each annotator, and their label noise
is inevitable. Contrary to the strong labels, weak labels indicate only the
occurrence of a specific event. They do not have the label noise caused by the
timestamps, but the time information is excluded. To fully exploit information
from available strong and weak labels, we propose an AED scheme to train with
sequential labels in addition to the given strong and weak labels after
converting the strong labels into the sequential labels. Using sequential
labels consistently improved the performance particularly with the
segment-based F-score by focusing on occurrences of events. In the
mean-teacher-based approach for semi-supervised learning, including an early
step with sequential prediction in addition to supervised learning with
sequential labels mitigated label noise and inaccurate prediction of the
teacher model and improved the segment-based F-score significantly while
maintaining the event-based F-score.

an interacting particle system known as the inclusion process. For inclusion
processes, it is widely believed that the system nucleates the condensation of
particles because of the attractive nature of the interaction mechanism. The
metastable behavior of the inclusion processes corresponds to the movement of
the condensate on a suitable time scale, and the computation of the
corresponding time scale and the characterization of the scaling limit of the
condensate motion are the main problems in the study of metastability of
inclusion processes. Previously, these problems were solved for reversible
inclusion processes in [Bianchi, Dommers, and Giardin\`a, Electronic Journal of
Probability, 22: 1-34, 2017], and the main contribution of the present study is
to extend this analysis to a wide class of non-reversible inclusion processes.
Non-reversibility is a major obstacle to analyzing such models, mainly because
there is no closed-form expression of the invariant measure for the general
case, and our main achievement is to overcome this difficulty. In particular,
our results demonstrate that the time scale and limiting process of
non-reversible inclusion processes are quantitatively and qualitatively
different from those of reversible ones, respectively. We emphasize that, to
the best of our knowledge, these results are the first rigorous quantitative
results in the study of metastability when the invariant measure is not

system by analyzing the short-timescale ($t_{\rm E}\sim 4.4$~days) lensing
event KMT-2018-BLG-0748. The central part of the light curve exhibits asymmetry
due to the negative deviations in the rising part and the positive deviations

The short event timescale together with the small angular Einstein radius,
$\theta_{\rm E}\sim 0.11$~mas, indicate that the mass of the planet host is
very small. The Bayesian analysis conducted under the assumption that the
planet frequency is independent of the host mass indicates that the mass of the
planet is $M_{\rm p}=0.18^{+0.29}_{-0.10}~M_{\rm J}$, and the mass of the host,
$M_{\rm h}= 0.087^{+0.138}_{-0.047}~M_\odot$, is near the star/brown dwarf

structure space of $C_c(X,F)$ is $\beta_0X$, the Banaschewski Compactification
of $X$. The ideals $\{O^{p,F}_c:p\in \beta_0X\}$ in $C_c(X,F)$ are introduced
as modified countable analogue of the ideals $\{O^p:p\in\beta X\}$ in $C(X)$.
It is realized that $C_c(X,F)\cap
C_K(X,F)=\bigcap_{p\in\beta_0X\texttt{\textbackslash}X} O^{p,F}_c$, this may be
called a countable analogue of the well-known formula
$C_K(X)=\bigcap_{p\in\beta X\texttt{\textbackslash}X}O^p$ in $C(X)$.
Furthermore, it is shown that the hypothesis $C_c(X,F)$ is a Von-Neumann
regular ring is equivalent to amongst others the condition that $X$ is a
$P-$space.

  Multiple Alternative Hypotheses",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we develop a new elegant framework relying on the
Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion to address the design of one-stage
adaptive detection architectures for multiple hypothesis testing problems.
Specifically, at the design stage, we assume that several alternative
hypotheses may be in force and that only one null hypothesis exists. Then,
starting from the case where all the parameters are known and proceeding until
the case where the adaptivity with respect to the entire parameter set is
required, we come up with decision schemes for multiple alternative hypotheses
consisting of the sum between the compressed log-likelihood ratio based upon
the available data and a penalty term accounting for the number of unknown
parameters. The latter rises from suitable approximations of the
Kullback-Leibler Divergence between the true and a candidate probability
density function. Interestingly, under specific constraints, the proposed
decision schemes can share the constant false alarm rate property by virtue of
the Invariance Principle. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework through the application to examples of practical value in the context
of radar detection also in comparison with two-stage competitors. This analysis
highlights that the architectures devised within the proposed framework
represent an effective means to deal with detection problems where the
uncertainty on some parameters leads to multiple alternative hypotheses.

differentiable dynamical systems on $[0,1]$ depending on one parameter
$\omega\in\mathbb R^+$. These maps are everywhere expanding apart from a
neutral fixed point. It is well known that depending on the amount of expansion
close to the neutral point, they have either an absolutely continuous invariant
probability measure and polynomial decay of correlations ($\omega <1$), or a
unique physical measure that is singular and concentrated at the neutral point
($\omega >1$). In this paper, we study the composition of L-S-V maps whose
parameters are randomly sampled from a range in $\mathbb R^+$, and where these
two contrasting behaviours are mixed. We show that if the parameters $\omega<1$
are sampled with positive probability, then the stationary measure of the
random system is absolutely continuous; the annealed decay rate of correlations
is close (or in some cases equal) to the fastest rate of decay among those of
the sampled systems; and suitably rescaled Birkhoff averages converge to limit
laws. In contrast to previous studies where $\omega \in [0,1]$, we allow $
\omega >1$ in our sampling distribution. We also show that one can obtain
similar decay of correlation rates for $\omega \in [0,\infty)$, when sampling

$v|p$ of $F$ that is not split in $K$ and for which $V_v$ is anisotropic, let
$\nu$ be an extension of $v$ to the reflex field $E$. We define an integral
model of the corresponding Shimura curve over ${\rm Spec}\, O_{E, (\nu)}$ by
means of a moduli problem for abelian schemes with suitable polarization and
level structure prime to $p$. The formulation of the moduli problem involves a
Kottwitz condition, an Eisenstein condition, and an adjusted invariant. The
first two conditions are conditions on the Lie algebra of the abelian
varieties; the last condition is a condition on the Riemann form of the
polarization. The uniformization of the formal completion of this model along
its special fiber is given in terms of the formal Drinfeld upper half plane for
$F_v$. The proof relies on the construction of the contracting functor which
relates a relative Rapoport-Zink space for strict formal $O_{F_v}$-modules with
a Rapoport-Zink space of $p$-divisible groups which arise from the moduli
problem, where the $O_{F_v}$-action is usually not strict when $F_v\ne \mathbb

a novel machine learning and optimization technique to find the optimal price
point at an individual product level. It comprises three major components.
Firstly, we use a demand prediction model to predict the next day demand for
each product at a certain discount percentage. Next step, we use the concept of
price elasticity of demand to get the multiple demand values by varying the
discount percentage. Thus we obtain multiple price demand pairs for each
product and we have to choose one of them for the live platform. Typically
fashion e-commerce has millions of products, so there can be many permutations.
Each permutation will assign a unique price point for all the products, which
will sum up to a unique revenue number. To choose the best permutation which
gives maximum revenue, a linear programming optimization technique is used. We
have deployed the above methods in the live production environment and
conducted several AB tests. According to the AB test result, our model is
improving the revenue by 1 percent and gross margin by 0.81 percent.

analysis of the battery recharging time (BRT) in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RISs) aided wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Specifically, we
derive novel closed-form expressions for the probability density function
(PDF), cumulative distribution function, and moments of the BRT of the radio
frequency energy harvesting wireless nodes. Moreover, closed-form expressions
of the the PDF of the BRT is obtained for two special cases: i) when the RIS is
equipped with one reflecting element (RE), ii) when the RIS consists of a large
number of REs. Capitalizing on the derived expressions, we offer a
comprehensive treatment for the statistical characterization of the BRT and
study the impact of the system and battery parameters on its performance. Our
results reveal that the proposed statistical models are analytically tractable,
accurate, and efficient in assessing the sustainability of RIS-assisted WPT
networks and in providing key design insights for large-scale future wireless
applications. For example, we demonstrate that a 4-fold reduction in the mean
time of the BRT can be achieved by doubling the number of RIS elements. Monte
Carlo simulation results corroborate the accuracy of the proposed theoretical
framework.

computational structural biology. Studies of RNA structure formation often
assume that the process starts from a fully synthesized sequence. Experimental
evidence, however, has shown that RNA folds concurrently with its elongation.
We investigate RNA secondary structure formation, including pseudoknots, that
takes into account the cotranscriptional effects. We propose a
single-nucleotide resolution kinetic model of the folding process of RNA
molecules, where the polymerase-driven elongation of an RNA strand by a new
nucleotide is included as a primitive operation, together with a stochastic
simulation method that implements this folding concurrently with the
transcriptional synthesis. Numerical case studies show that our
cotranscriptional RNA folding model can predict the formation of conformations
that are favored in actual biological systems. Our new computational tool can
thus provide quantitative predictions and offer useful insights into the
kinetics of RNA folding.

its rotational and kinetic temperatures can be affected by the blended
Hyperfine Components (HFCs). We developed a new recipe, referred to as the
HyperFine Group Ratio (HFGR), which utilizes only direct observables, namely
the intensity ratios between the grouped HFCs. As tested on the model spectra,
the empirical formulae in HFGR can derive the rotational temperature ($T_{\rm
rot}$) from the HFC group ratios in an unambiguous manner. We compared HFGR
with two other classical methods, intensity ratio and hyperfine fitting, based
on both simulated spectra and real data. HFGR has three major improvements.
First, HFGR does not require modeling the HFC or fitting the line profiles,
thus is more robust against the effect of HFC blending. Second, the
simulation-enabled empirical formulae are much faster than fitting the spectra
over the parameter space, so the computer time and human time can be both
largely saved. Third, the statistical uncertainty of the temperature $\Delta
T_{\rm rot}$ as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a natural
product of the HFGR recipe. The internal error of HFGR is $\Delta T_{\rm
rot}\leq0.5$ K over a broad parameter space of rotational temperature (10 to 60
K), line width (0.3 to 4 km/s), and optical depth (0 to 5). When there is a
spectral noise, HFGR can also maintain a reasonable uncertainty level at
$\Delta T_{\rm rot}\leq 1.0$ K (1 $\sigma$) when SNR > 4.

unsupervised deep networks remains challenging for this task. To this end, we
propose a novel coupled unmixing network with a cross-attention mechanism,
CUCaNet for short, to enhance the spatial resolution of HSI by means of
higher-spatial-resolution multispectral image (MSI). Inspired by coupled
spectral unmixing, a two-stream convolutional autoencoder framework is taken as
backbone to jointly decompose MS and HS data into a spectrally meaningful basis
and corresponding coefficients. CUCaNet is capable of adaptively learning
spectral and spatial response functions from HS-MS correspondences by enforcing
reasonable consistency assumptions on the networks. Moreover, a cross-attention
module is devised to yield more effective spatial-spectral information transfer
in networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely-used HS-MS
datasets in comparison with state-of-the-art HSI-SR models, demonstrating the
superiority of the CUCaNet in the HSI-SR application. Furthermore, the codes

the acoustic velocity power map in 2.5-4 mHz band for pre-flare, spanning

processes are found to significantly influence the plasma-electron density
distributions and leads to a dependence of the distribution on the specific
bound state of the targeted atom. As a critical check, the model is applied to
simulate the emission spectra of He-like Aluminum and Chlorine in hot dense

$\tau:V\to \mathbb{N}$ upper-bounded by the vertex degree. For a given model, a
set $S_0\subseteq V(G)$ is a target set if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into
non-empty subsets $S_0,S_1,\dotsc,S_t$ such that, for $i \in \{1, \ldots, t\}$,
$S_i$ contains exactly every vertex $v$ having at least $\tau(v)$ neighbors in
$S_0\cup\dots\cup S_{i-1}$. We say that $t$ is the activation time
$t_{\tau}(S_0)$ of the target set $S_0$. The problem of, given such a model,
finding a target set of minimum size has been extensively studied in the
literature. In this article, we investigate its variant, which we call
TSS-time, in which the goal is to find a target set $S_0$ that maximizes
$t_{\tau}(S_0)$. That is, given a graph $G$, a threshold function $\tau$ in
$G$, and an integer $k$, the objective of the TSS-time problem is to decide
whether $G$ contains a target set $S_0$ such that $t_{\tau}(S_0)\geq k$. Let
$\tau^* = \max_{v \in V(G)} \tau(v)$. Our main result is the following
dichotomy about the complexity of TSS-time when $G$ belongs to a minor-closed
graph class ${\cal C}$: if ${\cal C}$ has bounded local treewidth, the problem
is FPT parameterized by $k$ and $\tau^{\star}$; otherwise, it is NP-complete
even for fixed $k=4$ and $\tau^{\star}=2$. We also prove that, with $\tau^*=2$,
the problem is NP-hard in bipartite graphs for fixed $k=5$, and from previous
results we observe that TSS-time is NP-hard in planar graphs and W[1]-hard
parameterized by treewidth. Finally, we present a linear-time algorithm to find
a target set $S_0$ in a given tree maximizing $t_{\tau}(S_0)$.

phenomenon was observed in multiple photometric bands using two different
HIPPI-class (HIgh Precision Polarimetric Instrument)polarimeters with
telescopes ranging in size from 35-cm to 3.9-m. The peak-to-trough amplitude of
the polarization is wavelength dependent and large, $\sim$700 parts-per-million

Light from each star reflected by the photosphere of the other, together with a
much smaller contribution from tidal distortion and eclipse effects, wholly
accounts for the polarization amplitude. In the past polarization in

  Tolerance",,,,,"cs.DC cs.MA cs.NI cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale decentralized systems of autonomous agents interacting via
asynchronous communication often experience the following self-healing dilemma:
fault detection inherits network uncertainties making a remote faulty process
indistinguishable from a slow process. In the case of a slow process without
fault, fault correction is undesirable as it can trigger new faults that could
be prevented with fault tolerance that is a more proactive system maintenance.
But in the case of an actual faulty process, fault tolerance alone without
eventually correcting persistent faults can make systems underperforming.
Measuring, understanding and resolving such self-healing dilemmas is a timely
challenge and critical requirement given the rise of distributed ledgers, edge
computing, the Internet of Things in several energy, transport and health
applications. This paper contributes a novel and general-purpose modeling of
fault scenarios during system runtime. They are used to accurately measure and
predict inconsistencies generated by the undesirable outcomes of fault
correction and fault tolerance as the means to improve self-healing of
large-scale decentralized systems at the design phase. A rigorous experimental
methodology is designed that evaluates 696 experimental settings of different
fault scales, fault profiles and fault detection thresholds in a prototyped
decentralized network of 3000 nodes. Almost 9 million measurements of
inconsistencies were collected in a network, where each node monitors the
health status of another node, while both can defect. The prediction
performance of the modeled fault scenarios is validated in a challenging
application scenario of decentralized and dynamic in-network data aggregation
using real-world data from a Smart Grid pilot project. Findings confirm the
origin of inconsistencies at design phase.

Standalone Photovoltaic Distributed Generation (SPVDG) system is considered .
On-site generation from these systems is more efficient when the power is
transmitted via DC due to elimination of transmission losses and needless
energy conversions. The inherent low-inertia of these systems added with
fluctuation of output power and uncertain load consumption, calls for advanced
control techniques to ensure fast and stable operation during various
intermittencies. These techniques are expensive since they demand installation
of many sophisticated sensors. The computation power provided by the fast
growing IC technology can be utilized to estimate different parameters in a
system and reduce the need for expensive sensing equipment. This work provides
solutions to problems encountered in the development of faster, more stable and
sensor-free voltage control and maximum power point tracking(MPPT) for SPVDG
systems with PV and battery.

we use the LAXPC data from the Target of Opportunity observations of India's
first multi-wavelength astronomy satellite AstroSat. The $\theta$ class is
marked by the recurrent appearance of U-shaped regions in the light curve,
where the photon count rate first decreases rapidly and then increases slowly.
For our analysis, we use U-shaped regions of first two orbits (02345 and 02346)
on 2016 March 04. In both of the cases, the dynamic Power Density Spectra (PDS)
showed significant power at around $4-5$ Hz, suggesting the presence of a
low-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) around that frequency interval.
The QPO frequency is found to increase with time when the enhancement of the
energy flux also takes place. From the evolution of the spectra, we determine
the evolution of the accretion flow parameters in both of these observations.
Fitting the spectra with the transonic flow solution based Two-Component
Advective Flow (TCAF) model in $4-25$ keV energy band shows that the Keplerian
disk accretion rate rises with the rise in the radiation intensity, while the
location of the centrifugal pressure driven shock front decreases. In both
these data, a gradual increment of power-law photon index with intensity is
observed suggesting the progressive softening of the source.

observations of the ET Cha (RECX 15) system, a nearby 'old' classical T Tauri
star (5-8 Myr, ~100 pc), which is still strongly accreting. We use SPHERE/IRDIS
in H-band polarimetric imaging mode to obtain high contrast images of the ET
Cha system to search for scattered light from the circumstellar disk as well as
thermal emission from close companions. We additionally employ VLT/NACO total
intensity archival data taken in 2003. We report here the discovery of a
low-mass (sub)stellar companion with SPHERE/IRDIS to ET Cha. We are estimating
the mass of this new companion based on photometry. Depending on the system age
it is a 5 Myr, 50 $M_{Jup}$ brown dwarf or an 8 Myr, 0.10 $M_\odot$ M-type
pre-main-sequence star. We explore possible orbital solutions and discuss the
recent dynamic history of the system. Independent of the precise companion mass
we find that the presence of the companion likely explains the small size of
the disk around ET Cha. The small separation of the binary pair indicates that
the disk around the primary component is likely clearing from the outside in,
explaining the high accretion rate of the system.

service degradation under disruptions. This paper contributes to the literature
with a novel causal inference approach for estimating station-level
vulnerability in metro systems. The empirical analysis is based on large-scale
data on historical incidents and population-level passenger demand. This
analysis thus obviates the need for assumptions made by previous studies on
human behaviour and disruption scenarios. We develop four empirical
vulnerability metrics based on the causal impact of disruptions on travel
demand, average travel speed and passenger flow distribution. Specifically, the
proposed metrics based on the irregularity in passenger flow distribution
extends the scope of vulnerability measurement to the entire trip distribution,
instead of just analysing the disruption impact on the entry or exit demand
(that is, moments of the trip distribution). The unbiased estimates of
disruption impact are obtained by adopting a propensity score matching method,
which adjusts for the confounding biases caused by non-random occurrence of
disruptions. An application of the proposed framework to the London Underground
indicates that the vulnerability of a metro station depends on the location,
topology, and other characteristics. We find that, in 2013, central London
stations are more vulnerable in terms of travel demand loss. However, the loss
of average travel speed and irregularity in relative passenger flows reveal
that passengers from outer London stations suffer from longer individual delays
due to lack of alternative routes.

demonstrate the robust performance of the approach through real world use case
of a multinational fashion retailer having over 300 stores, 35k items and
around 40 categories. The main contributions of this work include unique and

with some primitive operations for smooth partial functions and constructs for
real conditionals and iteration, as a unique structure preserving macro
determined by its action on the primitive operations. We define a semantics for
the language in terms of diffeological spaces, where the key idea is to make
use of a suitable partiality monad. A semantic logical relations argument,
constructed through a subsconing construction over diffeological spaces, yields
a correctness proof of the defined AD macro. A key insight is that, to reason
about differentiation at sum types, we work with relations which form sheaves.
Next, we extend our language with term and type recursion. To model this in our
semantics, we introduce a new notion of space, suitable for modeling both
recursion and differentiation, by equipping a diffeological space with a
compatible $\omega$cpo-structure. We demonstrate that our whole development
extends to this setting. By making use of a semantic, rather than syntactic,

modeling algorithms are used. In this paper, the main problem we consider is
how to conduct more efficient profiling attacks when sufficient profiling
traces cannot be obtained. To deal with this problem, we first introduce the
Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) in the context of
side-channel attacks. We show that CGAN can generate new traces to enlarge the
size of the profiling set, which improves the performance of profiling attacks.
For both unprotected and protected cryptographic algorithms, we find that CGAN
can effectively learn the leakage of traces collected in their implementations.
We also apply it to different modeling algorithms. In our experiments, the
model constructed with the augmented profiling set can reduce the required
attack traces by more than half, which means the generated traces can provide
useful information as the real traces.

a global FCNN localizes multiple landmarks through the analysis of image

regression, displacement vectors pointing from the center of image patches
towards landmark locations are determined. In classification, presence of
landmarks of interest in the patch is established. Global landmark locations
are obtained by averaging the predicted displacement vectors, where the
contribution of each displacement vector is weighted by the posterior
classification probability of the patch that it is pointing from. Subsequently,
for each landmark localized with global localization, local analysis is
performed. Specialized FCNNs refine the global landmark locations by analyzing
local sub-images in a similar manner, i.e. by performing regression and
classification simultaneously and combining the results. Evaluation was
performed through localization of 8 anatomical landmarks in CCTA scans, 2

of Software Defined Networking (SDN) are proposed that decouple the network
control plane from the data-forwarding plane. The SDN control plane can
integrate a diverse set of devices, and tune them at run-time through
vendor-agnostic programmable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This
thesis proposes software defined cognitive networking to enable intelligent use
of network resources. Different radio access technologies, including cognitive
radios, are integrated through a common control platform to increase the
overall network performance. The architectural framework of software defined
cognitive networking is presented alongside the experimental performance
evaluation. Since SDN enables applications to change the network behavior and
centralizes the network control plane to oversee the whole network, it is
highly important to investigate security of SDNs. Therefore, this thesis finds
potential security vulnerabilities in SDN, studies proposed security platforms
and architectures for those vulnerabilities, and presents future directions for
unresolved security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, this thesis also investigates
the potential security challenges and their solutions for the enabling

Histological samples showing garland-like hypercellular structures (so-called

for GBM and hint on poor prognosis of patient survival. We propose a multiscale
modeling approach in the kinetic theory of active particles framework and
deduce by an upscaling process a reaction-diffusion model with repellent

a version of the obtained macroscopic system and investigate the asymptotic
behavior of the solution. Moreover, we study two different types of scaling and
compare the behavior of the obtained macroscopic PDEs by way of simulations.
These show that patterns1 (including pseudopalisades) can be formed for some
parameter ranges, in accordance with the tumor grade. This is true when the
PDEs are obtained via parabolic scaling (undirected tissue), while no such
patterns are observed for the PDEs arising by a hyperbolic limit (directed
tissue). This suggests that brain tissue might be undirected - at least as far

distance, which we determine analytically, from the source before getting
pulled into the sink. Larger droplets can travel further from the source before

intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets

distillation for metric learning problems. Unlike previous approaches, our
proposed method jointly addresses the following constraints i) limited queries
to teacher model, ii) black box teacher model with access to the final output

student and teacher to have same dimensionality. Addressing these constraints
reduces computation requirements, dependency on large-scale training datasets

platforms, present tremendous opportunities and challenges for deep learning,
as there is a significant portion of tagged images, but often with noisy, i.e.
erroneous, labels. Recent studies improve the robustness of deep models against
noisy labels without the knowledge of true labels. In this paper, we advocate
to derive a stronger classifier which proactively makes use of the noisy labels
in addition to the original images - turning noisy labels into learning
features. To such an end, we propose a novel framework, ExpertNet, composed of
Amateur and Expert, which iteratively learn from each other. Amateur is a
regular image classifier trained by the feedback of Expert, which imitates how
human experts would correct the predicted labels from Amateur using the noise
pattern learnt from the knowledge of both the noisy and ground truth labels.
The trained Amateur and Expert proactively leverage the images and their noisy
labels to infer image classes. Our empirical evaluations on noisy versions of
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and real-world data of Clothing1M show that the proposed
model can achieve robust classification against a wide range of noise ratios
and with as little as 20-50% training data, compared to state-of-the-art deep
models that solely focus on distilling the impact of noisy labels.

TIMELY, a probabilistic model that combines pseudotime inference methods with

  subgraph obfuscation",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses active re-identification attacks in the context of
privacy-preserving social graph publication. Active attacks are those where the
adversary can leverage fake accounts, a.k.a. sybil nodes, to enforce structural
patterns that can be used to re-identify their victims on anonymised graphs. In
this paper we present a new probabilistic interpretation of this type of
attacks. Unlike previous privacy properties, which model the protection from
active adversaries as the task of making victim nodes indistinguishable in
terms of their fingerprints with respect to all potential attackers, our new
formulation introduces a more complete view, where the attack is countered by
jointly preventing the attacker from retrieving the set of sybil nodes, and
from using these sybil nodes for re-identifying the victims. Under the new
formulation, we show that the privacy property $k$-symmetry, introduced in the
context of passive attacks, provides a sufficient condition for the protection
against active re-identification attacks leveraging an arbitrary number of
sybil nodes. Moreover, we show that the algorithm K-Match, originally devised
for efficiently enforcing the related notion of $k$-automorphism, also
guarantees $k$-symmetry. Empirical results on several collections of synthetic
graphs corroborate that our approach allows, for the first time, to publish
anonymised social graphs (with formal privacy guarantees) that effectively
resist the strongest active re-identification attack reported in the
literature, even when it leverages a large number of sybil nodes.

malicious agent initiates these attacks by perturbing an input into another one
such that the two inputs are classified differently by the NN. In this paper,
we consider a special class of adversarial examples, which can exhibit not only
the weakness of NN models - as do for the typical adversarial examples - but
also the different behavior between two NN models. We call them
difference-inducing adversarial examples or DIAEs. Specifically, we propose
DAEGEN, the first black-box differential technique for adversarial input
generation. DAEGEN takes as input two NN models of the same classification
problem and reports on output an adversarial example. The obtained adversarial
example is a DIAE, so that it represents a point-wise difference in the input
space between the two NN models. Algorithmically, DAEGEN uses a local
search-based optimization algorithm to find DIAEs by iteratively perturbing an
input to maximize the difference of two models on predicting the input. We
conduct experiments on a spectrum of benchmark datasets (e.g., MNIST, ImageNet,
and Driving) and NN models (e.g., LeNet, ResNet, Dave, and VGG). Experimental
results are promising. First, we compare DAEGEN with two existing white-box
differential techniques (DeepXplore and DLFuzz) and find that under the same
setting, DAEGEN is 1) effective, i.e., it is the only technique that succeeds
in generating attacks in all cases, 2) precise, i.e., the adversarial attacks
are very likely to fool machines and humans, and 3) efficient, i.e, it requires
a reasonable number of classification queries. Second, we compare DAEGEN with
state-of-the-art black-box adversarial attack methods (simba and tremba), by
adapting them to work on a differential setting. The experimental results show
that DAEGEN performs better than both of them.

of min-degree within the clusters and arboricity outside the clusters, (2) all
the listing is done within the cluster, which necessitates new techniques for
bringing into the cluster the information about \emph{all} edges that can
potentially form $K_p$ instances with the cluster edges, and (3) within each
cluster we use a sparsity-aware listing algorithm, which is faster than a
general listing algorithm and which we can allow the cluster to use since we
make sure to sparsify the graph as the iterations proceed.

algorithm for $K_p$ listing, which runs in $\tilde{\Theta}(1 + m/n^{1 + 2/p})$

crucial step for many downstream medical and diagnostic tasks, such as vessel

limit ($10^{29}$ W/cm$^{2}$) would enable testing decades-old fundamental
predictions of Quantum Electrodynamics. A promising yet challenging approach to
achieve such extreme fields consists in reflecting a high-power femtosecond
laser pulse off a curved relativistic mirror. This enhances the intensity of
the reflected beam by simultaneously compressing it in time down to the
attosecond range, and focusing it to sub-micron focal spots. Here we show that
such curved relativistic mirrors can be produced when an ultra-intense laser
pulse ionizes a solid target and creates a dense plasma that specularly
reflects the incident light. This is evidenced by measuring for the first time
the temporal and spatial effects induced on the reflected beam by this
so-called 'plasma mirror'. The all-optical measurement technique demonstrated
here will be instrumental for the use of relativistic plasma mirrors with the
emerging generation of Petawatt lasers, which constitutes a viable experimental
path to the Schwinger limit.

COSMO-SkyMed satellite data, a detailed and updated survey is provided, for
monitoring the accelerating destabilization process of the Mosul dam, that
represents the largest hydraulic facility of Iraq and is located on the Tigris
river. The destructive potential of the wave that would be generated, in the
event of the dam destruction, could have serious consequences. If the concern
for human lives comes first, the concern for cultural heritage protection is
not negligible, since several archaeological sites are located around the Mosul
dam. The proposed procedure is an in-depth modal assessment based on the
micro-motion estimation, through a Doppler sub-apertures tracking and a
Multi-Chromatic Analysis (MCA). The method is based initially on the Persistent
Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) that is also discussed for completeness and
validation. The modal analysis has detected the presence of several areas of
resonance that could mean the presence of cracks, and the results have shown
that the dam is still in a strong destabilization. Moreover, the dam appears to
be divided into two parts: the northern part is accelerating rapidly while the
southern part is decelerating and a main crack in this north-south junction is
found. The estimated velocities through the PS-InSAR technique show a good
agreement with the GNSS in-situ measurements, resulting in a very high
correlation coefficient and showing how the proposed procedure works
efficiently.

with a nonlocal energy functional, depending on a small parameter $\epsilon >
0$. The model gives rise to transition layers, called N\'eel walls, and we
study their behaviour in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$. The analysis has some
similarity to the theory of Ginzburg-Landau vortices. In particular, it gives
rise to a renormalised energy that determines the interaction (attraction or
repulsion) between N\'eel walls to leading order. But while Ginzburg-Landau
vortices show attraction for degrees of the same sign and repulsion for degrees
of opposite signs, the pattern is reversed in this model.
  In a previous paper, we determined the renormalised energy for one of the
models studied here under the assumption that the N\'eel walls stay separated
from each other. In this paper, we present a deeper analysis that in particular
removes this assumption. The theory gives rise to an effective variational
problem for the positions of the walls, encapsulated in a $\Gamma$-convergence
result. In the second part of the paper, we turn our attention to another, more
physical model, including an anisotropy term. We show that it permits a similar
theory, but the anisotropy changes the renormalised energy in unexpected ways
and requires different methods to find it.

attack elliptic curve scalar multiplication algorithms. This attack has only
been analyzed in the realm of power consumption and EM side channels, where the
signals leak related to the value being processed. However, microarchitecture
signals have no such feature, invalidating some assumptions from previous OTA
works.
  In this paper, we revisit previous OTA descriptions, proposing a generic
framework and evaluation metrics for any side-channel signal. Our analysis
reveals OTA features not previously considered, increasing its application
scenarios and requiring a fresh countermeasure analysis to prevent it.
  In this regard, we demonstrate that OTAs can work in the backward direction,
allowing to mount an augmented projective coordinates attack with respect to
the proposal by Naccache, Smart and Stern (Eurocrypt 2004). This demonstrates
that randomizing the initial targeted algorithm state does not prevent the
attack as believed in previous works.
  We analyze three libraries libgcrypt, mbedTLS, and wolfSSL using two
microarchitecture side channels. For the libgcrypt case, we target its EdDSA
implementation using Curve25519 twist curve. We obtain similar results for
mbedTLS and wolfSSL with curve secp256r1. For each library, we execute
extensive attack instances that are able to recover the complete scalar in all
cases using a single trace.
  This work demonstrates that microarchitecture online template attacks are
also very powerful in this scenario, recovering secret information without
knowing a leakage model. This highlights the importance of developing
secure-by-default implementations, instead of fix-on-demand ones.

approximate the correctly rounded value of $f(x)$ (i.e., the value of $f(x)$
rounded to the target representation). It provides more margin to identify
efficient polynomials that produce correctly rounded results for all inputs. We
frame the problem of generating efficient polynomials that produce correctly

we produce the correct result even with range reduction techniques. Using our

simulation requires several hours of (un)processed signals, which is
obstructive when the signals have to be recorded. We propose and evaluate a
data-reduced FADE version (DARF) which facilitates simulations with signals
that cannot be processed digitally, but that can only be recorded in real-time.
DARF simulates one speech recognition threshold (SRT) with about 30 minutes of
recorded and processed signals of the (German) matrix sentence test. Benchmark
experiments were carried out to compare DARF and standard FADE exhibiting small
differences for stationary maskers (1 dB), but larger differences with strongly
fluctuating maskers (5 dB). Hearing impairment and hearing aid algorithms
seemed to reduce the differences. Hearing aid benefits were simulated in terms
of speech recognition with three pairs of real hearing aids in silence ($\geq$8
dB), in stationary and fluctuating maskers in co-located (stat. 2 dB; fluct. 6
dB), and spatially separated speech and noise signals (stat. $\geq$8 dB; fluct.
8 dB). The simulations were plausible in comparison to data from literature,
but a comparison with empirical data is still open. DARF facilitates objective
SRT simulations with real devices with unknown signal processing in real
environments. Yet, a validation of DARF for devices with unknown signal
processing is still pending since it was only tested with three similar
devices. Nonetheless, DARF could be used for improving as well as for

has risen in parts of the world in the last several decades. The resultant
demographic consequences, mostly on sex imbalance, are well documented,
typically including ""missing girls/women"" and ""marriage squeeze."" However, the
SRB-induced impact on demographic dynamics, particularly its underlying
mechanism, has not been explored in depth. We aim to investigate the impact of
the SRB rise on the size, structure, and growth of a population, particularly
emphasizing on population aging. We provide a simple framework, derived from
classical stable population models, to analyze how the SRB rise can reduce the
population size and make the population old. We demonstrate that the cohorts
born with a higher SRB are smaller in size than those with a lower SRB. As the
affected cohorts are born into the population, their smaller size will reduce
the total population size, thereby lifting the fraction of old people that were
born with the original SRB and have the same size as before. The resultant
population aging speed increases as the cohorts with the new SRB take an
increasing share of the population. This study adds that, in addition to
fertility and mortality, the SRB can be a driving factor of population
dynamics, especially when it moves far above normal biological levels.

finite-length wires instead host localized states at the wire ends. These end
states are not topologically protected, they are four-fold degenerate and split
into two Kramers pairs in the presence of potential disorder along the axial

midline shift, which plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of
various brain pathology. Nevertheless, there are still great challenges with
brain midline delineation, such as the largely deformed midline caused by the
mass effect and the possible morphological failure that the predicted midline
is not a connected curve. To address these challenges, we propose a
context-aware refinement network (CAR-Net) to refine and integrate the feature
pyramid representation generated by the UNet. Consequently, the proposed
CAR-Net explores more discriminative contextual features and a larger receptive
field, which is of great importance to predict largely deformed midline. For
keeping the structural connectivity of the brain midline, we introduce a novel
connectivity regular loss (CRL) to punish the disconnectivity between adjacent
coordinates. Moreover, we address the ignored prerequisite of previous
regression-based methods that the brain CT image must be in the standard pose.
A simple pose rectification network is presented to align the source input
image to the standard pose image. Extensive experimental results on the CQ
dataset and one inhouse dataset show that the proposed method requires fewer
parameters and outperforms three state-of-the-art methods in terms of four

the data and observing the induced effect on the computation result of a
data-centric application. Previous work has shown that fine-grained data
provenance can help make such an analysis more efficient: instead of a costly
re-execution of the underlying application, hypothetical scenarios are applied
to a pre-computed provenance expression. However, storing provenance for
complex queries and large-scale data leads to a significant overhead, which is
often a barrier to the incorporation of provenance-based solutions.
  To this end, we present a framework that allows to reduce provenance size.
Our approach is based on reducing the provenance granularity using user defined
abstraction trees over the provenance variables; the granularity is based on
the anticipated hypothetical scenarios. We formalize the tradeoff between
provenance size and supported granularity of the hypothetical reasoning, and
study the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, provide efficient
algorithms for tractable cases and heuristics for others. We experimentally
study the performance of our solution for various queries and abstraction
trees. Our study shows that the algorithms generally lead to substantial
speedup of hypothetical reasoning, with a reasonable loss of accuracy.

Outstanding challenges include

evolutionary heat diffusion-based network alignment (EDNA) to address this

similarities between networks. Comparing EDNA with state-of-the-art algorithms
on a popular protein-protein interaction network dataset, using four different
evaluation metrics, we achieve (i) the most accurate alignments, (ii) increased
robustness against noise, and (iii) superior scaling capacity. The EDNA
algorithm is versatile in that other available network alignments/embeddings
can be used as an initial baseline alignment, and then EDNA works as a wrapper
around them by running the evolutionary diffusion on top of them. In
conclusion, EDNA outperforms state-of-the-art methods for network alignment,
thus setting the stage for large-scale comparison and integration of networks.

MAPS is a cooperative system in which each agent is an independent ""investor""

act as diversely as possible while maximizing its own return with a carefully
designed loss function. As a result, MAPS as a system ends up with a
diversified portfolio. Experiment results with 12 years of US market data show
that MAPS outperforms most of the baselines in terms of Sharpe ratio.

polyelectrolyte or charged nanogel, is immersed into a physiological
electrolyte solution, monovalent and divalent counterions from the solution
bind to the macromolecule in a certain ratio and thereby almost completely
electroneutralize it. For charged macromolecules in biological media, the
number ratio of bound mono- versus di-valent ions is decisive for the desired
function. A theoretical prediction of such a sorption ratio is challenging
because of the competition of electrostatic (valency), ion-specific, and
binding saturation effects. Here, we devise and discuss a few approximate
models to predict such an equilibrium sorption ratio by extending and combining
established electrostatic binding theories such as Donnan, Langmuir, Manning as
well as Poisson-Boltzmann approaches, to systematically study the competitive
uptake of mono- and di-valent counterions by the macromolecule. We compare and
fit our models to coarse-grained (implicit-solvent) computer simulation data of
the globular polyelectrolyte dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS) in salt
solutions of mixed valencies. The dPGS has high potential to serve in
macromolecular carrier applications in biological systems and at the same time
constitutes a good model system for a highly charged macromolecule. We finally
use the simulation-informed models to extrapolate and predict electrostatic
features such as the effective charge as a function of the divalent ion
concentration for a wide range of dPGS generations (sizes).

agent can use this terminal to close any loopholes that are discovered in the
utility function's encoding of agent goals and constraints, to direct the agent

the humans involved. The safety layer will partially, and sometimes fully,
suppress this dangerous incentive. The first part of this paper generalizes
earlier work on AGI emergency stop buttons. We aim to make the mathematical

design that wraps the safety layer around either a known machine learning

stratosphere with several new species, among them water vapor (H2O). With the
aid of a photochemical model H2O can be used as a dynamical tracer in the
jovian stratosphere. In this paper, we aim at constraining vertical eddy
diffusion (Kzz) at the levels where H2O resides. We monitored the H2O
disk-averaged emission at 556.936 GHz with the Odin space telescope between
2002 and 2019, covering nearly two decades. We analyzed the data with a
combination of 1D photochemical and radiative transfer models to constrain
vertical eddy diffusion in the stratosphere of Jupiter. The Odin observations
show us that the emission of H2O has an almost linear decrease of about 40%
between 2002 and 2019.We can only reproduce our time series if we increase the
magnitude of Kzz in the pressure range where H2O diffuses downward from 2002 to
2019, i.e. from ~0.2 mbar to ~5 mbar. However, this modified Kzz is
incompatible with hydrocarbon observations. We find that, even if allowance is
made for the initially large abundances of H2O and CO at the impact latitudes,
the photochemical conversion of H2O to CO2 is not sufficient to explain the
progressive decline of the H2O line emission, suggestive of additional loss
mechanisms. The Kzz we derived from the Odin observations of H2O can only be
viewed as an upper limit in the ~0.2 mbar to ~5 mbar pressure range. The
incompatibility between the interpretations made from H2O and hydrocarbon
observations probably results from 1D modeling limitations. Meridional
variability of H2O, most probably at auroral latitudes, would need to be
assessed and compared with that of hydrocarbons to quantify the role of auroral
chemistry in the temporal evolution of the H2O abundance since the SL9 impacts.
Modeling the temporal evolution of SL9 species with a 2D model would be the
next natural step.

2.5$\times 10^{16}$ n/cm$^2$ to 1$\times 10^{17}$ n/cm$^2$. Edge-TCT
measurements showed that the active detector thickness is limited to the
epitaxial layer and does not extend into the low resistivity substrate even
after the highest fluence. Detector current was measured under reverse and
forward bias. The forward current was higher than the reverse at the same
voltage but the difference gets smaller with increasing fluence. Rapid increase
of current (breakdown) above ~ 700 V under reverse bias was observed. An
annealing study at 60$^\circ$C was made to 1200 minutes of accumulated
annealing time. It showed that the reverse current anneals with similar time
constants as measured at lower fluences. A small increase of forward current
due to annealing was seen. Collected charge was measured with electrons from
$^{90}$Sr source in forward and reverse bias configurations. Under reverse bias
the collected charge increased linearly with bias voltage up to 6000 electrons
at 2.5$\times 10^{16}$ n/cm$^2$ and 3000 electrons at 1$\times 10^{17}$
n/cm$^2$. Rapid increase of noise was measured above $\sim$ 700 V reverse bias
due to breakdown resulting in worse S/N ratio. At low bias voltages slightly
more charge is measured under forward bias compared to reverse. However better
S/N is achieved under reverse bias. Effective trapping times were estimated
from charge collection measurements under forward bias showing that at high
fluences they are much longer than values extrapolated from low fluence
measurements - at 1$\times 10^{17}$ n/cm$^2$ a factor of 6 larger value was
measured.

invoking information on velocity and structural aspects of the clusters into a

contracting functions removing values proven not to be in any solution of a
given constraint. The literature contains numerous propagation algorithms, for
many different constraints, and common to all these propagation algorithms is
the notion of correctness: only values that appear in no solution to the
respective constraint may be removed. In this paper half-checking propagators
are introduced, for which the only requirements are that identified solutions
(by the propagators) are actual solutions (to the corresponding constraints),
and that the propagators are contracting. In particular, a half-checking
propagator may remove solutions resulting in an incomplete solving process, but
with the upside that (good) solutions may be found faster. Overall completeness
can be obtained by running half-checking propagators as one component in a
portfolio solving process. Half-checking propagators opens up a wider variety
of techniques to be used when designing propagation algorithms, compared to
what is currently available.
  A formal model for half-checking propagators is introduced, together with a
detailed description of how to support such propagators in a constraint
programming system. Three general directions for creating half-checking
propagation algorithms are introduced, and used for designing new half-checking
propagators for the cost-circuit constraint as examples. The new propagators
are implemented in the Gecode system.

  This paper approaches heritability from a machine learning perspective, and
examines the close link between mixed models and ridge regression. Our
contribution is twofold. First, we propose estimating genomic heritability
using a predictive approach via ridge regression and Generalized Cross
Validation (GCV). We show that this is consistent with classical mixed model
based estimation. Second, we derive simple formulae that express prediction
accuracy as a function of the ratio n/p, where n is the population size and p
the total number of SNPs. These formulae clearly show that a high heritability
does not imply an accurate prediction when p>n.
  Both the estimation of heritability via GCV and the prediction accuracy
formulae are validated using simulated data and real data from UK Biobank.

Deconvolution was shown in this context to improve the accuracy of the blood

experimental setups. To overcome this limitation, we propose herein a blind
deconvolution method able to estimate both the blood component and the PSF from
Doppler data. Numerical experiments conducted on simulated and in vivo data
demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in comparison with the previous method based on experimentally
measured PSF and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

the dispersion relation by perturbing the fluid variables around their

dispersion relation yields the well-known propagating modes: the Alfv\'en and
the magneto-sonic modes.In the presence of bulk viscous pressure, the causality
bound is found to be independent of the magnitude of the magnetic field. The
same bound also remains true, when we take the full non-linear form of the
equation using the method of characteristics. In the presence of shear viscous
pressure, the causality bound is independent of the magnitude of the magnetic
field for the two magneto-sonic modes. The causality bound for the
shear-Alfv\'en modes, however, depends both on the magnitude and the direction
of the propagation. For modified IS theory in the presence of shear viscosity,
new non-hydrodynamic modes emerge but the asymptotic causality condition is the

of various surfactants. We interpret our results within a recent theoretical
framework that models the rheological effects of stress-dependent constraints
on inter-particle motion. Bare calcite particle suspensions are found to have
finite yield stresses. In these suspensions, frictional contacts that constrain
inter-particle sliding form at an infinitesimal applied stress and remain
thereafter, while adhesive bonds that constrain inter-particle rotation are
broken as the applied stress increases. Adding surfactants reduces the yield
stress of such suspensions. We show that, contrary to the case of surfactant
added to colloidal suspensions, this effect in non-Brownian suspensions is
attributable to the emergence of a finite onset stress for the formation of
frictional contacts. Our data suggest that the magnitude of this onset stress
is set by the strength of surfactant adsorption to the particle surfaces, which
therefore constitutes a new design principle for using surfactants to tune the
rheology of formulations consisting of suspensions of adhesive non-Brownian

algorithm in $O(\rho(m+\mathcal{T}))$ time, where $\rho$, $m$, and
$\mathcal{T}$ are respectively the arboricity, the number of edges, and the
number of triangles in $G$. To improve the efficiency, we design an elegant and

further optimize the structure of TSD-index into a highly compressed GCT-index.
Our GCT-index-based structural diversity search utilizes the global triangle

vertex-weights we obtain results for the maximal degree that are similar to
those observed for RRTs and DAGs. If the vertex-weights have unbounded support,
then the maximal degree has to satisfy the right balance between having a high
vertex-weight and being born early. For vertex-weights in the Frechet maximum
domain of attraction the first order behaviour of the maximal degree is random,
while for those in the Gumbel maximum domain of attraction the leading order is
deterministic. Surprisingly, in the latter case, the second order is random

their impression, without having to memorize all the details of what they have

achieve this, we propose a simple but powerful framework to establish an
{\emph{Impression Space}} upon an off-the-shelf pretrained network. This
network is referred to as the {\emph{Template Network}} because its filters
will be used as templates to reconstruct images from the impression. In our
framework, the impression space and image space are bridged by a layer-wise
encoding and iterative decoding process. It turns out that the impression space
indeed captures the salient features from images, and it can be directly
applied to tasks such as unpaired image translation and image synthesis through
impression matching without further network training. Furthermore, the
impression naturally constructs a high-level common space for different data.
Based on this, we propose a mechanism to model the data relations inside the
impression space, which is able to reveal the feature similarity between
images. Our code will be released.

enrichment and the presence of circumstellar dust, and the only correlation
that could be found between Li enrichment and rapid rotation is that the most
Li-enriched K giants appear to be fast-rotating stars. However, among the dusty

Typically, such segmentation tasks require significant effort to manually
generate accurate pixel-wise annotations for fully supervised training. To
alleviate such tedious and manual effort, in this paper we propose a novel
weakly supervised segmentation framework based on partial points annotation,
i.e., only a small portion of nuclei locations in each image are labeled. The
framework consists of two learning stages. In the first stage, we design a
semi-supervised strategy to learn a detection model from partially labeled
nuclei locations. Specifically, an extended Gaussian mask is designed to train
an initial model with partially labeled data. Then, selftraining with
background propagation is proposed to make use of the unlabeled regions to
boost nuclei detection and suppress false positives. In the second stage, a
segmentation model is trained from the detected nuclei locations in a
weakly-supervised fashion. Two types of coarse labels with complementary
information are derived from the detected points and are then utilized to train
a deep neural network. The fully-connected conditional random field loss is
utilized in training to further refine the model without introducing extra
computational complexity during inference. The proposed method is extensively
evaluated on two nuclei segmentation datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive performance compared to the
fully supervised counterpart and the state-of-the-art methods while requiring
significantly less annotation effort.

Several IoT satellite applications for tracking ships and cargo can be seen as
exemplary cases of intermittent transmission of updates whose main performance
parameter is the information freshness. This paper analyzes the Age of
Information (AoI) of a satellite network with multiple sources and destinations
that are very distant and therefore require several consecutive multi-hop
transmissions. A packet erasure channel and different queueing policies are
considered. We provide closed-form bounds and tight approximations of the
average AoI, as well as an upper bound of the Peak Age of Information (PAoI)
distribution as a worst-case metric for the system design. The performance
evaluation reveals complex trade-offs among age, load, and packet losses. The
optimal operational point is found when the combination of arrival rates and
packet losses is such that the system load can ensure fresh information at the
receiver; nevertheless, achieving this is highly dependent on the mesh
topology. Moreover, the potential of an age-aware scheduling strategy is
investigated and the fairness among users discussed. The results show the need
to identify the bottleneck nodes for the age, as improving the rate and
reliability of those critical links will highly impact on the overall
performance. The model is general enough to represent other multi-hop mesh
networks.

4-orientable manifolds with an odd Euler characteristic is an open question.
This paper discusses the question of finding candidates for such a manifold

three exceptional symmetric spaces known as Rosenfeld planes, which have odd
Euler characteristic and are of dimension 32, 64 and 128. We perform

the first two of these manifolds with the use computer calculations. The first
Rosenfeld plane, $(\mathbb{O} \otimes \mathbb{C})\mathbb{P}^{2}$, is
2-orientable but not 3-orientable and thus not an example of
$\mathfrak{X}^{32}$. We show that the second Rosenfeld plane $(\mathbb{O}
\otimes \mathbb{H})\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is 3-orientable and we present a condition
under which is may be 4-orientable if the action of the Steenrod algebra is
established further, and therefore it remains a potential candidate for
$\mathfrak{X}^{64}$. No other clear candidate manifolds for

experiments. We assume a general two-field inflation model with five free
parameters, leading to one isocurvature mode (which can be CDM density,
neutrino density or neutrino velocity) arbitrarily correlated with the
adiabatic mode. We theoretically assess in which cases (of detecting and/or
fixing parameters) improvements can be expected, to guide our subsequent
numerical analyses. We find that for Planck, which detected neither
isocurvature modes nor primordial non-Gaussianity, the joint analysis does not
improve the constraints in the general case. However, if we fix additional
parameters in the model, the improvements can be highly significant depending
on the chosen parameter values. For LiteBIRD+CMB-S4 we study in which regions
of parameter space compatible with the Planck results the joint analysis will
improve the constraints or the significance of a detection. We find that, while
for CDM isocurvature this region is very small, for the neutrino isocurvature
modes it is much larger. In particular for neutrino velocity it can be about
half of the Planck-allowed region, where the joint analysis reduces the
isocurvature error bars by up to 70%. In addition the joint analysis can also
improve the error bars of some of the standard cosmological parameters, by up
to 30% for $\theta_{MC}$ for example, by breaking the degeneracies with the
correlation parameter between adiabatic and isocurvature modes.

contracting problem introduced by Sannikov, in the extended context allowing
for possibly different discount rates for both parties. The agent's problem is
to seek for optimal effort, given the compensation scheme proposed by the
principal over a random horizon. Then, given the optimal agent's response, the
principal determines the best compensation scheme in terms of running payment,
retirement, and lump-sum payment at retirement. A Golden Parachute is a
situation where the agent ceases any effort at some positive stopping time, and
receives a payment afterwards, possibly under the form of a lump sum payment,
or of a continuous stream of payments. We show that a Golden Parachute only
exists in certain specific circumstances. This is in contrast with the results
claimed by Sannikov, where the only requirement is a positive agent's marginal
cost of effort at zero. Namely, we show that there is no Golden Parachute if
this parameter is too large. Similarly, in the context of a concave marginal
utility, there is no Golden Parachute if the agent's utility function has a too
negative curvature at zero. In the general case, we prove that an agent with
positive reservation utility is either never retired by the principal, or
retired above some given threshold (as in Sannikov's solution). We show that
different discount factors induce a face-lifted utility function, which allows
to reduce the analysis to a setting similar to the equal discount rates one.
Finally, we also confirm that an agent with small reservation utility may have
an informational rent, meaning that the principal optimally offers him a
contract with strictly higher utility than his participation value.

magnetic fields of astrophysical objects. Although many systematic studies of
parameters have already been made to determine the different dynamical regimes
explored by direct numerical geodynamo simulations, it is only recently that
the regime corresponding to the outer core of the Earth characterized by a
balance of forces between the Coriolis and Lorentz forces is accessible
numerically. In most previous studies, the Lorentz force played a relatively
minor role. For example, they have shown that a purely hydrodynamic parameter
(the local Rossby number $Ro_\ell$ determines the stability domain of dynamos
dominated by the axial dipole (dipolar dynamos).
  In this study, we show that this result cannot hold when the Lorentz force
becomes dominant. We model turbulent geodynamo simulations with a strong
Lorentz force by varying the important parameters over several orders of
magnitude. This method enables us to question previous results and to argue on
the applications of numerical dynamos in order to better understand the
geodynamo problem. Strong dipolar fields considerably affect the kinetic energy
distribution of convective motions which enables the maintenance of this field
configuration. The relative importance of each force depends on the spatial
length scale, whereas $Ro_\ell$ is a global output parameter which ignores the
spatial dependency. We show that inertia does not induce a dipole collapse as
long as the Lorentz and the Coriolis forces remain dominant at large length
scales.

models. With the increased interest in graph based machine learning techniques,
there have been investigations which suggest that these models are also

degrade the performance of graph based learning algorithms severely. This is
due to the fact that the prediction capability of these algorithms relies
mostly on the similarity structure imposed by the graph connectivity.
Therefore, detecting the location of the corruption and correcting the induced

detection problem, however these methods do not address the effect of the
attack on the downstream learning task. In this work, we propose an algorithm
that uses node copying to mitigate the degradation in classification that is

safety issues to consider (for example, a safety failure can lead to a safety
failure). Before they are deployed, these systems of have to show evidence that
they adhere to a set of regulator-defined rules for safety and security. Formal
methods provide robust approaches to proving a system obeys given rules, but
formalising (usually natural language) rules can prove difficult. Regulations
specifically for autonomous systems are still being developed, but the safety
rules for a human operator are a good starting point when trying to show that
an autonomous system is safe. For applications of autonomous systems like
driverless cars and pilotless aircraft, there are clear rules for human
operators, which have been formalised and used to prove that an autonomous
system obeys some or all of these rules. However, in the space and nuclear
sectors applications are more likely to differ, so a set of general safety
principles has developed. This allows novel applications to be assessed for
their safety, but are difficult to formalise. To improve this situation, we are
collaborating with regulators and the community in the space and nuclear
sectors to develop guidelines for autonomous and robotic systems that are
amenable to robust (formal) verification. These activities also have the
benefit of bridging the gaps in knowledge within both the space or nuclear

fluid density in a pore using DFT without calculating the free energy variation
- Variation Free Density Functional Theory (VF-DFT). This technique is
applicable to explore fluids with complex interactions and speed up
calculations for simple fluids. In VF-DFT the fluid density is represented as a
decomposition over a limited set of basis functions and decomposition
coefficients. To construct basis functions, we applied principal component
analysis (PCA). PCA is used to extract the main patterns of the fluid densities
in the nanopore. Decomposition coefficients are sought with stochastic
gradient-free optimization methods, such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle
swarm optimization (PSO) to minimize the free energy of the system. We also
suggest the Hybrid Density Functional Theory (H-DFT) approach based on
stochastic optimization methods and the classical Piccard iteration method to
find the equilibrium fluid density in the pore. Combining these methods helps
to significantly speed up the calculations of equilibrium density in the system
without losing quality. We considered two fluids: nitrogen at the temperature
of T=77.4 K and argon 87.3 K, at the pore 3.6 nm. VF-DFT, H-DFT with different
optimization algorithms were compared with each other and with classical
Piccard iteration technique. Furthermore, the problem of calculation pore size

regularization method was applied to reconstruct of PSD from experimental data

limited astrophysical value: we therefore embarked, since 2009, on a long-term
project to uncover the optical properties of sources identified by Swift by
using a large suite of ground-based telescopes and instruments. In this work,
we continue our programme of characterization of unidentified or poorly studied
hard X-ray sources by presenting the results of an optical spectroscopic
campaign aimed at pinpointing and classifying the optical counterparts of 35

absorption lines) of the observed objects, and determined their nature. We
identify and characterize a total of 41 optical candidate counterparts

uncertainties, multiple lower energy counterparts can sometimes be associated
with higher energy detections. We discuss which ones are the actual (or at

particular, 31 sources in our sample are active galactic nuclei: 16 are
classified as Type 1 (with broad and narrow emission lines) and 13 are

time-varying reproductive number (Rt) curves to investigate the relationship
between Rt, individual mobility as measured by Google Community Mobility
Reports, and NPI.
  Results: We found a strong relationship between reproductive number and
mobility, with each 10% drop in mobility being associated with an expected
10.2% reduction in Rt compared to baseline. The effects of limitations on the
size of gatherings, school and business closures, and stay-at-home orders were
dominated by the trend over time, which was associated with a 48% decrease in
