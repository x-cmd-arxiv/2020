Instead of asking the agents to report their complete preferences, our goal is
to learn a desirable matching from partial preferences, specifically a matching

a microwave cavity mode couples to a magnon mode (spin wave) via the magnetic

of the ferromagnetic sphere via a nonlinear magnetostrictive interaction. We
show that by directly driving the magnon mode with a red-detuned microwave

cavity-magnon-phonon state-swap interaction can be realized. Therefore, if the
two cavities are further driven by a two-mode squeezed vacuum field, the
quantum correlation of the driving fields is successively transferred to the
two magnon modes and subsequently to the two phonon modes, i.e., the two

treated as such. Instead, we use a more sophisticated discriminator that
returns a label pyramid describing what portions of the road network are

Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions from a given dataset is promising to
promote AI democratization; however, the amount of time that is required by
current co-search frameworks is in the order of hundreds of GPU hours for one
target hardware. This inhibits the use of such frameworks on commodity
hardware. The root cause of the low efficiency in existing co-search frameworks
is the fact that they start from a ""cold"" state (i.e., search from scratch). In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely HotNAS, that starts from a
""hot"" state based on a set of existing pre-trained models (a.k.a. model zoo) to
avoid lengthy training time. As such, the search time can be reduced from 200
GPU hours to less than 3 GPU hours. In HotNAS, in addition to hardware design
space and neural architecture search space, we further integrate a compression
space to conduct model compressing during the co-search, which creates new
opportunities to reduce latency but also brings challenges. One of the key
challenges is that all of the above search spaces are coupled with each other,
e.g., compression may not work without hardware design support. To tackle this
issue, HotNAS builds a chain of tools to design hardware to support
compression, based on which a global optimizer is developed to automatically
co-search all the involved search spaces. Experiments on ImageNet dataset and
Xilinx FPGA show that, within the timing constraint of 5ms, neural
architectures generated by HotNAS can achieve up to 5.79% Top-1 and 3.97% Top-5

$N$-body models, we show that the face-on morphology of the so-called `face-on
peanut' bars (boxy bars) and barlenses is supported by different types of
orbits. For `face-on peanut' bars, the so-called boxy orbits come to the fore,
and they are responsible for the unusual morphology of the bar in the central
regions. In the models with compact bulges, the bars show a barlens morphology
in their central parts. We found that the barlens supporting orbits come in two
types, one of which gives a square-like shape and the other have a rosette-like
shape in the frame co-rotating with the bar. Such a shape is typical for orbits
around stable loop orbits in nearly axisymmetric potentials only slightly
distorted by the bar. They were already known from some of the previous studies
but their role in barlens shaping was barely investigated. Although quite
simple, the rosette-like orbits are found to be the main building block of a
barlens in our models. The detailed analysis of all bar orbits also allowed us
to distinguish the x2 orbital family and isolate the structure supported by
orbits trapped around this family. The x2 family is well-known, but,
apparently, for the first time in $N$-body models we have revealed the
structure it supports by means of spectral dynamics and highlight its
contribution to the barlens. We found that the x2 family population increases
with an increase in central matter concentration.

The problem is decidable and it was recently proved that the dimension of the

dimensions larger than two, the complexity is not known (with huge complexity
gaps). In dimension two, the reachability problem was shown to be
PSPACE-complete by Blondin et al. in 2015. We consider an extension of this
model, called 2-TVASS, where the first counter can be tested for zero. This
model naturally extends the classical model of one counter automata (OCA). We

a long-standing puzzle. Measurements from neutrino-nucleus deep inelastic
scattering (DIS) experiments suggest the strange quark is suppressed compared
to the light sea quarks, while recent studies of W/Z boson production at the
LHC imply a larger strange component at small x values. As the parton flavor
determination in the proton depends on nuclear corrections, e.g. from
heavy-target DIS, LHC heavy ion measurements can provide a distinct perspective
to help clarify this situation. In this investigation we extend the nCTEQ15
nPDFs to study the impact of the LHC proton-lead W/Z production data on both
the flavor differentiation and nuclear corrections. This complementary data set
provides new insights on both the LHC W/Z proton analyses and the
neutrino-nucleus DIS data. We identify these new nPDFs as nCTEQ15WZ. Our
calculations are performed using a new implementation of the nCTEQ code
(nCTEQ++) based on C++ which enables us to easily interface to external
programs such as HOPPET, APPLgrid and MCFM. Our results indicate that, as
suggested by the proton data, the small x nuclear strange sea appears larger
than previously expected, even when the normalization of the W/Z data is
accommodated in the fit. Extending the nCTEQ15 analysis to include LHC W/Z data
represents an important step as we advance toward the next generation of nPDFs.

numerical optimal control, we find the optimal coupling which minimizes the
two-photon occupation of one mode, which is actually transferred to the other,
while maintains a non-zero one-photon occupation in the same mode. Moreover, we
choose the continuous coupling to vanish after the transfer between the modes
such that they are decoupled and one of them is left only with some one-photon
population which can be observed upon its decay. We numerically find lower
values of the second-order correlation function obtained at earlier times than
with constant coupling, with larger one-photon populations and for longer time
windows, corresponding thus to higher emission efficiency and easier detection.
The presented methodology is not restricted to the system under study, but it

driving fields which can improve the single-photon emission statistics from

hyperbolic partial differential equations. However, if the fluid is to be the
large-scale description of a short-range many-body system, further constraints
arise on the structure of these equations. Here we derive one such constraint,
pertaining to the free energy fluxes. The free energy fluxes generate
expectation values of currents, akin to the specific free energy generating
conserved densities. They fix the equations of state and the Euler-scale
hydrodynamics, and are simply related to the entropy currents. Using the
Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relations associated to many conserved quantities, in
quantum and classical systems, we show that the associated free energy fluxes
are perpendicular to the vector of inverse temperatures characterising the
state. This implies that all entropy currents can be expressed as averages of
local observables. In few-component fluids, it implies that the averages of
currents follow from the specific free energy alone, without the use of
Galilean or relativistic invariance. In integrable models, in implies that the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz must satisfy a unitarity condition. The relation
also guarantees physical consistency of the Euler hydrodynamics in
spatially-inhomogeneous, macroscopic external fields, as it implies
conservation of entropy, and the local-density approximated Gibbs form of
stationarity states. The main result on free energy fluxes is based on general
properties such as clustering, and we show that it is mathematically rigorous

tuning a simulator's parameters so that its outputs match data is challenging.
Simulation-based inference (SBI) seeks to identify parameter sets that a) are

Importantly, SBI does not seek to recover a single 'best' data-compatible
parameter set, but rather to identify all high probability regions of parameter

uncertainty. In Bayesian terminology, SBI aims to retrieve the posterior
distribution over the parameters of interest. In contrast to conventional
Bayesian inference, SBI is also applicable when one can run model simulations,

ingredients of success of the similarity function is translation equivariance.
Non-translation-equivariant architectures induce a positional bias during
training, so the location of the target will be hard to recover from the
feature space. In real life scenarios, objects undergoe various transformations
other than translation, such as rotation or scaling. Unless the model has an
internal mechanism to handle them, the similarity may degrade. In this paper,
we focus on scaling and we aim to equip the Siamese network with additional
built-in scale equivariance to capture the natural variations of the target a
priori. We develop the theory for scale-equivariant Siamese trackers, and
provide a simple recipe for how to make a wide range of existing trackers
scale-equivariant. We present SE-SiamFC, a scale-equivariant variant of SiamFC

relaxed matching for $\alpha = O(1)$ was a major step in obtaining a constant

convergence speed of average consensus under wireless broadcast communication.
This yields a unified framework for studying joint optimization of control and
network parameters for consensus subject to message losses in wireless
communications. Exemplary we show in this work how far outage correlation in
wireless broadcast communication positively affects convergence speed of
average consensus compared to consensus in the uncorrelated case.

master equation to describe the steady-state time-averaged properties of a
driven two-level system, an electron coherently tunneling between double
quantum dots (DQDs), interacting with a bosonic phonon bath. Comparing the
results obtained using these two master equations with those from a recent DQD
experiment and its corresponding weak-coupling theoretical method, we find that
the original parameter set used in the experiment and theoretical method is not
in the weak-coupling parameter regime. By using the full-polaron master
equation with a slight adjustment on only the value of the interdot separation
in the original experimental parameter set, we find that a reasonable fit to
the experimentally measured time-averaged steady-state population data can be
achieved. The adjusted interdot separation is within the possible values
allowed by the geometry of the surface gates that define the DQD in the
experiment. Our full-polaron equation approach does not require the special
renormalization scheme employed in their weak-coupling theoretical method, and
can still describe the experimental results of driving-induced phonon-enhanced
steplike shoulder behaviors in the experiment. This demonstrates that the
full-polaron master equation approach is a correct and efficient tool to
describe the steady-state properties of a driven spin-boson model in the case
of strong system-environment coupling.

observed in the optical with the GMOS-IFU, showing an outflow, and with the
HST/ACS, revealing two extended structures with similar orientation, suggesting
the presence of a collimating and/or obscuring structure. In order to ascertain
this hypothesis, adaptive optics assisted NIR integral field spectroscopic
observations were obtained with the NIFS spectrograph in the Gemini North
telescope. We detected a compact structure of H$_2$ molecular gas, interpreted
as a nearly edge-on disc with diameter of $\sim$47 pc, PA=124$\deg$ and
velocity range from -40 to +40 km s$^{-1}$. This disc is misaligned by 32$\deg$
with respect to the radio jet and the ionization cones seen in the optical.
There are two regions of turbulent gas, with position angles similar to the
jet/cones, seen both in molecular and ionized phases; these regions are
connected to the edges of the molecular disc and coincide with a high ratio of
[N II]/H$\alpha$=5, suggesting that these regions are shock excited, partially
ionized or both. We explain these structures as a consequence of a ""digging
process"" that the jet inflicts on the disc, ejecting the molecular gas towards
the ionization cones. The dynamical mass within 17 pc is estimated as
$6.3\times10^{6}$$M_{\odot}$. This is an interesting case of an object

makes available, for every produced joint, on-line RSW process parameters, such
as, in particular, the so-called dynamic resistance curve (DRC), which is
recognized as the full technological signature of the spot welds. Motivated by
this context, the present paper means to show the potentiality and the
practical applicability to clustering methods of the functional data approach
that avoids the need for arbitrary and often controversial feature extraction
to find out homogeneous groups of DRCs, which likely pertain to spot welds
sharing common mechanical and metallurgical properties. We intend is to provide
an essential hands-on overview of the most promising functional clustering

of an indivisible mixed manna: Divide m indivisible items among n agents under
the fairness notion of maximin share (MMS) and the efficiency notion of Pareto
optimality (PO). A mixed manna allows an item to be a good for some agents and
a chore for others. The problem of finding $\alpha$-MMS allocation for the
(near) best $\alpha\in(0,1]$ for which it exists, remains unresolved even for a
goods manna with constantly many agents, while the problem of finding
$\alpha$-MMS+PO allocation is unexplored for any $\alpha\in(0,1]$.
  We make significant progress on the above questions for a mixed manna. First,
we show that for any $\alpha>0$, an $\alpha$-MMS allocation may not always
exist, thus ruling out solving the problem for a fixed $\alpha$. Second,
towards computing $\alpha$-MMS+PO allocation for the best possible $\alpha$, we
obtain a dichotomous result: We derive two conditions and show that the problem
is tractable under these two conditions, while dropping either renders the
problem intractable. The two conditions are: (i) number of agents is a
constant, and (ii) for every agent, her absolute value for all the items is at
least a constant factor of her total (absolute) value for all the goods or all
the chores.
  In particular, first, for instances satisfying (i) and (ii) we design a PTAS
- an efficient algorithm to find an $(\alpha-\epsilon)$-MMS and $\gamma$-PO
allocation when given $\epsilon,\gamma>0$, for the highest possible
$\alpha\in(0,1]$. Second, we show that if either condition is not satisfied
then finding an $\alpha$-MMS allocation for any $\alpha\in(0,1]$ is NP-hard,
even when a solution exists for $\alpha=1$. To the best of our knowledge, ours
is the first algorithm that ensures both approximate MMS and PO guarantees.

influence of the effective temperature of the environment. Interestingly, we
find that both sudden death and sudden birth of entanglement may occur in such
a simple system. We also discuss a different partition, in which the isolated
qubit is considered to be coupled to a composite environment, constituted by
the other qubit plus the field mode.

suggested as a more physically motivated (and generally larger) halo boundary,
adding to the range of definitions. It is often difficult to assess the impact
of a particular choice because most halo catalogs contain only one or a few
definitions and generally only one set of host-subhalo relations. To alleviate
this issue, we present halo catalogs and merger trees for 14 N-body simulations
of LambdaCDM and self-similar universes. Based on ROCKSTAR catalogs, we compute
additional halo properties using the SPARTA code and recombine them with the
original catalogs. The new catalogs contain numerous variants of spherical

Galactic open cluster. We use medium-resolution, 19 200 <= R <= 21 500, optical
spectra of the stars in the open cluster NGC 2420 obtained within the Gaia-ESO
survey. The sample covers all evolutionary stages from the main-sequence to red
giant branch. Stellar parameters are derived using a combined Bayesian analysis
of spectra, 2MASS photometry, and astrometric data from Gaia DR2. The
abundances of Mg, Ca, Fe, and Li are determined from non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (NLTE) synthetic spectra, computed using one-dimensional (1D) and
averaged three-dimensional (3D) model atmospheres. We compare our results with
a grid of Code d'Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire (CESTAM) stellar

mixing. We find prominent evolutionary trends in the abundances of Fe, Ca, Mg,

depletion at the cluster turn-off, but the abundances gradually increase and
flatten near the base of the RGB. The abundance trend for Li displays a
signature of rotational mixing on the main-sequence and abrupt depletion on the
subgiant branch, which is caused by advection of Li-poor material to the

construct approximate codes which are covariant with respect to the entire

We show that our codes are capable of efficiently correcting different types of
erasure errors. When only a small fraction of the $n$ qudits upon which the
code is built are erased, our covariant code has an error that scales as
$1/n^2$, which is reminiscent of the Heisenberg limit of quantum metrology.
When every qudit has a chance of being erased, our covariant code has an error
that scales as $1/n$. We show that the error scaling is optimal in both cases.
Our approach has implications for fault-tolerant quantum computing, reference
frame error correction, and the AdS-CFT duality.

than the Sun. Their existence was first inferred from the detection of variable
absorption features in stellar spectra in the late 1980s using spectroscopy.
More recently, they have been detected through photometric transits from space,
and through far-IR/mm gas emission within debris disks. As (exo)comets are
considered to contain the most pristine material accessible in stellar systems,
they hold the potential to give us information about early stage formation and
evolution conditions of extra Solar Systems. In the Solar System, comets carry
the physical and chemical memory of the protoplanetary disk environment where
they formed, providing relevant information on processes in the primordial
solar nebula. The aim of this paper is to compare essential compositional
properties between Solar System comets and exocomets. The paper aims to
highlight commonalities and to discuss differences which may aid the
communication between the involved research communities and perhaps also avoid
misconceptions. Exocomets likely vary in their composition depending on their
formation environment like Solar System comets do, and since exocomets are not
resolved spatially, they pose a challenge when comparing them to high fidelity
observations of Solar System comets. Observations of gas around main sequence
stars, spectroscopic observations of ""polluted"" white dwarf atmospheres and
spectroscopic observations of transiting exocomets suggest that exocomets may
show compositional similarities with Solar System comets. The recent
interstellar visitor 2I/Borisov showed gas, dust and nuclear properties similar
to that of Solar System comets. This raises the tantalising prospect that
observations of interstellar comets may help bridge the fields of exocomet and
Solar System comets.

resolvable, the component spins have proven difficult to measure. This
limitation stems in great part from our choice to inquire about the spins of
the most and least massive objects in each binary, a question that becomes
ill-defined when the masses are equal. In this paper we show that one can ask a
different question of the data: what are the spins of the objects with the
highest and lowest dimensionless spins in the binary? We show that this can
significantly improve estimates of the individual spins, especially for binary
systems with comparable masses. When applying this parameterization to the
first 13 gravitational-wave events detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration

the distribution of spin magnitude for the highest-spinning object has
negligible support at zero spin. Regardless of the parameterization used, the

Entanglement in both nuclei is found to be more localized within NAT and VNAT

anticipated, a core-valence (tensor product) structure emerges from the full
six-body calculation of $^{6}$He. The two-nucleon mutual information shows that
the VNAT basis, which typically exhibits good convergence properties,
effectively decouples the active and inactive spaces. We conclude that measures

higher N/O ratios. The true composite regions stand separately from both

of object poses, appearances, their interactions with the context, etc. On the
other hand, we propose a novel learning method motivated by two parallel lines
of work that explore unlabeled data for image classification: self-training and
self-supervised learning. They fail to improve object detectors in their
vanilla forms due to the domain gap between the Web images and curated
datasets. To tackle this challenge, we propose a selective net to rectify the
supervision signals in Web images. It not only identifies positive bounding
boxes but also creates a safe zone for mining hard negative boxes. We report

the combination of threshold and a so-called threshold-improved transverse

formalism allows for a systematic improvement of the transverse momentum
resummation that is valid in the entire range of $p_T$ by the inclusion of the
threshold contribution. We use the Borel method as a suitable prescription for
defining the inverse Mellin and Fourier transforms in the context of combined
resummed expression. The study is applied to two QCD processes, namely the
Higgs boson produced via gluon fusion and $Z$ boson production via the
Drell--Yan mechanism. We compare our results to the standard transverse
momentum resummation, as well as to the fixed-order results. We find that the
threshold-improved transverse momentum resummation leads to faster perturbative
convergence at small $p_T$ while the inclusion of threshold resummation
improves the agreement with fixed-order calculations at medium and large $p_T$.
These effects are more pronounced in the case of Higgs which is known to have
slower perturbative convergence.

intricate metric found by Chng, Mann and Stelea in 2006 indeed solves
Einstein's vacuum field equations of General Relativity. We explicitly
calculate all components of the Weyl tensor and determine its algebraic
structure. As it turns out, it is actually of algebraically general type I with
four distinct principal null directions. It explains why this class of
solutions has not been (and could not be) found within the large
Plebanski-Demianski family of type D spacetimes. Then we transform the solution
into a much more convenient metric form which explicitly depends on three
physical parameters: mass, acceleration, and the NUT parameter. These
parameters can independently be set to zero, recovering thus the well-known
spacetimes in standard coordinates, namely the C-metric, the Taub-NUT metric,
the Schwarzschild metric, and flat Minkowski space. Using this new metric, we
investigate physical and geometrical properties of such accelerating NUT black
holes. In particular, we localize and study four Killing horizons (two
black-hole plus two acceleration) and investigate the curvature. Employing the
scalar invariants we prove that there are no curvature singularities whenever
the NUT parameter is nonzero. We identify asymptotically flat regions and
relate them to conformal infinities. This leads to a complete understanding of
the global structure. The boost-rotation metric form reveals that there is
actually a pair of such black holes. They uniformly accelerate in opposite
directions due to the action of rotating cosmic strings or struts located along
the corresponding two axes. Rotation of these sources is directly related to
the NUT parameter. In their vicinity there are pathological regions with closed

collection of hyperedges $E$ with arbitrary covering requirements $k_e$, the
goal is to find an ordering of the vertices to minimize the total cover time of
the hyperedges; a hyperedge $e$ is considered covered by the first time when
$k_e$ many of its vertices appear in the ordering. We give a $4.642$
approximation algorithm for GMSSC, coming close to the best possible bound of
$4$, already for the classical special case (with all $k_e=1$) of min sum set
cover (MSSC) studied by Feige, Lov\'{a}sz and Tetali, and improving upon the
previous best known bound of $12.4$ due to Im, Sviridenko and van der Zwaan.
Our algorithm is based on transforming the LP solution by a suitable kernel and
applying randomized rounding. This also gives an LP-based $4$ approximation for
MSSC. As part of the analysis of our algorithm, we also derive an inequality on
the lower tail of a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables, which might
be of independent interest and broader utility.
  Another well-known special case is the min sum vertex cover (MSVC) problem,
in which the input hypergraph is a graph and $k_e = 1$, for every edge. We give
a $16/9$ approximation for MSVC, and show a matching integrality gap for the
natural LP relaxation. This improves upon the previous best $1.999946$
approximation of Barenholz, Feige and Peleg. (The claimed $1.79$ approximation
result of Iwata, Tetali and Tripathi for the MSVC turned out have an
unfortunate, seemingly unfixable, mistake in it.) Finally, we revisit MSSC and
consider the $\ell_p$ norm of cover-time of the hyperedges. Using a dual
fitting argument, we show that the natural greedy algorithm achieves tight, up
to NP-hardness, approximation guarantees of $(p+1)^{1+1/p}$, for all $p\ge 1$.
For $p=1$, this gives yet another proof of the $4$ approximation for MSSC.

S^5$, which we call `the large $p$ limit'. It consists of studying four-point
correlators of single-particle operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM at large $N$
and large 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$, by looking at the regime in which the
dual KK modes become short massive strings. In this regime the charge of the
single-particle operators is order $\lambda^{1/4}$ and the dual KK modes are in
between fields and strings. Starting from SUGRA we compute the large $p$ limit
of the correlators by introducing an improved $AdS_5\times S^5$ Mellin space
amplitude, and we show that the correlator is dominated by a saddle point. Our
results are consistent with the picture of four geodesics shooting from the
boundary of $AdS_5\times S^5$ towards a common bulk point, where they scatter
as if they were in flat space. The Mandelstam invariants are put in
correspondence with the Mellin variables and in turn with certain combinations
of cross ratios. At the saddle point the dynamics of the correlator is directly
related to the bulk Mellin amplitude, which in the process of taking large $p$
becomes the flat space ten-dimensional S-matrix. We thus learn how to embed the
full type IIB S-matrix in the $AdS_5\times S^5$ Mellin amplitude, and how to
stratify the latter in a large $p$ expansion. We compute the large $p$ limit of
all genus zero data currently available, pointing out additional hidden
simplicity of known results. We then show that the genus zero resummation at
large $p$ naturally leads to the Gross-Mende phase for the minimal area surface
around the bulk point. At one-loop, we first uncover a novel and finite Mellin
amplitude, and then we show that the large $p$ limit beautifully asymptotes the
gravitational S-matrix.

two groups are decoded using successive interference cancellation while within
the group users are decoded using the message passing algorithm. To further
improve the performance of the system, a spectral-efficiency maximization

non-convex and has sparsity constraints. The alternating optimization procedure

of RGB-D images for providing a geometric counterpart to the RGB
representation. Most existing works simply assume that depth measurements are
accurate and well-aligned with the RGB pixels and models the problem as a
cross-modal feature fusion to obtain better feature representations to achieve
more accurate segmentation. This, however, may not lead to satisfactory results
as actual depth data are generally noisy, which might worsen the accuracy as
the networks go deeper.
  In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient Cross-modality Guided
Encoder to not only effectively recalibrate RGB feature responses, but also to
distill accurate depth information via multiple stages and aggregate the two
recalibrated representations alternatively. The key of the proposed
architecture is a novel Separation-and-Aggregation Gating operation that
jointly filters and recalibrates both representations before cross-modality
aggregation. Meanwhile, a Bi-direction Multi-step Propagation strategy is
introduced, on the one hand, to help to propagate and fuse information between
the two modalities, and on the other hand, to preserve their specificity along

nearly-transform-limited pulses with peak power up to 1 kW are obtained.
Finally, we demonstrate the generation of pulses with controllable frequency
chirp, pulses with variable width, and double pulses. This amplifier is thus
suitable for coherent control of narrow atomic resonances and especially for

attributes of products, such that the total profit or revenue or market share
is maximized. Usually, these attributes can affect both a product's market
share (probability to be chosen) and its profit margin. For example, if a smart
phone has a better battery, then it is more costly to be produced, but is more
likely to be purchased by a customer. The decision maker then needs to choose
an optimal vector of attributes for each product that balances this trade-off.
In spite of the importance of such problems, there is not yet a method to solve
it efficiently in general. Past literature in revenue management and discrete
choice models focus on pricing problems, where price is the only attribute to
be chosen for each product. Existing approaches to solve pricing problems
tractably cannot be generalized to the optimization problem with multiple
product attributes as decision variables. On the other hand, papers studying
product line design with multiple attributes all result in intractable
optimization problems. Then we found a way to reformulate the static
multi-attribute optimization problem, as well as the multi-stage fluid
optimization problem with both resource constraints and upper and lower bounds
of attributes, as a tractable convex conic optimization problem. Our result
applies to optimization problems under the multinomial logit (MNL) model, the
Markov chain (MC) choice model, and with certain conditions, the nested logit

biological and physical systems, many of which share a common set of
``universal'' properties at the point of synchronization. Common biological
systems of coupled oscillators have been shown to be members of the Ising
universality class, meaning that the very simple Ising model replicates certain
spatial statistics of these systems at stationarity. This observation is useful
because it reveals which aspects of spatial pattern arise independently of the
details governing local dynamics, resulting in both deeper understanding of and
a simpler baseline model for biological synchrony. However, in many situations
a system's dynamics are of greater interest than their static spatial
properties. Here, we ask whether a dynamical Ising model can replicate
universal and non-universal features of ecological systems, using noisy coupled
metapopulation models with two-cycle dynamics as a case study. The standard
Ising model makes unrealistic dynamical predictions, but the Ising model with
memory corrects this by using an additional parameter to reflect the tendency
for local dynamics to maintain their phase of oscillation. By fitting the two
parameters of the Ising model with memory to simulated ecological dynamics, we
assess the correspondence between the Ising and ecological models in several of
their features (location of the critical boundary in parameter space between
synchronous and asynchronous dynamics, probability of local phase changes, and
ability to predict future dynamics). We find that the Ising model with memory
is reasonably good at representing these properties of ecological
metapopulations. The correspondence between these models creates the potential
for the simple and well-known Ising class of models to become a valuable tool

particles, ultra light scalars minimally coupled to gravity and heavier
fermions, from inflation to radiation domination (RD). Initial conditions
correspond to dark matter fields in their Bunch-Davies vacua during inflation.
The ""out"" states are correlated particle-antiparticle pairs, and the
distribution function is found in both cases. In the adiabatic regime the
density matrix features rapid decoherence by dephasing from interference
effects in the basis of ""out"" particle states, effectively reducing it to a
diagonal form with a concomitant von Neumann entropy. We show that it is
exactly the entanglement entropy obtained by tracing over one member of the
correlated pairs. Remarkably, for both statistics the entanglement entropy is
similar to the quantum kinetic entropy in terms of the distribution function
with noteworthy differences stemming from pair correlations. The entropy and
the kinetic fluid form of the energy momentum tensor all originate from
decoherence of the density matrix. For ultra light scalar dark matter, the
distribution function peaks at low momentum $\propto 1/k^3$ and the specific
entropy is $\ll 1$. This is a hallmark of a \emph{condensed phase} but with
vanishing field expectation value. For fermionic dark matter the distribution
function is nearly thermal and the specific entropy is $\mathcal{O}(1)$ typical
of a thermal species. We argue that the functional form of the entanglement
entropy is quite general and applies to alternative production mechanisms such
as parametric amplification during reheating.

distributed age-aware modification of slotted ALOHA proposed in recent
literature. In threshold-ALOHA, each terminal suspends its transmissions until
the Age of Information (AoI) of the status update flow it is sending reaches a
certain threshold $\Gamma$. Once the age exceeds $\Gamma$, the terminal
attempts transmission with constant probability $\tau$ in each slot, as in
standard slotted ALOHA. We analyze the time-average expected AoI attained by
this policy, and explore its scaling with network size, $n$. We derive the
probability distribution of the number of active users at steady state, and
show that as network size increases the policy converges to one that runs
slotted ALOHA with fewer sources: on average about one fifth of the users is
active at any time. We obtain an expression for steady-state expected AoI and
use this to optimize the parameters $\Gamma$ and $\tau$, resolving the
conjectures in \cite{doga} by confirming that the optimal age threshold and
transmission probability are $2.2n$ and $4.69/n$, respectively. We find that
the optimal AoI scales with the network size as $1.4169n$, which is almost half
the minimum AoI achievable with slotted ALOHA, while the loss from the maximum
throughput of $e^{-1}$ remains below $1\%$. We compare the performance of this

\in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to decide if the size
of the minimum cut in the graph is $t$ or $t-2$. Also, we show that, for any $t
\in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to find all the minimum
cut edges even if it is promised that the input graph has a minimum cut of size
$t$. Both of our lower bound results are randomized, and hold even if we can
make {\sc Random Edge} query apart from local queries.

Domain adaptation methods tackle the issue by aligning the source domain and

structure in the target domain. To fully exploit the supervision in the source
domain, we propose a fine-grained adversarial learning strategy for class-level

traditional binary domain labels are also generalized to domain encodings as
the supervision signal to guide the fine-grained feature alignment. An analysis

beating and refractory. We focus on investigating the expectation and variance
of (synchronized) beating interval. In particular, for the single-isolated
cell, we obtain the closed-form expectation and variance of the beating
interval, and we discover that the coefficient of variance (CV) has upper limit
$\sqrt{2/3}$. For two-coupled cells, we derive the partial differential
equations (PDEs) for the expected synchronized beating intervals and the
distribution density of phase. Moreover, we also consider the conventional
Kuramoto model for both two- and $N$-cells models, where we establish a new
analysis using stochastic calculus to obtain the CV of the ''synchronized''
beating interval, and make some improvement to the literature work.

techniques, nanoscale magnetic ordering in self-assemblies of Fe3O4
nanoparticles is here unveiled via x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS).
Measured throughout the magnetization process, the XRMS signal reveals
size-dependent inter-particle magnetic correlations. Smaller (5 nm) particles
show little magnetic correlation, even when tightly close-packed, yielding to
mostly magnetic disorder in the absence of external field, which is
characteristic of superparamagnetic behavior. In contrast, larger (11 nm)
particles tend to be strongly correlated, yielding a mix of magnetic orders
including ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic orders. These strong magnetic
correlations are present even when the particles are sparsely distributed.

benefits UA and convergence speed by allowing users to train models
personalised to their own data. MTFL is compatible with popular iterative FL

empirically that a distributed form of Adam optimisation (FedAvg-Adam) benefits
convergence speed even further when used as the optimisation strategy within
MTFL. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that MTFL is able to
significantly reduce the number of rounds required to reach a target UA, by up
to $5\times$ when using existing FL optimisation strategies, and with a further
$3\times$ improvement when using FedAvg-Adam. We compare MTFL to competing

stochastic clumps in the wind of the WC star. We find no evidence of
large-scale, periodic variations often associated with Corotating Interaction
Regions that could have explained the observed intrinsic continuum polarization
of this star. Our moderately high-resolution and high signal-to-noise average
Keck spectrum shows narrow double-peak emission profiles in the Halpha, Hbeta,
Hgamma, HeII6678 and HeII5876 lines. These peaks have a stable blue-to-red
intensity ratio with a mean of 0.997 and a root-mean-square of 0.004,
commensurate with the noise level; no variability is found during the entire
observing period. We suggest that these profiles arise in a decretion disk
around the O9 companion, which is thus an O9e star. The characteristics of the
profiles are compatible with those of other Be/Oe stars. The presence of this
disk can explain the constant component of the continuum polarization of this
system, for which the angle is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit,
implying that the rotation axis of the O9e star is aligned with that of the
orbit. It remains to be explained why the disk is so stable within the strong
ultraviolet radiation field of the O star. We present a binary evolutionary
scenario that is compatible with the current stellar and system parameters.

(MIMO-OFDM) is a key technology component in the evolution towards cognitive
radio (CR) in next-generation communication in which the accuracy of timing and
frequency synchronization significantly impacts the overall system performance.
In this paper, we propose a novel scheme leveraging extreme learning machine
(ELM) to achieve high-precision synchronization. Specifically, exploiting the
preamble signals with synchronization offsets, two ELMs are incorporated into a
traditional MIMO-OFDM system to estimate both the residual symbol timing offset
(RSTO) and the residual carrier frequency offset (RCFO). The simulation results
show that the performance of the proposed ELM-based synchronization scheme is
superior to the traditional method under both additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) and frequency selective fading channels. Furthermore, comparing with the
existing machine learning based techniques, the proposed method shows
outstanding performance without the requirement of perfect channel state
information (CSI) and prohibitive computational complexity. Finally, the
proposed method is robust in terms of the choice of channel parameters (e.g.,
number of paths) and also in terms of ""generalization ability"" from a machine
learning standpoint.

  Data","submitted to IEEE",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study presents a flexible approach for bridge modal identification using
smartphone data collected by a large pool of passing vehicles. With each trip
of a mobile sensor, the spatio-temporal response of the bridge is sampled, plus
various sources of noise, e.g., vehicle dynamics, environmental effects, and
road profile. This paper provides further evidence to support the hypothesis
that through trip aggregation, such noise effects can be mitigated and the true
bridge dynamics are exhibited. In this study, the continuous wavelet transform
is applied to each trip, and the results are combined to estimate the
structural modal response of the bridge. The Crowdsourced Modal Identification
using Continuous Wavelets (CMICW) method is presented and validated in an
experimental setting. In summary, the method successfully identifies natural
frequencies and absolute mode shapes of a bridge with high accuracy. Notably,
these results are the first to extract torsional mode shape information from
mobile sensor data. Moreover, the influence of vehicle speed on the estimation
accuracy is investigated. Finally, a hybrid simulation framework is proposed to
account for the vehicle dynamics within the raw mobile sensing data. The
proposed method is successful in removing vehicle dynamic effects and
identifying modal properties. These results contribute to the growing body of
knowledge on the practice of mobile crowdsensing for physical properties of
transportation infrastructure.

photo-realistic images. However, controllable generation with GANs remains a
challenging research problem. Achieving controllable generation requires
semantically interpretable and disentangled factors of variation. It is
challenging to achieve this goal using simple fixed distributions such as
Gaussian distribution. Instead, we propose an unsupervised framework to learn a
distribution of latent codes that control the generator through self-training.
Self-training provides an iterative feedback in the GAN training, from the
discriminator to the generator, and progressively improves the proposal of the
latent codes as training proceeds. The latent codes are sampled from a latent
variable model that is learned in the feature space of the discriminator. We
consider a normalized independent component analysis model and learn its
parameters through tensor factorization of the higher-order moments. Our
framework exhibits better disentanglement compared to other variants such as
the variational autoencoder, and is able to discover semantically meaningful
latent codes without any supervision. We demonstrate empirically on both cars
and faces datasets that each group of elements in the learned code controls a
mode of variation with a semantic meaning, e.g. pose or background change. We
also demonstrate with quantitative metrics that our method generates better
results compared to other approaches.

introduced by Ted Suffridge in 1969. We begin by giving a brief overview of
their extremal properties in classic and more recent work. We also give a
compact form for Suffridge polynomials which matches a general pattern
discovered by Brandt. Our approach allows us to find the coefficients which
Brandt's result was not giving explicitly. This new presentation provides us
the tools to obtain an estimate of the rate of approximation of the generalized
Koebe functions by univalent polynomials. Furthermore, we consider the
presentation of Suffridge polynomials in Robertson's form and find the suiting
Robertson measure. This suggests a new way to approximate step functions by
continuous monotonic ones. We then study the lack of robustness of the
univalency of these polynomials and suggest a new family of polynomials for
which we conjecture the univalency of a subclass. Namely, we prove the quite
surprising fact that by extending the family by letting the discrete argument
in the polynomial coefficients become continuous one does not increase the set
of univalent polynomials. Only the initial polynomials remain univalent. In
this new one parameter family generalizing the Suffridge polynomials, it is
remarkable that the Suffridge polynomials are already extremal as they
correspond to the choice of the parameter set to 1; moreover the complex
Fej\'er polynomials correspond the choice of the parameter set to 0, and the
choice of the parameter set to -1 corresponds the polynomials $z+(z^N/N)$.
Remarkably, computer simulations seem to clearly indicate that the image of the
unit disc under these new polynomial mapping is a simply-connected region
bounded by a simple curve. This justifies the conjectural univalency of these
polynomials for the whole range of the parameters.

optimizing multiple and possibly contradicting constraints. A challenging
extension of this problem occurs when every individual task is a
multi-objective optimization problem by itself. While deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been successfully applied to complex sequential problems,
its application to the MOTS domain has been stymied by two challenges. The
first challenge is the inability of the DRL algorithm to ensure that every item
is processed identically regardless of its position in the queue. The second
challenge is the need to manage large queues, which results in large neural
architectures and long training times. In this study we present MERLIN, a
robust, modular and near-optimal DRL-based approach for multi-objective task
scheduling. MERLIN applies a hierarchical approach to the MOTS problem by
creating one neural network for the processing of individual tasks and another
for the scheduling of the overall queue. In addition to being smaller and with
shorted training times, the resulting architecture ensures that an item is
processed in the same manner regardless of its position in the queue.
Additionally, we present a novel approach for efficiently applying DRL-based
solutions on very large queues, and demonstrate how we effectively scale MERLIN
to process queue sizes that are larger by orders of magnitude than those on
which it was trained. Extensive evaluation on multiple queue sizes show that
MERLIN outperforms multiple well-known baselines by a large margin (>22%).

low resolution, which is common in real-world scenarios (e.g., from LiDAR or
Kinect sensors). Existing learning-based mesh generative methods mostly predict
the surface by first building a shape embedding that is at the whole object
level, a design that causes issues in generating fine-grained details and
generalizing to unseen categories. Instead, we propose to leverage the input
point cloud as much as possible, by only adding connectivity information to
existing points. Particularly, we predict which triplets of points should form
faces. Our key innovation is a surrogate of local connectivity, calculated by
comparing the intrinsic/extrinsic metrics. We learn to predict this surrogate
using a deep point cloud network and then feed it to an efficient
post-processing module for high-quality mesh generation. We demonstrate that
our method can not only preserve details, handle ambiguous structures, but also
possess strong generalizability to unseen categories by experiments on
synthetic and real data. The code is available at

from single polarized 2D images, i.e. polarization images. Polarization images
are known to be able to capture polarized reflected lights that preserve rich
geometric cues of an object, which has motivated its recent applications in
reconstructing surface normal of the objects of interest. Inspired by the
recent advances in human shape estimation from single color images, in this
paper, we attempt at estimating human body shapes by leveraging the geometric
cues from single polarization images. A dedicated two-stage deep learning
approach, SfP, is proposed: given a polarization image, stage one aims at
inferring the fined-detailed body surface normal; stage two gears to
reconstruct the 3D body shape of clothing details. Empirical evaluations on a
synthetic dataset (SURREAL) as well as a real-world dataset (PHSPD) demonstrate
the qualitative and quantitative performance of our approach in estimating
human poses and shapes. This indicates polarization camera is a promising
alternative to the more conventional color or depth imaging for human shape
estimation. Further, normal maps inferred from polarization imaging play a
significant role in accurately recovering the body shapes of clothed people.

offline and learning policies are isolated from their usage. The learned
policies are mostly constant throughout the training process and are not
adapted to the current training model state. Second, the policies rely on
class-preserving image processing functions. Hence applying current offline
methods to new tasks may require domain knowledge to specify such kind of

require expensive offline training when entering a new domain, and more
adaptive as it adapts to the learner state. Our augmentation networks require
less domain knowledge and are easily applicable to new tasks. Extensive

also study the inverse of Noether theorem for scaling symmetries and show how
we can construct and identify the generator of the scaling transformation, and
how it works for the vertical extended constant of motion that we are able to

resulting model flexibly captures nonlinear and heterogeneous lag dependence
when several mixture components are active, identifies low-order nonlinear
dependence while inferring relevant lags when few components are active, and
averages over multiple and competing single-lag models to quantify/propagate
uncertainty. Sparsity-inducing priors on the mixture weights aid in selecting a
subset of active lags. The hierarchical model specification follows conventions
for both GP regression and MTD models, admitting a convenient Gibbs sampling
scheme for posterior inference. We demonstrate properties of the proposed model

Healthcare professionals treating the coronavirus patients grapple with a

the health of the medical staff treating the patients affected by the
coronavirus. While many FPRs are designed to be disposable single-use devices,
the development of sterilization strategies is necessary to circumvent future
shortages. Here, we describe the development of a plasma-based method to
sterilize PPE such as FPRs with ozone. The novel design uses a flow-through
configuration where ozone directly flows through the fibers of the PPE through
the maintenance of a pressure gradient. Canonical ozone-based methods place the
mask into a sealed ozone-containing enclosure but lack pressurization to
permeate the mask fibers. In this device, ozone is created through an
atmospheric pressure Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) fed with compressed
air. Due to limited supply and clinical need of FPRs, we demonstrated
sterilization with surgical masks. We demonstrate rapid sterilization using E.
coli as a model pathogen. A flow-through configuration enables a >400%
improvement of the sterilization efficiency with respect to the canonical
approach. This method has potential for a broad and cost-effective utilization.
Using the power supply from a readily available plasma ball toy, a plastic box,
a glass tube, steel mesh, and 3D printed components, we designed and tested an

degree of heterogeneity present in the sample can grow and new components can
arise as sample size increases, allowing full flexibility in modeling the
complexity of data. This however will lead to a high-dimensional model which
poses great challenges for estimation. We novelly employ the idea of a sample
size dependent prior in a Bayesian model and establish a number of important
theoretical results. We first show that under mild conditions on the prior, the
posterior distribution concentrates around the true mixing distribution at a
near optimal rate with respect to the Wasserstein distance. Under a separation
condition on the true mixing distribution, we further show that a better and
adaptive convergence rate can be achieved, and the number of components can be
consistently estimated. Furthermore, we derive optimal convergence rates for
the higher-order mixture models where the number of components diverges
arbitrarily fast. In addition, we suggest a simple recipe for using Dirichlet

theoretical guarantees. In particular, we provide a novel solution for adopting
the number of clusters in a DP mixture model as an estimate of the number of
components in a finite mixture model. Simulation study and real data

""gap"". LAMOST J035913.61+405035.0 is evidently an eclipsing, weakly-outbursting
dwarf nova with a 5.48-hr period. Our spectrum of LAMOST J090150.09+375444.3 is
dominated by a late-type secondary and shows weak, narrow Balmer emission
moving in phase with the absorption lines, but at lower amplitude; we do not
see the HeII 4686 emission evident in the published discovery spectrum. We
again confirm that a period from the Catalina data, in this case 6.80 hr, is
orbital. LAMOST J033940.98+414805.7 yields a radial-velocity period of 3.54 hr,
and its spectrum appears to be typical of novalike variables in this period
range. The spectroscopically-selected sample from LAMOST evidently includes
some interesting cataclysmic variables that have been unrecognized until now,
apparently because of the relatively modest range of their photometric

optimization and 2) regularization. First, during the optimization phase, the

SmallSat mission being developed to demonstrate 10-milliarcsecond X-ray imaging

provide several orders of magnitude improvement in angular resolution over
current state of the art X-ray optics. However, PFLs for astronomical
applications require a long focal length, for VTXO the focal length is
estimated to be in the range of 0.5 km to 4 km. Since these focal lengths are
not feasible on a single spacecraft, the proposed solution is to use two
separate spacecraft, one with the lense(s), and the second with an X-ray
camera. These two spacecrafts will then fly in a formation approximating a
single rigid telescope. In order to achieve this configuration, the two
spacecraft must maintain the formation a focal length distance apart, with
centimeter level control, and sub-millimeter level knowledge requirements.
Additionally, the system must keep the telescope axis pointed at a fixed target
on the celestial sphere for extended durations. VTXOs system architecture calls
for two CubeSats to operate in a highly eccentric Earth orbit with one of the
spacecrafts traveling on a natural keplarian orbit. The second spacecraft will
then fly on a pseudo orbit maintaining a fixed offset during observations.
Observations with this system will occur near apogee where differential forces
on the spacecrafts are minimal which in turn minimizes fuel consumption. This
paper overviews VTXOs system architecture, and looks in depth at the formation
flying techniques, including fuel consumption, and methods maintaining the
formation. Beyond its use in X-ray astronomy, these formations flying
techniques should eventually contribute to the development of distributed
aperture telescopes, with imaging performance orders of magnitude better than
the current state of the art.

resolution enables measuring the environments closer to the central engines in
compact X-ray sources. This resolution will be achieved by the use of Phased
Fresnel Lenses (PFLs) optics which provide near diffraction-limited imaging in
the X-ray band. However, PFLs require long focal lengths in order to realize
their imaging performance, for VTXO this dictates that the telescopes optics

convex flux function, which is usual for existence and uniqueness for

(2) if so, to assess which philosophical stance - in relation to the
ontological and epistemological status of representations - is most

fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of
mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents
of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a
fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are
scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After
reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the
model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to
furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific
phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far
from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account: an
organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the
free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of
neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content
involved in the aboutness or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position
is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist

aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse

representation learning. Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation
and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one
layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate
neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger
receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance
deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated
propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable.
In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights
towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis
on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance
significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and
propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two
operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node
representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical
analysis of the above observation when building very deep models, which can

achieve the LASSO solution when the regression matrix has independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian entries in the sense that the
averaged per-coordinate l2 distance between the AMP iterates and the LASSO
solution vanishes as the signal dimension goes to infinity before the iteration
number. However, in finite dimensional settings, characterization of AMP
iterates in the limit of large iteration number has not been established. In
this work, we propose an AMP variant by including a parameter that depends on
the largest singular value of the regression matrix. The proposed algorithm can
also be considered as a primal dual hybrid gradient algorithm with adaptive
stepsizes. We show that whenever the AMP variant converges, it converges to the
LASSO solution for arbitrary finite dimensional regression matrices. Moreover,
we show that the AMP variant is locally stable around the LASSO solution under
the condition that the LASSO solution is unique and that the regression matrix
is drawn from a continuous distribution. Our local stability result implies
that in the special case where the regression matrix is large and has i.i.d.

precursors. Upon light absorption, the metal nanocrystals heat rapidly,
inducing semiconductor precursor decomposition and nanowire growth. This
process is performed on a benchtop in simple glassware under standard
conditions. To demonstrate the generality of this technique, we synthesized
three distinct semiconductor nanowire material systems: bismuth-seeded
germanium nanowires, bismuth-seeded cadmium selenide nanowires, and
indium-seeded germanium nanowires. The simplicity and versatility of this
process opens the door to a range of experiments and technologies including
in-line combinatorial identification of optimized reaction parameters, in situ
spectroscopic measurements to study solution-based nanowire growth, and the
potential production of nanowires with complex compositions or rationally
incorporated dopants.

related target domain has long been an important topic in the context of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in this field is
establishing a metric that can exactly measure the data distribution
discrepancy between two homogeneous domains and adopt it in distribution
alignment, especially in the matching of feature representations in the hidden
activation space. Existing distribution matching approaches can be interpreted
as failing to either explicitly orderwise align higher-order moments or satisfy
the prerequisite of certain assumptions in practical uses. We propose a novel
moment-based probability distribution metric termed dimensional weighted
orderwise moment discrepancy (DWMD) for feature representation matching in the
UDA scenario. Our metric function takes advantage of a series for high-order
moment alignment, and we theoretically prove that our DWMD metric function is
error-free, which means that it can strictly reflect the distribution
differences between domains and is valid without any feature distribution
assumption. In addition, since the discrepancies between probability
distributions in each feature dimension are different, dimensional weighting is
considered in our function. We further calculate the error bound of the
empirical estimate of the DWMD metric in practical applications. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate that our method yields
state-of-the-art distribution metrics.

a novel dynamic dual-attentive aggregation (DDAG) learning method by mining

the representation with the contextual relations across the two modalities. We

lines were investigated utilizing medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy. The
observations were conducted with Nayuta/MALLS and Subaru/HDS. Additionally,
archive data obtained by Keck/HIRES, VLT/UVES, and VLT/X-Shooter was used. The
small ratios of the equivalent widths indicate that Ca II IRT emission lines
arise primarily in dense chromospheric regions. Seven PMS stars show broad
emission lines. Among them, four PMS stars have more than one order of
magnitude brighter emission line fluxes compared to the low-mass stars in young
open clusters. The four PMS stars have a high mass accretion rate, which
indicates that the broad and strong emission results from a large mass
accretion. However, most PMS stars exhibit narrow emission lines. No
significant correlation was found between the accretion rate and flux of the
emission line. The ratios of the surface flux of the Ca II IRT lines to the
stellar bolometric luminosity, R'_IRT, of the PMS stars with narrow emission
lines are as large as the largest R'_IRT of the low-mass stars in the young

specified, and observations might be missing completely at random. The
intuitive idea is as follows: We assume that data are missing at random, and
the complete case analysis is applied. To account for the occurrence of missing
data, the design criterion we choose is the mean, for the missing indicator, of
the averaged (over the design space) mean squared errors of the predictions. To
describe the uncertainty in the specification of the real underlying model, we
impose a neighborhood structure on the deterministic part of the regression
response and maximize, analytically, the \textbf{M}ean of the averaged
\textbf{M}ean squared \textbf{P}rediction \textbf{E}rrors (MMPE), over the
entire neighborhood. The maximized MMPE is the ``worst'' loss in the
neighborhood of the fitted regression model. Minimizing the maximum MMPE over
the class of designs, we obtain robust ``minimax'' designs. The robust designs
constructed afford protection from increases in prediction errors resulting

Shortest Paths (APSP) for $n$-node graphs requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time. Another
famous hypothesis is that the $3$SUM problem for $n$ integers requires
$n^{2-o(1)}$ time. Although there are no direct reductions between $3$SUM and
APSP, it is known that they are related: there is a problem,
$(\min,+)$-convolution that reduces in a fine-grained way to both, and a
problem Exact Triangle that both fine-grained reduce to.
  In this paper we find more relationships between these two problems and other
basic problems. P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu had shown that under the $3$SUM hypothesis the
All-Edges Sparse Triangle problem in $m$-edge graphs requires $m^{4/3-o(1)}$
time. The latter problem asks to determine for every edge $e$, whether $e$ is
in a triangle. It is equivalent to the problem of listing $m$ triangles in an
$m$-edge graph where $m=\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$, and can be solved in $O(m^{1.41})$
time [Alon et al.'97] with the current matrix multiplication bounds, and in
$\tilde{O}(m^{4/3})$ time if $\omega=2$.
  We show that one can reduce Exact Triangle to All-Edges Sparse Triangle,
showing that All-Edges Sparse Triangle (and hence Triangle Listing) requires
$m^{4/3-o(1)}$ time also assuming the APSP hypothesis. This allows us to
provide APSP-hardness for many dynamic problems that were previously known to
be hard under the $3$SUM hypothesis.
  We also consider the previously studied All-Edges Monochromatic Triangle

Triangle implies that if the All-Edges Monochromatic Triangle problem has an
$O(n^{2.5-\epsilon})$ time algorithm for $\epsilon>0$, then both the APSP and

ill-posed when partially occluded or homogeneous regions exist in images. This
causes a cost volume to contain outliers and affects the flow decoding from it.
Besides, the coarse-to-fine flow inference demands an accurate flow
initialization. Ambiguous correspondence yields erroneous flow fields and
affects the flow inferences in subsequent levels. In this paper, we introduce
LiteFlowNet3, a deep network consisting of two specialized modules, to address
the above challenges. (1) We ameliorate the issue of outliers in the cost
volume by amending each cost vector through an adaptive modulation prior to the

find that the emission at lower energies comes from a diffuse or extended
component, while the major contribution of gamma rays above 1 TeV arises from
the southern part of the source. Moreover, we find that a significant curvature
is present in the combined observed spectrum of MAGIC and Fermi-LAT. The first
multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution of this unidentified source shows
that the emission at GeV-TeV energies can be well explained with both leptonic
and hadronic models. For the leptonic scenario, bremsstrahlung is the dominant
emission compared to inverse Compton. On the other hand, for the hadronic
model, gamma-ray resulting from the decay of neutral pions ($\pi^0$) can
explain the observed spectrum. The presence of dense molecular clouds
overlapping with HESS J1841-055 makes both bremsstrahlung and $\pi^0$-decay
processes the dominant emission mechanisms for the source.

due to high intensity pumping caused crystal damage, linear absorption and
nonlinear distortion induced short effective interaction length, and so on.
Here, through cryogenically cooling the crystals, delicately tailoring the pump

first successfully realized the generation of 1.4-mJ THz pulses lithium
niobates under the excitation of 214-mJ femtosecond laser pulses via tilted

0.7%, and a free-space THz peak electric and magnetic fields reached 6.3 MV/cm

second-order nonlinear wave equation under slowly varying envelope

capability of this super-strong THz source, nonlinear absorption due to

upper airway is often used in clinical practice. However, the success rate of
this surgery is limited; the failed surgery would even make the situation
worse, indicating the widened airway is not the unique criterion to evaluate
the breathing quality. Therefore, we carried out both experimental measurement
and numerical simulation on OSA upper airways and found that there existed an
intrinsic dominant 3-5 Hz signal and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 3-5 Hz
is inversely correlated with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Firstly, to validate
the suitability of simulation methods, we carried out Laser Doppler measurement
in 3D-printing OSA upper airway models, and found excellent agreement between
the measured and calculated velocity profiles in two upper airway models for
the first time. Then we carried out large eddy simulation (LES) to investigate
four pairs of OSA upper airway models with 8 different AHI values for both pre-

The decreased the pressure drop for failed case, proving that only widening
airway cannot guarantee to improve OSA. In our analysis, it is indicating that
a dominant recirculation downstream of the minimum cross-section should be a
main feature of a successful surgery, and the strength of 3-5 Hz signal induced
by flow separation in the upper airway plays an important role in appraising
breathing quality. This provides a new guideline for surgery planning.
Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between AHI and the area ratio of
minimum cross-section near the retro-palate to the maximum cross-section behind
the tongue base, and this correlation is highly significant, r = - 0.833, p =

apply it to load balancing problems. Additive approximation schemes aim to find
a solution with an absolute error in the objective of at most $\epsilon h$ for
some suitable parameter $h$. In the case that the parameter $h$ provides a
lower bound an additive approximation scheme implies a standard multiplicative
approximation scheme and can be much stronger when $h \ll$ OPT. On the other
hand, when no PTAS exists (or is unlikely to exist), additive approximation
schemes can provide a different notion for approximation.
  We consider the problem of assigning jobs to identical machines with lower
and upper bounds for the loads of the machines. This setting generalizes
problems like makespan minimization, the Santa Claus problem (on identical
machines), and the envy-minimizing Santa Claus problem. For the last problem,
in which the objective is to minimize the difference between the maximum and
minimum load, the optimal objective value may be zero and hence it is NP-hard
to obtain any multiplicative approximation guarantee. For this class of
problems we present additive approximation schemes for $h = p_{\max}$, the
maximum processing time of the jobs.
  Our technical contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce a new relaxation
based on integrally assigning slots to machines and fractionally assigning jobs
to the slots (the slot-MILP). We identify structural properties of
(near-)optimal solutions of the slot-MILP, which allow us to solve it
efficiently, assuming that there are $O(1)$ different lower and upper bounds on
the machine loads (which is the relevant setting for the three problems
mentioned above). The second technical contribution is a local-search based
algorithm which rounds a solution to the slot-MILP introducing an additive
error on the target load intervals of at most $\epsilon\cdot p_{\max}$.

sequential information from amino acid chains and the high-order pairwise

on both their features and the information of other amino acid pairs. In this

prediction problem. In addition, we propose a novel deep model to incorporate
the sequential information and high-order pairwise interactions to perform
interface predictions. We represent proteins as graphs and employ graph neural

reported on applications of four major brain imaging methods. These include
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG),
Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG),
with the first two being the most common methods in this domain. While
collecting driver fMRI signal has been particularly instrumental in studying
neural correlates of intoxicated driving (e.g. alcohol or cannabis) or
distracted driving, the EEG method has been predominantly utilised in relation
to the efforts aiming at development of automatic fatigue/drowsiness detection
systems, a topic to which the literature on neuro-ergonomics of driving
particularly has shown a spike of interest within the last few years. The
survey also reveals that topics such as driver brain activity in semi-automated
settings or the brain activity of drivers with brain injuries or chronic
neurological conditions have by contrast been investigated to a very limited
extent. Further, potential topics in relation to driving behaviour are
identified that could benefit from the adoption of neuroimaging methods in
future studies.

lives encompassing a diverse range of application domains that we regularly

computational capabilities, IoT networks are prone to various cyber attacks.
Thus, defending the IoT network against adversarial attacks is of vital
importance. In this paper, we present a novel intrusion detection approach for
IoT networks through the application of a deep learning technique. We adopt a
cutting-edge IoT dataset comprising IoT traces and realistic attack traffic,
including denial of service, distributed denial of service, reconnaissance and
information theft attacks. We utilise the header field information in
individual packets as generic features to capture general network behaviours,
and develop a feed-forward neural networks model with embedding layers (to
encode high-dimensional categorical features) for multi-class classification.
The concept of transfer learning is subsequently adopted to encode
high-dimensional categorical features to build a binary classifier. Results
obtained through the evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrate a high
classification accuracy for both binary and multi-class classifiers.

presented in this paper. It leverages the notion of critical clusters -- a
localized group of inverters with parameters having the highest impact on the
system stability. The spectrum of the weighted network admittance matrix is
proposed to decompose a system into clusters and rank them based on their
distances from the stability boundary. We show that each distinct eigenvalue of
this matrix is associated with one cluster, and its eigenvectors reveal a set
of inverters that participate most in the corresponding cluster. The least
stable or unstable clusters correspond to higher values of respective
eigenvalues of the weighted admittance matrix. We also establish an upper
threshold for eigenvalues that determines the stability boundary of the entire
system and demonstrate that this value depends only on the grid type (i.e.
$R/X$ ratio of the network) and does not depend on the grid topology.
Therefore, the proposed method provides the stability certificate based on this

be adjusted to restore or improve the stability.

nature although the width of the resonance for the barrier along the zigzag
direction is too thinner than that for the armchair one. Resonant transmission
is suppressed for both the cases by the application of oscillating potential
that produces small oscillations in the transmission around the resonant energy

in the transmission spectrum along the armchair direction while a distinct line
shape resonance is noted for the zigzag direction at higher frequency of the

are recognized as a key approach to narrow down the performance and
energy-efficiency gap between custom hardware accelerators and programmable
processors. Reaching the full potential of these architectures depends
critically on optimally scheduling the applications to available resources at
runtime. Existing optimization-based techniques cannot achieve this objective
at runtime due to the combinatorial nature of the task scheduling problem. As
the main theoretical contribution, this paper poses scheduling as a
classification problem and proposes a hierarchical imitation learning
(IL)-based scheduler that learns from an Oracle to maximize the performance of
multiple domain-specific applications. Extensive evaluations with six streaming
applications from wireless communications and radar domains show that the
proposed IL-based scheduler approximates an offline Oracle policy with more
than 99% accuracy for performance- and energy-based optimization objectives.
Furthermore, it achieves almost identical performance to the Oracle with a low
runtime overhead and successfully adapts to new applications, many-core system
configurations, and runtime variations in application characteristics.

identify tweets that inform about resource needs and availabilities (termed as

who needs / is providing the resource. Understanding these aspects helps us to

relationships with the magnetic structuring of the underlying sunspot. We found
that during development of wave trains the motion path occurred along a
preferential direction, and that the broadband wavefronts can be represented as
a set of separate narrowband oscillation sources. These sources become visible
as the waves pass through the umbral inhomogeneities caused by the differing
magnetic field inclination angles. We found the spatial and frequency
fragmentation of wavefronts, and deduced that the combination of narrowband
spherical and linear parts of the wavefronts provide the observed spirality.
Maps of the magnetic field inclination angles confirm this assumption. We
detect the activation of umbral structures as the increasing of oscillations in
the sources along the front ridge. Their temporal dynamics are associated with
the occurrence of umbral flashes. Spatial localisation of the sources is stable

algorithms which further leads to a high-probability bound for any learning

preservation and further generalization. Three composition theorems are
proposed to approximate the differential privacy of any iterative algorithm
through the differential privacy of its every iteration. By integrating the
above two steps, we eventually deliver generalization bounds for iterative
learning algorithms, which suggest one can simultaneously enhance privacy
preservation and generalization. Our results are strictly tighter than the

model size which is prohibitively large in deep learning. This sheds light to
understanding the generalizability of deep learning. These results apply to a

the SSDA problem, in this paper, we raise the intra-domain discrepancy issue
within the target domain, which has never been discussed so far. Then, we
demonstrate that addressing the intra-domain discrepancy leads to the ultimate
goal of the SSDA problem. We propose an SSDA framework that aims to align
features via alleviation of the intra-domain discrepancy. Our framework mainly
consists of three schemes, i.e., attraction, perturbation, and exploration.
First, the attraction scheme globally minimizes the intra-domain discrepancy
within the target domain. Second, we demonstrate the incompatibility of the
conventional adversarial perturbation methods with SSDA. Then, we present a
domain adaptive adversarial perturbation scheme, which perturbs the given
target samples in a way that reduces the intra-domain discrepancy. Finally, the
exploration scheme locally aligns features in a class-wise manner complementary
to the attraction scheme by selectively aligning unlabeled target features
complementary to the perturbation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments on

model, primarily the disk size $R_\mathrm{disk}$ which has been found to be
larger than predicted by the thin-disk model. In this work, we propose that
light curves measured in different bands will give different time delays since
$R_\mathrm{disk}$ is a function of wavelength, and by measuring the time delay
differences between bands, one can 1) directly verify such an new effect; 2)
test the thin-disk model of quasars. For the second goal, our method can avoid

results by continuum reverberation mapping. We conduct a simulation based on a
PG 1115+080-like lensed quasar, calculating the theoretical distributions of
time delay differences between two bands: u and i centered around 354nm and
780nm, under and beyond the thin-disk model, respectively. Assuming the disk
size is twice larger than the standard one, we find that with a precision of 2
days in the time delay difference measurements, the microlensing time delay
effect can be verified with $\sim4$ measurements while with $\sim35$
measurements the standard model can be excluded. This approach could be
realized in the ongoing and upcoming multi-band wide-field surveys with

report an efficient short-distance transport (SDT) growth approach and achieve
the controlled growth of high quality BP with the highest yield so far, where
98% of the red phosphorus is converted to BP. The doping of BP by As, Sb, Bi,
Se and Te are also achieved by this SDT growth approach. Spectroscopic results
show that doping systematically changes its electronic structures including
band gap, work function, and energy band position. As a result, we have found
that the air-stability of doped BP samples (Sb and Te-doped BP) improves
compared with pristine BP, due to the downshift of the conduction band minimum

tunable electronic structures and improved stability, and should extend the

notably in N-band (8 to 13~$\mu$m). Studying their fine chemistry through
mid-infrared spectro-interferometry with the new VLTI instrument MATISSE, which
can spatially resolve these regions, requires detailed dust chemistry models.
Using radiative transfer, we derived infrared spectra of a fiducial static
protoplanetary disc model with different inner disc ($< 1$ au) dust
compositions. The latter were derived from condensation sequences computed at
LTE for three initial $C/O$ ratios: subsolar ($C/O=0.4$), solar ($C/O=0.54$),
and supersolar ($C/O=1$). The three scenarios return very different N-band
spectra, especially when considering the presence of sub-micron-sized dust
grains. MATISSE should be able to detect these differences and trace the
associated sub-au-scale radial changes. We propose a first interpretation of
N-band `inner-disc' spectra obtained with the former VLTI instrument MIDI on
three Herbig stars (HD142527, HD144432, HD163296) and one T Tauri star (AS209).
Notably, we could associate a supersolar (`carbon-rich') composition for
HD142527 and a subsolar (`oxygen-rich') one for HD1444432. We show that the
inner disc mineralogy can be very specific and not related to the dust
composition derived from spatially unresolved mid-infrared spectroscopy. We
highlight the need for including more complex chemistry when interpreting

colouration, so-called magneto-chromatic effect, which holds great promise for
optical, biochemical and medical applications due to its contactless and
non-invasive nature. This goal can be achieved by magnetic-field controlled
birefringence, where colours are produced by the interference between
phase-retarded components of transmitted polarised light. Thus far
birefringence-tuneable coloration has been demonstrated using electric field,
material chirality and mechanical strain but magnetic field control remained
elusive due to either weak magneto-optical response of transparent media or low
transmittance to visible light of magnetically responsive media, such as
ferrofluids. Here we demonstrate magnetically tuneable colouration of aqueous
suspensions of two-dimensional cobalt-doped titanium oxide which exhibit an
anomalously large magneto-birefringence effect. The colour of the suspensions
can be tuned over more than two wavelength cycles in the visible range by
moderate magnetic fields below 0.8 T. We show that such giant magneto-chromatic
response is due to particularly large phase retardation (>3 pi) of the
polarised light, which in its turn is a combined result of a large
Cotton-Mouton coefficient (three orders of magnitude larger than for known
liquid crystals), relatively high saturation birefringence (delta n = 2 x
10^-4) and high transparency of our suspensions to visible light. The work
opens a new avenue to achieve tuneable colouration through engineered magnetic
birefringence and can readily be extended to other magnetic 2D nanocrystals.
The demonstrated effect can be used in a variety of magneto-optical

network to predict. Similar to the long-tailed distribution problem in visual
recognition, the small number of examples for such poses limits the ability of
networks to model them. Interestingly, local pose distributions suffer less
from the long-tail problem, i.e., local joint configurations within a rare pose
may appear within other poses in the training set, making them less rare. We
propose to take advantage of this fact for better generalization to rare and
unseen poses. To be specific, our method splits the body into local regions and
processes them in separate network branches, utilizing the property that a
joint position depends mainly on the joints within its local body region.
Global coherence is maintained by recombining the global context from the rest
of the body into each branch as a low-dimensional vector. With the reduced
dimensionality of less relevant body areas, the training set distribution
within network branches more closely reflects the statistics of local poses
instead of global body poses, without sacrificing information important for
joint inference. The proposed split-and-recombine approach, called SRNet, can
be easily adapted to both single-image and temporal models, and it leads to
appreciable improvements in the prediction of rare and unseen poses.

models estimate normalized log-densities of data to derive a bivariate measure

causal direction often require restrictive assumptions on the nature of causal
relationships (e.g., linearity),the flexibility of flow models allows for
arbitrary causal dependencies. Our approach compares favourably against

Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, a simple surface treatment was
shown to allow the possible formation of such an interface. Ta adsorption on
the surface of a p-doped SnSe shifts the valence band maximum towards higher
binding energy due to the charge transfer from Ta to SnSe that is highly
localized at the surface due to the layered structure of SnSe. As a result, the
charge carriers of the surface are changed from holes of its bulk
characteristics to electrons, while the bulk remains as a p-type semiconductor.
This observation suggests that the well-defined interface of a p-n junction

$SU(N)$ single-particle operators. Then, we point out that at large $N$, as the
length of the operator increases, the single-particle operator naturally
interpolates between the single-trace and the $S^3$ giant graviton. At finite

single-particle operators, gives a new basis for all half-BPS states, and this
new basis naturally cuts off when the length of any of the single-particle

orthogonality we prove a multipoint orthogonality theorem which implies
vanishing of all near-extremal correlators. We then compute all maximally and
next-to-maximally extremal free correlators, and we discuss features of the

presented to investigate the statistical signature of clustering and void
regions in particle-laden incompressible isotropic turbulence.
Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence at high Reynolds number ($Re_\lambda \gtrsim 200$) with up to $10^9$
inertial particles are performed for Stokes numbers ranging from $0.05$ to
$5.0$. Orthogonal wavelet analysis is then applied to the computed particle
number density fields. Scale-dependent skewness and flatness values of the
particle number density distributions are calculated and the influence of
Reynolds number $Re_\lambda$ and Stokes number $St$ is assessed. For $St \sim
1.0$, both the scale-dependent skewness and flatness values become larger as
the scale decreases, suggesting intermittent clustering at small scales. For
$St \le 0.2$, the flatness at intermediate scales, i.e. for scales larger than
the Kolmogorov scale and smaller than the integral scale of the flow, increases
as $St$ increases, and the skewness exhibits negative values at the
intermediate scales. The negative values of the skewness are attributed to void
regions. These results indicate that void regions at the intermediate sales are
pronounced and intermittently distributed for such small Stokes numbers. As
$Re_\lambda$ increases, the flatness increases slightly. For $Re_\lambda \ge
328$, the skewness shows negative values at large scales, suggesting that void
regions are pronounced at large scales, while clusters are pronounced at small
scales.

computed by solving the reduced-order semi-classical Einstein field equations
sourced by simple analytical approximations for the renormalized expectation

conformally coupled, we adopt Page's approximation to the renormalised stress

the reduced-order field equations are easily integrated and the first-order (in

corrections to the black hole event horizon, surface gravity and minimum
temperature as well as corrections to the photon sphere and quadratic curvature
invariants. We pay particular attention to the temperature profiles of the

out some interesting qualitative features produced by the backreaction. These

$f_0 \approx$ 30 - 250 kHz, $-\gamma \approx$ 0 - 13 kHz, and $\vert n \vert

trend period followed by an equilibrium period. Scientists may wish to quantify
features of the two periods, as well as the timing of the change point.
Specifically, we are motivated by problems in the study of electrical
cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) data. ECIS is a popular new technology
which measures cell behavior non-invasively. Previous studies using ECIS data
have found that different cell types can be classified by their equilibrium
behavior. However, it can be challenging to identify when equilibrium has been
reached, and to quantify the relevant features of cells' equilibrium behavior.
In this paper, we assume that measurements during the trend period are
independent deviations from a smooth nonlinear function of time, and that
measurements during the equilibrium period are characterized by a simple long
memory model. We propose a method to simultaneously estimate the parameters of
the trend and equilibrium processes and locate the change point between the
two. We find that this method performs well in simulations and in practice.
When applied to ECIS data, it produces estimates of change points and measures
of cell equilibrium behavior which offer improved classification of infected
and uninfected cells.

density below jamming, and no critical exponent can characterise its behaviour
approaching jamming. In mean-field, the relaxation time is instead
well-defined: it diverges at jamming with a critical exponent that we determine

argument in which the relaxation time is dominated by the most connected region

respectively. In a financial market context, if $g(s)=(K-s)^+$ or
$g(s)=(s-K)^+$ and $\mathbb{E}$ is the expectation taken with respect to a
martingale measure, $V^{\omega}_{\rm A}(s)$ describes the price of a perpetual
American option with a discount rate depending on the value of the asset
process $S_t$. If $\omega$ is a constant, the above problem produces the
standard case of pricing perpetual American options. In the first part of this
paper we find sufficient conditions for the convexity of the value function
$V^{\omega}_{\rm A}(s)$. This allows us to determine the stopping region as a
certain interval and hence we are able to identify the form of $V^{\omega}_{\rm
A}(s)$. We also prove a put-call symmetry for American options with
asset-dependent discounting. In the case when $S_t$ is a geometric L\'evy
process we give exact expressions using the so-called omega scale functions
introduced in Li and Palmowski (2018). We prove that the analysed value
function satisfies the HJB equation and we give sufficient conditions for the
smooth fit property as well. Finally, we present a few examples for which we
obtain the analytical form of the value function $V^{\omega}_{\rm A}(s)$.

its normal class and the residual components, respectively. Two anomaly scores
are calculated to quantify the anomalous degree of the image in either normal
class latent space or reconstruction image space. Thereby, anomaly detection
can be performed via thresholding the anomaly score. The experiments

essentially describe lower-dimensional projections of the state space using

representation, SETSe is able to differentiate between graphs that are designed
to appear identical using standard network metrics such as number of nodes,
number of edges and assortativity. The embeddings generated position the nodes
such that sub-classes, hidden during the embedding process, are linearly
separable, due to the way they connect to the rest of the network. SETSe
outperforms five other common graph embedding methods on both graph
differentiation and sub-class identification. The technique is applied to
social network data, showing its advantages over assortativity as well as
SETSe's ability to quantify network structure and predict node type. The
algorithm has a convergence complexity of around $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, and the
iteration speed is linear ($\mathcal{O}(n)$), as is memory complexity. Overall,
SETSe is a fast, flexible framework for a variety of network and graph tasks,
providing analytical insight and simple visualisation for complex systems.

whether a product is defect-free and further analyze the severity of anomality.
To this end, accurate defect segmentation on images of products provides an
important functionality. In industrial inspection tasks, it is common to
capture abundant defect-free image samples but very limited anomalous ones.
Therefore, it is critical to develop automatic and accurate defect segmentation
systems using only a small number of annotated anomalous training images. This
paper tackles the challenging few-shot defect segmentation task with sufficient
normal (defect-free) training images but very few anomalous ones. We present
two effective regularization techniques via incorporating abundant defect-free
images into the training of a UNet-like encoder-decoder defect segmentation
network. We first propose a Normal Background Regularization (NBR) loss which
is jointly minimized with the segmentation loss, enhancing the encoder network
to produce distinctive representations for normal regions. Secondly, we
crop/paste defective regions to the randomly selected normal images for data
augmentation and propose a weighted binary cross-entropy loss to enhance the
training by emphasizing more realistic crop-and-pasted augmented images based
on feature-level similarity comparison. Both techniques are implemented on an
encoder-decoder segmentation network backboned by ResNet-34 for few-shot defect
segmentation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the recently released
MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset with high-resolution industrial images. Under
both 1-shot and 5-shot defect segmentation settings, the proposed method
significantly outperforms several benchmarking methods.

hom-Lie algebras with respect to a representation. Any $\mathcal{O}$-operator
induces a hom-pre-Lie algebra structure. We express the cochain complex of an
$\mathcal{O}$-operator in terms of certain hom-Lie algebra cochain complex of
the sub-adjacent hom-Lie algebra associated with the induced hom-pre-Lie
algebra. If the structure maps in a hom-Lie algebra and its representation are
invertible, then we can extend the above cochain complex to a deformation
complex for $\mathcal{O}$-operators by adding the space of zero cochains.
Subsequently, we study linear and formal deformations of
$\mathcal{O}$-operators on hom-Lie algebras in terms of the deformation
cohomology. In the end, we deduce deformations of $s$-Rota-Baxter operators (of
weight 0) and skew-symmetric $r$-matrices on hom-Lie algebras as particular
cases of $\mathcal{O}$-operators on hom-Lie algebras.

establish that the low-rank plus sparse matrix set is closed provided the
incoherence of the low-rank component is upper bounded as
$\mu<\sqrt{mn}/(r\sqrt{s})$, and subsequently, the restricted isometry

magnetic Gr\""unesien ratio reveals that, surprisingly, this compound is quantum
critical without tuning. The dynamical energy over temperature scaling in the
neutron response, seen throughout the Brillouin zone, as well as the
temperature dependence of the static uniform susceptibility indicate that
temperature is the only energy scale in the criticality. Such behavior, which
has been associated with Kondo destruction quantum criticality in metallic
systems, may well be generic in the semimetal setting.

challenging research domain. To ensure safety from intruders and potential
objects posing threats to the zone being protected, it is crucial to be able to
distinguish between normal and abnormal states in real-time. Additionally, we
also need to consider any device malfunction. However, the inherent uncertainty
embedded within the type and level of abnormality makes supervised techniques
less suitable since the adversary may present a unique anomaly for intrusion.
As a result, an unsupervised method for anomaly detection is preferable taking
the unpredictable nature of attacks into account. Again in our case, the
autonomous drone provides heterogeneous data streams consisting of images and
other analog or digital sensor data, all of which can play a role in anomaly
detection if they are ensembled synergistically. To that end, an ensemble
detection mechanism is proposed here which estimates the degree of abnormality
of analyzing the real-time image and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor
data in an unsupervised manner. First, we have implemented a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) regression block, named AngleNet to estimate the angle
between a reference image and current test image, which provides us with a
measure of the anomaly of the device. Moreover, the IMU data are used in
autoencoders to predict abnormality. Finally, the results from these two
pipelines are ensembled to estimate the final degree of abnormality.
Furthermore, we have applied adversarial attack to test the robustness and
security of the proposed approach and integrated defense mechanism. The
proposed method performs satisfactorily on the IEEE SP Cup-2020 dataset with an
accuracy of 97.8%. Additionally, we have also tested this approach on an

If the system is under such a risk, preventive control decisions such as
changes in AVR setpoints need to be taken to enhance the stability. In this

  Incoherent Light: From Dimers to Networks","26 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The question of how quantum coherence facilitates energy transfer has been
intensively debated in the scientific community. Since natural and artificial
light-harvesting units operate under the stationary condition, we address this
question via a non-equilibrium steady-state analysis of a molecular dimer
irradiated by incoherent sunlight and then generalize the key predictions to
arbitrarily-complex exciton networks. The central result of the steady-state
analysis is the coherence-flux-efficiency relation:$\eta=c\sum_{i\neq
j}F_{ij}\kappa_j=2c\sum_{i\neq j}J_{ij}{\rm Im}[{\rho}_{ij}]\kappa_j$ with $c$
the normalization constant. In this relation, the first equality indicates that
energy transfer efficiency $\eta$ is uniquely determined by the trapping flux,
which is the product of flux $F$ and branching ratio $\kappa$ for trapping at
the reaction centers, and the second equality indicates that the energy
transfer flux $F$ is equivalent to quantum coherence measured by the imaginary
part of the off-diagonal density matrix, i.e., $F_{ij}=2J_{ij}{\rm
Im}[{\rho}_{ij}]$. Consequently, maximal steady-state coherence gives rise to
optimal efficiency. The coherence-flux-efficiency relation holds rigorously and
generally for any exciton networks of arbitrary connectivity under the
stationary condition and is not limited to incoherent radiation or incoherent
pumping. For light-harvesting systems under incoherent light, non-equilibrium
energy transfer flux (i.e. steady-state coherence) is driven by the breakdown
of detailed balance and by the quantum interference of light-excitations and
leads to the optimization of energy transfer efficiency. It should be noted
that the steady-state coherence or, equivalently, efficiency is the combined
result of light-induced transient coherence, inhomogeneous depletion, and
system-bath correlation, and is thus not necessarily correlated with quantum
beatings.

ability required for escaping from local minima in non-convex landscapes. A
directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) approach was recently proposed by the

referred to as the DGS gradient, in order to enable nonlocal exploration in
high-dimensional black-box optimization. Promising results show that replacing
the traditional local gradient with the nonlocal DGS gradient can significantly
improve the performance of gradient-based methods in optimizing highly
multi-modal loss functions. However, the current DGS method is designed for
unbounded and unconstrained optimization problems, making it inapplicable to
real-world engineering design optimization problems where the tuning parameters
are often bounded and the loss function is usually constrained by physical
processes. In this work, we propose to extend the DGS approach to the
constrained inverse design framework in order to find a better design. The
proposed framework has its advantages in portability and flexibility to
naturally incorporate the parameterization, physics simulation, and objective
formulation together to build up an effective inverse design workflow. A series
of adaptive strategies for smoothing radius and learning rate updating are
developed to improve the computational efficiency and robustness. To enable a
clear binarized design, a dynamic growth mechanism is imposed on the projection
strength in parameterization. Our methodology is demonstrated by an example of
designing a nanoscale wavelength demultiplexer and shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. By incorporating volume
constraints, the optimized design achieves an equivalently high performance but
significantly reduces the amount of material usage.

high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods, there is therefore a requirement to
understand how different numerical treatments of the interfaces between the

In this article, we compare two different approaches to handle this
non-conformal interface. The first is the so-called mortar approach, where flux

focusing not only on observing convergence orders for smooth solutions, but
also how each method performs in under-resolved simulations of linear and

algorithms applied on the inverse optimization of the Interfacial Heat Transfer
Coefficient (IHTC) coupled on the solidification phenomenon. It was considered
an upward directional solidification system for Al-7wt.% Si alloy and, for IHTC
model, a exponential time function. All thermophysical properties of the alloy
were considered constant. Scheil Rule was used as segregation model ahead
phase-transformation interface. Optimization results from Markov Chain Monte
Carlo method (MCMC) were considered as reference. Based on average, quantiles
95% and 5%, kurtosis, average iterations and absolute errors of the
metaheuristic methods, in relation to MCMC results, the Flower Pollination
Algorithm (FPA) and Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) presented the most
appropriate results, outperforming the other methods in this particular
phenomenon, based on these metrics. The regions with the most probable values
for parameters in IHTC time function were also determined.

  Advances in Cognitive Systems 2020",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Language-capable interactive robots participating in dialogues with human
interlocutors must be able to naturally and efficiently communicate about the
entities in their environment. A key aspect of such communication is the use of
anaphoric language. The linguistic theory of the Givenness Hierarchy(GH)
suggests that humans use anaphora based on the cognitive statuses their
referents have in the minds of their interlocutors. In previous work,
researchers presented GH-theoretic approaches to robot anaphora understanding.
In this paper we describe how the GH might need to be used quite differently to
facilitate robot anaphora generation.

for visual object recognition. As datasets get larger, a natural question to
ask is if existing deep learning architectures can be extended to handle the
50+K classes thought to be perceptible by a typical human. Most deep learning
architectures concentrate on splitting diverse categories, while ignoring the
similarities amongst them. This paper introduces a framework that automatically
analyzes and configures a family of smaller deep networks as a replacement to a
singular, larger network. Class similarities guide the creation of a family
from course to fine classifiers which solve categorical problems more
effectively than a single large classifier. The resulting smaller networks are
highly scalable, parallel and more practical to train, and achieve higher
classification accuracy. This paper also proposes a method to adaptively select
the configuration of the hierarchical family of classifiers using linkage
statistics from overall and sub-classification confusion matrices. Depending on
the number of classes and the complexity of the problem, a deep learning model
is selected and the complexity is determined. Numerous experiments on network
classes, layers, and architecture configurations validate our results.

  Domain","Masters thesis, Arizona State Univ (May, 2020)",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information Retrieval (IR) is the task of obtaining pieces of data (such as
documents) that are relevant to a particular query or need from a large
repository of information. IR is a valuable component of several downstream
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Practically, IR is at the heart of
many widely-used technologies like search engines. While probabilistic ranking
functions like the Okapi BM25 function have been utilized in IR systems since
the 1970's, modern neural approaches pose certain advantages compared to their
classical counterparts. In particular, the release of BERT (Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers) has had a significant impact in the
NLP community by demonstrating how the use of a Masked Language Model trained
on a large corpus of data can improve a variety of downstream NLP tasks,
including sentence classification and passage re-ranking. IR Systems are also
important in the biomedical and clinical domains. Given the increasing amount
of scientific literature across biomedical domain, the ability find answers to
specific clinical queries from a repository of millions of articles is a matter
of practical value to medical professionals. Moreover, there are
domain-specific challenges present, including handling clinical jargon and
evaluating the similarity or relatedness of various medical symptoms when
determining the relevance between a query and a sentence. This work presents
contributions to several aspects of the Biomedical Semantic Information
Retrieval domain. First, it introduces Multi-Perspective Sentence Relevance, a
novel methodology of utilizing BERT-based models for contextual IR. The system
is evaluated using the BioASQ Biomedical IR Challenge. Finally, practical
contributions in the form of a live IR system for medics and a proposed
challenge on the Living Systematic Review clinical task are provided.

consistent, satisfactory performance are legion. We investigate why AI failures
occur. We address only a narrow subset of the broader field of AI Safety. We
focus on AI failures on account of flaws in conceptualization, design and
deployment. Other AI Safety issues like trade-offs between privacy and security
or convenience, bad actors hacking into AI systems to create mayhem or bad
actors deploying AI for purposes harmful to humanity and are out of scope of
our discussion. We find that AI systems fail on account of omission and
commission errors in the design of the AI system, as well as upon failure to
develop an appropriate interpretation of input information. Moreover, even when
there is no significant flaw in the AI software, an AI system may fail because
the hardware is incapable of robust performance across environments. Finally an
AI system is quite likely to fail in situations where, in effect, it is called
upon to deliver moral judgments -- a capability AI does not possess. We observe
certain trade-offs in measures to mitigate a subset of AI failures and provide
some recommendations.
