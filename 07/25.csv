TREC 2020 News Track. The main objective of this task is to recommend a list of
relevant articles that the reader should refer to in order to understand the
context and gain background information of the query article. Our first
approach focuses on building an effective search query by combining weighted
keywords extracted from the query document and uses BM25 for retrieval. The
second approach leverages the capability of SBERT (Nils Reimers et al.) to
learn contextual representations of the query in order to perform semantic
search over the corpus. We empirically show that employing a language model
benefits our approach in understanding the context as well as the background of
the query article. The proposed approaches are evaluated on the TREC 2018
Washington Post dataset and our best model outperforms the TREC median as well
as the highest scoring model of 2018 in terms of the nDCG@5 metric. We further
propose a diversity measure to evaluate the effectiveness of the various
approaches in retrieving a diverse set of documents. This would potentially
motivate researchers to work on introducing diversity in their recommended
list. We have open sourced our implementation on Github and plan to submit our
runs for the background linking task in TREC 2020.

various saddles governed by a matrix model corresponding to SU($N$)

with the Bethe-Ansatz approach. We also determine the logarithmic correction to
the superconformal index to be $\log N$, finding precise agreement between the
saddle-point and Bethe-Ansatz approaches in their respective approximations. We
generalize the two approaches to cover a large class of 4d ${\cal N}=1$

agree all the way down to a universal contribution of the form $\log N$. The
universality of this last result constitutes a robust signature of this

develops along two main directions. At a macroscopic level, it follows the
structure of the Internet protocol stack, starting from the physical layer and
extending to the upper layers, without neglecting cross-layer and optimization
approaches. At a finer level, all the most relevant works belonging to each
layer of the stack are further classified, according to the different issues
peculiar of the layer, and highlighting the most relevant differences with the
other surveys present in literature. To provide a deeper insight in the theme,
the present work embraces many facets of the IoD, including privacy and

Finally, a discussion on the main research challenges and possible future
directions is carried out, focusing on the open issues and the most promising

Diophantine approximation and the behavior of waves on black hole interiors

this for the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in general relativity. We
study linear scalar perturbations $\psi$ of Kerr-AdS solving
$\Box_g\psi-\frac{2}{3}\Lambda \psi=0$ with reflecting boundary conditions at
infinity. Understanding the behavior of $\psi$ at the Cauchy horizon
corresponds to a linear analog of the problem of Strong Cosmic Censorship. Our
main result shows that if the dimensionless black hole parameters mass
$\mathfrak m = M \sqrt{-\Lambda}$ and angular momentum $\mathfrak a = a
\sqrt{-\Lambda}$ satisfy a certain non-Diophantine condition, then
perturbations $\psi$ arising from generic smooth initial data blow up at the
Cauchy horizon. The proof crucially relies on a novel resonance phenomenon
between stable trapping on the black hole exterior and the poles of the
interior scattering operator that gives rise to a small divisors problem. Our
result is in stark contrast to the result on Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS
(arxiv:1812.06142) as well as to previous work on the analogous problem for
$\Lambda \geq 0$. As a result of the non-Diophantine condition, the set of
parameters $\mathfrak m, \mathfrak a$ for which we show blow-up forms a
Baire-generic but Lebesgue-exceptional subset of all parameters below the
Hawking-Reall bound. On the other hand, we conjecture that for a set of
parameters $\mathfrak m, \mathfrak a $ which is Baire-exceptional but
Lebesgue-generic, all linear scalar perturbations remain bounded at the Cauchy
horizon. This suggests that the validity of the $C^0$-formulation of Strong
Cosmic Censorship for $\Lambda <0$ may change in a spectacular way according to
the notion of genericity imposed.

damping tidal flows in stars and giant planets. However, the efficiency of this
mechanism has long been debated, particularly in the regime of fast tides, when
the tidal frequency ($\omega$) exceeds the turnover frequency of the dominant
convective eddies ($\omega_c$). We present the results of hydrodynamical
simulations to study the interaction between tidal flows and convection in a
small patch of a convection zone. These simulations build upon our prior work
by simulating more turbulent convection in larger horizontal boxes, and here we
explore a wider range of parameters. We obtain several new results: 1) $\nu_E$
is frequency-dependent, scaling as $\omega^{-0.5}$ when $\omega/\omega_c
\lesssim 1$, and appears to attain its maximum constant value only for very
small frequencies ($\omega/\omega_c \lesssim 10^{-2}$). This
frequency-reduction for low frequency tidal forcing has never been observed
previously. 2) The frequency-dependence of $\nu_E$ appears to follow the same
scaling as the frequency spectrum of the energy (or Reynolds stress) for low
and intermediate frequencies. 3) For high frequencies ($\omega/\omega_c\gtrsim
1-5$), $\nu_E\propto \omega^{-2}$. 4) The energetically-dominant convective
modes always appear to contribute the most to $\nu_E$, rather than the resonant
eddies in a Kolmogorov cascade. These results have important implications for
tidal dissipation in convection zones of stars and planets, and indicate that
the classical tidal theory of the equilibrium tide in stars and giant planets
should be revisited. We briefly touch upon the implications for planetary
orbital decay around evolving stars.

the study is done is the Interacting Boson Model (IBM), including its version
with configuration mixing (IBM-CM). In order to generate the wave functions of
the isotope chains of interest, needed for calculating transfer intensities,
previous systematic studies with IBM and IBM-CM are taken without changing the
parameters. Results for two-neutron transfer intensities are presented for Zr,
Hg and Pt isotopic chains using IBM-CM and, moreover, the same is done for Zr,
Pt and Sm isotopic chains using IBM with just a single configuration, i.e.,
without using configuration mixing. In the case of Zr, the two-neutron transfer
intensities between the ground states provide a clear observable indicating
that normal and intruder configurations coexist in the low-lying spectrum and
that they cross at A=98->100, and this could allow to disentangle whether or
not shape coexistence is inducing a given QPT. In the case of Pt, where shape
coexistence is present and the regular and the intruder configurations cross
for the ground state, there is almost no influence in the value of the
two-neutron transfer, neither in the case of Hg where the ground state always
has regular nature. For the Sm isotope chain that is one of the quantum phase
transition paradigms, the value of the two-neutron transfer is strongly
affected.

static types to untyped programs. To remain sound, languages insert run-time
checks at the boundaries between typed and untyped code. Unfortunately,
performance studies have shown that the overhead of these checks can be
disastrously high, calling into question the viability of sound gradual typing.
In this paper, we show that by building on existing work on soft contract
verification, we can reduce or eliminate this overhead.
  Our key insight is that while untyped code cannot be trusted by a gradual
type system, there is no need to consider only the worst case when optimizing a
gradually-typed program. Instead, we statically analyze the untyped portions of
a gradually-typed program to prove that almost all of the dynamic checks
implied by gradual type boundaries cannot fail, and can be eliminated at
compile time. Our analysis is modular, and can be applied to any portion of a
program.
  We evaluate this approach on a dozen existing gradually-typed programs
previously shown to have prohibitive performance overhead---with a median
overhead of $3.5\times$ and up to $73.6\times$ in the worst case---and
eliminate all overhead in most cases, suffering only $1.6\times$ overhead in
the worst case.

across the path of the plasma wave before its arrival, where it generates a

distorts the plasma wave during the density downramp, causing plasma electrons

play a central role. They appear in the Hamiltonian analysis of the theory, and
in the Lagrangian path integral when constructing the gravity partition
function from topological BF theory. We develop here a systematic analysis of
the corner symplectic structure encoding the symmetry algebra of gravity, and
perform a thorough analysis of the simplicity constraints. Starting from a
precursor phase space with Poincar\'e and Heisenberg symmetry, we obtain the
corner phase space of BF theory by imposing kinematical constraints. This
amounts to fixing the Heisenberg frame with a choice of position and spin
operators. The simplicity constraints then further reduce the Poincar\'e
symmetry of the BF phase space to a Lorentz subalgebra. This picture provides a
particle-like description of (quantum) geometry: The internal normal plays the
role of the four-momentum, the Barbero-Immirzi parameter that of the mass, the
flux that of a relativistic position, and the frame that of a spin harmonic
oscillator. Moreover, we show that the corner area element corresponds to the
Poincar\'e spin Casimir. We achieve this central result by properly splitting,
in the continuum, the corner simplicity constraints into first and second class
parts. We construct the complete set of Dirac observables, which includes the
generators of the local $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ subalgebra of Poincar\'e,
and the components of the tangential corner metric satisfying an
$\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. We then present a preliminary analysis
of the covariant and continuous irreducible representations of the
infinite-dimensional corner algebra. Moreover, as an alternative path to
quantization, we also introduce a regularization of the corner algebra and
interpret this discrete setting in terms of an extended notion of twisted
geometries.

can be provided upon the vast infrastructures of Internet of Things (IoT) and

the EC and Cloud for further processing. EC nodes could become the hosts of
distributed datasets where various processing activities take place. The future
of EC involves numerous nodes interacting with the IoT devices and themselves
in a cooperative manner to realize the desired processing. A critical issue for
concluding this cooperative approach is the exchange of data synopses to have
EC nodes informed about the data present in their peers. Such knowledge will be
useful for decision making related to the execution of processing activities.
In this paper, we propose n uncertainty driven model for the exchange of data
synopses. We argue that EC nodes should delay the exchange of synopses
especially when no significant differences with historical values are present.
Our mechanism adopts a Fuzzy Logic (FL) system to decide when there is a
significant difference with the previous reported synopses to decide the
exchange of the new one. Our scheme is capable of alleviating the network from
numerous messages retrieved even for low fluctuations in synopses. We
analytically describe our model and evaluate it through a large set of
experiments. Our experimental evaluation targets to detect the efficiency of
the approach based on the elimination of unnecessary messages while keeping
immediately informed peer nodes for significant statistical changes in the

Heuristic methods are traditionally used to quickly produce models with

resulting trees may not necessarily be the best representation of the data in
terms of accuracy and size. In recent years, this motivated the development of
optimal classification tree algorithms that globally optimise the decision tree
in contrast to heuristic methods that perform a sequence of locally optimal

Our algorithm supports constraints on the depth of the tree and number of
nodes. The success of our approach is attributed to a series of specialised
techniques that exploit properties unique to classification trees. Whereas
algorithms for optimal classification trees have traditionally been plagued by
high runtimes and limited scalability, we show in a detailed experimental study

  Roughgarden and Wang (2016) showed that this problem is APX-hard but admits a
greedy $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm. Later, Derakhshan, Golrezai, and
Paes Leme (2019) gave an LP-based algorithm achieving a $0.68$-approximation

quantum communication, quantum simulation for instance boson sampling, linear
optics-based and measurement-based quantum computing. These applications
involve many photons and therefore place stringent requirements on the
efficiency of single photon creation. The scaling on efficiency is an
exponential function of the number of photons. Schemes taking full advantage of
quantum superpositions also depend sensitively on the coherence of the photons,
i.e. their indistinguishability. It is therefore crucial to maintain the
coherence over long strings of photons. Here, we report a single photon source
with an especially high system efficiency: a photon is created on-demand at the
output of the final optical fibre with a probability of 57%. The coherence of
the photons is very high and is maintained over a stream consisting of
thousands of photons; the repetition rate is in the GHz regime. We break with
the established semiconductor paradigms, such as micropillars, photonic crystal
cavities and waveguides. Instead, we employ gated quantum dots in an open,
tunable microcavity. The gating ensures low-noise operation; the tunability
compensates for the lack of control in quantum dot position and emission
frequency; the output is very well-matched to a single-mode fibre. An increase
in efficiency over the state-of-the-art by more than a factor of two, as

enables a shared perception, so that a physical robot not only perceives the
virtual elements in its own view but also infers the utility of the human
agent--the cost needed to perceive and interact in AR--by sensing the human
agent's gaze and pose. Such a new HRI design also affords a shared
manipulation, wherein the physical robot can control and alter virtual objects
in AR as an active agent; crucially, a robot can proactively interact with
human agents, instead of purely passively executing received commands. In
experiments, we design a resource collection game that qualitatively
demonstrates how a robot perceives, processes, and manipulates in AR and
quantitatively evaluates the efficacy of HRI using the shared AR workspace. We
further discuss how the system can potentially benefit future HRI studies that

context of its sublimative evolution. Shortly after the Sun's protoplanetary
disk (PPD) cleared, the newly intense sunlight sparked a sublimative period in
Arrokoth's early history that lasted for ~10-100 Myr. Although this sublimation
was too weak to significantly alter Arrokoth's spin state, it could drive mass
transport around the surface significant enough to erase topographic features
on length scales of ~10-100 m. This includes craters up to ~50-500 m in
diameter, which suggests that the majority of Arrokoth's craters may not be
primordial (dating from the merger of Arrokoth's lobes), but rather could date
from after the end of this sublimative period. Thereafter, Arrokoth entered a
Quiescent Period (which lasts to the present day), in which volatile production
rates are at least 13 orders of magnitude less than the ~10^24 molecules/s
detection limit of the New Horizons spacecraft (Lisse et al. 2020). This is
insufficient to drive either mass transport or sublimative torques. These
results suggest that the observed surface of Arrokoth is not primordial, but
rather dates from the Quiescent Period. By contrast, the inability of
sublimative torques to meaningfully alter Arrokoth's rotation state suggests
that its shape is indeed primordial, and its observed rotation is
representative of its spin state after formation.

effective tool to find optimal control policies for dynamical systems, with
recent focus on approaches that guarantee safety during the learning and/or

learning when the system is safety-critical and/or task restarts are not
practically feasible. In optimal control theory, safety requirements are often
expressed in terms of state and/or control constraints. In recent years,
reinforcement learning approaches that rely on persistent excitation have been
combined with a barrier transformation to learn the optimal control policies

reinforcement learning methods that rely on exact model knowledge have also
been integrated with the barrier transformation framework. The objective of
this paper is to develop safe reinforcement learning method for deterministic
nonlinear systems, with parametric uncertainties in the model, to learn
approximate constrained optimal policies without relying on stringent
excitation conditions. To that end, a model-based reinforcement learning
technique that utilizes a novel filtered concurrent learning method, along with
a barrier transformation, is developed in this paper to realize simultaneous
learning of unknown model parameters and approximate optimal state-constrained

Within the context of a simple renormalizable field theory coupled to gravity

constants in a way which is incompatible with their actual values. This
contradiction persists on deforming the theory. Further enforcing the
$t$-channel pole subtracted positivity bounds on such generic renormalizable
effective theories coupled to gravity would imply new physics at a scale
parametrically smaller than expected, with far reaching implications. This
suggests that generically the standard positivity bounds are inapplicable with
gravity and we highlight a number of issues that impinge on the formulation of
a three-dimensional amplitude which simultaneously satisfies the required
properties of analyticity, positivity and crossing symmetry. We conjecture
instead a modified bound that ought to be satisfied independently of the

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking mechanism, the non-trivial vacuum. We verify the
stability of the model as much as the magnetic vortex, and noticed that the
soliton modes with polarized direction generated can be associated with local
anisotropy of vacuum energy. The vortex equations of motion and the asymptotic
behaviour is presented. We have obtained that the effect of the Lorentz

or as a barrier at $r_0$ which can represent a boundary in the universe, if the
Bumblebee vector field vacuum has space-like characteristic. We also analyse
the spectrum via propagators where we note that the topological mass

Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) with 32MHz bandwidth, and were
calibrated using the SPAM routines. The source extraction was carried out with
the PyBDSF tool, followed by verification through visual inspection of every

reported as a key enabler in the fifth-generation communication and beyond. It
is customary to use a lens antenna array to transform a mmWave mMIMO channel
into a beamspace where the channel exhibits sparsity. This beamspace
transformation is equivalent to performing a Fourier transformation of the
channel. Still, a Fourier transformation is not necessarily the optimal one,
due to many reasons. Accordingly, this paper proposes using a learned
sparsifying dictionary as the transformation operator leading to another
beamspace. Since the dictionary is obtained by training over actual channel
measurements, this transformation is shown to yield two immediate advantages.
First is enhancing channel sparsity, thereby leading to more efficient pilot
reduction. Second is improving the channel representation quality, and thus
reducing the underlying power leakage phenomenon. Consequently, this allows for
both improved channel estimation and facilitated beam selection in mmWave
mMIMO. Besides, a learned dictionary is also used as the precoding operator for
the same reasons. Extensive simulations under various operating scenarios and
environments validate the added benefits of using learned dictionaries in
improving the channel estimation quality and the beam selectivity, thereby
improving the spectral efficiency.

(UDA) task across domains. By doing so, the two sub-tasks can better leverage
the corresponding supervision and thus yield very different classifiers. To
integrate the strengths of the two classifiers, we apply the well-established
co-training framework, in which the two classifiers exchange their high

integral representation of the deformed Pearcey determinant involving the
Hamiltonian associated with a family of special solutions to a system of

identities for the Hamiltonian, this allows us to obtain the large gap

mechanisms proposed to introduce $^{26}$Al into protoplanetary disks, primarily
through contamination by external sources. We propose a local mechanism to
enrich protostellar disks with $^{26}$Al through irradiation of the
protostellar disk surface by cosmic rays accelerated in the protostellar
accretion shock. We calculate the $^{26}$Al enrichment, [$^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al],
at the surface of the protostellar disk in the inner AU throughout the
evolution of low-mass stars, from M-dwarfs to proto-Suns. Assuming constant
mass accretion rates, $\dot{m}$, we find that irradiation by MeV cosmic rays
can provide significant enrichment on the disk surface if the cosmic rays are
not completely coupled to the gas in the accretion flow. Importantly, we find
that low accretion rates, $\dot{m} < 10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, are able
to produce canonical amounts of $^{26}$Al, $[^{26}{\rm Al}/^{27}{\rm Al}]
\approx 5\times10^{-5}$. These accretion rates are experienced at the
transition from Class I- to Class II-type protostars, when it is assumed that
calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions condense in the inner disk. We conclude that
irradiation of the inner disk surface by cosmic ray protons accelerated in
accretion shocks at the protostellar surface may be an important mechanism to
produce $^{26}$Al. Our models show protostellar cosmic rays may be a viable
model to explain the enrichment of $^{26}$Al found in the Solar System.

exploit a new source of information, the so-called Morse phase, which further
mitigates the search background and constrains viable lenses. The best
candidate we find is consistent with a strongly lensed signal from a massive
binary black hole (BBH) merger, with three detected images consisting of the
previously catalogued events GW170104 and GW170814, and a subthreshold trigger,
GWC170620. Given the number of BBH events detected so far, we estimate an
overall false alarm probability $\sim 10^{-4}$ for the observed high degree of
parameter coincidence between the three events. On the flip side, we measure
the Morse phase differences which suggest a complex and atypical lens system,
with at least five images including a magnified image at a local maximum of the
Fermat potential. The low prior probability for multiple lensed images and the
amount of fine tuning required in the lens model reduce the credibility of the
lensing hypothesis. The long time delays between lensed images point toward a
galaxy cluster lens with an internal velocity dispersion $\sigma \sim 650\,{\rm
km/s}$, and the observed strain amplitudes imply a likely range $0.4 < z
\lesssim 0.7$ for the source redshift. We provide an error ellipse of $\sim
16\,{\rm deg}^2$ for the sky location of the source together with additional
specific constraints on the lens-host system, and encourage follow-up efforts
to confirm or rule out any viable lens. If this is indeed a lensed event,
successfully pinpointing the system would offer a unique opportunity to

structure on the category $\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{dgwu}}(\Bbbk)$ of small weakly
unital dg categories (in the sense of Kontsevich-Soibelman [KS]) over a field
$\Bbbk$. In [PS], we constructed a closed model structure on the category of
weakly unital dg categories, imposing a technical condition on the weakly
unital dg categories, saying that $\mathrm{id}_x\cdot
\mathrm{id}_x=\mathrm{id}_x$ for any object $x$. Although this condition led us
to a great simplification, it was redundant and had to be dropped.
  Here we get rid of this condition, and provide a closed model structure in
full generality. The new closed model category is as well cofibrantly
generated, and it is proven to be Quillen equivalent to the closed model
category $\mathrm{Cat}_\mathrm{dg}(\Bbbk)$ of (strictly unital) dg categories
over $\Bbbk$, given by Tabuada [Tab1]. Dropping the condition
$\mathrm{id}_x^2=\mathrm{id}_x$ makes the construction of the closed model
structure more distant from loc.cit., and requires new constructions. One of
them is a pre-triangulated hull of a wu dg category, which in turn is shown to
be a wu dg category as well.
  One example of a weakly unital dg category which naturally appears is the
bar-cobar resolution of a dg category. We supply this paper with a refinement
of the classical bar-cobar resolution of a unital dg category which is strictly
unital (appendix B). A similar construction can be applied to constructing a
cofibrant resolution in $\mathrm{Cat}_\mathrm{dgwu}(\Bbbk)$.

Lippmann-Schwinger equation to accelerate the computation of an approximate
inverse. The solver is coupled with a Nystr\""om discretization on a regular
square grid, using a quadrature method developed by Ran Duan and Vladimir
Rokhlin that attains high-order accuracy despite the singularity in the kernel
of the integral equation. A particularly efficient solver is obtained when the
direct solver is run at four digits of accuracy, and is used as a
preconditioner to GMRES, with each forwards application of the integral
operators accelerated by the FFT. Extensive numerical experiments are presented
that illustrate the high performance of the method in challenging environments.
Using the $10^{\rm th}$-order accurate version of the Duan-Rokhlin quadrature
rule, the scheme is capable of solving problems on domains that are over 500
wavelengths wide to residual error below $10^{-10}$ in a couple of hours on a
workstation, using 26M degrees of freedom.

minimizing variance leads to faster convergence, LogOpt increases the
data-efficiency of counterfactual estimation. LogOpt turns the counterfactual
approach - which is indifferent to the logging policy - into an online

as an online evaluation method, LogOpt is unbiased w.r.t. position and

to the requirement to unroll the network through time. Online learning has
recently regained the attention of the research community, focusing either on
approaches that approximate BPTT or on biologically-plausible schemes applied
to SNNs. Here we present an alternative perspective that is based on a clear
separation of spatial and temporal gradient components. Combined with insights
from biology, we derive from first principles a novel online learning algorithm
for deep SNNs, called online spatio-temporal learning (OSTL). For shallow
networks, OSTL is gradient-equivalent to BPTT enabling for the first time
online training of SNNs with BPTT-equivalent gradients. In addition, the
proposed formulation unveils a class of SNN architectures trainable online at
low time complexity. Moreover, we extend OSTL to a generic form, applicable to
a wide range of network architectures, including networks comprising long
short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU). We demonstrate the
operation of our algorithm on various tasks from language modelling to speech

arguably simpler and more general in that canonical coordinates are not

systems. The method is then applied to ion crystals in a Penning trap. Reduced
eigenvalue problems for the case of large applied magnetic field are developed,
for which the spectrum breaks into ExB drift modes, axial modes, and cyclotron

consistent with the Bohr-van-Leeuwen theorem, provided that neutrally-stable

are likely metal-poor stars in the inner bulge with small apocenters (i.e.,
$R_{\mathrm{apo}}\lesssim4$ kpc). In the past, stars with these properties have
been impossible to find due to extreme reddening and extinction along the line
of sight to the inner bulge. We have used the mid-infrared metal-poor star
selection of Schlaufman & Casey (2014) on Spitzer/GLIMPSE data to overcome
these problems and target candidate inner bulge metal-poor giants for
moderate-resolution spectroscopy with AAT/AAOmega. We used those data to select
three confirmed metal-poor giants ($[\mathrm{Fe/H}]=-3.15,-2.56,-2.03$) for
follow-up high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy. A comprehensive orbit
analysis using Gaia DR2 astrometry and our measured radial velocities confirms
that these stars are tightly bound inner bulge stars. We determine the
elemental abundances of each star and find high titanium and iron-peak
abundances relative to iron in our most metal-poor star. We propose that the
distinct abundance signature we detect is a product of nucleosynthesis in the
Chandrasekhar-mass thermonuclear supernova of a CO white dwarf accreting from a
helium star with a delay time of about 10 Myr. Even though chemical evolution

sequence as the price history of a stock that goes up or down one unit at each
time step. In this problem, an investor has access to the predictions of two or
more 'experts,' and strives to minimize her final-time regret with respect to
the best-performing expert. Probability plays no role; rather, the market is
assumed to be adversarial. We consider the case when there are two
history-dependent experts, whose predictions are determined by the d most
recent stock moves. Focusing on an appropriate continuum limit and using
methods from optimal control, graph theory, and partial differential equations,
we discuss strategies for the investor and the adversarial market, and we
determine associated upper and lower bounds for the investor's final-time
regret. When d is less than 4 our upper and lower bounds coalesce, so the
proposed strategies are asymptotically optimal. Compared to other recent
applications of partial differential equations to prediction, ours has a new
element: there are two timescales, since the recent history changes at every
step whereas regret accumulates more slowly.

applications in post-silicon microelectronics have attracted significant
attention in the past decade. Recently, ferromagnetic order with out-of-plane
easy axis in a monolayer of CrI3 has been observed and reported, with a Curie
temperature of 45 K. Here we study, using density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, how hydrogen and oxygen adsorption affects the structural,
electronic, and magnetic properties of a CrI3 monolayer. Our results show that
while the structure remains almost unchanged by the adsorption of hydrogen,
adsorption of oxygen completely distorts it. We have also found that both the
adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen atoms significantly influences the electronic
and magnetic properties of the monolayer. While hydrogen quenches the magnetic
moments of Cr atoms, oxygen introduces an impurity band in the gap.
Interestingly, we find a strong enhancement of the Curie temperature by full
hydrogenation, while the results are not conclusive for O. This result suggests
a simple and effective approach to manipulate the electronic and magnetic
properties of 2D magnets for spintronics applications.

Caffo and Xi Luo","Principal Regression for High Dimensional Covariance Matrices","21 pages of main text and references, 3 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This manuscript presents an approach to perform generalized linear regression
with multiple high dimensional covariance matrices as the outcome. Model
parameters are proposed to be estimated by maximizing a pseudo-likelihood. When
the data are high dimensional, the normal likelihood function is ill-posed as
the sample covariance matrix is rank-deficient. Thus, a well-conditioned linear
shrinkage estimator of the covariance matrix is introduced. With multiple
covariance matrices, the shrinkage coefficients are proposed to be common
across matrices. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the proposed covariance
matrix estimator is optimal achieving the uniformly minimum quadratic loss
asymptotically among all linear combinations of the identity matrix and the
sample covariance matrix. Under regularity conditions, the proposed estimator
of the model parameters is consistent. The superior performance of the proposed
approach over existing methods is illustrated through simulation studies.
Implemented to a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study
acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the proposed
approach identified a brain network within which functional connectivity is
significantly associated with Apolipoprotein E $\varepsilon$4, a strong genetic
marker for Alzheimer's disease.

  link",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The conventional paradigm in speech translation starts with a speech
recognition step to generate transcripts, followed by a translation step with
the automatic transcripts as input. To address various shortcomings of this
paradigm, recent work explores end-to-end trainable direct models that
translate without transcribing. However, transcripts can be an indispensable
output in practical applications, which often display transcripts alongside the
translations to users.
  We make this common requirement explicit and explore the task of jointly
transcribing and translating speech. While high accuracy of transcript and
translation are crucial, even highly accurate systems can suffer from
inconsistencies between both outputs that degrade the user experience. We
introduce a methodology to evaluate consistency and compare several modeling
approaches, including the traditional cascaded approach and end-to-end models.
We find that direct models are poorly suited to the joint
transcription/translation task, but that end-to-end models that feature a
coupled inference procedure are able to achieve strong consistency. We further
introduce simple techniques for directly optimizing for consistency, and
analyze the resulting trade-offs between consistency, transcription accuracy,
and translation accuracy.

a convecting layer of its fluid rotating about the vertical axis. In the
rotating regime studied here, with Rayleigh numbers of order $10^7$, convection
takes the form of columnar vortices, the number and size of which depend upon
the Ekman and Prandtl numbers, as well as the geometry -- periodic or confined.
As the Ekman and Rayleigh numbers vary, the number and average area of vortices
vary in inverse proportion, becoming thinner and more numerous with decreasing
Ekman number. The vortices transport heat to the phase boundary thereby
controlling its morphology, characterized by the number and size of the voids
formed in the solid, and the overall melt rate, which increases when the lower
boundary is governed by a no-slip rather than a stress-free velocity boundary
condition. Moreover, the number and size of voids formed are relatively
insensitive to the Stefan number, here inversely proportional to the latent
heat of fusion. For small values of the Stefan number, the convection in the
fluid reaches a slowly evolving geostrophic state wherein columnar vortices
transport nearly all the heat from the lower boundary to melt the solid at an
approximately constant rate. In this quasi-steady state, we find that the
Nusselt number, characterizing the heat flux, co-varies with the interfacial
roughness, for all the flow parameters and Stefan numbers considered here. This
confluence of processes should influence the treatment of moving boundary
problems, particularly those in astrophysical and geophysical problems where
rotational effects are important.

age of the subgiant agrees with a stellar isochrone fit, but the rotation
period is much shorter than expected from standard models of angular momentum
evolution. We conclude that weakened magnetic braking may be needed to
reproduce the stellar properties, and that evolved subgiants in the hydrogen

states of magnetic topological materials. EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is an excellent
example, as it is predicted to have collinear antiferromagnetic order where the
magnetic moment direction determines either a topological-crystalline-insulator
phase supporting axion electrodynamics or a higher-order-topological-insulator
phase with chiral hinge states. Here, we use neutron diffraction, symmetry
analysis, and density functional theory results to demonstrate that
EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ actually exhibits low-symmetry helical antiferromagnetic
order which makes it a stoichiometric magnetic topological-crystalline axion
insulator protected by the combination of a 180$^{\circ}$ rotation and
time-reversal symmetries: $C_{2}\times\mathcal{T}=2^{\prime}$. Surfaces
protected by $2^{\prime}$ are expected to have an exotic gapless Dirac cone
which is unpinned to specific crystal momenta. All other surfaces have gapped
Dirac cones and exhibit half-integer quantum anomalous Hall conductivity. We
predict that the direction of a modest applied magnetic field of $H\approx1$ to
$2$ T can tune between gapless and gapped surface states.

edit distance problem and for embedding edit distance to Hamming distance. For
the gap edit distance problem, we give an $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{k}+k^2)$-time
greedy algorithm that distinguishes between length-$n$ input strings with edit
distance at most $k$ and those with edit distance exceeding $(3k+5)k$. This is
an improvement and a simplification upon the result of Goldenberg, Krauthgamer,
and Saha [FOCS 2019], where the $k$ vs $\Theta(k^2)$ gap edit distance problem
is solved in $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{k}+k^3)$ time. We further generalize our
result to solve the $k$ vs $k'$ gap edit distance problem in time
$\tilde{O}(\frac{nk}{k'}+k^2+ \frac{k^2}{k'}\sqrt{nk})$, strictly improving
upon the previously known bound $\tilde{O}(\frac{nk}{k'}+k^3)$. Finally, we
show that if the input strings do not have long highly periodic substrings,
then already the $k$ vs $(1+\epsilon)k$ gap edit distance problem can be solved
in sublinear time. Specifically, if the strings contain no substring of length
$\ell$ with period at most $2k$, then the running time we achieve is
$\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2 k}+k^2\ell)$.
  We further give the first sublinear-time probabilistic embedding of edit
distance to Hamming distance. For any parameter $p$, our
$\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{p})$-time procedure yields an embedding with distortion
$O(kp)$, where $k$ is the edit distance of the original strings. Specifically,
the Hamming distance of the resultant strings is between $\frac{k-p+1}{p+1}$
and $O(k^2)$ with good probability. This generalizes the linear-time embedding
of Chakraborty, Goldenberg, and Kouck\'y [STOC 2016], where the resultant
Hamming distance is between $\frac k2$ and $O(k^2)$. Our algorithm is based on
a random walk over samples, which we believe will find other applications in
sublinear-time algorithms.

significant changes of the material's microstructure and dynamics. After
yielding, many soft materials recover their quiescent properties over time as
they age. There remains, however, a lack of understanding of the nature of this
recovery. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms by which fibrillar networks restore
their ability to support stress after yielding. Crucially, we observe that the
aging response bifurcates around a critical stress $\sigma_\mathrm{c}$, which
is equivalent to the material yield stress. After an initial yielding event,
fibrillar networks subsequently yield faster and at lower magnitudes of stress.
For stresses $\sigma<\sigma_\mathrm{c}$, the time to yielding increases with
waiting time $t_\mathrm{w}$ and diverges once the network has restored
sufficient entanglement density to support the stress. When $\sigma >
\sigma_\mathrm{c}$, the yield time instead plateaus at a finite value because
the developed network density is insufficient to support the applied stress. We
quantitatively relate the yielding and aging behavior of the network to the
competition between stress-induced disentanglement and dynamic fluctuations of
the fibrils rebuilding the network. The bifurcation in the material response
around $\sigma_c$ provides a new possibility to more rigorously localize the
yield stress in disordered materials with time-dependent behavior.

Earth. Competition between species in a population is considered by ecological
niche-based theories as a key factor leading to different severity of species
extinctions. There are population dynamics models that describe a simple and
easily understandable mechanism for resource competition. However, these models
can not efficiently characterize and quantify new emergent extinctions in a
large population appearing due to environmental forcing. To address this issue
we develop a stochastic physics-inspired approach to analyze how environmental
forcing influences the severity of species extinctions in such models. This
approach is based on the large deviations theory of stochastic processes (the
Freidlin-Wentzell theory). We show that there are three possible fundamentally
different scenarios of extinctions, which we call catastrophic extinctions,
asymmetric ones, and extinctions with exponentially small probabilities. The
realization of those scenarios depends on environmental noise properties and
the boundaries of niches, which define the domain, where species survive.
Furthermore, we describe a hysteresis effect in species extinction showing that
fluctuations can lead to dramatic consequences even if an averaged resource
supply is sufficient to support population survival. Our stochastic
physics-inspired approach generalizes niche theory by accounting environmental
forcing and will be useful to find, by available data, which environmental
perturbations may induce extinctions.

provides several out of the box functionality including (a) loss integrity

We deploy this approach to train generative models of sizes hitherto not

In this paper, we show that future gravitational-wave detectors on the ground

the individual black holes in the observed binaries. We lay out the detection
strategy and, focusing on scalar bosons, chart the suitable parameter space. We
study the impact of ignorance about the system's history, including cloud age
and black hole spin. We also consider the tidal resonances that may destroy the
boson cloud before its gravitational signal becomes detectable by a
ground-based follow-up. Finally, we show how to take all of these factors into

that the pressure in the direction perpendicular to the domain wall can be, in
contrast to the weak-field limit of General Relativity, significantly greater

states that the average value of the perpendicular pressure is approximately
equal to zero in the weak-field limit of General Relativity, does not generally
hold in EiBI gravity not only for domain walls, but also in the case cosmic

management and in the prediction of associated comorbidities. Blood pressure is
a dynamic vital sign with frequent changes throughout a given day. Capturing
blood pressure remotely and frequently (also known as ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring) has traditionally been achieved by measuring blood pressure at
discrete intervals using an inflatable cuff. However, there is growing interest
in developing a cuffless ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system to measure
blood pressure continuously. One such approach is by utilizing bioimpedance
sensors to build regression models. A practical problem with this approach is
that the amount of data required to confidently train such a regression model
can be prohibitive. In this paper, we propose the application of the
domain-adversarial training neural network (DANN) method on our multitask
learning (MTL) blood pressure estimation model, allowing for knowledge transfer
between subjects. Our proposed model obtains average root mean square error
(RMSE) of $4.80 \pm 0.74$ mmHg for diastolic blood pressure and $7.34 \pm 1.88$

demonstrate similar pedagogic behavior. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel
explainable AI (XAI) framework for achieving human-like communication in
human-robot collaborations, where the robot builds a hierarchical mind model of
the human user and generates explanations of its own mind as a form of
communications based on its online Bayesian inference of the user's mental
state. To evaluate our framework, we conduct a user study on a real-time
human-robot cooking task. Experimental results show that the generated
explanations of our approach significantly improves the collaboration
performance and user perception of the robot. Code and video demos are

Existing studies on entrepreneurial regimes mainly use common methods from
multivariate analysis and some type of institutional related analysis. In our
analysis, the entrepreneurial regimes is analyzed by applying a novel polygonal
symbolic data cluster analysis approach. Considering the diversity of data
structures in Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA), interval-valued data is the most
popular. Yet, this approach requires assuming equidistribution hypothesis. We
use a novel polygonal cluster analysis approach to address this limitation with
additional advantages: to store more information, to significantly reduce large
data sets preserving the classical variability through polygon radius, and to
open new possibilities in symbolic data analysis. We construct a dynamic
cluster analysis algorithm for this type of data with proving main theorems and
lemmata to justify its usage. In the empirical part we use dataset of Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) for year 2015 to construct typologies of
countries based on responses to main entrepreneurial questions. The article
presents a novel approach to clustering in statistical theory (with novel type
of variables never accounted for) and application to a pressing issue in

point triangulation to reconstruct a static scene. The triangulation
constraint, however, is invalid for moving points captured in multiple
unsynchronized videos and bundle adjustment is not designed to estimate the
temporal alignment between cameras. We present a spatiotemporal bundle
adjustment framework that jointly optimizes four coupled sub-problems:
estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics, triangulating static 3D points, as
well as sub-frame temporal alignment between cameras and computing 3D
trajectories of dynamic points. Key to our joint optimization is the careful
integration of physics-based motion priors within the reconstruction pipeline,
validated on a large motion capture corpus of human subjects. We devise an
incremental reconstruction and alignment algorithm to strictly enforce the
motion prior during the spatiotemporal bundle adjustment. This algorithm is
further made more efficient by a divide and conquer scheme while still
maintaining high accuracy. We apply this algorithm to reconstruct 3D motion
trajectories of human bodies in dynamic events captured by multiple
uncalibrated and unsynchronized video cameras in the wild. To make the
reconstruction visually more interpretable, we fit a statistical 3D human body
model to the asynchronous video streams.Compared to the baseline, the fitting
significantly benefits from the proposed spatiotemporal bundle adjustment
procedure. Because the videos are aligned with sub-frame precision, we
reconstruct 3D motion at much higher temporal resolution than the input videos.

approach to calculating fish abundance using deep learning for fish and dolphin
estimates from sonar images taken from the back of a trolling boat. We consider
a data set of 143 images ranging from 0-34 fish, and 0-3 dolphins provided by
the Fund Amazonia research group. To overcome the data limitation, we test the
capabilities of data augmentation on an unconventional 15/85 training/testing

images using augmented backgrounds and randomly placed/rotation cropped fish
and dolphin taken from the training set. We then train four multitask network
architectures: DenseNet201, InceptionNetV2, Xception, and MobileNetV2 to
predict fish and dolphin numbers using two function approximation methods:
regression and classification. For regression, Densenet201 performed best for
fish and Xception best for dolphin with mean squared errors of 2.11 and 0.133

MobileNetV2 best for dolphins with a mean error of 2.07 and 0.245 respectively.
Considering the 123 testing images, our results show the success of data

density of 0.18 kg/m^3 (15,000 times more lightweight than aluminum) as a
versatile material for highly efficient propulsion with sunlight. A hollow

aerographite hollow sphere, whose shell is 1 micrometer thick, at 0.04 AU (the
closest approach of the Parker Solar Probe) results in an escape speed of
nearly 6900 km/s and 185 yr of travel to the distance of our nearest star,
Proxima Centauri. The infrared signature of a meter-sized aerographite sail

payload on chemical interstellar rockets is typically a thousandth of the
weight of the rocket. Simplistic communication would enable studies of the
interplanetary medium and a search for the suspected Planet Nine, and would
serve as a precursor mission to alpha Centauri. We estimate prototype

efficiency. Stochastic variance-reduced gradient methods such as SVRG have been
applied to reduce the estimation variance (Zhao et al. 2019). However, due to
the online instance generation nature of reinforcement learning, directly
applying SVRG to deep Q-learning is facing the problem of the inaccurate
estimation of the anchor points, which dramatically limits the potentials of
SVRG. To address this issue and inspired by the recursive gradient variance
reduction algorithm SARAH (Nguyen et al. 2017), this paper proposes to
introduce the recursive framework for updating the stochastic gradient
estimates in deep Q-learning, achieving a novel algorithm called SRG-DQN.
Unlike the SVRG-based algorithms, SRG-DQN designs a recursive update of the
stochastic gradient estimate. The parameter update is along an accumulated
direction using the past stochastic gradient information, and therefore can get
rid of the estimation of the full gradients as the anchors. Additionally,
SRG-DQN involves the Adam process for further accelerating the training
process. Theoretical analysis and the experimental results on well-known
reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of
the proposed SRG-DQN algorithm.

We show that assumptions in their analysis can be weakened, allowing us to
replace their derivation of a crucial function $g$ on the unit square with a
linear program that computes the values of a best possible $g$ under these
assumptions on a discretized unit square. We show that the discretization does
not incur much error, and show computationally that we can obtain a competitive

parallelization, and still needed two days of computing on a 64-core machine.
Furthermore, by modifying our linear program somewhat, we can show
computationally an upper bound on our approach of 0.6688; any further progress
beyond this bound will require either further weakening in the assumptions of

regime: they comprise so many parameters that they can interpolate the training
set, even if actual labels are replaced by purely random ones. Despite this,
they achieve good prediction error on unseen data: interpolating the training
set does not lead to a large generalization error. Further, overparametrization
appears to be beneficial in that it simplifies the optimization landscape. Here
we study these phenomena in the context of two-layers neural networks in the
neural tangent (NT) regime. We consider a simple data model, with isotropic
covariates vectors in $d$ dimensions, and $N$ hidden neurons. We assume that
both the sample size $n$ and the dimension $d$ are large, and they are
polynomially related. Our first main result is a characterization of the
eigenstructure of the empirical NT kernel in the overparametrized regime $Nd\gg
n$. This characterization implies as a corollary that the minimum eigenvalue of
the empirical NT kernel is bounded away from zero as soon as $Nd\gg n$, and
therefore the network can exactly interpolate arbitrary labels in the same
regime.
  Our second main result is a characterization of the generalization error of
NT ridge regression including, as a special case, min-$\ell_2$ norm
interpolation. We prove that, as soon as $Nd\gg n$, the test error is well
approximated by the one of kernel ridge regression with respect to the
infinite-width kernel. The latter is in turn well approximated by the error of
polynomial ridge regression, whereby the regularization parameter is increased
by a `self-induced' term related to the high-degree components of the
activation function. The polynomial degree depends on the sample size and the
dimension (in particular on $\log n/\log d$).

aspects of the data and provide complementary information to each other, to
improve the clustering performance. It remains challenging to effectively
exploit complementary information across multiple views since the original data
often contain noise and are highly redundant. Moreover, most existing
multi-view clustering methods only aim to explore the consistency of all views
while ignoring the local structure of each view. However, it is necessary to
take the local structure of each view into consideration, because different

self-representation feature spaces. Especially, a common cluster structure
regularization is adopted to guarantee consistency among different views. An

the available point annotations to supervise the estimation of the center
points of objects directly. Based on a locally-uniform distribution assumption,
we initialize pseudo object sizes from the point-level supervisory information,
which are then leveraged to guide the regression of object sizes via a
crowdedness-aware loss. Meanwhile, we propose a confidence and order-aware
refinement scheme to continuously refine the initial pseudo object sizes such
that the ability of the detector is increasingly boosted to detect and count
objects in crowds simultaneously. Moreover, to address extremely crowded
scenes, we propose an effective decoding method to improve the detector's
representation ability. Experimental results on the WiderFace benchmark show
that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art point-supervised
methods under both detection and counting tasks, i.e., our method improves the
average precision by more than 10% and reduces the counting error by 31.2%.

the proposed list detection technique uses two candidate-list schemes to
enhance the detection performance. We also incorporate the proposed list

We derive uplink sum-rate expressions that take into account metadata

is essential to account for observations of magnetic fields in the universe. A
theoretical framework attributing the origin and sustainment of these fields to
the so-called fluctuation dynamo was recently validated by experiments on laser
facilities in low-magnetic-Prandtl-number plasmas ($\mathrm{Pm} < 1$). However,
the same framework proposes that the fluctuation dynamo should operate
differently when $\mathrm{Pm} \gtrsim 1$, the regime relevant to many
astrophysical environments such as the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters.
This paper reports a new experiment that creates a laboratory $\mathrm{Pm}
\gtrsim 1$ plasma dynamo for the first time. We provide a time-resolved
characterization of the plasma's evolution, measuring temperatures, densities,
flow velocities and magnetic fields, which allows us to explore various stages
of the fluctuation dynamo's operation. The magnetic energy in structures with
characteristic scales close to the driving scale of the stochastic motions is
found to increase by almost three orders of magnitude from its initial value
and saturate dynamically. It is shown that the growth of these fields occurs
exponentially at a rate that is much greater than the turnover rate of the
driving-scale stochastic motions. Our results point to the possibility that
plasma turbulence produced by strong shear can generate fields more efficiently
at the driving scale than anticipated by idealized MHD simulations of the
nonhelical fluctuation dynamo; this finding could help explain the large-scale
fields inferred from observations of astrophysical systems.

both type-I and type- II band crossings has attracted intense research
interest. However, it remains a challenge to realize hybrid nodal loop in both
two-dimensional (2D) materials and in ferromagnetic (FM) materials. Here, we
propose the first FM hybrid nodal loop in 2D CrN monolayer. We show that the
material has a high Curie temperature (> 600 K) FM ground state, with the
out-of-plane [001] magnetization. It shows a half-metallic band structure with
two bands in the spin-up channel crossing each other near the Fermi level.
These bands produce both type-I and type-II band crossings, which form a fully
spin-polarized hybrid nodal loop. We find the nodal loop is protected by the
mirror symmetry and robust against spin-orbit coupling (SOC). An effective
Hamiltonian characterizing the hybrid nodal loop is established. We further
find the configuration of nodal loop can be shifted under external
perturbations such as strain. Most remarkably, we demonstrate that both type-I
and type-II Weyl nodes can be realized from such FM hybrid nodal loop by simply
shifting the magnetization from out-of-plane to in-plane. Our work provides an
excellent candidate to realize FM hybrid nodal loop and Weyl fermions in 2D

characteristics of misinformation propagated through computational media, and
the devising techniques to address the associated challenges. However, most
work in this area has been concentrated on the cases in the western world
leaving a major portion of this problem unaddressed that is situated in the
Global South. This paper aims to broaden the scope of this discourse by
focusing on this problem in the context of Bangladesh, a country in the Global
South. The spread of misinformation on Facebook in Bangladesh, a country with a
population over 163 million, has resulted in chaos, hate attacks, and killings.
By interviewing journalists, fact-checkers, in addition to surveying the
general public, we analyzed the current state of verifying misinformation in
Bangladesh. Our findings show that most people in the `news audience' want the
news media to verify the authenticity of online information that they see
online. However, the newspaper journalists say that fact-checking online
information is not a part of their job, and it is also beyond their capacity
given the amount of information being published online everyday. We further
find that the voluntary fact-checkers in Bangladesh are not equipped with
sufficient infrastructural support to fill in this gap. We show how our
findings are connected to some of the core concerns of CSCW community around
social media, collaboration, infrastructural politics, and information
inequality. From our analysis, we also suggest several pathways to increase the
impact of fact-checking efforts through collaboration, technology design, and
infrastructure development.

discussed in non-magnetic materials. Here, by using first-principles
calculations and symmetry analysis, we propose the realization of fully
spin-polarized nodal chain in the half-metal state of LiV$_2$O$_4$ compound.
The material naturally shows a ferromagnetic ground state, and takes on a
half-metal band structure with only the bands from the spin-up channel present
near the Fermi level. The spin-up bands cross with each other, which form two
types of nodal loops. These nodal loops arise from band inversion and are under
the protection of the glide mirror symmetries. Remarkably, we find the nodal
loops conjunct with each other and form chain-like nodal structure.
Correspondingly, the w-shaped surface states are also fully spin-polarized. The
fully spin-polarized nodal chain identified here has not been proposed in
realistic materials before. An effective model is constructed to describe the
nature of nodal chain. The effects of the electron correlation, the lattice
strains, and the spin-orbit coupling are discussed. The fully spin-polarized
bulk nodal-chain and the associated nontrivial surface states for a half-metal
may open novel applications in spintronics.

state, where only the spin-up bands present near the Fermi level. These bands
form a Weyl nodal line close to the Fermi level, locating in the kz = 0 plane.
The nodal line is robust against SOC, under the protection of the mirror
symmetry. The nodal line band structure is very clean, thus the drumhead
surface states can be clearly identified. Remarkably, the nodal line and
drumhead surface states have the 100% spin polarization, which are highly
desirable for spintronics applications. In addition, by shifting the magnetic

incomplete data log-likelihood L and the complete data log-likelihood Q are
positively correlated, and we can maximize L by maximizing Q. The Deterministic
Annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm was hence proposed for avoiding locally maximal
Q. This paper provides different conclusions: 1) The popular convergence theory
is wrong; 2) The locally maximal Q can affect the convergent speed, but cannot
block the global convergence; 3) Like marriage competition, unfair competition
between two components may vastly decrease the globally convergent speed; 4)
Local convergence exists because the sample is too small, and unfair
competition exists; 5) An improved EM algorithm, called the Channel Matching
(CM) EM algorithm, can accelerate the global convergence. This paper provides
an initialization map with two means as two axes for the example of a binary
Gaussian mixture studied by the authors of DAEM algorithm. This map can tell
how fast the convergent speeds are for different initial means and why points
in some areas are not suitable as initial points. A two-dimensional example
indicates that the big sample or the fair initialization can avoid global
convergence. For more complicated mixture models, we need further study to
convert the fair marriage principle to specific methods for the

2-step random access approaches would be preferable to 4-step random access
approaches that are employed for most MTC standards in cellular systems. While
2-step approaches are efficient in terms of access delay, their access delay is
still dependent on retransmission strategies. Thus, for a low access delay,
fast retrial that allows immediate re-transmissions can be employed as a
re-transmission strategy. In this paper, we study 2-step random access
approaches with fast retrial as a buffered multichannel ALOHA with fast
retrial, and derive an analytical way to obtain the quality-of-service (QoS)
exponent for the distribution of queue length so that key parameters can be
decided to meet QoS requirements in terms of access delay. Simulation results
confirm that the derived analytical approach can provide a good approximation

bearings need to be monitored to identify any trace of abnormal conditions.
Most of the data-driven approaches applied to bearing fault diagnosis
up-to-date are trained using a large amount of fault data collected a priori.
In many practical applications, however, it can be unsafe and time-consuming to
collect sufficient data samples for each fault category, making it challenging
to train a robust classifier. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning
framework for bearing fault diagnosis based on model-agnostic meta-learning

fault scenarios more efficiently. Case studies on the generalization to new
artificial faults show that the proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy
up to 25% higher than a Siamese network-based benchmark study. Finally, the
robustness and the generalization capability of the proposed framework are
further validated by applying it to identify real bearing damages using data
from artificial damages, which compares favorably against 6 state-of-the-art

latent representation under the model is used to decompose the time series into
a parsimonious set of multivariate sub-sequences. In each sub-sequence,
different data dimensions often share similar temporal patterns but may exhibit
distinct magnitudes, and hence allowing the superposition of all sub-sequences
to exhibit diverse behaviors at different data dimensions. We further
generalize the proposed model by replacing the Gaussian observation layer with
the negative binomial distribution to model multivariate count time series.
Generated from the proposed GGP is an infinite dimensional directed sparse
random graph, which is constructed by taking the logical OR operation of
countably infinite binary adjacency matrices that share the same set of
countably infinite nodes. Each of these adjacency matrices is associated with a
weight to indicate its activation strength, and places a finite number of edges
between a finite subset of nodes belonging to the same node community. We use
the generated random graph, whose number of nonzero-degree nodes is finite, to
define both the sparsity pattern and dimension of the latent state transition
matrix of a (generalized) linear dynamical system. The activation strength of
each node community relative to the overall activation strength is used to
extract a multivariate sub-sequence, revealing the data pattern captured by the

thus important for machine learning models to be capable of proposing different
plausible solutions with meaningful probability measures. In this work we
introduce such a deep learning framework that learns the one-to-many mappings
between the inputs and outputs, together with faithful uncertainty measures. We
call our framework {\it modal uncertainty estimation} since we model the
one-to-many mappings to be generated through a set of discrete latent
variables, each representing a latent mode hypothesis that explains the
corresponding type of input-output relationship. The discrete nature of the
latent representations thus allows us to estimate for any input the conditional
probability distribution of the outputs very effectively. Both the discrete
latent space and its uncertainty estimation are jointly learned during
training. We motivate our use of discrete latent space through the multi-modal
posterior collapse problem in current conditional generative models, then
develop the theoretical background, and extensively validate our method on both
synthetic and realistic tasks. Our framework demonstrates significantly more
accurate uncertainty estimation than the current state-of-the-art methods, and
is informative and convenient for practical use.

theoretically by means of a transfer matrix method. The influence of surface
line defects, acting as structural ripples on propagation of electrons are
studied in two perpendicular directions due to the asymmetry of warped energy
contour under momentum exchange. The transmission profiles and the details of
resonant peaks which vary with the number of defects and the strength of their
potentials are strongly dependent on the direction in which the line defects
extend. At low energies, the quantum interference between the incident and
reflected propagating electrons has the dominant contribution in transmission
resonances, while at high energies the multiple scattering processes on the
constant-energy contour also appear because of the strong warping effect. By
increasing the spatial separation between the line defects, the minimum value
of electrical conductance remains significantly high at low incident energies,
while the minimum value may approach zero at high energies as the number of
defects is increased. Our findings suggest that the potential ripples on the

capacity to use preferential subsidies to effectively dictate system outcomes
are not always applicable to modern decentralized economies. What other types
of mechanisms are feasible? In this paper, we develop and analyze a mechanism
that induces transitions from inefficient lock-ins to superior alternatives.
This mechanism does not exogenously favor one option over another -- instead,
the phase transition emerges endogenously via a standard evolutionary learning
model, Q-learning, where agents trade-off exploration and exploitation.
Exerting the same transient influence to both the efficient and inefficient
technologies encourages exploration and results in irreversible phase
transitions and permanent stabilization of the efficient one. On a technical
level, our work is based on bifurcation and catastrophe theory, a branch of
mathematics that deals with changes in the number and stability properties of
equilibria. Critically, our analysis is shown to be structurally robust to
significant and even adversarially chosen perturbations to the parameters of
both our game and our behavioral model.

the ES finite volume approximation of the RHD equations in curvilinear

implemented by iteratively solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of the mesh
adaption functional in the computational domain with suitably chosen monitor
functions. First, a sufficient condition is proved for the two-point entropy
conservative (EC) flux, by mimicking the derivation of the continuous entropy
identity in curvilinear coordinates and using the discrete geometric
conservation laws given by the conservative metrics method. Based on such
sufficient condition, the EC fluxes for the RHD equations in curvilinear
coordinates are derived and the second-order accurate semi-discrete EC schemes
are developed to satisfy the entropy identity for the given convex entropy
pair. Next, the semi-discrete ES schemes satisfying the entropy inequality are
proposed by adding a suitable dissipation term to the EC scheme and utilizing
linear reconstruction with the minmod limiter in the scaled entropy variables
in order to suppress the numerical oscillations of the above EC scheme. Then,
the semi-discrete ES schemes are integrated in time by using the second-order
strong stability preserving explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Finally, several
numerical results show that our 2D and 3D ES adaptive moving mesh schemes
effectively capture the localized structures, such as sharp transitions or

  Predictability","14 pages, ECCV20",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Latent traversal is a popular approach to visualize the disentangled latent
representations. Given a bunch of variations in a single unit of the latent
representation, it is expected that there is a change in a single factor of
variation of the data while others are fixed. However, this impressive
experimental observation is rarely explicitly encoded in the objective function
of learning disentangled representations. This paper defines the variation
predictability of latent disentangled representations. Given image pairs
generated by latent codes varying in a single dimension, this varied dimension
could be closely correlated with these image pairs if the representation is
well disentangled. Within an adversarial generation process, we encourage
variation predictability by maximizing the mutual information between latent
variations and corresponding image pairs. We further develop an evaluation
metric that does not rely on the ground-truth generative factors to measure the
disentanglement of latent representations. The proposed variation
predictability is a general constraint that is applicable to the VAE and GAN
frameworks for boosting disentanglement of latent representations. Experiments
show that the proposed variation predictability correlates well with existing
ground-truth-required metrics and the proposed algorithm is effective for
disentanglement learning.

MLPs can be seen as a constraint approximation of bilinear operations, thus can
be used to construct deep ABMs in existing CNNs while reusing pretrained
parameters; frame features can be divided into static and dynamic parts because
of visual repetition in adjacent frames, which enables temporal modeling to be
more efficient. Multiple ABM variants and implementations are investigated,
from high performance to high efficiency. Specifically, we show how two-layer

Adversarial Noise (AN) in audio samples transcribed by ASR systems. To this
end, we generated AAEs with the Fast Gradient Sign Method for an end-to-end,

indicators: (1) Character Error Rates (CER) that measure the speech decoding
performance of four ASR models trained on uncompressed, as well as
MP3-compressed data sets and (2) Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) estimated for both
uncompressed and MP3-compressed AAEs that are reconstructed in the time domain

reduces the CER when compared to uncompressed AAEs. Moreover, feature-inverted
(reconstructed) AAEs had significantly higher SNRs after MP3 compression,
indicating that AN was reduced. In contrast to AN, MP3 compression applied to
utterances augmented with regular noise resulted in more transcription errors,
giving further evidence that MP3 encoding is effective in diminishing only AN.

the aim of verifying what the minimum order of the gravitational model to be
considered should be in order to produce realistic results that can be applied
to the analysis and design of real missions. With that purpose, we have
considered a perturbation model that comprises a 50x50 gravitational field and
the third-body attraction from the Earth. Initially, the process of developing
the theory is briefly described. Then, the discussion is focused on the search
for frozen orbits, for which the effect of each harmonic term of the
gravitational model is analyzed separately. As higher-order zonal harmonics are
included, new families of frozen orbits can appear. In addition, the
eccentricity and inclination values for which frozen orbits can exist change.
This effect is very important and needs to be taken into consideration, because
ignoring high-order harmonics can lead to predict the existence of frozen
orbits at certain inclinations at which the frozen-orbit eccentricity actually
falls beyond the impact limit. Consequently, it has been verified that, in
agreement with other authors, a 50x50 gravitational model should be the minimum
to be considered for real applications.

cause of cancer death in the United States. Lung cancer CT screening has been
shown to reduce mortality by up to 40% and is now included in US screening
guidelines. Reducing the high error rates in lung cancer screening is
imperative because of the high clinical and financial costs caused by diagnosis
mistakes. Despite the use of standards for radiological diagnosis, persistent
inter-grader variability and incomplete characterization of comprehensive
imaging findings remain as limitations of current methods. These limitations
suggest opportunities for more sophisticated systems to improve performance and
inter-reader consistency. In this report, we reproduce a state-of-the-art deep
learning algorithm for lung cancer risk prediction. Our model predicts
malignancy probability and risk bucket classification from lung CT studies.
This allows for risk categorization of patients being screened and suggests the
most appropriate surveillance and management. Combining our solution high

highly efficient screening procedures and accelerate the adoption of lung

on-chip optical nanoscopy methods. The sample is illuminated by the evanescent
field generated by the electromagnetic wave modes guided inside the optical
waveguide. In addition to the photokinetics of the fluorophores, the waveguide
modes can be further exploited for introducing controlled intensity
fluctuations for exploitation by techniques such as super-resolution optical
fluctuation imaging (SOFI). However, the problem of non-uniform illumination
pattern generated by the modes contribute to artifacts in the reconstructed
image. To alleviate this problem, we propose to perform Haar wavelet kernel
(HAWK) analysis on the original image stack prior to the application of (SOFI).
HAWK produces a computational image stack with higher spatio-temporal sparsity
than the original stack. In the case of multimoded non-uniform illumination
patterns, HAWK processing bre aks the mode pattern while introducing
spatio-temporal sparsity, thereby differentially affecting the non-uniformity
of the illumination. Consequently, this assists nanoscopy methods such as SOFI
to better support super-resolution, which is otherwise compromised due to
spatial correlation of the mode patterns in the raw image. Furthermore,
applying HAWK prior to SOFI alleviates the problem of artifacts due to
non-uniform illumination without degrading temporal resolution. Our
experimental results demonstrate resolution enhancement as well as reduction in
artifacts through the combination of HAWK and SOFI.

complex reinforcement learning (RL) tasks without access to a reward function
by defining a single fixed preference between pairs of trajectory segments.
However, the judgement of preferences between trajectories is not dynamic and
still requires human input over thousands of iterations. In this study, we
proposed a weak human preference supervision framework, for which we developed
a human preference scaling model that naturally reflects the human perception
of the degree of weak choices between trajectories and established a
human-demonstration estimator via supervised learning to generate the predicted
preferences for reducing the number of human inputs. The proposed weak human
preference supervision framework can effectively solve complex RL tasks and
achieve higher cumulative rewards in simulated robot locomotion -- MuJoCo games
-- relative to the single fixed human preferences. Furthermore, our established
human-demonstration estimator requires human feedback only for less than 0.01\%
of the agent's interactions with the environment and significantly reduces the
cost of human inputs by up to 30\% compared with the existing approaches. To
present the flexibility of our approach, we released a video

unprecedented size and coverage thanks to APOGEE DR16 and Gaia EDR3 data. Our
inner Galactic sample has more than 26,000 stars within $|X_{\rm Gal}| <5$ kpc,
$|Y_{\rm Gal}| <3.5$ kpc, $|Z_{\rm Gal}| <1$ kpc, and we also make the analysis
for a foreground-cleaned sub-sample of 8,000 stars more representative of the
bulge-bar populations. The inner Galaxy shows a clear chemical discontinuity in
key abundance ratios [$\alpha$/Fe], [C/N], and [Mn/O], probing different
enrichment timescales, which suggests a star formation gap (quenching) between
the high- and low-$\alpha$ populations. For the first time, we are able to
fully characterize the different populations co-existing in the innermost
regions of the Galaxy via joint analysis of the distributions of rotational
velocities, metallicities, orbital parameters and chemical abundances. The
chemo-kinematic analysis reveals the presence of the bar; of an inner thin
disk; of a thick disk, and of a broad metallicity population, with a large
velocity dispersion, indicative of a pressure supported component. We find and
characterize chemically and kinematically a group of counter-rotating stars,
which could be the result of a gas-rich merger event or just the result of
clumpy star formation during the earliest phases of the early disk, which
migrated into the bulge. Finally, based on the 6D information we assign stars a
probability value of being on a bar orbit and find that most of the stars with
large bar orbit probabilities come from the innermost 3 kpcs. Even stars with a
high probability of belonging to the bar show the chemical bimodality in the
[$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagram. This suggests bar trapping to be an efficient
mechanism, explaining why stars on bar orbits do not show a significant
distinct chemical abundance ratio signature.

provided conclusive evidence for particle acceleration to at least TeV
energies. Analysis of high spatial resolution X-ray maps of young SNRs has
indicated that the particle acceleration process is accompanied by strong
non-adiabatic amplification of magnetic fields. If Fermi acceleration is the
mechanism producing the energetic cosmic rays (CRs), the amplified magnetic
field must be turbulent and CR-driven instabilities are among the most probable
mechanisms for converting the shock ram pressure into the magnetic turbulence.
The development and evolution of strong magnetic turbulence in the
collisionless plasmas forming SNR shells are complicated phenomena which
include the amplification of magnetic modes, anisotropic mode transformations
at shocks, as well as the nonlinear physics of turbulent cascades. Polarized
X-ray synchrotron radiation from ultra-relativistic electrons accelerated in
the SNR shock is produced in a thin layer immediately behind the shock and is
not subject to the Faraday depolarization effect. These factors open
possibilities to study some properties of magnetic turbulence and here we
present polarized X-ray synchrotron maps of SNR shells assuming different
models of magnetic turbulence cascades. It is shown that different models of
the anisotropic turbulence can be distinguished by measuring the predominant
polarization angle direction. We discuss the detection of these features in
Tycho's SNR with the coming generation of X-ray polarimeters such as the

medicine. Randomized controlled trials are gold-standard for treatment effect
estimation but are typically underpowered for heterogeneous effects. While
large observational studies have high predictive power but are often confounded
due to lack of randomization of treatment. We show that the observational
study, even subject to hidden confounding, may empower trials in estimating the
heterogeneity of treatment effect using the notion of confounding function. The
confounding function summarizes the impact of unmeasured confounders on the
difference in the potential outcomes between the treated and untreated groups
accounting for the observed covariates, which is unidentifiable based only on
the observational study. Coupling the randomized trial and observational study,
we show that the heterogeneity of treatment effect and confounding function are
nonparametrically identifiable. We then derive the semiparametric efficient
scores and the rate-doubly robust integrative estimators of the heterogeneity
of treatment effect and confounding function under parametric structural
models. We clarify the conditions under which the integrative estimator of the
heterogeneity of treatment effect is strictly more efficient than the trial
estimator. We illustrate the integrative estimators via simulation and an

rows of tandem cylinders. Local stability analysis shows that the wakes of two
tandem cylinders are characterised by the formation of a region where the mean
flow is locally absolutely unstable immediately behind the second cylinder,
followed by a long region that is convectively unstable. The location where the
flow changes from absolutely to convectively unstable provides a prediction of
where the placement of a third body could trigger a global change, which is
confirmed with simulations of the flow past three cylinders, and the flow past
two cylinders followed by a short flat plate. A third body placed downstream of
the absolute/convective instability transition location is effectively cloaked,
its presence having virtually no impact on the flow both upstream and
downstream. However, when a body is placed upstream of this location it
triggers a global change in the flow, its presence being broadcast throughout
the flow domain. However, a third cylinder placed well upstream of this
location does not trigger the global change. Sensitivity analysis of the mean
flow is conducted, and it is shown that the third cylinder does not simply act
as a small perturbation that can excite sensitive regions, but when it is very
close to the second cylinder it induces a mean flow correction that eliminates
the sensitive regions which may explain why it does not trigger the global
change.

model and offers prediction (inference) service to users. In this setting, our
objective is to protect the confidentiality of both the users' input queries as
well as the model parameters at the server, with modest computation and
communication overhead. Prior solutions primarily propose fine-tuning
cryptographic methods to make them efficient for known fixed model
architectures. The drawback with this line of approach is that the model itself
is never designed to operate with existing efficient cryptographic
computations. We observe that the network architecture, internal functions, and
parameters of a model, which are all chosen during training, significantly
influence the computation and communication overhead of a cryptographic method,
during inference. Based on this observation, we propose SOTERIA -- a training
method to construct model architectures that are by-design efficient for
private inference. We use neural architecture search algorithms with the dual
objective of optimizing the accuracy of the model and the overhead of using
cryptographic primitives for secure inference. Given the flexibility of
modifying a model during training, we find accurate models that are also
efficient for private computation. We select garbled circuits as our underlying
cryptographic primitive, due to their expressiveness and efficiency, but this
approach can be extended to hybrid multi-party computation settings. We
empirically evaluate SOTERIA on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, to compare with the
prior work. Our results confirm that SOTERIA is indeed effective in balancing
performance and accuracy.

learning experience. However, the poor ability of adapting to dynamic
environments remains a major challenge for AI models. To better understand this
issue, we study the problem of continual domain adaptation, where the model is
presented with a labeled source domain and a sequence of unlabeled target
domains. There are two major obstacles in this problem: domain shifts and
catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose Gradient Regularized
Contrastive Learning to solve the above obstacles. At the core of our method,
gradient regularization plays two key roles: (1) enforces the gradient of
contrastive loss not to increase the supervised training loss on the source
domain, which maintains the discriminative power of learned features; (2)
regularizes the gradient update on the new domain not to increase the
classification loss on the old target domains, which enables the model to adapt
to an in-coming target domain while preserving the performance of previously
observed domains. Hence our method can jointly learn both semantically
discriminative and domain-invariant features with labeled source domain and
unlabeled target domains. The experiments on Digits, DomainNet and

The network fuses multiple branches of tree-structured graph convolution layers

Each branch learns to grow a different shape part, offering control over the
shape generation at the part level. Our network encourages disentangled
generation of semantic parts via two key ingredients: a root-mixing training
strategy which helps decorrelate the different branches to facilitate
disentanglement, and a set of loss terms designed with part disentanglement and
shape semantics in mind. Of these, a novel convexity loss incentivizes the
generation of parts that are more convex, as semantic parts tend to be. In
addition, a root-dropping loss further ensures that each root seeds a single
part, preventing the degeneration or over-growth of the point-producing
branches. We evaluate the performance of our network on a number of 3D shape
classes, and offer qualitative and quantitative comparisons to previous works
and baseline approaches. We demonstrate the controllability offered by our
part-disentangled generation through two applications for shape modeling: part
mixing and individual part variation, without receiving segmented shapes as

fully releases the object to the receiver. However, important cognitive and
physical processes begin before the physical exchange, including initiating
implicit agreement with respect to the location and timing of the exchange.

physical exchange. We focus our analysis on the two actors (giver and receiver)
and report the state of the art of robotic givers (robot-to-human handovers)

WaveGAN (PWG) model using pitch-dependent dilated convolution networks
(PDCNNs). PWG is a small-footprint GAN-based raw waveform generative model,
whose generation time is much faster than real time because of its compact
model and non-autoregressive (non-AR) and non-causal mechanisms. Although PWG
achieves high-fidelity speech generation, the generic and simple network
architecture lacks pitch controllability for an unseen auxiliary fundamental
frequency ($F_{0}$) feature such as a scaled $F_{0}$. To improve the pitch
controllability and speech modeling capability, we apply a QP structure with
PDCNNs to PWG, which introduces pitch information to the network by dynamically
changing the network architecture corresponding to the auxiliary $F_{0}$
feature. Both objective and subjective experimental results show that QPPWG
outperforms PWG when the auxiliary $F_{0}$ feature is scaled. Moreover,
analyses of the intermediate outputs of QPPWG also show better tractability and
interpretability of QPPWG, which respectively models spectral and
excitation-like signals using the cascaded fixed and adaptive blocks of the QP
structure.

simultaneous large particle and small noise limit. Our work extends recent
results of Orrieri (2018), in which the diffusion coefficient is taken to be

the mean field interaction influencing both the drift and diffusion

constrain the dynamical mass of the system. We introduce a new method based on
the concept of the curve of growth to derive a set of robust parameters to
characterize the line width, asymmetry, and concentration of the integrated H I

estimate realistic systematic uncertainties for the proposed parameters, and to
correct the line widths for the effects of instrumental resolution and
turbulence broadening. Using a large sample of nearby galaxies with available
spatially resolved kinematics, we demonstrate that the newly defined line
widths can predict the rotational velocities of galaxies to within an accuracy
of $\lesssim 30$ km s$^{-1}$. We use the calibrated line widths, in conjunction

formulate a prescription for estimating the dynamical mass within the H

Each arm's signal follows a distribution from a vector exponential family. The
actual parameters of the arms are unknown to the decision maker. The decision
maker incurs a delay cost for delay until a decision and a switching cost
whenever he switches from one arm to another. His goal is to minimise the
overall cost until a decision is reached on the true hypothesis. Of interest
are policies that satisfy a given constraint on the probability of false
detection. This is a sequential decision making problem where the decision
maker gets only a limited view of the true state of nature at each stage, but
can control his view by choosing the arm to observe at each stage. An
information-theoretic lower bound on the total cost (expected time for a
reliable decision plus total switching cost) is first identified, and a
variation on a sequential policy based on the generalised likelihood ratio
statistic is then studied. Due to the vector exponential family assumption, the
signal processing at each stage is simple; the associated conjugate prior
distribution on the unknown model parameters enables easy updates of the
posterior distribution. The proposed policy, with a suitable threshold for
stopping, is shown to satisfy the given constraint on the probability of false
detection. Under a continuous selection assumption, the policy is also shown to
be asymptotically optimal in terms of the total cost among all policies that

generally increase as Mg is replaced by Ca or Fe. However, two bands in

its prototype implementation and evaluation at ISO New England, the solution
has demonstrated two major advantages. Firstly, the cloud infrastructure is

operators need to work remotely away from the control center. Secondly, the
overall design is event-driven using serverless cloud services in response to
the SCADA/EMS failure event. Thanks to ""serverless"", the burden of the server
provisioning and maintenance can be avoided from the user side. The cost of
using public cloud services for this solution is extremely low since it is
architected and implemented based on the event-driven Function-as-a-Service

  overlap with arXiv:1912.07104",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian model selection is premised on the assumption that the data are
generated from one of the postulated models. However, in many applications, all
of these models are incorrect (that is, there is misspecification). When the
models are misspecified, two or more models can provide a nearly equally good
fit to the data, in which case Bayesian model selection can be highly unstable,
potentially leading to self-contradictory findings. To remedy this instability,
we propose to use bagging on the posterior distribution (""BayesBag"") -- that
is, to average the posterior model probabilities over many bootstrapped
datasets. We provide theoretical results characterizing the asymptotic behavior
of the posterior and the bagged posterior in the (misspecified) model selection
setting. We empirically assess the BayesBag approach on synthetic and
real-world data in (i) feature selection for linear regression and (ii)
phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Our theory and experiments show that, when
all models are misspecified, BayesBag (a) provides greater reproducibility and
(b) places posterior mass on optimal models more reliably, compared to the
usual Bayesian posterior; on the other hand, under correct specification,
BayesBag is slightly more conservative than the usual posterior, in the sense
that BayesBag posterior probabilities tend to be slightly farther from the
extremes of zero and one. Overall, our results demonstrate that BayesBag
provides an easy-to-use and widely applicable approach that improves upon
Bayesian model selection by making it more stable and reproducible.

system to an external observer, namely intruder. The conventional opacity that
has been studied in the Discrete Event System (DES) literature usually assumes
passive intruders, who only observe the behavior of the system. However, in
many cybersecurity concerns, such as web service, active intruders, who are
capable of influencing the system's behavior beyond passive observations, need
to be considered and defended against. We are therefore motivated to extend the
opacity notions to handle active intruders. For this, we model the system as a
non-deterministic finite-state transducer. It is assumed that the intruder has
a full knowledge of the system structure and is capable of interacting with the
system by injecting different inputs and observing its responses. In this
setup, we first introduce reactive current-state opacity (RCSO) notion
characterizing a property that the system does not leak its secret state
regardless of how the intruder manipulates the system behavior. We furthermore
extend this notion to language-based and initial-state reactive opacity
notions, and study the relationship among them. It turns out that all the
proposed reactive opacity notions are equivalent to RCSO. We therefore focus on
RCSO and study its verification problem. It is shown that the RCSO can be
verified by constructing an observer automaton.

so a better understanding of damage micro-mechanisms and hydrogen diffusion
within the metal is needed. Local concentrations depend on transport phenomena
including trapping effects, which are usually characterised by a
temperature-programmed desorption method often referred to as Thermal
Desorption Analysis (TDA). When the hydrogen is released from the specimen
during the programmed heating, some desorption peaks are observed that are
commonly related to detrapping energies by means of an analytical procedure.
The limitations of this approach are revisited here and gaseous hydrogen
charging at high temperatures is simulated. This popular procedure enables
attaining high concentrations due to the higher solubility of hydrogen at high
temperatures. However, the segregation behaviour of hydrogen into traps depends
on charging time and temperature. This process and the subsequent cooling alter
hydrogen distribution are numerically modelled; it is found that TDA spectra
are strongly affected by the charging temperature and the charging time, both
for weak and strong traps. However, the influence of ageing time at room
temperature after cooling and before desorption is only appreciable for weak
traps.

analysis of the use of machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement
learning solutions to recognize intrusive behavior in the collected traffic. We
evaluate the proposed mechanisms by using KD'99 as real attack data-set in our
simulations. Results present the performance metrics for three different IDSs
namely the Adaptively Supervised and Clustered Hybrid IDS (ASCH-IDS),
Restricted Boltzmann Machine-based Clustered IDS (RBC-IDS) and Q-learning based
IDS (QL-IDS) to detect malicious behaviors. We also present the performance of
different reinforcement learning techniques such as
State-Action-Reward-State-Action Learning (SARSA) and the Temporal Difference

  The system has exhibited a high creative power and versatility to produce
music of different types and it has been tested, proving on many occasions the
outcome to be indistinguishable from the music made by human composers. The
system has also enabled the emergence of a set of completely novel
applications: from effective tools to help anyone to easily obtain the precise
music that they need, to radically new uses, such as adaptive music for
therapy, exercise, amusement and many others. It seems clear that automated
