collection of CAS objects. Taking a snapshot allows later operations to read
the value that each CAS object had at the time the snapshot was taken. Taking a
snapshot requires a constant number of steps and returns a handle to the
snapshot. Reading a snapshotted value of an individual CAS object using this
handle is wait-free, taking time proportional to the number of successful CASes
on the object since the snapshot was taken. Our fast, flexible snapshots yield
simple, efficient implementations of atomic multi-point queries on concurrent
data structures built from CAS objects. For example, in a search tree where
child pointers are updated using CAS, once a snapshot is taken, one can
atomically search for ranges of keys, find the first key that matches some
criteria, or check if a collection of keys are all present, simply by running a
standard sequential algorithm on a snapshot of the tree.
  To evaluate the performance of our approach, we apply it to two search trees,
one balanced and one not. Experiments show that the overhead of supporting
snapshots is low across a variety of workloads. Moreover, in almost all cases,
range queries on the trees built from our snapshots perform as well as or
better than state-of-the-art concurrent data structures that support atomic

feature aggregation(RFA), to express the two kinds of features and reconstruct
coordinates from their combination. In addition, we also design a refinement

achieve $O(\log n)$-approximation in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time or a constant factor

$\Omega(n^{2-\epsilon})$ lower bound for Sparsest Cut even in planar graphs
with unit vertex weights, under the $(min,+)$-Convolution conjecture, showing
that approximations are inevitable in the near-linear time regime. To
complement the lower bound, we provide a constant factor approximation in
near-linear time, improving upon the 25-year old result of Rao in both time and
accuracy.
  Our lower bound accomplishes a repeatedly raised challenge by being the first
fine-grained lower bound for a natural planar graph problem in P. Moreover, we
prove near-quadratic lower bounds under SETH for variants of the closest pair

improved higher-order matching algorithms on warped images due to projection.
Although currently, several existing methods ""flatten"" such 3D images to use
planar graph / hypergraph matching methods, they still suffer from severe
distortions and other undesired artifacts, which result in inaccurate matching.
Alternatively, current planar methods cannot be trivially extended to
effectively match points on images warped onto manifolds. Hence, matching on

the assignment problem as finding a bijective map between two graph induced
simplicial complexes, which are higher-order analogues of graphs. We propose a
constrained quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that matches each p-skeleton of

value of particular spin configuration, i.e, the approximation is taken into
account within each configuration. This approximation is used in two different
mean-field-type approaches. The first consideration is a pure-mean-field-type
treatment in which all the neighboring spins are replaced with the assumed
configurational average. The second consideration is introduced by the reduced
transfer matrix method. The estimations of critical coupling values of the
systems are evaluated both numerically and also analytically by the using of
saddle point approximation. The analytical estimation of critical values in the
first and second considerations are $ K_{c}=\frac{1}{z} $ and $ (z-2)
K_{c}e^{2K_{c}} =1 $ respectively. Obviously, both of the considerations have
some significant deviation from the exact treatment. In this work, we conclude
that the method introduced here is more appropriate physical picture than
self-consistent mean-field-type models, because the method introduced here does
not presume the presence of the phase transition from the outset. Consequently,
the introduced approach potentially makes our research very valuable
mean-field-type picture for phase transition treatment.

Moreover, to effectively optimize the posterior distribution of the prototype

distribution in $d$ dimensions, when the samples are truncated by a set $S

time that the computational and statistical complexity of learning from

  We introduce a natural notion of fatness of the truncation set $S$, under
which truncated samples reveal enough information about the true distribution.
We show that if the truncation set is sufficiently fat, samples from the true
distribution can be generated from truncated samples. A stunning consequence is
that virtually any statistical task (e.g., learning in total variation
distance, parameter estimation, uniformity or identity testing) that can be
performed efficiently for Boolean product distributions, can also be performed
from truncated samples, with a small increase in sample complexity. We
generalize our approach to ranking distributions over $d$ alternatives, where
we show how fatness implies efficient parameter estimation of Mallows models
from truncated samples.
  Exploring the limits of learning discrete models from truncated samples, we
identify three natural conditions that are necessary for efficient
identifiability: (i) the truncation set $S$ should be rich enough; (ii) $S$
should be accessible through membership queries; and (iii) the truncation by
$S$ should leave enough randomness in all directions. By carefully adapting the

Starting from a canonical tangency circle packing with the desired number of

a circle packing for any desired (proper) contact graph with the same number of

  In this paper, we extend the Connelly-Gortler method to allow circles to
overlap by angles up to $\pi/2$. As a result, we obtain a new proof of the

propose an algorithm of Iteratively Projected SVD (IP-SVD) for the

space spanned by covariates and applies SVD on matricized tensors over each

tensor factor. Compared with the Tucker decomposition, IP-SVD yields more
accurate estimates with a faster convergence rate. Besides estimation, we show
several prediction methods with newly observed covariates based on the STEFA

the STEFA model and the IP-SVD algorithm on both the estimation and prediction
tasks.

record event logs. Conformance checking relies on these logs to analyze whether
the recorded behavior of a process conforms to the behavior of a normative
specification. A key assumption of existing conformance checking techniques,
however, is that all events are associated with timestamps that allow to infer
a total order of events per process instance. Unfortunately, this assumption is
often violated in practice. Due to synchronization issues, manual event
recordings, or data corruption, events are only partially ordered. In this
paper, we put forward the problem of partial order resolution of event logs to
close this gap. It refers to the construction of a probability distribution
over all possible total orders of events of an instance. To cope with the order
uncertainty in real-world data, we present several estimators for this task,
incorporating different notions of behavioral abstraction. Moreover, to reduce
the runtime of conformance checking based on partial order resolution, we
introduce an approximation method that comes with a bounded error in terms of
accuracy. Our experiments with real-world and synthetic data reveal that our
approach improves accuracy over the state-of-the-art considerably.

effective selective planning mechanism requires estimating predictive

have shown great potentials to relieve the demand of expensive per-pixel
annotations. However, most existing works address the domain discrepancy by
aligning the data distributions of two domains at a global image level whereas
the local consistencies are largely neglected. This paper presents an
innovative local contextual-relation consistent domain adaptation (CrCDA)
technique that aims to achieve local-level consistencies during the
global-level alignment. The idea is to take a closer look at region-wise
feature representations and align them for local-level consistencies.
Specifically, CrCDA learns and enforces the prototypical local
contextual-relations explicitly in the feature space of a labelled source
domain while transferring them to an unlabelled target domain via
backpropagation-based adversarial learning. An adaptive entropy max-min
adversarial learning scheme is designed to optimally align these hundreds of
local contextual-relations across domain without requiring discriminator or
extra computation overhead. The proposed CrCDA has been evaluated extensively
over two challenging domain adaptive segmentation tasks (e.g., GTA5 to

and supervised techniques, in both their traditional and deep versions, are
becoming the most frequently used ones for prediction in this area of space
weather. Yet, machine learning has not been able so far to realize an operating
warning system for flaring storms and the scientific literature of the last
decade suggests that its performances in the prediction of intense solar flares
are not optimal.
  The main difficulties related to forecasting solar flaring storms are
probably two. First, most methods are conceived to provide probabilistic
predictions and not to send binary yes/no indications on the consecutive
occurrence of flares along an extended time range. Second, flaring storms are
typically characterized by the explosion of high energy events, which are
seldom recorded in the databases of space missions; as a consequence,
supervised methods are trained on very imbalanced historical sets, which makes
them particularly ineffective for the forecasting of intense flares.
  Yet, in this study we show that supervised machine learning could be utilized
in a way to send timely warnings about the most violent and most unexpected
flaring event of the last decade, and even to predict with some accuracy the
energy budget daily released by magnetic reconnection during the whole time
course of the storm. Further, we show that the combination of
sparsity-enhancing machine learning and feature ranking could allow the
identification of the prominent role that energy played as an Active Region
property in the forecasting process.

questions: Do sponsors influence the organizational structures of free software
communities by promoting differences between sponsored and non-sponsored
communities? What strategies are adopted by the sponsor to influence the
organizational structure of free software communities? Two constructs are
central to the study: organizational structure and sponsorship. For this
research, we adopted case study methodology and three free software communities
were studied. In the analysis of the results it was evidenced that sponsors
influence decision making, definition of community key roles, and a
formalization of norms. In turn, nonsponsored communities were characterized by
the centralization and informality of the norms. We conclude that differences
were identified in the organizational structure of sponsored and nonsponsored
free software communities, and this differentiation was influenced by sponsors.
In addition, it was possible to describe strategies and mechanisms used by
sponsors to influence the community organizational structure.

way to define a notion of a continuous underlying learning problem. In this
view, neural networks can be interpreted as a discretization of a parametric
Ordinary Differential Equation which, in the limit, defines a continuous-depth
neural network. The learning task then consists in finding the best ODE
parameters for the problem under consideration, and their number increases with
the accuracy of the time discretization. Although important steps have been
taken to realize the advantages of such continuous formulations, most current
learning techniques fix a discretization (i.e. the number of layers is fixed).
In this work, we propose an iterative adaptive algorithm where we progressively
refine the time discretization (i.e. we increase the number of layers).
Provided that certain tolerances are met across the iterations, we prove that
the strategy converges to the underlying continuous problem. One salient
advantage of such a shallow-to-deep approach is that it helps to benefit in
practice from the higher approximation properties of deep networks by
mitigating over-parametrization issues. The performance of the approach is
illustrated in several numerical examples.

affect the sample heterogeneity. However, the covariates' influence on

completion, a dense depth map can be generated by assigning each camera pixel a
corresponding depth value. However, the existing depth completion convolutional
neural networks are very complex that requires high-end GPUs for processing,
and thus they are not applicable to real-time autonomous driving. In this
paper, a light-weight network is proposed for the task of LiDAR point cloud
depth completion. With an astonishing 96.2% reduction in the number of
parameters, it still achieves comparable performance (9.3% better in MAE but
3.9% worse in RMSE) to the state-of-the-art network. For real-time embedded
platforms, depthwise separable technique is applied to both convolution and
deconvolution operations and the number of parameters decreases further by a
factor of 7.3, with only a small percentage increase in RMSE and MAE
performance. Moreover, a system-on-chip architecture for depth completion is
developed on a PYNQ-based FPGA platform that achieves real-time processing for

viewpoint or object pose. To address this problem, several recent approaches
leverage intermediate voxel-based representations in combination with
differentiable rendering. However, existing methods either produce low image
resolution or fall short in disentangling camera and scene properties, e.g.,
the object identity may vary with the viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a
generative model for radiance fields which have recently proven successful for
novel view synthesis of a single scene. In contrast to voxel-based
representations, radiance fields are not confined to a coarse discretization of
the 3D space, yet allow for disentangling camera and scene properties while
degrading gracefully in the presence of reconstruction ambiguity. By
introducing a multi-scale patch-based discriminator, we demonstrate synthesis
of high-resolution images while training our model from unposed 2D images

approaches. Our generative model consists of a normalizing flow (NF), a
probabilistic and invertible neural network, trained on the internal embeddings
of the network. By keeping a single NF conditioned on the task, we show that
our memory overhead remains constant. In addition, exploiting the invertibility
of the NF, we propose a simple approach to regularize the network's embeddings
with respect to past tasks. We show that our method performs favorably with
respect to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, with bounded
computational power and memory overheads.

Semi-conductor photo sensors have replaced photo multiplier tubes in numerous

the surface conditions of the sensor and influences the probability for
crosstalk photons to leave the sensor without inducing secondary breakdowns.
This study compares properties of sensors that are optically coupled to light

that the optical coupling to a light guide significantly reduces the crosstalk

such as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces,
more general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best
configuration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces
the practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product
space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration
search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared
between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a
result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.
Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since
their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces
outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both
distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,
where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively
solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also
perform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where
we compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the
proposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without
any configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be
significant in large-scale applications.

independently distributed on the unit square, where two vertices are connected
by an edge if their Euclidian distance is less or equal than the connection
radius $\ell \in [0,\sqrt{2}]$. To evaluate the topological properties of RGGs
we chose two well-known topological indices, the Randi\'c index $R(G)$ and the
harmonic index $H(G)$. While we characterize the spectral and eigenvector
properties of the corresponding randomly-weighted adjacency matrices by the use
of random matrix theory measures: the ratio between consecutive eigenvalue
spacings, the inverse participation ratios and the information or Shannon
entropies $S(G)$. First, we review the scaling properties of the averaged
measures, topological and spectral, on RGGs. Then we show that: (i) the
averaged--scaled indices, $\left\langle R(G) \right\rangle$ and $\left\langle
H(G) \right\rangle$, are highly correlated with the average number of
non-isolated vertices $\left\langle V_\times(G) \right\rangle$; and (ii)
surprisingly, the averaged--scaled Shannon entropy $\left\langle S(G)

We introduce a simple training heuristic, Representation Self-Challenging

activated on the training data, and forces the network to activate remaining
features that correlates with labels. This process appears to activate feature

typical tasks in analyzing genomics data. Though many general-purpose
algorithms were developed for prediction, dealing with highly correlated genes
in the prediction model is still not well addressed. High correlation among
genes introduces technical problems, such as multi-collinearity issues, leading
to unreliable prediction models. Furthermore, when a causal gene (whose
variants have an actual biological effect on a phenotype) is highly correlated
with other genes, most algorithms select the feature gene from the correlated
group in a purely data-driven manner. Since the correlation structure among
genes could change substantially when condition changes, the prediction model
based on not correctly selected feature genes is unreliable. Therefore, we aim
to keep the causal biological signal in the prediction process and build a more
robust prediction model.
  Method: We propose a grouping algorithm, which treats highly correlated genes
as a group and uses their common pattern to represent the group's biological
signal in feature selection. Our novel grouping algorithm can be integrated
into existing prediction algorithms to enhance their prediction performance.
Our proposed grouping method has two advantages. First, using the gene group's
common patterns makes the prediction more robust and reliable under condition
change. Second, it reports whole correlated gene groups as discovered
biomarkers for prediction tasks, allowing researchers to conduct follow-up
studies to identify causal genes within the identified groups.
  Result: Using real benchmark scRNA-seq datasets with simulated cell
phenotypes, we demonstrate our novel method significantly outperforms standard
models in both (1) prediction of cell phenotypes and (2) feature gene
selection.

recalibrate these surveys by tying their tertiary survey stars to Pan-STARRS1

by taking the spatially variable zeropoints of each telescope/camera into
account, and applying improved color transformations in the surveys' natural

of the data which produces a covariance matrix of magnitude offsets and
bandpass shifts, quantifying and reducing the systematic uncertainties in the

also from simply tying our calibration to more color calibrators, rather than

To minimize the requirement of domain knowledge, the fitting ability of deep

avoid human intervention and annotation. To facilitate flexible applications,
the robustness of the proposed scheme is achieved without requiring any prior

line of emerging research involves formulating an optimization-based
reconstruction method in the latent space of a generative deep neural network.
However, when generative adversarial networks (GANs) are employed, such methods
can result in image reconstruction errors if the sought-after solution does not
reside within the range of the GAN. To circumvent this problem, in this work, a
framework for reconstructing images from incomplete measurements is proposed
that is formulated in the latent space of invertible neural network-based
generative models. A novel regularization strategy is introduced that takes
advantage of the multiscale architecture of certain invertible neural networks,
which can result in improved reconstruction performance over classical methods
in terms of traditional metrics. The proposed method is investigated for
reconstructing images from undersampled MRI data. The method is shown to
achieve comparable performance to a state-of-the-art generative model-based
reconstruction method while benefiting from a deterministic reconstruction
procedure and easier control over regularization parameters.

media through the use of wireless carriers such as radio frequency (RF) and

indoor scenarios, overloads conventional RF technologies. Therefore,
technologies such as millimeter waves (mmWave) and cognitive radios have been
adopted as possible solutions to overcome the spectrum scarcity and capacity
limitations of the conventional RF systems. In parallel, visible light
communication (VLC) has been proposed as an alternative solution, where a light
source is used for both illumination and data transmission. In comparison to RF
links, VLC links present a very high bandwidth that allows much higher data
rates. VLC exhibits also immunity to interference from electromagnetic sources,
has unlicensed channels, is a very low power consumption system, and has no
health hazard. VLC is appealing for a wide range of applications including
reliable communications with low latency such as vehicle safety communication.
Despite the major advantages of VLC technology and a variety of its
applications, its use has been hampered by its cons such as its dependence on a
line of sight connectivity. Recently, hybrid RF/VLC systems were proposed to
take advantage of the high capacity of VLC links and better connectivity of RF
links. Thus, hybrid RF/VLC systems are envisioned as a key enabler to improve
the user rates and mobility on one hand and to optimize the capacity,
interference and power consumption of the overall network on the other hand.
This paper seeks to provide a detailed survey of hybrid RF/VLC systems. This

procedure is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing dynamic
pricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice
models, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of
learned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online
statistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes
the challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses
several appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation
that the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online
regularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the
proposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP)
pricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into
pricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with
always-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with
time-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic
inference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic
pricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm
exploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a
logarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made
possible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves
dynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of
non-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in
different synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that
OORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods.

involving the new concept of approximate consistency and the method of

without ranking reversal are addressed and called ranking equilibrium. The
likelihood of ranking reversal is captured by introducing a possibility degree

chamber means the effect of user interests being reinforced through repeated

of echo chamber in two steps. First, we explore whether user interests have

exposure of similar contents. Our evaluations are enhanced with robust metrics,

Before making purchases on e-commerce websites, most consumers tend to rely on
rating scores and review information to make purchase decisions. With this
information, they can infer the quality of products to reduce the risk of
purchase. Specifically, items with high rating scores and good reviews tend to
be less risky, while items with low rating scores and bad reviews might be
risky to purchase. On the other hand, the purchase behaviors will also be
influenced by consumers' tolerance of risks, known as the risk attitudes.
Economists have studied risk attitudes for decades. These studies reveal that
people are not always rational enough when making decisions, and their risk
attitudes may vary in different circumstances.
  Most existing works over recommendation systems do not consider users' risk
attitudes in modeling, which may lead to inappropriate recommendations to
users. For example, suggesting a risky item to a risk-averse person or a
conservative item to a risk-seeking person may result in the reduction of user
experience. In this paper, we propose a novel risk-aware recommendation
framework that integrates machine learning and behavioral economics to uncover
the risk mechanism behind users' purchasing behaviors. Concretely, we first
develop statistical methods to estimate the risk distribution of each item and
then draw the Nobel-award winning Prospect Theory into our model to learn how
users choose from probabilistic alternatives that involve risks, where the
probabilities of the outcomes are uncertain. Experiments on several e-commerce
datasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve better performance than many
classical recommendation approaches, and further analyses also verify the
advantages of risk-aware recommendation beyond accuracy.

embeddings for text-independent speaker verification systems. By introducing
the residual connections to the CNN and standardizing the residual blocks, the
ResNet structure is capable of training deep networks to achieve highly
competitive recognition performance. However, when the input feature space
becomes more complicated, simply increasing the depth and width of the ResNet
network may not fully realize its performance potential. In this paper, we
present two extensions of the ResNet architecture, ResNeXt and Res2Net, for
speaker verification. Originally proposed for image recognition, the ResNeXt
and Res2Net introduce two more dimensions, cardinality and scale, in addition
to depth and width, to improve the model's representation capacity. By
increasing the scale dimension, the Res2Net model can represent multi-scale
features with various granularities, which particularly facilitates speaker
verification for short utterances. We evaluate our proposed systems on three
speaker verification tasks. Experiments on the VoxCeleb test set demonstrated
that the ResNeXt and Res2Net can significantly outperform the conventional
ResNet model. The Res2Net model achieved superior performance by reducing the
EER by 18.5% relative. Experiments on the other two internal test sets of
mismatched conditions further confirmed the generalization of the ResNeXt and
Res2Net architectures against noisy environment and segment length variations.

parameter in condensed matter systems can mimic the Higgs boson, an elementary
particle in the standard model, and are dubbed as Higgs modes. Identifying the
condensed-matter Higgs mode is challenging because it is known in many cases to
decay rapidly into other low-energy bosonic modes, which renders the Higgs mode
invisible. Therefore, it is desirable to find a way to stabilize the Higgs
mode, which can offer an insight into the stabilization mechanism of the Higgs
mode in condensed matter physics. In quantum magnets, magnetic order caused by
spontaneous symmetry breaking supports transverse (magnons) and longitudinal
(Higgs modes) fluctuations. When a continuous symmetry is broken, the Goldstone
magnon mode generally has a lower excitation energy than the Higgs mode,
causing a rapid decay of the latter. In this work, we show that a stable Higgs
mode exists in anisotropic quantum magnets near the quantum critical point
between the dimerized and magnetically ordered phases. We find that an easy
axis anisotropy increases the magnon gap such that the magnon mode is above the
Higgs mode near the quantum critical point, and the decay of the Higgs mode
into the magnon mode is forbidden kinematically. Our results suggest that the
anisotropic quantum magnets provide ideal platforms to explore the Higgs
physics in condensed matter systems.

Unlike most previous methods using unlabeled frames individually, we propose a
dual motion based method to wisely learn motion flows for segmentation
enhancement by leveraging temporal dynamics. We firstly design a flow predictor
to derive the motion for jointly propagating the frame-label pairs given the
current labeled frame. Considering the fast instrument motion, we further
introduce a flow compensator to estimate intermediate motion within continuous
frames, with a novel cycle learning strategy. By exploiting generated data
pairs, our framework can recover and even enhance temporal consistency of
training sequences to benefit segmentation. We validate our framework with
binary, part, and type tasks on 2017 MICCAI EndoVis Robotic Instrument
Segmentation Challenge dataset. Results show that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods by a large margin, and even exceeds
fully supervised training on two tasks.

need for text-based video retrieval systems. Traditional methods mainly favor
the concept-based paradigm on retrieval with simple queries, which are usually
ineffective for complex queries that carry far more complex semantics.
Recently, embedding-based paradigm has emerged as a popular approach. It aims
to map the queries and videos into a shared embedding space where
semantically-similar texts and videos are much closer to each other. Despite
its simplicity, it forgoes the exploitation of the syntactic structure of text
queries, making it suboptimal to model the complex queries.
  To facilitate video retrieval with complex queries, we propose a
Tree-augmented Cross-modal Encoding method by jointly learning the linguistic
structure of queries and the temporal representation of videos. Specifically,
given a complex user query, we first recursively compose a latent semantic tree
to structurally describe the text query. We then design a tree-augmented query
encoder to derive structure-aware query representation and a temporal attentive
video encoder to model the temporal characteristics of videos. Finally, both
the query and videos are mapped into a joint embedding space for matching and
ranking. In this approach, we have a better understanding and modeling of the
complex queries, thereby achieving a better video retrieval performance.
Extensive experiments on large scale video retrieval benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

order discretization of boundary integral equations (BIEs) using the

be parameterized using a uniform grid on a rectangle, such as deformed tori, or
channels with periodic boundary conditions. When a BIE on such a geometry is
discretized using the Nystr\""{o}m method based on the Trapezoidal quadrature
rule, the resulting scheme tends to converge only slowly, due to the
singularity in the kernel function. The key finding of the manuscript is that
the convergence order can be greatly improved by modifying only a very small
number of elements in the coefficient matrix. Specifically, it is demonstrated
that by correcting only the diagonal entries in the coefficient matrix,
$O(h^{3})$ convergence can be attained for the single and double layer
potentials associated with both the Laplace and the Helmholtz kernels. A
nine-point correction stencil leads to an $O(h^5)$ scheme. The method proposed

outline an alternative sample partitioning procedure for estimating the average

map to encode the interactive relationship between the target agent and its
surrounding agents. Given a trajectory sequence, the LSTM networks are firstly
utilized to extract the features for all agents, based on which the attention
mask and social map are formed. Then, the attention mask and social map are
fused to get the fusion feature map, which is processed by the social
convolution to obtain a fusion feature representation. Finally, this fusion
feature is taken as the input of a variable-length LSTM to predict the
trajectory of the target agent. We note that the variable-length LSTM enables
our model to handle the case that the number of agents in the sensing scope is
highly dynamic in traffic scenes. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we

this paper, we propose a formalism to construct the asymptotic states directly
from the interaction of the theory by setting a sufficiently large time scale
$T$. In this dressed state formalism, we define the asymptotic interaction
remaining at $|t|>T$ in terms of some fixed order of $1/T$, and we are
performing all calculations according to that order. We study the asymptotic
states in QED specifically, but we can formally apply the dressed state
formalism proposed in this paper to any perturbative QFT. We show that, at
least in QED, we can construct divergence-free and unitary $S$-matrix using
dressed states proposed in this paper. Furthermore, we discuss the transition
rate to show that we can predict experimental results. We also show that the
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge symmetry of $S$-matrix leads to the QED large gauge
symmetry, and deviation of the expectation values of the vector potential
between initial and final spacelike hypersurfaces emerges as a QED memory

prove that, after $N$ rounds of online IL with stochastic feedback, the policy
improves in $\tilde{O}(1/N + \sqrt{\xi/N})$ in both expectation and high

of age at relay and destination as a Markov chain (MC). Numerical results
validate all the theoretical analysis, and show that the low-complexity DTR
policy can achieve near optimal performance compared with the optimal
CMDP-based policy. Moreover, the relay should always consider the threshold for
its local age to maintain a low age at the destination. When the resource
constraint is relatively tight, it further needs to consider the threshold on

cannot be bribed. Under this setting, we consider the following bi-level
decision problem: Is it possible for the protector to protect a proper subset
of voters such that no briber with a fixed budget on bribery can alter the
election result? The goal of this paper is to give a full picture on the
complexity of protection problems. We give an extensive study on the protection
problem and provide algorithmic and complexity results. Comparing our results
with that on the bribery problems, we observe that the protection problem is in

very restricted special cases, while most bribery problems lie in NP. However,
it is not necessarily the case that the protection problem is always harder.
Some of the protection problems can still be solved in polynomial time, while

significant difficulties, especially for convolutional sparse coding (CSC) as
existing methods do not take advantage of the particularities of tensor

address this issue, in this paper we introduce a new CSC model, named Kruskal

leverage the intrinsic low rank nature of these representations in order to
extract relevant and interpretable encodings. Our main contribution, TC-FISTA,
uses multiple tools to efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem

confined under an external harmonic field with frequency $\omega$. We perform
the equilibrium thermo-statistical analysis in the framework of continuum
approximation. This study reveals the existence of two asymptotic limits: the
known Brillouin steady state at zero temperature, and the gas of harmonic
oscillators in the limit of high temperatures. The non-extensive character of
this model is evidenced by the associated thermodynamic limit,
$N\rightarrow+\infty: U/N^{7/3}=const$, which coincides with the thermodynamic
limit of a self-gravitating system of non-relativistic point particles in
presence of Newtonian gravitation. Afterwards, the dynamics of this model is
analyzed through numerical simulations. It is verified the agreement of
thermo-statistical estimations and the temporal expectation values of the same
macroscopic observables. The system chaoticity is addressed via numerical
computation of Lyapunov exponents in the framework of the known \emph{tangent
dynamics}. The temperature dependence of Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ approaches
to zero in the two asymptotic limits of this model, reaching its maximum during
the transit between them. The chaos of the present model is very strong, since
its rate is faster than the characteristic timescale of the microscopic
dynamics $\tau_{dyn}=1/\omega$. A qualitative analysis suggests that such a
strong chaoticity cannot be explained in terms of collision events because of
their respective characteristic timescales are quite different,
$\tau_{ch}\propto \tau_{dyn}/N^{1/4}$ and $\tau_{coll}\propto \tau_{dyn}$.

harmonic of the magnetic field, the expansion contains a finite number of
terms. A multipole magnetic field can provide an explanation for the stable
sub-structures of pulses, and they offer a solution to the problem of current
closure in pulsar magnetospheres. Conclusions. This computation generalises the
widely used model of a rotating star in vacuum with a dipole field. It can be
especially useful as a first approximation to the electromagnetic environment
of a compact star, for instance a neutron star, with an arbitrarily magnetic
field.

resources between network components with an attractive cost/performance
relation. In this paper, a novel architecture for a MIN is proposed. In
contrast to other existing networks, this new architecture operates via
wormhole routing using a multi-lane equivalent-weighted fair queuing system.
Associating the lane storage with each physical channel for movement of the
flits allows for high levels of packet flow and makes the system more robust.
The resulting flit scheduling schema has been studied thoroughly, and the
results are presented in this manuscript. In addition to performance metrics,
additional factors such as complexity, cost and reliability are investigated.
Since a basic aim of the design of MINs is to achieve a good data flow control
mechanism, this proposal is an extremely effective and robust solution. The
rationale behind this innovative scheme is to introduce a more efficient
network technology, thus providing a better quality of service (i.e. streaming
media vs. file transfer).

evaluating marginal treatment effects. The generalized propensity score (GPS)
is an extension of the propensity score framework, historically developed in
the case of binary exposures, for use with quantitative or continuous
exposures. In this paper, we proposed variance esti-mators for treatment effect
estimators on continuous outcomes. Dose-response functions (DRF) were estimated
through weighting on the inverse of the GPS, or using stratification. Variance
estimators were evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. Despite the use of
stabilized weights, the variability of the weighted estimator of the DRF was
particularly high, and none of the variance estimators (a bootstrap-based
estimator, a closed-form estimator especially developped to take into account
the estimation step of the GPS, and a sandwich estimator) were able to
adequately capture this variability, resulting in coverages below to the
nominal value, particularly when the proportion of the variation in the
quantitative exposure explained by the covariates was 1 large. The stratified
estimator was more stable, and variance estima-tors (a bootstrap-based
estimator, a pooled linearized estimator, and a pooled model-based estimator)
more efficient at capturing the empirical variability of the parameters of the
DRF. The pooled variance estimators tended to overestimate the variance,
whereas the bootstrap estimator, which intrinsically takes into account the
estimation step of the GPS, resulted in correct variance estimations and
coverage rates. These methods were applied to a real data set with the aim of
assessing the effect of maternal body mass index on newborn birth weight.

their invariant distributions and long-term behaviour. We will show that under
a continuity assumption an invariant distribution exists. Moreover, we provide
a sufficient criterion for the uniqueness of the invariant distribution that

the recent result in \cite{A-H-S}, asymptotic flocking admits only two types of
asymptotic scenarios, either convergence to a rest state or a state lying on

of $B$ mesons, $B^-\to K^+K^-\pi^-$ and $B^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$, within the
factorization approach. The main results are: (i) There are two distinct
sources of nonresonant contributions: one arises from the $b\to u$ tree
transition and the other from the nonresonant matrix element of scalar
densities $\langle M_1M_2|\bar q_1 q_2|0\rangle^{\rm NR}$. It turns out that
even for tree-dominated three-body decays, dominant nonresonant contributions
originate from the penguin diagram rather than from the $b\to u$ tree process,
as implied by the large nonresonant component observed recently in the $\pi^-
K^+$ system which accounts for one third of the $B^-\to K^+K^-\pi^-$ rate. (ii)
The calculated branching fraction of $B^-\to f_2(1270)\pi^-\to K^+K^-\pi^-$ is
smaller than the LHCb by a factor of $\sim 7$ in its central value, but the
predicted $\B(B^-\to f_2(1270)\pi^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-)$ is consistent with the
data. Branching fractions of $B^-\to f_2(1270)\pi^-$ extracted from the LHCb
measurements of these two processes also differ by a factor of seven!
Therefore, it is likely that the $f_2(1270)$ contribution to $B^-\to
K^+K^-\pi^-$ is largely overestimated experimentally. Including $1/m_b$ power
corrections from penguin annihilation inferred from QCD factorization (QCDF), a
sizable CP asymmetry of 32\% in the $f_2(1270)$ component agrees with
experiment. (iii) A fraction of 5\% for the $\rho(1450)$ component in
$B^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$ is in accordance with the theoretical expectation.
However, a large fraction of 30\% in $B^-\to K^+K^-\pi^-$ is entirely
unexpected. This issue needs to be clarified in the future.

locked terrestrial planets around M dwarfs are the main targets of space
missions looking to discover habitable exoplanets. The question of whether
hurricanes can form on this kind of planet is important for determining their
climate and habitability. Using a high-resolution global atmospheric
circulation model, we investigated whether there are hurricanes on tidally
locked terrestrial planets under fixed surface temperatures. The relevant
effects of the planetary rotation rate, surface temperature, and bulk
atmospheric compositions were examined. We find that hurricanes can form on the
planets but not on all of them. For planets near the inner edge of the
habitable zone of late M dwarfs, there are more numerous and stronger
hurricanes on both day and night sides. For planets in the middle and outer
ranges of the habitable zone, the possibility of hurricane formation is low or
even close to zero, as has been suggested in recent studies. Earth-based
hurricane theories are applicable to tidally locked planets only when the
atmospheric compositions are similar to that of Earth. However, if the
background atmosphere is lighter than H2O, hurricanes can hardly be produced
because convection is always inhibited due to the effect of the mean molecular
weight, similarly to the case of Saturn. These results have broad implications
on the precipitation, ocean mixing, climate, and atmospheric characterization
of tidally locked planets. Finally, A test with a coupled slab ocean and an
Earth-like atmosphere in a tide-locked orbit of ten Earth days demonstrates
that there are also hurricanes present in the experiment.

correlation existing in the dataset, which causes the model to be biased. While
previous work tackles this issue by using explicit labeling on the spuriously
correlated attributes or presuming a particular bias type, we instead utilize a
cheaper, yet generic form of human knowledge, which can be widely applicable to
various types of bias. We first observe that neural networks learn to rely on
the spurious correlation only when it is ""easier"" to learn than the desired

training. Based on the observations, we propose a failure-based debiasing
scheme by training a pair of neural networks simultaneously. Our main idea is
twofold; (a) we intentionally train the first network to be biased by
repeatedly amplifying its ""prejudice"", and (b) we debias the training of the
second network by focusing on samples that go against the prejudice of the
biased network in (a). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the training of the network against various types of

even occasionally outperforms the debiasing methods requiring explicit

of the differences in image characteristics in CV and RS, this approach limits
the performance of the existing CD methods. To address this problem, we propose

Generating a reconstructed version of the input image as an unchanged image 2)
Learning the distribution of unchanged samples through an adversarial game.
Unlike the existing GAN based methods (which only use the discriminator during

exploits the discriminator likelihood to solve the binary CD task. Experimental
results show the effectiveness of the proposed S2-cGAN when compared to the

effective strategy is to use intermediate representations based on the

classifiers. More precisely, two methods are proposed, which modify the Random

trajectory features, a goal-oriented lane attention module is proposed to
predict the future locations of the vehicle. We show that the proposed lane
representation together with the lane attention module can be integrated into
the widely used encoder-decoder framework to generate diverse predictions. Most
importantly, each generated trajectory is associated with a probability to
handle the uncertainty. Our method does not suffer from collapsing to one
behavior modal and can cover diverse possibilities. Extensive experiments and
ablation studies on the benchmark datasets corroborate the effectiveness of our

Fermi systems. We use the representation of the trace of the imaginary time
$\tau=it$ propagator as a functional integral type of a sum over complete sets
of states at intermediate propagation slices. We assume that these states are
$\tau$-dependent and generated by an arbitrary trial Hamiltonian $H_0(\tau)$.
We then use the convexity inequality to derive $H_0(\tau)$ controlled
variational bound for a trial action functional. This functional has a general
structure consisting of two parts - statistically weighted quantum
penetrability and dynamical tunneling entropy. We examine how this structure
incorporates the basic physics of tunneling of hot Fermi systems. Using the
variational inequality one can optimise the dynamical parameters controlling
the action functional for any choice of the trial problem.
  As an application we take $H_0(\tau)$ to describe imaginary time dynamics of
non interacting Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles. Optimising its
dynamical parameters we extend the tunneling theory of hot Fermi systems to the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov(HFB) frame and derive the corresponding generalisation
of imaginary time temperature dependent BdG mean field equations.
  As in the trial action the prominent feature of these equations is an
inseparable interplay between quantum dynamical and entropic statistical
effects. In the zero temperature limit these equations describe the ""false
ground state"" tunneling decay of superfluid Fermi systems (spontaneous fission
in nuclear physics). With increasing excitation energy (effective temperature)
the decay process is gradually evolving from pure quantum tunneling to
statistical ""bottle neck"" escape mechanism.

Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to

essential role in studying dark matter, and indicate that there exists a
central constant density dark matter core. However, the cosmological N-body
simulations of cold dark matter predict an inner cusped halo with a power-law
mass density distribution, and can't reproduce a central constant-density core.
This phenomenon is called cusp-core problem. When dark matter is quiescent and
satisfies the condition for hydrostatic equilibrium, using the equation of
state can get the density profile in the static and spherically symmetric
space-time. To solve the cusp-core problem, we assume that the equation of
state is independent of the scaling transformation. Its lower order
approximation for this type of equation of state can naturally lead to a
special case, i.e. $p=\zeta\rho+2\epsilon V_{rot}^{2}\rho$, where $p$ and
$\rho$ are the pressure and density, $V_{rot}$ is the rotation velocity of
galaxy, $\zeta$ and $ \epsilon$ are positive constants. It can obtain a density
profile that is similar to the pseudo-isothermal halo model when $\epsilon$ is
around $0.15$. To get a more widely used model, let the equation of state
include the polytropic model, i.e. $p= \frac{\zeta}{\rho_{0}^{s}}\rho^{1+s}+
2\epsilon V_{rot}^{2}\rho$, we can get other kinds of density profiles, such as
the profile that is nearly same with the Burkert profile, where $s$ and
$\rho_{0}$ are positive constants.

giants all show the need for invoking a more efficient transport of angular
momentum than theoretically predicted. Constraints on the core rotation rate
are available starting from the base of the red giant branch (RGB) and we are
still lacking information on the internal rotation of less evolved subgiants.
We identified two young Kepler subgiants, KIC8524425 and KIC5955122, whose
mixed modes are clearly split by rotation. Using the full Kepler data set, we
extracted the mode frequencies and rotational splittings for the two stars
using a Bayesian approach. We then performed a detailed seismic modeling of
both targets and used the rotational kernels to invert their internal rotation
profiles. We found that both stars are rotating nearly as solid bodies, with
core-envelope contrasts of $\Omega_{\rm g}/\Omega_{\rm p}=0.68\pm0.47$ for
KIC8524425 and $0.72\pm0.37$ for KIC5955122. This result shows that the
internal transport of angular momentum has to occur faster than the timescale
at which differential rotation is forced in these stars (between 300 Myr and
600 Myr). By modeling the additional transport of angular momentum as a
diffusive process with a constant viscosity $\nu_{\rm add}$, we found that
values of $\nu_{\rm add}>5\times10^4$~cm$^2$.s$^{-1}$ are required to account
for the internal rotation of KIC8524425, and $\nu_{\rm
add}>1.5\times10^5$~cm$^2$.s$^{-1}$ for KIC5955122. These values are lower than
or comparable to the efficiency of the core-envelope coupling during the main
sequence, as given by the surface rotation of stars in open clusters. On the
other hand, they are higher than the viscosity needed to reproduce the rotation
of subgiants near the base of the RGB. Our results yield further evidence that
the efficiency of the internal redistribution of angular momentum decreases
during the subgiant phase.

requires coincident single-photon detection proportional to the number of
photons involved, which represents a severe challenge for achieving a practical
quantum advantage over classical methods. Here, we exploit advanced quantum
state engineering based on superposing two photon-pair creation events to
realise a new approach that bypasses this issue. In particular, optical phase
shifts are probed with a two-photon quantum state whose information is
subsequently effectively transferred to a single-photon state. Notably, without
any multiphoton detection, we infer phase shifts by measuring the average
intensity of the single-photon beam on a photodiode, in analogy to standard
classical measurements. Importantly, our approach maintains the quantum
advantage: twice as many interference fringes are observed for the same phase
shift, corresponding to N=2 path-entangled photons. Our results demonstrate
that the advantages of quantum-enhanced phase-sensing can be fully exploited in
standard intensity measurements, paving the way towards resource-efficient and
practical quantum optical metrology.

approaches typically relies heavily upon accurate modeling of the motion
dynamics. However, modeling the true dynamics of present-day increasingly
complex systems can be an extremely challenging task; and the usually necessary
practical approximations often render the automation system to operate in a
non-optimal condition. This problem can be greatly aggravated in the case of a
multi-axis magnetically-levitated nanopositioning system where the fully
floating behavior and multi-axis coupling make extremely accurate
identification of the motion dynamics largely impossible. On the other hand, in
many related industrial automation applications, e.g., the scanning process
with the maglev system, repetitive motions are involved which could generate a
large amount of motion data under non-optimal conditions. These motion data
essentially contain rich information; therefore, the possibility exists to
develop an intelligent automation system to learn from these motion data and to
drive the system to operate towards optimality in a data-driven manner. Along
this line then, this paper proposes a data-driven controller optimization
approach that learns from the past non-optimal motion data to iteratively
improve the motion control performance. Specifically, a novel data-driven
multi-objective optimization approach is proposed that is able to automatically
estimate the gradient and Hessian purely based on the measured motion data; the
multi-objective cost function is suitably designed to take into account both
smooth and accurate trajectory tracking. Experiments are then conducted on the
maglev nanopositioning system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, and the results show rather clearly the practical appeal of our
methodology for related complex robotic systems with no accurate model
available.

challenges of the large domain gap between the labeled training data and

aligning the image/instance-level features between source and unlabeled target

because of ignoring the category information of object instances. To tackle
this issue, we develop a fine-grained domain alignment approach with a
well-designed domain classifier bank that achieves the instance-level alignment
respecting to their categories. Specifically, we first employ the mean teacher
paradigm to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled samples. Then we implement the
class-level domain classifiers and group them together, called domain
classifier bank, in which each domain classifier is responsible for aligning
features of a specific class. We assemble the bare object detector with the
proposed fine-grained domain alignment mechanism as the adaptive detector, and
optimize it with a developed crossed adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive
experiments on three popular transferring benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and achieve the new remarkable state-of-the-arts.

QSOs as a function of the overdensity defined by the galaxy population. Using
these measurements, we investigate how QSOs populate and sample the galaxy
population, and how the host dark-matter haloes of QSOs sample the underlying
halo distribution. We find that the probability of a galaxy hosting a QSO is
independent of the host dark matter halo mass of the galaxy. We also find that
about 60\% of eBOSS QSOs are hosted by LRGs and about 20-40\% of QSOs are

satellite galaxies over central galaxies. This is connected to the host halo
mass distribution of different types of galaxies. Based on our analysis, QSOs

efficient for deep learning models. In particular, Wong et al. (2020) showed
that $\ell_\infty$-adversarial training with fast gradient sign method (FGSM)
can fail due to a phenomenon called ""catastrophic overfitting"", when the model
quickly loses its robustness over a single epoch of training. We show that
adding a random step to FGSM, as proposed in Wong et al. (2020), does not
prevent catastrophic overfitting, and that randomness is not important per se
-- its main role being simply to reduce the magnitude of the perturbation.
Moreover, we show that catastrophic overfitting is not inherent to deep and
overparametrized networks, but can occur in a single-layer convolutional
network with a few filters. In an extreme case, even a single filter can make
the network highly non-linear locally, which is the main reason why FGSM
training fails. Based on this observation, we propose a new regularization
method, GradAlign, that prevents catastrophic overfitting by explicitly
maximizing the gradient alignment inside the perturbation set and improves the
quality of the FGSM solution. As a result, GradAlign allows to successfully
apply FGSM training also for larger $\ell_\infty$-perturbations and reduce the
gap to multi-step adversarial training. The code of our experiments is

  For a full-duplex network under the no interference model, we propose an

  Fractional weighted coloring based approximation algorithms are proposed for

We perform 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using the European
Heliospheric Forecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) code to show that this
empirical relationship forms during the propagation phase of high-speed streams
from the Sun to Earth. For this purpose, we neglect the acceleration phase of
high-speed streams, and project the areas of coronal holes to a sphere at 0.1
au. We then vary only the areas and latitudes of the coronal holes. The
velocity, temperature, and density in the cross section of the corresponding
highspeed streams at 0.1 au are set to constant, homogeneous values. Finally,
we propagate the associated high-speed streams through the inner heliosphere
using the EUHFORIA code. The simulated high-speed stream peak velocities at
Earth reveal a linear dependence on the area of their source coronal holes. The
slopes of the relationship decrease with increasing latitudes of the coronal
holes, and the peak velocities saturate at a value of about 730 km/s, similar
to the observations. These findings imply that the empirical relationship
between the coronal hole areas and high-speed stream peak velocities does not
describe the acceleration phase of high-speed streams, but is a result of the
high-speed stream propagation from the Sun to Earth.

Comments welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/staa2028",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supersonic turbulence plays a pivotal role during the formation of molecular
clouds and stars in galaxies. However, little is known about how the fraction
of compressive and solenoidal modes in the velocity field evolves over time and
how it depends on properties of the molecular cloud or the galactic
environment. In this work, we carry out magnetohydrodynamical simulations of
disc galaxies and study the time evolution of the turbulence driving parameter
for an ensemble of clouds. We find that the time-averaged turbulence driving
parameter is insensitive to the position of the cloud within the galaxy. The
ensemble-averaged driving parameter is found to be rather compressive with
$b\sim0.5-0.7$, indicating almost time-independent global star formation
properties. However, each individual cloud shows a highly fluctuating driving
parameter, which would strongly affect the cloud's star formation rate. We find
that the mode of turbulence driving can rapidly change within only a few Myr,
both from solenoidal to compressive and vice versa. We attribute these changes
to cloud collisions and to tidal interactions with clouds or overdensities in
the environment. Last, we find no significant differences in the average
driving parameter between hydrodynamic and initially strongly magnetised
galaxies. However, the magnetic field tends to reduce the overall fluctuation
of the driving parameter. The average driving as well as its uncertainty are
seen to be in agreement with recent constraints on the turbulence driving mode
for solar neighbourhood clouds.

spectroscopic effort involving ESO and Keck facilities designed to empirically
calibrate the galaxy colour-redshift relation - P(z|C) to the Euclid depth
(i_AB=24.5) and is intimately linked to upcoming Stage IV dark energy missions
based on weak lensing cosmology. The aim is to build a spectroscopic
calibration sample that is as representative as possible of the galaxies of the
Euclid weak lensing sample. In order to minimise the number of spectroscopic
observations to fill the gaps in current knowledge of the P(z|C),
self-organising map (SOM) representations of the galaxy colour space have been
constructed. Here we present the first results of an ESO@ VLT Large Programme
approved in the context of C3R2, which makes use of the two VLT optical and
near-infrared multi-object spectrographs, FORS2 and KMOS. This paper focuses on
high-quality spectroscopic redshifts of high-z galaxies observed with the KMOS
spectrograph in the H- and K-bands. A total of 424 highly-reliable z are
measured in the 1.3<=z<=2.5 range, with total success rates of 60.7% in the
H-band and 32.8% in the K-band. The newly determined z fill 55% of high and 35%
of lower priority empty SOM grid cells. We measured Halpha fluxes in a 1.""2
radius aperture from the spectra of the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies
and converted them into star formation rates. In addition, we performed an SED
fitting analysis on the same sample in order to derive stellar masses, E(B-V),
total magnitudes, and SFRs. We combine the results obtained from the spectra
with those derived via SED fitting, and we show that the spectroscopic failures
come from either weakly star-forming galaxies (at z<1.7, i.e. in the H-band) or
low S/N spectra (in the K-band) of z>2 galaxies.

for classification with large and imbalanced data. This paper proposes a more
general sampling scheme based on a working principle that data points deserve
higher sampling probability if they contain more information or appear
""surprising"" in the sense of, for example, a large error of pilot prediction or
a large absolute score. Compared with the relevant existing sampling schemes,
as reported in Fithian and Hastie (2014) and Ai, et al. (2018), the proposed
one has several advantages. It adaptively gives out the optimal forms to a
variety of objectives, including the LCC and Ai et al. (2018)'s sampling as
special cases. Under same model specifications, the proposed estimator also
performs no worse than those in the literature. The estimation procedure is
valid even if the model is misspecified and/or the pilot estimator is
inconsistent or dependent on full data. We present theoretical justifications
of the claimed advantages and optimality of the estimation and the sampling
design. Different from Ai, et al. (2018), our large sample theory are
population-wise rather than data-wise. Moreover, the proposed approach can be
applied to unsupervised learning studies, since it essentially only requires a
specific loss function and no response-covariate structure of data is needed.
Numerical studies are carried out and the evidence in support of the theory is
shown.

Various unconventional phenomena around EPs have been reported, and expected to

under the EP degeneracy is also predicted to exhibit enhanced radiation.
However, such responses have yet to be observed in on-chip lasers, because of
both the limited controllability of their gain and loss and the lifting of
degeneracy by pump-induced cavity detuning. Here, we report the first
non-Hermitian nanophotonic platform based on two electrically pumped photonic

tuned and independent current injection to our wavelength-scale active
heterostructure cavities enables us to demonstrate the clear EP phase
transition of their spontaneous emission, accompanied with the spectral
coalescence of coupled modes and reversed pump dependence of the intensity.
Furthermore, we find experimentally and confirm theoretically the peculiar
squared Lorentzian emission spectrum very near the exact EP, which indicates
the four-fold enhancement of the photonic local density of states induced
purely by the degeneracy. Our results open a new pathway to engineer the

industry, replacing Hall sensors in various low field environments. While there
have been some efforts in increasing the dynamic field range of xMR sensors,
Hall sensors remain to dominate high field applications due to their wide
linear range. Using a perpendicular magnetized reference system and an in-plane
free layer allows us to overcome this disadvantage of xMR sensors, and,
furthermore, investigate spin-canting effects in interlayer exchange coupled
perpendicular synthetic antiferromagnets (p-SAF). We created p-SAFs with
exchange coupling fields of up to 10 kOe, based on magnetic Co/Pt multilayer
systems. The p-SAFs are either designed as ""single"" p-SAFs, where two Co/Pt
multilayers are interlayer exchange coupled via a 4 {\AA} thick Ru spacer, or
as ""double"" p-SAFs, where an additional Co layer is interlayer exchange coupled
to the top multilayer. These p-SAFs are used for giant magnetoresistance (GMR)
sensors with wide dynamic field range. By using a p-SAF as the reference system
and employing an in-plane magnetic layer as the GMR's free layer, the linear
range can be effectively increased limited only by the p-SAF's switching
fields. Additionally, the magnetic anisotropy of the in-plane free layer is
fully controlled, which allows saturation fields by design. Different
configurations were investigated, ranging from free layer magnetic saturation
at lower to far higher fields than the p-SAF's switching fields. We can show
through micromagnetic simulations that certain GMR transfer curves are
dominated by spin-canting effects in the interlayer exchange coupled reference
system. Finally, our simulation results lay out the correlation of the p-SAF's
design parameters and its magnetization reversal behavior.

structure and semantic information in a HIN to distributed representations, has
drawn considerable research attention. Graph neural networks for HIN embeddings
typically adopt a hierarchical attention (including node-level and
meta-path-level attentions) to capture the information from meta-path-based
neighbors. However, this complicated attention structure often cannot achieve
the function of selecting meta-paths due to severe overfitting. Moreover, when
propagating information, these methods do not distinguish direct (one-hop)
meta-paths from indirect (multi-hop) ones. But from the perspective of network
science, direct relationships are often believed to be more essential, which
can only be used to model direct information propagation. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel neural network method via implicitly utilizing
attention and meta-paths, which can relieve the severe overfitting brought by
the current over-parameterized attention mechanisms on HIN. We first use the
multi-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) framework, which performs a
discriminative aggregation at each layer, along with stacking the information
propagation of direct linked meta-paths layer-by-layer, realizing the function
of attentions for selecting meta-paths in an indirect way. We then give an
effective relaxation and improvement via introducing a new propagation
operation which can be separated from aggregation. That is, we first model the
whole propagation process with well-defined probabilistic diffusion dynamics,
and then introduce a random graph-based constraint which allows it to reduce
noise with the increase of layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the new approach over state-of-the-art methods.

into the underlying physics. Analytical models rely on generalized expressions
from the dispersion relation of SSW with an arbitrary angle between
magnetization M and wavenumber k. The derived algebraic expression for the

showing a connection with fundamental physics of exchange dominated surface

distributed data without transmitting the entirety of the data to a central
point. By avoiding such costly transmissions, OTA computation schemes can
achieve a better-than-linear (depending on the function, often logarithmic or
even constant) scaling of the communication cost as the number of transmitters
grows. Among the most common functions computed OTA are linear functions such
as weighted sums. In this work, we propose and analyze an analog OTA
computation scheme for a class of functions that contains linear functions as
well as some nonlinear functions such as $p$-norms of vectors. We prove error
bound guarantees that are valid for fast-fading channels and all distributions
of fading and noise contained in the class of sub-Gaussian distributions. This
class includes Gaussian distributions, but also many other practically relevant
cases such as Class A Middleton noise and fading with dominant line-of-sight
components. In addition, there can be correlations in the fading and noise so
that the presented results also apply to, for example, block fading channels
and channels with bursty interference. We do not rely on any stochastic
characterization of the distributed arguments of the OTA computed function; in
particular, there is no assumption that these arguments are drawn from
identical or independent probability distributions. Our analysis is
nonasymptotic and therefore provides error bounds that are valid for a finite
number of channel uses. OTA computation has a huge potential for reducing
communication cost in applications such as Machine Learning (ML)-based
distributed anomaly detection in large wireless sensor networks. We illustrate
this potential through extensive numerical simulations.

as it has been shown to greatly improve the generalisation abilities of models.
These techniques rely on different ideas such as invariance-preserving
transformations (e.g, expert-defined augmentation), statistical heuristics
(e.g, Mixup), and learning the data distribution (e.g, GANs). However, in the
adversarial settings it remains unclear under what conditions such data
augmentation methods reduce or even worsen the misclassification risk. In this
paper, we therefore analyse the effect of different data augmentation
techniques on the adversarial risk by three measures: (a) the well-known risk
under adversarial attacks, (b) a new measure of prediction-change stress based
on the Laplacian operator, and (c) the influence of training examples on
prediction. The results of our empirical analysis disprove the hypothesis that
an improvement in the classification performance induced by a data augmentation
is always accompanied by an improvement in the risk under adversarial attack.
Further, our results reveal that the augmented data has more influence than the
non-augmented data, on the resulting models. Taken together, our results
suggest that general-purpose data augmentations that do not take into the
account the characteristics of the data and the task, must be applied with

only relevant initiatives are to maintain social distance, perform contact
tracing, use proper safety gears, and impose quarantine measures. But despite

researchers and authorities are considering the use of smartphone based mobile

interaction energy between the boundary of the predicted region and that of the
actual object. Under the supervision of the proposed loss, the boundary of the

Ising-Kondo model provides an example for static screening. At low
temperatures, the thermodynamics at finite magnetic fields resembles that of a
free spin-1/2 in a reduced external field. Alternatively, the Curie law can be
interpreted in terms of an antiferromagnetically screened effective spin. The
spin correlations decay algebraically to zero in the ground state and display
commensurate Friedel oscillations. In contrast to the symmetric Kondo model,
the impurity spin is not completely screened, i.e., the screening cloud
contains less than a spin-1/2 electron. At finite temperatures and weak
interactions, the spin correlations decay to zero exponentially with
correlation length $\xi(T)=1/(2\pi T)$.

and Image Processing (SWAP) instrument on board the PRoject for Onboard
Autonomy 2 (PROBA2) spacecraft provides a unique opportunity to study extended
coronal structures observed in EUV in conjunction with global coronal magnetic
field simulations. A global non-potential magnetic field model is used to
simulate the evolution of the global corona from 1 September 2014 to 31 March
2015, driven by newly emerging bipolar active regions determined from
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms. We compare the large-scale
structure of the simulated magnetic field with structures seen off-limb in SWAP
EUV observations. In particular, we investigate how successful the model is in
reproducing regions of closed and open structures; the scale of structures; and
compare the evolution of a coronal fan observed over several rotations. The
model is found to accurately reproduce observed large-scale off-limb
structures. When discrepancies do arise they mainly occur off the east solar
limb due to active regions emerging on the far side of the Sun, which cannot be
incorporated into the model until they are observed on the Earth-facing side.
When such ``late'' active region emergences are incorporated into the model, we
find that the simulated corona self-corrects within a few days, so that
simulated structures off the west limb more closely match what is observed.
Where the model is less successful, we consider how this may be addressed,
through model developments or additional observational products.

for the contents of a general audio signal. Typical audio captioning methods
rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), where the target of the DNN is to map the
input audio sequence to an output sequence of words, i.e. the caption. Though,
the length of the textual description is considerably less than the length of
the audio signal, for example 10 words versus some thousands of audio feature
vectors. This clearly indicates that an output word corresponds to multiple
input feature vectors. In this work we present an approach that focuses on
explicitly taking advantage of this difference of lengths between sequences, by
applying a temporal sub-sampling to the audio input sequence. We employ a
sequence-to-sequence method, which uses a fixed-length vector as an output from
the encoder, and we apply temporal sub-sampling between the RNNs of the
encoder. We evaluate the benefit of our approach by employing the freely

molecular clouds. Recent work has shown that magnetic fields are equally
important for primordial clouds, which form the first stars in the Universe.
While the primordial magnetic field strength on cosmic scales is largely
unconstrained, theoretical models strongly suggest that a weak seed field
existed in the early Universe. We study how the amplification of such a weak
field can influence the evolution of accretion discs around first stars, and
thus affect the primordial initial mass function (IMF). We perform a suite of
3D ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with different initial field
strengths and numerical resolutions. We find that, in simulations with
sufficient spatial resolution to resolve the Jeans scale during the collapse,
even initially weak magnetic fields grow exponentially to become dynamically
important due to both the so-called 'small-scale turbulent dynamo' and the
'large-scale mean-field dynamo'. Capturing the small-scale dynamo action
depends primarily on how well we resolve the Jeans length, while capturing the
large-scale dynamo depends on the Jeans resolution as well as the maximum
absolute resolution. Provided enough resolution, we find that fragmentation
does not depend strongly on the initial field strength, because even weak
fields grow to become strong. However, fragmentation in runs with magnetic
fields differs significantly from those without magnetic fields. We conclude
that the development of dynamically strong magnetic fields during the formation
of the first stars is likely inevitable, and that these fields had a
significant impact on the primordial IMF.

the detectivity of these detectors. In this work, we demonstrate that it is

recombination rate of generated carrier. We first describe the physics of
$PbSe$ detectors, the mechanisms underlying carrier transport, and long
observed lifetimes of conducting carriers. We then discuss the voltage control
of these inverted channels using a back-plane gate resulting in modulation of
the lifetime of these carriers. This voltage control represents and extrinsic
""knob"" through which it may be possible to open a pathway for design of high

for traffic analysis was proposed earlier by other researchers which is based
on an interplay between graph and Markov chain theories. This model provides a
transition probability matrix which describes the traffic's dynamic with its
unique stationary distribution of the vehicles on the road network. In this

concept of two-dimensional stationary distribution which can handle the

Although RNNs are in many cases superior than other types of deep neural

replacing RNNs with depth-wise separable (DWS) convolutions, which are a
lightweight and faster variant of the typical convolutions. We focus on singing
voice separation, employing an RNN architecture, and we replace the RNNs with
DWS convolutions (DWS-CNNs). We conduct an ablation study and examine the
effect of the number of channels and layers of DWS-CNNs on the source
separation performance, by utilizing the standard metrics of
signal-to-artifacts, signal-to-interference, and signal-to-distortion ratio.

vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS), which are widely deployed in
border control applications. The face morphing process uses the images from
multiple data subjects and performs an image blending operation to generate a
morphed image of high quality. The generated morphed image exhibits similar
visual characteristics corresponding to the biometric characteristics of the
data subjects that contributed to the composite image and thus making it
difficult for both humans and FRS, to detect such attacks. In this paper, we
report a systematic investigation on the vulnerability of the
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) FRS when morphed images under the influence of
ageing are presented. To this extent, we have introduced a new morphed face
dataset with ageing derived from the publicly available MORPH II face dataset,

intervals, the first bin - MorphAge-I dataset has 1002 unique data subjects
with the age variation of 1 year to 2 years while the MorphAge-II dataset

To effectively evaluate the vulnerability for morphing attacks, we also
introduce a new evaluation metric, namely the Fully Mated Morphed Presentation
Match Rate (FMMPMR), to quantify the vulnerability effectively in a realistic
scenario. Extensive experiments are carried out by using two different COTS FRS
(COTS I - Cognitec and COTS II - Neurotechnology) to quantify the vulnerability
with ageing. Further, we also evaluate five different Morph Attack Detection

equation, and in particular investigate the scattering issue in the limit case
of rotating Maclaurin spheroids. Firstly we give the metric of a rotating
ellipsoid star, then write the Dirac equation under this metric, and finally
derive the scattering solution to the Dirac equation and establish a relation
between differential scattering cross-section, $\sigma$, and stellar matter
density, $\mu$. It is found that the sensitivity of $\sigma$ to the change in
$\mu$ is proportional to the density $\mu$. Because of weak gravitational field
and constant mass density, our results are reasonable. The results can be
applied to white dwarfs, main sequence stars, red giants, supergiant stars and
so on, as long as their gravitational fields are so weak that they can be
treated in the Newtonan approximations, and the fluid is assumed to be
incompressible. Notice that we take the star's matter density to be its average
density and the star is not taken to be compact. Obviously our results cannot
be used to study neutron stars and black holes. In particular, our results are
suitable for white dwarfs, which have average densities of about

biological brains learn and adapt so efficiently from experience, it is
believed that synaptic plasticity plays a prominent role in this process.
Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose a search method that, instead
of optimizing the weight parameters of neural networks directly, only searches
for synapse-specific Hebbian learning rules that allow the network to
continuously self-organize its weights during the lifetime of the agent. We
demonstrate our approach on several reinforcement learning tasks with different

that starting from completely random weights, the discovered Hebbian rules
enable an agent to navigate a dynamical 2D-pixel environment; likewise they
allow a simulated 3D quadrupedal robot to learn how to walk while adapting to
morphological damage not seen during training and in the absence of any

Moreover, its 20\,kt target mass makes it an ideal detector to study neutrinos

specifically for JUNO and the results are mainly driven by its high optical
photon yield of 1,200 photo electrons per MeV of deposited energy. In order to
investigate the potential of event discrimination, several event pairings are
analysed, i.e. $\alpha/\beta$, $p/\beta$, $e^+/e^-$, and $e^-/\gamma$. We
compare the discrimination performance of advanced analytical techniques based
on neural networks and on the topological event reconstruction keeping the
standard Gatti filter as a reference. We use the Monte Carlo samples generated
in the physically motivated energy intervals. We study the dependence of our
cuts on energy, radial position, PMT time resolution, and dark noise. The
results show an excellent performance for $\alpha/\beta$ and $p/\beta$ with the
Gatti method and the neural network. Furthermore, $e^+/e^-$ and $e^-/\gamma$
can partly be distinguished by means of neural network and topological
reconstruction on a statistical basis. Especially in the latter case, the

detecting COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcription quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test kits. Similar to the Tapestry scheme
of Ghosh et al., the proposed schemes leverage soft information from the
RT-qPCR process about the total viral load in the pool. This is in contrast to
conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The
proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used
Dorfman's scheme. They also provide higher testing throughput, sensitivity and
specificity than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive Tapestry scheme. The number
of pipetting operations is lower than state-of-the-art non-adaptive pooling
schemes, and is higher than that for the Dorfman's scheme. The proposed schemes
can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and
are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in
the work of Ghosh et al. (Tapestry) show that 10 infected people in a
population of size 961 can be identified with 70.86 tests on the average with a
sensitivity of 99.50% and specificity of 99.62. This is 13.5x, 4.24x, and 1.3x

reachability is then used to predict worst-case triggering condition
violations, ultimately determining the next communication time. The ellipsoidal

The main issue for this is the lack of small time controllability of the

problem in the standard way. To overcome this issue, we first study the
long-time average of optimal control problems with control on the acceleration:
we prove that the time average of the value function converges to an ergodic
constant and represent this ergodic constant as a minimum of a Lagrangian over
a suitable class of closed probability measure. This characterization leads us
to define the ergodic MFG problem as a fixed-point problem on the set of closed
probability measures. Then we also show that this MFG ergodic problem has at
least one solution, that the associated ergodic constant is unique under the
standard mono-tonicity assumption and that the time-average of the value

analyzed and fitted to several simple rate models including the logistic,
Gompertz, quadratic, simple square, and simple exponential growth models. The
resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate predictions for more recent
data. While the Gompertz growth models (mean R2 = 0.998) best fitted the
current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit made future predictions
with logistic models prone to errors. Of the other models, the quadratic rate
model (mean R2 = 0.992) fitted the current data best for 25 (89 %) countries as
determined by R2 values. The simple square and quadratic models accurately
predicted the number of future total cases 37 and 36 days in advance
respectively, compared to only 15 days for the simple exponential model. The
simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future
cases while the quadratic and simple square models did not. These results
demonstrated that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given

extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential
outcomes framework with Granger causality, and to geostatistical analyses
involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are

scientific point of view the first major task is to predict the dynamics of the

fight it, as well as gauging the success of these measures by comparison with
the predictions in hindsight. The vast majority of pandemic models are based on
extensive models with large numbers of fit parameters, leading to individual
descriptions for every hot spot on the world. This makes predictions and
comparisons cumbersome, if not impossible. We here propose a different
approach, by moving away from a description over time, and instead choosing the
total number of infected people in an enclosed area as the independent
variable. Analyzing a few hot spots data, we derive an empirical formula for
the dynamics, dependent only on three variables. The final number of infections
is strictly connected to one fit parameter we call mitigation factor, which in
turn is mostly dependent only on the enclosed population. Despite its
simpleness, this description applies to every of the around 50 countries we
have analyzed, allows to separate different waves of the pandemic, provides a
figure of merit for the overall usefulness of government measures, and shows
when a pandemic is ending. Our model is robust against undetected cases, and
allows all nations, in particular those with fewer resources, to reasonably
predict the outcome of the pandemic in their country.

dominant planar regions. Clearly different from previous methods resorting to
plane segmentation, the key to our approach is to utilize rich semantic
information directly from RGB images to extract planar image regions with a
deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We specifically design a new module to
make fully use of existing semantic segmentation networks to accommodate planar
segmentation. To train the network, a dataset for planar region segmentation is
contributed. With the planar region knowledge, a set of local transformations
can be obtained by constraining matched regions, enabling more precise
alignment in the overlapping area. We also use planar knowledge to estimate a
transformation field over the whole image. The final mosaic is obtained by a
mesh-based optimization framework which maintains high alignment accuracy and
relaxes similarity transformation at the same time. Extensive experiments with
quantitative comparisons show that our method can deal with different

\log(nd)\big)$, improving on the previously known bound $O\big((nd)^{13}
\log(nd)\big)$ due to Kannan, Tetali and Vempala and $O\big(n^7d^{18}
\log(nd)\big)$ obtained by Dyer et al. The log-Sobolev inequality that we
establish for constant $d$ implies a bound $O(n\log^2 n)$ on the mixing time of
the chain which, up to the $\log n$ factor, captures a conjectured optimal
bound. Our proof strategy relies on building, for any fixed function on the set
of $d$-regular bipartite simple graphs, an appropriate extension to a function
on the set of multigraphs given by the configuration model. We then establish a
comparison procedure with the well studied random transposition model in order
to obtain the corresponding functional inequalities. While our method falls
into a rich class of comparison techniques for Markov chains on different state
spaces, the crucial feature of the method - dealing with chains with a large
distortion between their stationary measures - is a novel addition to the
theory.

solution of an optimization problem that involves an unknown function, usually
noted $o(1)$ and called $\xi(N)$ throughout this paper, which tends to zero as
the entry $N$ grows. The aim of this paper is to find optimal asymptotic
choices of the parameters of NFS as $N$ grows, in order to minimize its
heuristic asymptotic computational cost. This amounts to minimizing a function
of the parameters of NFS bound together by a non-linear constraint. We provide
precise asymptotic estimates of the minimizers of this optimization problem,
which yield refined formulas for the asymptotic complexity of NFS. One of the
main outcomes of this analysis is that $\xi(N)$ has a very slow rate of
convergence: We prove that it is equivalent to
$4{\log}{\log}{\log}\,N/(3{\log}{\log}\,N)$. Moreover, $\xi(N)$ has an
unpredictable behavior for practical estimates of the complexity. Indeed, we
provide an asymptotic series expansion of $\xi$ and numerical experiments
indicate that this series starts converging only for $N>\exp(\exp(25))$, far
beyond the practical range of NFS. This raises doubts on the relevance of NFS
running time estimates that are based on setting $\xi=0$ in the asymptotic
formula.

ability to predict the onset of transient-driven activity we also introduce a
model variant using solar X-ray flux to assess whether simple models including

activity with lead times longer than the L1-to-Earth propagation time. By
comparing the performance of these models we show that including

otherwise. We also analyze explicit definition existence if all symbols (except
the one that is defined) are admitted in the definition. In this case the
complexity depends on whether one considers individual or concept names.
Finally, we consider the problem of computing interpolants and explicit

emerge as outputs of suitably chosen su(2; C) time-dependent Hamiltonian
operators that characterize analog quantum search algorithms of specific types.
The su(2; C) Hamiltonian models under consideration are specified by external
time-dependent magnetic fields within which spin-1/2 test particles are
immersed. The positive definite Riemannian metrization of the parameter
manifold is furnished by the Fisher information function. The Fisher
information function is evaluated along parametrized squared probability
amplitudes obtained from the temporal evolution of these spin-1/2 test
particles. A minimum action approach is then utilized to induce the transfer of
the quantum system from its initial state to its final state on the parameter
manifold over a finite temporal interval. We demonstrate in an explicit manner
that the minimal (that is, optimum) path corresponds to the shortest (that is,
geodesic) path between the initial and final states. Furthermore, we show that
the minimal path serves also to minimize the total entropy production occurring
during the transfer of states. Finally, upon evaluating the entropic speed as
well as the total entropy production along optimal transfer paths within
several scenarios of physical interest in analog quantum searching algorithms,
we demonstrate in a transparent quantitative manner a correspondence between a
faster transfer and a higher rate of entropy production. We therefore conclude
that higher entropic speed is associated with lower entropic efficiency within
the context of quantum state transfer.

from structured samples (OPSS) for coverage functions, where the data samples
encode the structural information of the functions. We show that under three

super-logarithmic lower bounds on the depth of circuits (i.e.,
$\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^1$). Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson
(Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995) suggested to approach this problem by
proving that depth complexity behaves ""as expected"" with respect to the
composition of functions $f\diamond g$. They showed that the validity of this
conjecture would imply that $\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^1$.
  Several works have made progress toward resolving this conjecture by proving
special cases. In particular, these works proved the KRW conjecture for every
outer function $f$, but only for few inner functions $g$. Thus, it is an
important challenge to prove the KRW conjecture for a wider range of inner
functions.
  In this work, we extend significantly the range of inner functions that can
be handled. First, we consider the $\textit{monotone}$ version of the KRW
conjecture. We prove it for every monotone inner function $g$ whose depth
complexity can be lower bounded via a query-to-communication lifting theorem.
This allows us to handle several new and well-studied functions such as the
$s\textbf{-}t$-connectivity, clique, and generation functions.
  In order to carry this progress back to the $\textit{non-monotone}$ setting,
we introduce a new notion of $\textit{semi-monotone}$ composition, which
combines the non-monotone complexity of the outer function $f$ with the
monotone complexity of the inner function $g$. In this setting, we prove the
KRW conjecture for a similar selection of inner functions $g$, but only for a
specific choice of the outer function $f$.

derived the transit depth for each curve individually by fitting an analytical
model together with a Gaussian process to account for systematic noise in the
light curves. We find that the transit depth increases toward bluer
wavelengths, indicative of a larger effective planet radius. Our results are
consistent with space-based measurements obtained in the near infrared using
the Hubble Space Telescope, which show a compatible slope of the transmission

requires the recommender system to do the session-based recommendation (SR) in
the streaming scenario. In the real-world applications of e-commerce and social
media, a sequence of user-item interactions generated within a certain period
are grouped as a session, and these sessions consecutively arrive in the form
of streams. Most of the recent SR research has focused on the static setting
where the training data is first acquired and then used to train a
session-based recommender model. They need several epochs of training over the
whole dataset, which is infeasible in the streaming setting. Besides, they can
hardly well capture long-term user interests because of the neglect or the
simple usage of the user information. Although some streaming recommendation
strategies have been proposed recently, they are designed for streams of
individual interactions rather than streams of sessions. In this paper, we
propose a Global Attributed Graph (GAG) neural network model with a Wasserstein
reservoir for the SSR problem. On one hand, when a new session arrives, a
session graph with a global attribute is constructed based on the current
session and its associate user. Thus, the GAG can take both the global
attribute and the current session into consideration to learn more
comprehensive representations of the session and the user, yielding a better
performance in the recommendation. On the other hand, for the adaptation to the
streaming session scenario, a Wasserstein reservoir is proposed to help
preserve a representative sketch of the historical data. Extensive experiments
on two real-world datasets have been conducted to verify the superiority of the
GAG model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

  recoveries","Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa2678",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pulsar glitches offer an insight into the dynamics of superfluids in the high
density interior of a neutron star. To model these phenomena, however, one
needs to have an understanding of the dynamics of a turbulent array of
superfluid vortices moving through a pinning lattice. In this paper we develop
a theoretical approach to describe vortex mediated mutual friction in a pinned,
turbulent and rotating superfluid. Our model is then applied to the study of
the post glitch rotational evolution in the Vela pulsar and in PSR J0537-6910.
We show that in both cases a turbulent model fits the evolution of the spin
frequency derivative better than a laminar one. We also predict that the second
derivative of the frequency after a glitch should be correlated with the
waiting time since the previous glitch, which we find to be consistent with
observational data for these pulsars. The main conclusion of this paper is that
in the post-glitch rotational evolution of these two pulsars we are most likely
observing the response to the glitch of a pinned turbulent region of the star
(possibly the crust) and not the laminar response of a regular straight vortex
array.

network (CNN) is huge. To reduce searching cost, most NAS algorithms use fixed
outer network level structure, and search the repeatable cell structure only.
Such kind of fixed architecture performs well when enough cells and channels
are used. However, when the architecture becomes more lightweight, the
performance decreases significantly. To obtain better lightweight
architectures, more flexible and diversified neural architectures are in
demand, and more efficient methods should be designed for larger search space.
Motivated by this, we propose MoARR algorithm, which utilizes the existing
research results and historical information to quickly find architectures that
are both lightweight and accurate. We use the discovered high-performance cells
to construct network architectures. This method increases the network
architecture diversity while also reduces the search space of cell structure
design. In addition, we designs a novel multi-objective method to effectively
analyze the historical evaluation information, so as to efficiently search for
the Pareto optimal architectures with high accuracy and small parameter number.
Experimental results show that our MoARR can achieve a powerful and lightweight
model (with 1.9% error rate and 2.3M parameters) on CIFAR-10 in 6 GPU hours,
which is better than the state-of-the-arts. The explored architecture is
transferable to ImageNet and achieves 76.0% top-1 accuracy with 4.9M

Conventional modalities exploit only primary radiation and although in the

Scattering Tomography not only accounts for the Compton effect but also uses it
to image material electronic density. Despite its promising applications, some
aspects of Compton scattering tomography have not been studied so far and,
since they are necessary for the design of a operational system, they need to
be addressed.
  In this paper we analyze the effect of some physical influences regarding
real detectors for the Circular Compton Scattering tomography, a system
recently introduced by the authors. This is accomplished through the
formulation of a new weighted Radon transform. In addition, we propose to adapt
the acquired data with pre-processing steps so that they are suitable for
reconstruction with a filtered back-projection type reconstruction algorithm,
and thus, properly deal with missing data of real measurements. Finally, we
introduce a bi-imaging configuration that allows recovering simultaneously the

a seamless transfer from training in simulation to application on the robot. We
showcase the capabilities and the effectiveness of the framework with two real

The distributed capabilities of the framework enable several advantages like
using distributed algorithms, separating the workload of simulation and

opportunity to train in simulation and real world at the same time. Finally we

incorporates resilience against a wide spectrum of attacks.
  Firstly, GossipSub's mesh construction implements an eager push model keeps
the fan-out of the pubsub delivery low and balances excessive bandwidth
consumption and fast message propagation throughout the mesh. Secondly, through
gossip dissemination, GossipSub realises a lazy-pull model to reach nodes
far-away or outside the mesh. Thirdly, through constant observation, nodes
maintain a score profile for the peers they are connected to, allowing them to
choose the most well-behaved nodes to include in the mesh. Finally, and most
importantly, a number of tailor-made mitigation strategies designed
specifically for these three components make GossipSub resilient against the
most challenging Sybil-based attacks. We test GossipSub in a testbed
environment involving more than 5000 VM nodes deployed on AWS and show that it
stays immune to all considered attacks. GossipSub is currently being integrated

N circuit, where S, F$_{l,r}$ are superconductors and weak ferromagnets with
non-collinear magnetisations $\mathbf{M}_{l,r}$, F is a strong ferromagnet with
a high exchange energy. The ferromagnetic wire F can be replaced with a
non-magnetic wire n. In the limit of a weak proximity effect (PE), we obtain
simple analytical expressions for the currents $I_{J}$ and $I_{V}$. In
particular, the critical Josephson current in a long Josephson junction (JJ) is
$I_{c}(\alpha ,\beta )=I_{0c}\chi (\alpha ,\beta )$, where the function $% \chi
(\alpha ,\beta )$ is a function of angles $(\alpha ,\beta )_{l,r}$ that
characterize the orientations of $\mathbf{M}_{l,r}$. The oscillating part of
the dissipative current $I_{osc}(V)=\chi (\alpha ,\beta )\cos \varphi I_{0}(V)$
in the N - F(n)- N circuit depends on the angles $(\alpha ,\beta )_{l,r}$ in
the same way as the critical Josephson current $I_{c}(\alpha ,\beta )$, but can
be much greater than the $I_{c}(\alpha ,\beta )$. At some angles the current
$I_{c}(\alpha ,\beta )$ changes sign. We briefly discuss a relation between the
negative current $I_{c}$ and paramagnetic response. We argue that the
measurements of the conductance in N - F(n) - N circuit can be used as another
complementary method to identify the LRSTC in S/F heterostructures.

different physical approximations and have not yet been reconciled, despite

development of a scalar relativistic quantum electrodynamic (QED) approach of

Dyadic, usually applied to describe photonic excitations and the quasi-static
mixed dynamic form factor (MDFF), more adapted to describe core electronic
excitations of material. We then use this theory to establish two important
EELS-related equations. The first one relates the spatially resolved EELS to
the imaginary part of the photon propagator and the incoming and outgoing
electron beam wavefunction, synthesizing the most common theories developed for
analyzing spatially resolved EELS experiments. The second one shows that the
evolution of the electron beam density matrix is proportional to the mutual

by investigating how neural activity patterns reflect experimental conditions.
Instead of predicting activity patterns directly, the models predict the
geometry of the representation, as defined by the representational
dissimilarity matrix (RDM), which captures to what extent experimental
conditions are associated with similar or dissimilar activity patterns. RSA
therefore first quantifies the representational geometry by calculating a
dissimilarity measure for each pair of conditions, and then compares the
estimated representational dissimilarities to those predicted by each model.
Here we address two central challenges of RSA: First, dissimilarity measures
such as the Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and correlation distance, are biased by
measurement noise, which can lead to incorrect inferences. Unbiased
dissimilarity estimates can be obtained by crossvalidation, at the price of
increased variance. Second, the pairwise dissimilarity estimates are not
statistically independent, and ignoring this dependency makes model comparison
statistically suboptimal. We present an analytical expression for the mean and
(co)variance of both biased and unbiased estimators of the squared Euclidean
and Mahalanobis distance, allowing us to quantify the bias-variance trade-off.
We also use the analytical expression of the covariance of the dissimilarity
estimates to whiten the RDM estimation errors. This results in a new criterion
for RDM similarity, the whitened unbiased RDM cosine similarity (WUC), which
allows for near-optimal model selection combined with robustness to correlated
measurement noise.

each of these options involves trade-offs between several factors such as
reproducibility of results, system tunability, and robustness of the resulting

namely a magnetic chain deposited on a QSHI edge in contact with a
superconducting surface, offers a better choice of tunability and MBS
robustness compared to magnetic chain deposited on bulk. We study how the QSHI
edge interacts with the magnetic chain, and see how the topological phase is
affected by edge proximity. We show that MBSs near the edge can be realized
with lower chemical potential and Zeeman field than the ones inside the bulk,
independently of the chain's magnetic order (ferromagnetic or spiral order).
Different magnetic orderings in the chain modify the overall phase diagram,
even suppressing the boundless topological phase found in the bulk for chains
located at the QSHI edge. Moreover, we quantify the ""quality"" of MBSs by
calculating the Majorana Polarization (MP) for different configurations. For
chains located at the edge, the MP is close to its maximum value already for
short chains. For chains located away from the edge, longer chains are needed
to attain the same quality as chains located at the edge. The MP also
oscillates in phase with the in-gap states, which is relatively unexpected as
peaks in the energy spectrum corresponds to stronger overlap of MBSs.

$<10^{10}$ solar masses, simulated velocities match those of both analytical
models and are unaffected by the potential; above they reduce significantly as

outflow mass and each of the three phases differently. Outflow mass in the hot,
warm, and cold phases each scale with stellar mass as $\log M_*=$ -0.25, -0.97,

galaxies. In particular, using M82 as the canonical galaxy to interpret
hydrodynamical simulations of starburst-driven outflows from higher mass
galaxies will underestimate the retarding effect of gravity. Using the analytic

an electro-mechanically guided growth affected by axial strain and radial

non-uniformity of the residual stress distribution and induce extensional
buckling, while a low voltage can delay the onset of wrinkling shapes and can
also generate more complex morphologies. Within a controllable range, axial
tensile stretching shows the ability to stabilise the tube and help form more
complex 3D patterns, while compressive stretching promotes instability. Both
the applied voltage and external axial strain have a significant impact on
guiding growth and pattern formation. Our modelling provides a basic tool for
analysing the growth of electro-elastic materials, which can be useful for

finite-temperature many-body induced tails in the half-metallic gap. To this
end, the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is employed. For the bulk, a Bethe
lattice model is solved using a matrix product states based impurity solver at
zero temperature and a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CT-QMC) solver at
finite temperature. We demonstrate numerically, in agreement with the
analytical result, that the tails vanish at the Fermi level at zero
temperature. In order to study multilayers, taken to be square lattices within
the layers, we use the real-space DMFT extension with the CT-QMC impurity
solver. For bilayers formed by the HMF with a band or correlated insulator, we
find that charge fluctuations between the layers enhance the finite temperature
tails. In addition, in the presence of inter-layer hopping, a coherent
quasiparticle peak forms in the otherwise correlated insulator. In the
multilayer heterostructure setup, we find that by suitably choosing the model
parameters, the tails at the HMF/Mott insulator interface can be reduced

  Invasion, fixation and coexistence regimes","57 pages",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the interplay between two fundamental mechanisms of microbial
population dynamics and evolution called dormancy and horizontal gene transfer.
The corresponding traits come in many guises and are ubiquitous in microbial
communities, affecting their dynamics in important ways. Recently, they have
each moved (separately) into the focus of stochastic individual-based modelling
(Billiard et al. 2016, 2018; Champagnat, M\'el\'eard and Tran, 2021; Blath and
T\'obi\'as 2020). Here, we examine their combined effects in a unified model.
Indeed, we consider the (idealized) scenario of two sub-populations,
respectively carrying 'trait 1' and 'trait 2', where trait 1 individuals are
able to switch (under competitive pressure) into a dormant state, and trait 2
individuals are able to execute horizontal gene transfer, turning trait 1
individuals into trait 2 ones, at a rate depending on the frequency of
individuals. In the large-population limit, we examine the fate of a single
trait i individual (a 'mutant') arriving in a trait j resident population
living in equilibrium, for $i,j=1,2,i \neq j$. We provide a complete analysis
of the invasion dynamics in all cases where the resident population is
individually fit and the initial behaviour of the mutant population is
non-critical. We identify parameter regimes for the invasion and fixation of
the new trait, stable coexistence of the two traits, and 'founder control'
(where the initial resident always dominates, irrespective of its trait). The
most striking result is that stable coexistence occurs in certain scenarios
even if trait 2 (which benefits from transfer at the cost of trait 1) would be
unfit when being merely on its own. In the case of founder control, the
limiting dynamical system has an unstable coexistence equilibrium. In all
cases, we observe the classical (up to 3) phases of invasion dynamics \`a la
Champagnat (2006).

to support human labor. Researchers and technology companies such as Google and

applications. The goal of these applications is to continuously track people's
proximity and to make the smartphone users aware if they have ever been in
contact with positively diagnosed people, so that they could self-quarantine
and possibly have an infection test. A fundamental challenge with these
smartphone-based contact tracing technologies is to ensure the security and
privacy of their users. Moving from manual to smartphone-based contact tracing
creates new cyber risks that could suddenly affect the entire population. Major
risks include for example the abuse of the people's private data by companies

both emit, and interact with traveling polariton waves. By fine tuning the
lattice parameters, we reveal a nonequilibrium phase transition between two
distinct regimes of polariton condensation: a scatterer lattice of gain guided
polaritons condensing on the lattice potential maxima, and trapped polaritons
condensing in the lattice potential minima. The transition is characterised by
multimodal condensation due to gain competition between the two regimes. Energy
tomography on the polariton emission enables us to measure the intricate band
structure of the optically induced lattices. Our results pave the way towards
unexplored physics of non-Hermitian fluids in non-stationary mixtures of
confined and freely expanding waves.

the chemical abundance of HR 8799 and its planet c. We measure stellar
abundance using LBT/PEPSI (R=120,000) and archival HARPS data: stellar [C/H],
[O/H], and C/O are 0.11$\pm$0.12, 0.12$\pm$0.14, and 0.54$^{+0.12}_{-0.09}$,
all consistent with solar values. We conduct atmospheric retrieval using newly
obtained Subaru/CHARIS data together with archival Gemini/GPI and Keck/OSIRIS

using PyMultiNest. Retrieved planetary abundance can vary by $\sim$0.5 dex,
from sub-stellar to stellar C and O abundances. The variation depends on
whether strong priors are chosen to ensure a reasonable planet mass. Moreover,
comparison with previous works also reveals inconsistency in abundance
measurements. We discuss potential issues that can cause the inconsistency,
e.g., systematics in individual data sets and different assumptions in the
physics and chemistry in retrieval. We conclude that no robust retrieval can be

the appearance and patterns of the motions in the video sequences; however, the
conventional methodologies and classic neural networks cannot use temporal
information for action recognition prediction in the upcoming frames in a video
sequence. On the other hand, the computational cost of the preprocessing stage
is high. In this paper, we address challenges of the preprocessing phase, by an
automated selection of representative frames among the input sequences.
Furthermore, we extract the key features of the representative frame rather
than the entire features. We propose a hybrid technique using background
subtraction and HOG, followed by application of a deep neural network and
skeletal modelling method. The combination of a CNN and the LSTM recursive
network is considered for feature selection and maintaining the previous
information, and finally, a Softmax-KNN classifier is used for labelling human
activities. We name our model as Feature Reduction & Deep Learning based action

a key milestone on the way to an integrated platform capable of handling the
increasing demands for higher speed and higher capacity for information
transfer. Given the weak electro-optic and thermo-optic effects in silicon,
there has been intense interest in hybrid structures in which that switching
could be accomplished by integrating another material into the waveguide,
including the phase-changing material, vanadium dioxide (VO2). It has long been
known that the phase transition in VO2 can be triggered by ultrafast laser
pulses, and that pump-laser fluence is a critical parameter governing the
recovery time of thin films irradiated by femtosecond laser pulses near 800 nm.
However, thin-film experiments are not a priori reliable guides to using VO2
for all-optical switching in on-chip silicon photonics because of the large
changes in VO2 optical constants in the telecommunications band, the
requirement of low insertion loss, and the limits on switching energy
permissible in integrated photonic systems. Here we report the first
measurements to show that the reversible, ultrafast photo-induced phase
transition in VO2 can be harnessed to achieve sub-picosecond switching when
small VO2 volumes are integrated in a silicon waveguide as a modulating
element. Switching energies above threshold are of order 600 fJ/switch. These
results suggest that VO2 can now be pursued as a strong candidate for
all-optical switching with sub-picosecond on-off times.

from a fixed set of candidate algorithms most suitable for a specific instance
of an algorithmic problem class, where ""suitability"" often refers to an
algorithm's runtime. Due to possibly extremely long runtimes of candidate
algorithms, training data for algorithm selection models is usually generated
under time constraints in the sense that not all algorithms are run to
completion on all instances. Thus, training data usually comprises censored
information, as the true runtime of algorithms timed out remains unknown.
However, many standard AS approaches are not able to handle such information in
a proper way. On the other side, survival analysis (SA) naturally supports
censored data and offers appropriate ways to use such data for learning
distributional models of algorithm runtime, as we demonstrate in this work. We
leverage such models as a basis of a sophisticated decision-theoretic approach
to algorithm selection, which we dub Run2Survive. Moreover, taking advantage of
a framework of this kind, we advocate a risk-averse approach to algorithm
selection, in which the avoidance of a timeout is given high priority. In an
extensive experimental study with the standard benchmark ASlib, our approach is
shown to be highly competitive and in many cases even superior to
state-of-the-art AS approaches.

that these embeddings are preserved exactly by the Schur complement graph that

Schur complements is expensive, we give a nearly-linear time algorithm that

varying the wall Reynolds number in the range $0 \leq Re_w \leq 4000$ and
Prandtl number $0.22 \leq Pr \leq 4.6$, extending our prior work by Blass et
al. (2020), where $Pr$ was kept constant at unity and the thermal forcing
($Ra$) varied. We cover a wide span of bulk Richardson numbers $0.014 \leq Ri
\leq 100$ and show that the Prandtl number strongly influences the morphology
and dynamics of the flow structures. In particular, at fixed $Ra$ and $Re_w$, a
high Prandtl number causes stronger momentum transport from the walls and
therefore yields a greater impact of the wall shear on the flow structures,
resulting in an increased effect of $Re_w$ on the Nusselt number. Furthermore,
we analyse the thermal and kinetic boundary layer thicknesses and relate their
behaviour to the resulting flow regimes. For the largest shear rates and $Pr$
numbers, we observe the emergence of a Prandtl-von Karman log-layer, signalling
the onset of turbulent dynamics in the boundary layer. Finally, our results
allow to extend the Grossmann-Lohse theory for heat transport in
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection to the sheared case, universally describing

key properties of Bayesian network and explain score metrics used to measure

the methods to add them as cutting planes without declaring them all in the

corona have established that true wave energies hide in the nonthermal line
widths of the optically thin emission lines. This displays the need for a
relation between the nonthermal line widths and transverse wave amplitudes for
estimating the true wave energies. In the past decade, several studies have
assumed that the root mean square (rms) wave amplitudes are larger than
nonthermal line widths by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. However, a few studies have
ignored this factor while estimating rms wave amplitudes. Thus there appears to
exist a discrepancy in this relation. In this study, we investigate the
dependence of nonthermal line widths on wave amplitudes by constructing a
simple mathematical model followed by 3D MHD simulations. We derive this
relation for the linearly polarised, circularly polarised oscillations, and
oscillations excited by multiple velocity drivers. We note a fairly good match
between mathematical models and numerical simulations. We conclude that the rms
wave amplitudes are never greater than the nonthermal line widths which raises
questions about earlier studies claiming transverse waves carry enough energy
to heat the solar corona.

We find that following the initial discharge, the system undergoes gradual

reaching a state of quasi-periodic oscillations, depending on the spectral
shape and luminosity of the ambient radiation field. The oscillations occur
near the null charge surface in cases where the global magnetospheric current
is in the direction defined by the product of the asymptotic Goldreich-Julian
charge density and the radial velocity, while they occur near the boundary of
the simulation box when it is the opposite direction (return current). Their
amplitude and the resultant luminosity of TeV photons emitted from the gap
depend sensitively on the conditions; for the cases studied here the ratio of
TeV luminosity to the Blandford-Znajek power ranges from $10^{-5}$ to
$10^{-2}$, suggesting that strong flares may be generated by moderate changes
in disk emission. We also examined the dependence of the solution on the
initial number of particles per cell (PPC) and found convergence for PPC of
about 50 for the cases examined. At lower PPC values the pair multiplicity is
found to be artificially high, affecting the solution considerably.

subgroup for the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs field enters the symmetry break to
relate the strong and electroweak energy scales by exchange of one quantum of
action between the two sectors. This shapes the Higgs potential to fourth
order. Recently intrinsic quantum mechanics has given a suggestion for the
Cabibbo angle from theory (EPL124-2018) and a prediction for the Higgs
couplings to gauge bosons (EPL125-2019). Previously it has given the nucleon
mass and the parton distribution functions for u and d quarks in the proton
(EPL102-2013). It has given a quite accurate equation for the Higgs mass in
closed form (IJMPA30-2015) and an N and Delta spectrum essentially without
missing resonances (arXiv:1109.4732). The intrinsic space is to be
distinguished from an interior space. The intrinsic space is non-spatial, i.e.
no gravity in intrinsic space. The configuration variable is like a generalized
spin variable excited from laboratory space by kinematic generators: momentum,
spin and Laplace-Runge-Lenz operators. The baryon dynamics resides in a
Hamiltonian on U(3) and projects to laboratory space by the momentum form of
the wavefunction. The momentum form generates conjugate quark and gluon fields.
Local gauge invariance in laboratory space follows from unitarity of the
configuration variable and left invariance of the coordinate fields on the
intrinsic space. Future work should aim to invoke leptons in the second and
third generations and quarks in the third.

parameters such as the number of modes, the coarse-graining length and the
coupling constant. We show that in general the system studied here tends to
equilibrium, but the relaxation can be retarded depending on the values of the

  First, we consider the problem of determining if a sequence of parentheses is
a properly balanced one (a Dyck word), with a depth of at most $k$. We call
this the $Dyck_{k,n}$ problem. We prove a lower bound of $\Omega(c^k
\sqrt{n})$, showing that the complexity of this problem increases exponentially
in $k$. Here $n$ is the length of the word. When $k$ is a constant, this is
interesting as a representative example of star-free languages for which a
surprising $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ query quantum algorithm was recently
constructed by Aaronson et al. Their proof does not give rise to a general
algorithm. When $k$ is not a constant, $Dyck_{k,n}$ is not context-free. We
give an algorithm with $O\left(\sqrt{n}(\log{n})^{0.5k}\right)$ quantum queries
for $Dyck_{k,n}$ for all $k$. This is better than the trival upper bound $n$
for $k=o\left(\frac{\log(n)}{\log\log n}\right)$.
  Second, we consider connectivity problems on grid graphs in 2 dimensions, if
some of the edges of the grid may be missing. By embedding the ""balanced
parentheses"" problem into the grid, we show a lower bound of
$\Omega(n^{1.5-\epsilon})$ for the directed 2D grid and
$\Omega(n^{2-\epsilon})$ for the undirected 2D grid. The directed problem is
interesting as a black-box model for a class of classical dynamic programming
strategies including the one that is usually used for the well-known edit
distance problem. We also show a generalization of this result to more than 2
dimensions.

each user exploits limited local computational resources to train a local FL
model with its collected data and, then, sends the trained FL model parameters
to a base station (BS) which aggregates the local FL models and broadcasts the
aggregated FL model back to all the users. Since FL involves learning model
exchanges between the users and the BS, both computation and communication
latencies are determined by the required learning accuracy level, which affects
the convergence rate of the FL algorithm. This joint learning and communication
problem is formulated as a delay minimization problem, where it is proved that
the objective function is a convex function of the learning accuracy. Then, a
bisection search algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce delay by up to

support to patients with critical cardiac failure. Severe complications can
occur because of the modifications of the blood flow in the aortic region. In
this work, the effect of a continuous flow LVAD device on the aortic flow is
investigated by means of a non-intrusive reduced order model (ROM) built using
the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation (PODI) method. The full
order model (FOM) is represented by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
discretized by using a Finite Volume (FV) technique, coupled with three-element
Windkessel models to enforce outlet boundary conditions in a multi-scale
approach. A patient-specific framework is proposed: a personalized geometry
reconstructed from Computed Tomography (CT) images is used and the
individualization of the coefficients of the three-element Windkessel models is
based on experimental data provided by the Right Heart Catheterization (RCH)
and Echocardiography (ECHO) tests. Pre-surgery configuration is also considered
at FOM level in order to further validate the model. A parametric study with
respect to the LVAD flow rate is considered. The accuracy of the reduced order
model is assessed against results obtained with the full order model.

memory corruption vulnerabilities. By analyzing recent research, we observe
that bypasses of defensive solutions that enforce control-flow integrity or
attempt to detect return-oriented programming require memory disclosure attacks
as a fundamental first step. However, research lags behind in detecting such
information leaks.
  In this paper, we tackle this problem and present a system for fine-grained,
automated detection of memory disclosure attacks against scripting engines. The
basic insight is as follows: scripting languages, such as JavaScript in web
browsers, are strictly sandboxed. They must not provide any insights about the
memory layout in their contexts. In fact, any such information potentially
represents an ongoing memory disclosure attack. Hence, to detect information
leaks, our system creates a clone of the scripting engine process with a
re-randomized memory layout. The clone is instrumented to be synchronized with
the original process. Any inconsistency in the script contexts of both
processes appears when a memory disclosure was conducted to leak information
about the memory layout. Based on this detection approach, we have designed and
implemented Detile (\underline{det}ection of \underline{i}nformation
\underline{le}aks), a prototype for the JavaScript engine in Microsoft's
Internet Explorer 10/11 on Windows 8.0/8.1. An empirical evaluation shows that

involved in the phase field approach to fracture and also in the continuous

by micromechanical modeling through the homogenization theory, where the
representative volume element (RVE) has a planar crack in the center. The
proposed model is made closely match the response of the RVE, including the
frictionless self-contact condition. This homogenization approach allows to
identify a direction-dependent phase field model with the tension-compression
split obtained from cracked microstructures. One important feature of the
proposed model is that unlike most other models, the material degradation is
consistently determined without artificial assumptions or ad hoc parameters
with no physical interpretation, thus, a more realistic modeling is resulted.
With standard tests such as uniaxial loadings, three-point bending, simple
shear, and through-crack tests, the proposed model predicts reasonable crack
paths. Moreover, with the RVE response as a benchmark, the proposed model gives
rise to an accurate stress-strain curve under shear loads, more accurate than
most existing models.

Additionally, code gadgets are verified to provide the needed functionality for

lockdown costs and benefits, focussing on the United Kingdom (UK). Miles et al.
(2020) argue that the March-June UK lockdown was more costly than the benefit
of lives saved, evaluated using the NICE threshold of {\pounds}30000 for a
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that the costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks
from mid-June would be vastly greater than any plausible estimate of the
benefits, even if easing produced a second infection wave causing over 7000
deaths weekly by mid-September.
  I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and
cast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut
off after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they
assume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths
and corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes
that (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or
social interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary
lockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under
these assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of
serious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for
survivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in
deaths.
  In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without
estimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness
costs. More work on modelling these uncertainties is urgently needed.
