for wide baseline stereo focusing on the HardNet descriptor, which is close to
state-of-the-art. AMOS Patches dataset is introduced, which improves robustness
to illumination and appearance changes. It is based on registered images from
selected cameras from the AMOS dataset. We provide recommendations on the patch
dataset creation process and evaluate HardNet trained on data of different
modalities. We also introduce a dataset combination and reduction methods, that
allow comparable performance on a significantly smaller dataset.
  HardNet8, consistently outperforming the original HardNet, benefits from the
architectural choices made: connectivity pattern, final pooling, receptive
field, CNN building blocks found by manual or automatic search algorithms --
DARTS. We show impact of overlooked hyperparameters such as batch size and
length of training on the descriptor quality. PCA dimensionality reduction
further boosts performance and also reduces memory footprint.
  Finally, the insights gained lead to two HardNet8 descriptors: one performing
well on a variety of benchmarks -- HPatches, AMOS Patches and IMW Phototourism,
the other is optimized for IMW Phototourism.

models to data, for hypothesis selection and parameter estimation. However it
is little used because it is computationally very intensive. Here it is shown
how Bayes factors can be calculated accurately and easily, so that any
least-squares or maximum-likelihood fits may be routinely followed by the
calculation of Bayes factors to guide the best choice of model and hence the
best estimations of parameters. Approximations to the Bayes factor, such as the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), are increasingly used. Occam's razor
expresses a primary intuition, that parameters should not be multiplied
unnecessarily, and that is quantified by the BIC. The Bayes factor quantifies
two further intuitions. Models with physically-meaningful parameters are
preferable to models with physically-meaningless parameters. Models that could
fail to fit the data, yet which do fit, are preferable to models which span the
data space and are therefore guaranteed to fit the data. The outcomes of using
Bayes factors are often very different from traditional statistics tests and
from the BIC. Three examples are given. In two of these examples, the easy
calculation of the Bayes factor is exact. The third example illustrates the
rare conditions under which it has some error and shows how to diagnose and
correct the error.

hamper the fight against the virus.
  While the scientific community is actively engaged in identifying the virus
treatment, there is a growing interest in combating the associated harmful

underwrote most conceptions - and analyses - of distributed brain responses:
namely functional segregation and integration. There are currently two main
approaches to characterising functional integration. The first is a mechanistic
modelling of connectomics in terms of directed effective connectivity that
mediates neuronal message passing and dynamics on neuronal circuits. The second
phenomenological approach usually characterises undirected functional
connectivity (i.e., measurable correlations), in terms of intrinsic brain
networks, self-organised criticality, dynamical instability, etc. This paper
describes a treatment of effective connectivity that speaks to the emergence of
intrinsic brain networks and critical dynamics. It is predicated on the notion
of Markov blankets that play a fundamental role in the self-organisation of far
from equilibrium systems. Using the apparatus of the renormalisation group, we
show that much of the phenomenology found in network neuroscience is an
emergent property of a particular partition of neuronal states, over
progressively larger scales. As such, it offers a way of linking dynamics on
directed graphs to the phenomenology of intrinsic brain networks.

of industrial products in Industrial IoT (IIoT), accurately and timely
detecting anomalies is becoming increasingly important. Furthermore, data
collected by the edge device may contain the user's private data, which is
challenging the current detection approaches as user privacy is calling for the
public concern in recent years. With this focus, this paper proposes a new
communication-efficient on-device federated learning (FL)-based deep anomaly
detection framework for sensing time-series data in IIoT. Specifically, we
first introduce a FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to
collaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can improve its
generalization ability. Second, we propose an Attention Mechanism-based
Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to
accurately detect anomalies. The AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention
mechanism-based CNN units to capture important fine-grained features, thereby
preventing memory loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this
model retains the advantages of LSTM unit in predicting time series data.
Third, to adapt the proposed framework to the timeliness of industrial anomaly
detection, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-\textit{k}
selection to improve communication efficiency. Extensive experiment studies on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately
and timely detect anomalies and also reduce the communication overhead by 50\%

sample-optimal verification protocols based on local measurements have been
found only for disparate groups of states: bipartite pure states, GHZ states,
and antisymmetric basis states. In this work, we investigate systematically
optimal verification of entangled stabilizer states using Pauli measurements.
First, we provide a lower bound on the sample complexity of any verification
protocol based on separable measurements, which is independent of the number of
qubits and the specific stabilizer state. Then we propose a simple algorithm
for constructing optimal protocols based on Pauli measurements. Our
calculations suggest that optimal protocols based on Pauli measurements can
saturate the above bound for all entangled stabilizer states, and this claim is
verified explicitly for states up to seven qubits. Similar results are derived
when each party can choose only two measurement settings, say X and Z.
Furthermore, by virtue of the chromatic number, we provide an upper bound for
the minimum number of settings required to verify any graph state, which is
expected to be tight. For experimentalists, optimal protocols and protocols
with the minimum number of settings are explicitly provided for all equivalent
classes of stabilizer states up to seven qubits. For theorists, general results
on stabilizer states (including graph states in particular) and related
structures derived here may be of independent interest beyond quantum state
verification.

Moreover, the VCG mechanism services on average $1.5\%$ more EVs than the

higher prices for the EVs and higher profit for the stations, but lower utility
for the EVs. However, we theoretically prove that the VCG mechanism guarantees
truthful reporting of the EVs' preferences. In contrast, the fixed-price one is
vulnerable to agents' strategic behaviour as non-truthful EVs can charge in

deal with the challenges in studying the heterogeneous relationships between
high dimensional molecular features to a phenotype. The algorithm was adapted
from the classification expectation maximization algorithm, which offers a
novel supervised solution to the clustering problem, with substantial
improvement on both the computational efficiency and biological
interpretability. Experimental evaluation on simulated benchmark datasets
demonstrated that the CSMR can accurately identify the subspaces on which

CSMR represents a big data analysis tool with the potential to resolve the

attempt to address the hierarchy problem. The top partner is conventionally
assumed to decay to a quark and a SM boson. However, it is also possible that
the top partner decays to a non-SM scalar and a top quark. Such an exotic decay
channel can be the main decay channel of top partner, and thus provides new
windows to search for top partner at the LHC. In this paper, with classical
machine learning method Boosted Decision Tree (BDT), we perform a model
independent study of the discovery potential of this new signature at the LHC.
In order to suppress the main QCD background, we consider subdominant but clean
decay channel $a\to \gamma\gamma$. For completeness, the single production
process and pair production process of top partner are all taken into account.
We find that, for both single and pair production, the future High-Luminosity
LHC can exclude the top partner mass up to TeV scale through channel $T\to t a$
($a\to \gamma\gamma$), even if $BR(a\to \gamma\gamma)$ is as small as
$\mathcal{O}$(0.1\%). Besides, our result shows that single production can
overmatch pair production at 14 TeV LHC, provided that top partner is heavier
than $800\sim 900$ GeV.

multi-model ensemble methods such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA) embedded
with the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. BMA is a popular method
for combining the forecasts of individual simulation models by weighted
averaging and characterizing the uncertainty induced by simulating the model
structure. This method is referred to as the GEV-embedded BMA. It is, however,
based on a point-wise analysis of extreme events, which means it overlooks the
spatial dependency between nearby grid cells. Instead of a point-wise model, a
spatial extreme model such as the max-stable process (MSP) is often employed to
improve precision by considering spatial dependency. We propose an approach
that integrates the MSP into BMA, which is referred to as the MSP-BMA herein.
The superiority of the proposed method over the GEV-embedded BMA is
demonstrated by using extreme rainfall intensity data on the Korean peninsula
from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-models. The
reanalysis data called APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation Highly-Resolved
Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation, v1101) and 17 CMIP5 models
are examined for 10 grid boxes in Korea. In this example, the MSP-BMA achieves
a variance reduction over the GEV-embedded BMA. The bias inflation by MSP-BMA
over the GEV-embedded BMA is also discussed. A by-product technical advantage
of the MSP-BMA is that tedious `regridding' is not required before and after
the analysis while it should be done for the GEV-embedded BMA.

low magnetic fields and MAS frequencies, whereas owing to its higher robustness
to rf-field inhomogeneity and chemical shifts, D-RINEPT is more sensitive at
high fields and MAS frequencies, notably for protons exhibiting large offset or

vast number of other results in the subject, most notably Ramsey's theorem and
its many variants and consequences. Motivated by a question of Dobrinen, we
initiate the study of Milliken's tree theorem from the point of view of
computability theory. Our advance here stems from a careful analysis of the
Halpern-La\""{u}chli theorem which shows that it can be carried out effectively
(i.e., that it is computably true). We use this as the basis of a new inductive
proof of Milliken's tree theorem that permits us to gauge its effectivity in
turn.
  The principal outcome of this is a comprehensive classification of the
computable content of Milliken's tree theorem. We apply our analysis also to
several well-known applications of Milliken's tree theorem, namely Devlin's
theorem, a partition theorem for Rado graphs, and a generalized version of the
so-called tree theorem of Chubb, Hirst, and McNicholl. These are all certain
kinds of extensions of Ramsey's theorem for different structures, namely the
rational numbers, the Rado graph, and perfect binary trees, respectively. We
obtain a number of new results about how these principles relate to Milliken's
tree theorem and to each other, in terms of both their computability-theoretic
and combinatorial aspects. We identify again the familiar dichotomy between
coding the halting problem or not based on the size of instance, but this is
more subtle here owing to the more complicated underlying structures,
particularly in the case of Devlin's theorem. We also establish new structural
Ramsey-theoretic properties of the Rado graph theorem and the generalized
Chubb-Hirst-McNicholl tree theorem using Zucker's notion of big Ramsey
structure.

at nanoscales is imperative for unlocking adsorbed hydrocarbon in tight
reservoirs, especially in unconventional shale that retain abundant hydrocarbon
in kerogen nanopores. In this study, the temperature effect on interactions of
light oil with a type II kerogen in water was investigated using molecular
dynamics simulation. Non-polar and polar light oil droplets were modeled by
clusters of 30 octane molecules and 30 octanethiol molecules, respectively. The
free energy calculations were performed with umbrella sampling at constant
temperatures in the range 300-500 $K$, that are comparable to the reservoir
conditions of common shale plays. Our result shows that the
adsorption/desorption energy of an oil droplet is a linear function of
temperature ($T$), which can be described by $f(T) = c_1\times T + c_2$ where
$c_1$ and $c_2$ are constant. Comparative simulations show that a single oil
molecule cannot qualitatively describe oil droplet. In addition, the most
stable contact angles of oil droplets, which are associated with the global
energy minimum, were identified by computing free energy across a wide range of
distance between the oil droplet and the kerogen surface. The cosine of the
contact angle can be linearly correlated with the free energy of oil
adsorption/desorption. This study provides a thermodynamic insight at the
molecular level on how temperature affects the oil interactions with kerogen,
providing valuable implications to improve unconventional oil recovery.

include is not always straightforward. Using data on two agonistic behaviors in
a captive population of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), we developed a
framework for investigating how pooling or splitting behaviors at the scale of
dyadic relationships (between two individuals) affects individual- and
group-level social properties. We designed two reference models to test whether
randomizing the number of interactions across behavior types results in similar
structural patterns as the observed data. Although the behaviors were
correlated, the first reference model suggests that the two behaviors convey
different information about some social properties and should therefore not be
pooled. However, once we controlled for data sparsity, we found that the
observed measures corresponded with those from the second reference model.
Hence, our initial result may have been due to the unequal frequencies of each
behavior. Overall, our findings support pooling the two behaviors. Awareness of
how selected measurements can be affected by data properties is warranted, but
nonetheless our framework disentangles these efforts and as a result can be
used for myriad types of behaviors and questions. This framework will help
researchers make informed and data-driven decisions about which behaviors to

door to new experiments across many fields including materials physics, energy
storage and conversion, and biology. Such experiments, however, often face
signal limitations due to sample sensitivity or the need for rapid data
acquisition under less stable cryogenic conditions. Compared to traditional
indirect detection systems such as charge coupled devices (CCDs), direct
electron detectors (DEDs) offer improved detective quantum efficiencies,
narrower point spread functions, and superior signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we
compare the performance of a Gatan K2 Summit DED to an UltraScan 1000 CCD for
use in signal-limited atomic-resolution STEM-EELS experiments. Due to its
improved point spread function, the DED's energy resolution remains comparable
to that of the CCD at a 5 times lower dispersion, providing simultaneous access
to a much broader total energy range without sacrificing spectral resolution.
More importantly, the benefits of direct detection enable a variety of
low-signal experiments, including atomic-resolution mapping of minor and high
energy edges such as the La-M$_{2,3}$ edge at 1123 eV and the Bi-M$_{4,5}$ edge
at 2580 eV. For rapid acquisitions at 400 spectra per second, elemental maps
recorded with the DED show an up to 40 percent increase in atomic lattice
fringe contrast compared to those acquired with the CCD. Taking advantage of
these performance improvements and the fast readout of the K2 DED, we use
direct detection STEM-EELS to demonstrate atomic-resolution elemental mapping

Numerical results, obtained with the help of Monte Carlo simulation algorithm,
reveal that the ground state properties strongly depend on the onsite Coulomb
correlation between itinerant and localized electrons, orbital magnetic field
as well as the Zeeman splitting. Strikingly, for the on-site Coulomb
correlation $U/t \approx 1$, the Zeeman splitting produces a phase transition
from paramagnetic metal/insulator to ferromagnetic insulator/metal transition
in the itinerant electron subsystem accompanied by the phase segregation to the
bounded/regular phase in the localized electrons subsystem. For the onsite
Coulomb correlation $U/t \approx 5$, although no metal to insulator transition
is observed but a magnetic phase transition from paramagnetic phase to
ferromagnetic phase in the itinerant electron subsystem is observed with the

uniaxial compression to a confined one are often overlooked and display a
surprising level of complexity, even for simple elastic plastic constitutive

polystyrene thin films achieved through repeated plastic loading with a
cylindrical flat punch whose diameter is many times the initial film thickness.
This high aspect ratio combines with constraint provided by film material
surrounding the contact to generate a state of confined uniaxial strain in the

into the plastic domain, we achieve a 66% increase in the confined yield

arises not from intrinsic changes to the structure of the material, but rather
residual stresses imparted during plastic loading. We contrast this effect with

orders of magnitude thinner than the operating wavelength, i.e. thickness
$\approx\lambda/102$. This paves the way for developing advanced acoustic
metasurfaces with applicability to functional acoustic devices in sound-related

$w(t)\sim [\ln(t)]^{1/2}$ in the long-time limit. Krug (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf

remain unchanged with a change in the geometry. Other studies indicated that
for radial growth the exponent $\beta$ should remain the same as that of the
planar case, regardless of whether the growth is linear or nonlinear, but that
the saturation regime will not be reached anymore. We present the results of
extensive numerical simulations in (1+1)-dimensions of the radial KPZ equation,
starting from an initial circular substrate. We find that unlike the KPZ
equation for flat substrates, the transition from linear to nonlinear
universality classes is not sharp. Moreover, in the long-time limit the
interface width exhibits logarithmic growth with the time, instead of
saturation. We also find that evaporation dominates the growth process when the
coefficient of the nonlinear term in the KPZ equation is small, and that the
average radius of the interface decreases with time and reaches a minimum but
not zero value.

algorithmic task in the study of real-world graphs, with applications in
community detection, pattern recognition, and clustering. A number of effective
backtracking-based heuristics for these problems have emerged from recent
empirical work in social network analysis. Given the NP-hardness of variants of
clique counting, these results raise a challenge for beyond worst-case analysis
of these problems. Inspired by the triadic closure of real-world graphs, Fox et
al. (SICOMP 2020) introduced the notion of $c$-closed graphs and proved that
maximal clique enumeration is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $c$.
  In practice, due to noise in data, one wishes to actually discover
""near-cliques"", which can be characterized as cliques with a sparse subgraph
removed. In this work, we prove that many different kinds of maximal
near-cliques can be enumerated in polynomial time (and FPT in $c$) for
$c$-closed graphs. We study various established notions of such substructures,
including $k$-plexes, complements of bounded-degeneracy and bounded-treewidth
graphs. Interestingly, our algorithms follow relatively simple backtracking
procedures, analogous to what is done in practice. Our results underscore the
significance of the $c$-closed graph class for theoretical understanding of
social network analysis.

proposed as a strategy to reduce peak power in data centers. Thermal energy
storage systems, such as chilled water tanks, have gained increasing attention
in data centers for load shifting due to their relatively small capital and
operational costs compared to electrochemical energy storage. However, there
are few studies investigating the possibility of utilizing thermal energy
storage system with resources to provide ancillary services (e.g., frequency
regulation) to the grid. This paper proposes a synergistic control strategy for
the data center with a chilled water storage providing frequency regulation
service by adjusting the chiller capacity, storage charging rate, and IT server
CPU frequency. Then, a three-stage multi-market scheduling framework based on a
model predictive control scheme is developed to minimize operational costs of
data centers participating in both energy and regulation markets. The framework
solves a power baseline scheduling problem, a regulation reserve problem, and a
real-time power signal tracking problem sequentially. Simulation results show
that utilizing the thermal energy storage can increase the regulation capacity
bid, reduce energy costs and demand charges, and also harvest frequency
regulation revenues. The proposed multi-market scheduling framework in a span
of two days can reduce the operational costs up to 8.8% ($1,606.4) compared to
the baseline with 0.2% (\$38.7) energy cost reduction, 6.5% (\$1,179.4) from

  Games",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fast-growing market of autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and
fleets in general necessitates the design of smart and automatic navigation
systems considering the stochastic latency along different paths in the traffic
network. The longstanding shortest path problem in a deterministic network,
whose counterpart in a congestion game setting is Wardrop equilibrium, has been
studied extensively, but it is well known that finding the notion of an optimal
path is challenging in a traffic network with stochastic arc delays. In this
work, we propose three classes of risk-averse equilibria for an atomic
stochastic congestion game in its general form where the arc delay
distributions are load dependent and not necessarily independent of each other.
The three classes are risk-averse equilibrium (RAE), mean-variance equilibrium
(MVE), and conditional value at risk level $\alpha$ equilibrium
(CVaR$_\alpha$E) whose notions of risk-averse best responses are based on
maximizing the probability of taking the shortest path, minimizing a linear
combination of mean and variance of path delay, and minimizing the expected
delay at a specified risky quantile of the delay distributions, respectively.
We prove that for any finite stochastic atomic congestion game, the
risk-averse, mean-variance, and CVaR$_\alpha$ equilibria exist. We show that
for risk-averse travelers, the Braess paradox may not occur to the extent
presented originally since players do not necessarily travel along the shortest
path in expectation, but they take the uncertainty of travel time into
consideration as well. We show through some examples that the price of anarchy
can be improved when players are risk-averse and travel according to one of the
three classes of risk-averse equilibria rather than the Wardrop equilibrium.

traditional invasive forms of site-characterization for inferring a site's
subsurface shear wave velocity (Vs) structure. The advantage of surface wave
methods over traditional forms of site characterization is that measurements
made solely at the ground surface can be used routinely and economically to
infer the subsurface structure of a site to depths of engineering interest
(20-50 m), and much greater depths (>1 km) in some special cases. However, the
quantification and propagation of uncertainties from surface wave measurements
into the Vs profiles used in subsequent engineering analyses remains
challenging. While this has been the focus of much work in recent years, and
while considerable progress has been made, no approach for doing so has been
widely accepted, leading analysts to either address the propagation of
uncertainties in their own specialized manner or, worse, to ignore these
uncertainties entirely. In response, this paper presents an easy-to-implement,
effective, and verifiable method for developing uncertainty-consistent Vs
profiles from inversion of surface wave dispersion data. We begin by examining
four approaches presented in the literature for developing suites of Vs
profiles meant to account for uncertainty present in the measured dispersion
data. These methods are shown to be deficient in three specific ways. First,
all approaches are shown to be highly sensitive to their many user-defined
inversion input parameters, making it difficult/impossible for them to be
performed repeatedly by different analysts. Second, the suites of inverted Vs
profiles, when viewed in terms of their implied theoretical dispersion data,
are shown to significantly underestimate the uncertainty present in the
experimental dispersion data, though some may appear satisfactory when viewed
purely qualitatively...

of the human brain is prevalent in modern medical imaging analysis. Due to the
complex network topology, for an individual brain, mining a discriminative
network representation from the multimodal brain networks is non-trivial. The
recent success of deep learning techniques on graph-structured data suggests a
new way to model the non-linear cross-modality relationship. However, current
deep brain network methods either ignore the intrinsic graph topology or
require a network basis shared within a group. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel end-to-end deep graph representation learning (Deep Multimodal
Brain Networks - DMBN) to fuse multimodal brain networks. Specifically, we
decipher the cross-modality relationship through a graph encoding and decoding
process. The higher-order network mappings from brain structural networks to
functional networks are learned in the node domain. The learned network
representation is a set of node features that are informative to induce brain
saliency maps in a supervised manner. We test our framework in both synthetic

modified Maxwell equations are solved in terms of coupled electric and magnetic
scalar potentials using spherical coordinates and in the approximation where
the effective magnetoelectric coupling is of the order of the fine structure
constant. The emphasis is placed in the calculation of the magnetic field for
several relevant configurations designed to enhance the possibility of
measuring this field. The magnitudes we obtain fall within the sensitivities of

globe. Large scale and rapid testing of the population is required to contain
the disease, but such testing is prohibitive in terms of resources, cost and
time. Recently RT-PCR based pooled testing has emerged as a promising way to
boost testing efficiency. We introduce a stepped pooled testing strategy, a
probability driven approach which significantly reduces the number of tests
required to identify infected individuals in a large population. Our
comprehensive methodology incorporates the effect of false negative and
positive rates to accurately determine not only the efficiency of pooling but
also it's accuracy. Under various plausible scenarios, we show that this
approach significantly reduces the cost of testing and also reduces the
effective false positive rate of tests when compared to a strategy of testing
every individual of a population. We also outline an optimization strategy to
obtain the pool size that maximizes the efficiency of pooling given the
diagnostic protocol parameters and local infection conditions.

a small chance of suppressing each other. We address this issue by comparing
only those proposals that are generated from nearby anchors. The
translation-invariant property of the anchor lattice affords generation of a

in the regime of relaxation oscillations. We analyze the regime by using the
indices of local sensitivity which enables us to evaluate the sensitivity of
each individual oscillator at finite time. Spi-ral waves are observed in both
lattices when the interaction between elements have the local character. The
dynamics of all the elements is regular. There are no high-sensitive regions.
We have discovered that when the coupling becomes nonlocal, the features of the
systems significantly changes. The oscillation regime of the spiral wave center
element switches to chaotic one. Besides this, a region with high sensitivity
occurs around this oscillator. Moreover, we show that the latter expands in
space with elongation of the coupling range. As a result, an incoherence
cluster of the spiral wave chimera is formed exactly within this high-sensitive
area. Formation of this cluster is accompanied by the sharp increase in values
of the maximal Lyapunov exponent to the positive region. Furthermore, we
explore that the system can even switch to hyperchaotic regime, when several
Lyapunov exponents becomes positive.

suffer from inherent biases. A well-known one is the position bias -- documents
in top positions are more likely to receive clicks due in part to their
position advantages. To unbiasedly learn to rank, existing counterfactual
frameworks first estimate the propensity (probability) of missing clicks with
intervention data from a small portion of search traffic, and then use inverse
propensity score (IPS) to debias LTR algorithms on the whole data set. These
approaches often assume the propensity only depends on the position of the
document, which may cause high estimation variance in applications where the
search context (e.g. query, user) varies frequently. While context-dependent
propensity models reduce variance, accurate estimations may require
randomization or intervention on a large amount of traffic, which may not be
realistic in real-world systems, especially for long tail queries. In this
work, we employ heterogeneous treatment effect estimation techniques to
estimate position bias when intervention click data is limited. We then use
such estimations to debias the observed click distribution and re-draw a new
de-biased data set, which can be used for any LTR algorithms. We conduct
simulations with varying experiment conditions and show the effectiveness of
the proposed method in regimes with long tail queries and sparse clicks.

closed two dimensional box such that they couple with their neighbors, (2)
oscillators are static and they randomly switch their coupling partners.
Configuration (1) is further studied under two possible scenarios: in the first
case oscillators couple to fixed numbers of neighbors while in other they
couple to all oscillators lying in their circle of vision. Under these
circumstances, we monitor the degrees of temporal networks, velocities, and
radius of circle of vision of the oscillators, and the probability of forming
connections in order to study and compare the critical values of the coupling
required to induce ES in the population of phase oscillators.

database privacy in an untrusted environment. Later on, researchers proposed
several variants of differential privacy in order to preserve privacy in
certain other scenarios, such as real-time cyber physical systems. Since then,
differential privacy has rigorously been applied to certain other domains which
has the need of privacy preservation. One such domain is decentralized
blockchain based smart metering, in which smart meters acting as blockchain
nodes sent their real-time data to grid utility databases for real-time
reporting. This data is further used to carry out statistical tasks, such as
load forecasting, demand response calculation, etc. However, in case if any
intruder gets access to this data it can leak privacy of smart meter users. In
this context, differential privacy can be used to protect privacy of this data.
In this chapter, we carry out comparison of four variants of differential
privacy (Laplace, Gaussian, Uniform, and Geometric) in blockchain based smart
metering scenario. We test these variants on smart metering data and carry out
their performance evaluation by varying different parameters. Experimental
outcomes shows at low privacy budget ($\varepsilon$) and at low reading
sensitivity value ($\delta$), these privacy preserving mechanisms provide high
privacy by adding large amount of noise. However, among these four privacy
preserving parameters Geometric parameters is more suitable for protecting high
peak values and Laplace mechanism is more suitable for protecting low peak
values at ($\varepsilon$ = 0.01).

standard measurement-based QEC in platforms with an unconditional qubit reset
gate. We revisit the question of fault tolerance for a measurement-free variant
of the Steane code that leverages multi-qubit gates, finding previously
overlooked phase-flip errors that undermine fault tolerance. We construct a
revised MFQEC circuit design that is resistant to all single-qubit errors, but
which nonetheless cannot tolerate certain correlated errors. In order to
investigate fault tolerance systematically, we introduce an efficient method to
classically simulate MFQEC circuits with (i) Clifford gates for syndrome
extraction, (ii) ancilla-controlled Pauli operations for decoding, and (iii) a
Pauli noise model. We thereby find a pseudothreshold of $\sim0.7\%$ for our
revised MFQEC Steane code under a restricted noise model previously considered
in the literature. We then relax noise model assumptions to identify general
requirements for fault tolerance with multi-qubit gates, finding that existing
multi-qubit neutral atom gates are incompatible with fault-tolerant syndrome
extraction in both the measurement-based and measurement-free Steane code. We
also find that decomposing multi-qubit gates down to a two-qubit gate set
similarly spoils fault tolerance for the measurement-free Steane code. Finally,
we discuss the theoretical ingredients that are necessary to recover fault
tolerance for MFQEC codes.

generalize to 4D facial expressions across subjects, we trained our model using
a high resolution dataset with 4D scans of six facial expressions from 180

$O(\text{polylog}(n))$ energy. This work left open the strange possibility that
all natural problems in multi-hop networks might admit such an energy-efficient

  In this paper we prove that the landscape of energy complexity is rich enough
to support a multitude of problem complexities. Whereas $\mathsf{Broadcast}$
can be solved by an energy-efficient protocol, exact computation of
$\mathsf{Diameter}$ cannot, requiring $\Omega(n)$ energy. Our main result is
that $\mathsf{Breadth First Search}$ has sub-polynomial energy complexity at

programming model that allows GPUs and CPUs to share the same virtual memory
space, which shifts the complex memory management from programmers to GPU
driver/ hardware and enables kernel execution even when memory is
oversubscribed. Meanwhile, UVM may also incur considerable performance overhead
due to tracking and data migration along with special handling of page faults
and page table walk. As UVM is attracting significant attention from the
research community to develop innovative solutions to these problems, in this
paper, we propose a comprehensive UVM benchmark suite named UVMBench to
facilitate future research on this important topic. The proposed UVMBench
consists of 32 representative benchmarks from a wide range of application
domains. The suite also features unified programming implementation and diverse
memory access patterns across benchmarks, thus allowing thorough evaluation and
comparison with current state-of-the-art. A set of experiments have been
conducted on real GPUs to verify and analyze the benchmark suite behaviors
under various scenarios.

problem for a high dimensional multi-layer generalized linear model (ML-GLM),
which resembles a feed-forward fully connected deep learning network in that
each of its layer mixes up the random input with a known weighting matrix and
activates the results via non-linear functions, except that the activation here
is stochastic and following some random distribution. Part I of the work
focuses on the exact MMSE estimator, whose implementation is long known
infeasible. For this exact estimator, an asymptotic analysis on the performance
is carried out using a new replica method that is refined from certain aspects.
A decoupling principle is then established, suggesting that, in terms of joint
input-and-estimate distribution, the original estimation problem of
multiple-input multiple-output is indeed identical to a simple single-input
single-output one subjected to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) only. The
variance of the AWGN is further shown to be determined by some coupled
equations, whose dependency on the weighting and activation is given explicitly
and analytically. Comparing to existing results, this paper is the first to
offer a decoupling principle for the ML-GLM estimation problem. To further
address the implementation issue of an exact solution, Part II proposes an
approximate estimator, ML-GAMP, whose per-iteration complexity is as low as
GAMP, while its asymptotic MSE (if converged) is as optimal as the exact MMSE

acquire a more distinct video feature representation for localizing the

they are being equipped with powerful, high-end mobile CPUs and GPUs. However,
it is still a challenging task to execute 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) targeting for real-time performance, besides high inference accuracy.
The reason is more complex model structure and higher model dimensionality
overwhelm the available computation/storage resources on mobile devices. A
natural way may be turning to deep learning weight pruning techniques. However,
the direct generalization of existing 2D CNN weight pruning methods to 3D CNNs
is not ideal for fully exploiting mobile parallelism while achieving high
inference accuracy.
  This paper proposes RT3D, a model compression and mobile acceleration
framework for 3D CNNs, seamlessly integrating neural network weight pruning and
compiler code generation techniques. We propose and investigate two structured
sparsity schemes i.e., the vanilla structured sparsity and kernel group
structured (KGS) sparsity that are mobile acceleration friendly. The vanilla
sparsity removes whole kernel groups, while KGS sparsity is a more fine-grained
structured sparsity that enjoys higher flexibility while exploiting full
on-device parallelism. We propose a reweighted regularization pruning algorithm
to achieve the proposed sparsity schemes. The inference time speedup due to
sparsity is approaching the pruning rate of the whole model FLOPs (floating
point operations). RT3D demonstrates up to 29.1$\times$ speedup in end-to-end
inference time comparing with current mobile frameworks supporting 3D CNNs,
with moderate 1%-1.5% accuracy loss. The end-to-end inference time for 16 video

quench dynamics provides a novel and efficient scheme in detecting topological
invariants defined in equilibrium. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies
have focused on the ideal sudden quench regime. Here we provide a generic
non-adiabatic protocol of slowly quenching the system Hamiltonian, and
investigate the non-adiabatic dynamical characterization scheme of topological
phase. The {\it slow} quench protocol is realized by introducing a Coulomb-like
Landau-Zener problem, and it can describe, in a unified way, the crossover from
sudden quench regime (deep non-adiabatic limit) to adiabatic regime. By
analytically obtaining the final state vector after non-adiabatic evolution, we
can calculate the time-averaged spin polarization and the corresponding
topological spin texture. We find that the topological invariants of the
post-quench Hamiltonian are characterized directly by the values of spin
texture on the band inversion surfaces. Compared to the sudden quench regime,
where one has to take an additional step to calculate the {\it gradients} of
spin polarization, this non-adiabatic characterization provides a {\it minimal}
scheme in detecting the topological invariants. Our findings are not restricted
to 1D and 2D topological phases under Coulomb-like quench protocol, but are
also valid for higher dimensional system or different quench protocol.

important to control for all confounding factors. However, most existing
methods require parametric specification for how control variables influence
the outcome or generalized propensity score, and inference on treatment effects
is usually sensitive to this choice. Additionally, it is often the goal to
estimate how the treatment effect varies across observed units. To address this
gap, we propose a semiparametric model using Bayesian tree ensembles for
estimating the causal effect of a continuous treatment of exposure which (i)
does not require a priori parametric specification of the influence of control

pre-specified moderators. The main parametric assumption we make is that the
effect of the exposure on the outcome is linear, with the steepness of this
relationship determined by a nonparametric function of the moderators, and we
provide heuristics to diagnose the validity of this assumption. We apply our

played by the mass exchange between the component stars. Whether the mass
transfer is dynamically stable is one of the essential questions in binary
evolution. In the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a
donor star in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic
expansion. We use the adiabatic mass loss model to systematically survey the
thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer over the entire span of
possible donor star evolutionary states. We also simulate mass loss process
with isentropic envelopes, the specific entropy of which is fixed to be that at
the base of the convective envelope, to artificially mimic the effect of such
mass loss in superadiabatic surface convection regions, where the adiabatic
approximation fails. We illustrate the general adiabatic response of 3.2 Msun
donor stars at different evolutionary stages. We extend our study to a grid of
donor stars with different masses (from 0.1 to 100 Msun with Z = 0.02) and at
different evolutionary stages. We proceed to present our criteria for
dynamically unstable mass transfer in both tabular and graphical forms. For red
giant branch and asymptotic giant branch donors in systems with such mass
ratios, they may have convective envelopes deep enough to evolve into common
envelopes on a thermal timescale, if the donor star overfills its outer
Lagrangian radius. Our results show that the red giant branch and asymptotic
giant branch stars tend to be more stable than previously believed, and this
may be helpful to explain the abundance of observed post-AGB binary stars with
an orbital period of around 1000 days.

flexibility in the choice of test statistic while still ensuring validity, most
GoF tests for composite null hypotheses are far more constrained, as the test

A notable exception is co-sufficient sampling (CSS): resampling the data

testing using any test statistic the analyst chooses. But CSS testing requires
the null model to have a compact (in an information-theoretic sense) sufficient

However, natural physical mechanisms of our society promote cooperation. Thus,
in the long run, the evolution about genetic variation is something more than
the social evolution about fitness. The loci of evolutionary paths of the
cooperation and the defection are correlated, but not a full complement of each
other. Yet, the only single specific mechanism which is operated by some rules
explains the enhancement of cooperation where the independent analysis of
defect evolutionary mechanism is ignored. Moreover, the execution of a
particular evolutionary rule through algorithm method over the long time
encounters highly sensitive influence of the model parameters. Theoretically,
biodiversity of two types relatively persists rarely. Here I describe the
evolutionary outcome in the demographic fluctuation. Using both analytical
procedure and algorithm method the article concludes that the intratype fitness

clouds. The proposed method is called Gaussian Instance Center Network (GICN),
which can approximate the distributions of instance centers scattered in the
whole scene as Gaussian center heatmaps. Based on the predicted heatmaps, a
small number of center candidates can be easily selected for the subsequent
predictions with efficiency, including i) predicting the instance size of each
center to decide a range for extracting features, ii) generating bounding boxes
for centers, and iii) producing the final instance masks. GICN is a
single-stage, anchor-free, and end-to-end architecture that is easy to train
and efficient to perform inference. Benefited from the center-dictated
mechanism with adaptive instance size selection, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the task of 3D instance segmentation on ScanNet
and S3DIS datasets.

recognition over RoI-pooled features following the standard pipeline of
Faster-RCNN. In this work, we first empirically find the recognition accuracy
is highly correlated with the bounding box size of an actor, and thus higher
resolution of actors contributes to better performance. However, video models
require dense sampling in time to achieve accurate recognition. To fit in GPU
memory, the frames to backbone network must be kept low-resolution, resulting
in a coarse feature map in RoI-Pooling layer. Thus, we revisit RCNN for
actor-centric action recognition via cropping and resizing image patches around
actors before feature extraction with I3D deep network. Moreover, we found that
expanding actor bounding boxes slightly and fusing the context features can
further boost the performance. Consequently, we develop a surpringly effective
baseline (Context-Aware RCNN) and it achieves new state-of-the-art results on
two challenging action detection benchmarks of AVA and JHMDB. Our observations
challenge the conventional wisdom of RoI-Pooling based pipeline and encourage
researchers rethink the importance of resolution in actor-centric action
recognition. Our approach can serve as a strong baseline for video action

compatible with any query input interchangeably. These instances are referred
to as interchangeable foregrounds. We first present a pipeline to build
pattern-level FoS dataset containing labels of interchangeable foregrounds. We
then establish a benchmark dataset for further training and testing following
the pipeline. As for the proposed method, we first train a foreground encoder
to learn representations of interchangeable foregrounds. We then train a query
encoder to learn query-foreground compatibility following a knowledge
distillation framework. It aims to transfer knowledge from interchangeable
foregrounds to supervise representation learning of compatibility. The query
feature representation is projected to the same latent space as interchangeable
foregrounds, enabling very efficient and interpretable instance-level search.

can enable advanced maintenance schedules, increase equipment availability and
reduce operational costs. However, existing deep learning methods for RUL
prediction are not completely successful due to the following two reasons.
First, relying on a single objective function to estimate the RUL will limit
the learned representations and thus affect the prediction accuracy. Second,
while longer sequences are more informative for modelling the sensor dynamics
of equipment, existing methods are less effective to deal with very long
sequences, as they mainly focus on the latest information. To address these two
problems, we develop a novel attention-based sequence to sequence with
auxiliary task (ATS2S) model. In particular, our model jointly optimizes both
reconstruction loss to empower our model with predictive capabilities (by
predicting next input sequence given current input sequence) and RUL prediction
loss to minimize the difference between the predicted RUL and actual RUL.
Furthermore, to better handle longer sequence, we employ the attention
mechanism to focus on all the important input information during training
process. Finally, we propose a new dual-latent feature representation to
integrate the encoder features and decoder hidden states, to capture rich
semantic information in data. We conduct extensive experiments on four real

show that our proposed method can achieve superior performance over 13

Schubert varieties in some Kac-Moody flag variety as stratified spaces. The
existence of Bruaht atlases implies some nice combinatorial and geometric
properties on the partial flag varieties and the decomposition into projected

  A Bruhat atlas does not exist for partial flag varieties of an arbitrary
Kac-Moody group due to combinatorial and geometric reasons. To overcome
obstructions, we introduce the notion of Birkhoff-Bruhat atlas. Instead of the
Schubert varieties used in a Bruhat atlas, we use the $J$-Schubert varieties
for a Birkhoff-Bruhat atlas. The notion of the $J$-Schubert varieties
interpolates Birkhoff decomposition and Bruhat decomposition of the full flag
variety (of a larger Kac-Moody group). The main result of this paper is the
construction of a Birkhoff-Bruhat atlas for any partial flag variety ${\mathcal

index set $Q_K$ of the projected Richardson varieties in ${\mathcal {P}}_K$. As
a consequence, we show that $Q_K$ has some nice combinatorial properties. This
gives a new proof and generalizes the work of Williams in the case where the

squeezed-out neutron to proton ratio, photon and light cluster as well as the
production of mesons with strangeness or hidden strangeness. The blind spots of
probing the high-density symmetry energy by sensitive observable are
demonstrated. Model dependence of frequently used sensitive probes of the
symmetry energy has been studied thoroughly based on different transport
models. A qualitative observable of neutron to proton ratio at high emitting
energy is proposed to probe the high-density symmetry energy qualitatively. The
probed density regions of the symmetry energy are carefully studied. Effects of
nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations on the some sensitive observables of
the symmetry energy in heavy-ion collisions are explored carefully. Probing the
curvature of the symmetry energy by involving the slope information of the
symmetry energy at saturation point in the transport model is proposed.

provable approximations. In this paper, we investigate the convergence of such

that constructs an approximating manifold $\mathcal{M}^h$ using information
from a given point cloud that was developed by Sober \& Levin in 2019. In this
paper, we show that provided that $\mathcal{M}\in C^{k}$ and closed (i.e.
$\mathcal{M}$ is a compact manifold without boundary) the Riemannian metric of

Explicitly, given points $ p_1, p_2 \in \mathcal{M}$ with geodesic distance $
\rho_{\mathcal{M}}(p_1, p_2) $, we show that their corresponding points $

result, as well as the fact that $ \mathcal{M}^h $ can be sampled with any
desired resolution, to devise a naive algorithm that yields approximate
geodesic distances with a rate of convergence $ O(h^{k-1}) $. We show the

dwarf-sized galaxies collide with a high relative velocity of $\sim 300\,{\rm
kms^{-1}}$. Using idealized high-resolution simulations with both mesh-based

high-velocity galaxy collisions separate dark matter from the warm disk gas
which subsequently is compressed by shock and tidal interaction to form stars.
Then using a large simulated universe IllustrisTNG, we discover a number of
high-velocity galaxy collision events in which DMDGs are expected to form.
However, we did not find evidence that these types of collisions actually
produced DMDGs in the TNG100-1 run. We argue that the resolution of the

formation scenario. Our results demonstrate one of many routes in which
galaxies could form with unconventional dark matter fractions.

then updating the values of the non-zero entries by running gradient descent on

noticeable omission is that the locations of the non-zero entries of previous
algorithms were fixed, and only their values were learned. In this work we
propose the first learning algorithm that also optimizes the locations of the
non-zero entries. We show this algorithm gives better accuracy for low rank
approximation than previous work, and apply it to other problems such as
$k$-means clustering for the first time. We show that our algorithm is provably
better in the spiked covariance model and for Zipfian matrices. We also show
the importance of the sketch monotonicity property for combining learned

concepts are generally considered hard to comprehend being underpinned only by
theoretical coursework and occasional simulations. Further, K-12 schools and
small academic institutions may not have the resources necessary to produce
tangible demonstrations for clarification. The consequent lack of affordable
hands-on experiences fails to motivate and engage students. The DIY-LWS is
intended to make wireless concepts more understandable and less esoteric by
linking fundamental concepts with familiar technologies such as solar cells,
visible lights, and smartphones. It is also intended to pique student interest
by allowing them to personally assemble, operate, and explore a light-based
wireless communication system. A preliminary assessment is used to determine
the student base knowledge level and enthusiasm for wireless and related core
topics. Students are instructed to assemble and test their own DIY-LWS hardware
to provide a hands-on experience and stimulate further exploration. Short
lectures are given to link conceptual ideas to the real-world phenomena.
Finally, students are re-assessed to quantify any change in conceptual
understanding. The DIY-LWS kits have been used in multiple events with students
at different levels from secondary to high schools to college. Pre- and
post-assessments revealed pronounced improvements (the number of correct
answers doubled) in student understanding of EM concepts. Instructors observed
tremendous interest and excitement among the students during and after the

for several classic distribution testing problems in this model.
  First, we prove that tolerant uniformity testing in the conditional sampling
model can be solved using $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ queries, which is
optimal and improves upon the $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-20})$-query algorithm of
Canonne et al. [CRS15]. This bound even holds under a restricted version of the
conditional sampling model called the Pair Conditional Sampling model. Next, we
prove that tolerant identity testing in the conditional sampling model can be
solved in $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ queries, which is the first known bound
independent of the support size of the distribution for this problem. Next, we
use our algorithm for tolerant uniformity testing to get an
$\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$-query algorithm for monotonicity testing in the
conditional sampling model, improving on the
$\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-22})$-query algorithm of Canonne [Can15]. Finally, we
study (non-tolerant) identity testing under the pair conditional sampling
model, and provide a tight bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{\log N} \cdot
\varepsilon^{-2})$ for the query complexity, where the domain of the
distribution has size $N$. This improves upon both the known upper and lower

real-world scenarios. While modern classifiers perform well on populated
classes, its performance degrades significantly on tail classes. Humans,
however, are less affected by this since, when confronted with uncertain
examples, they simply opt to provide coarser predictions. Motivated by this, a
deep realistic taxonomic classifier (Deep-RTC) is proposed as a new solution to
the long-tail problem, combining realism with hierarchical predictions. The
model has the option to reject classifying samples at different levels of the
taxonomy, once it cannot guarantee the desired performance. Deep-RTC is
implemented with a stochastic tree sampling during training to simulate all
possible classification conditions at finer or coarser levels and a rejection
mechanism at inference time. Experiments on the long-tailed version of four
datasets, CIFAR100, AWA2, Imagenet, and iNaturalist, demonstrate that the
proposed approach preserves more information on all classes with different
popularity levels. Deep-RTC also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in
longtailed recognition, hierarchical classification, and learning with
rejection literature using the proposed correctly predicted bits (CPB) metric.

diffusivity and viscosity, are temperature-dependent and can significantly
influence the flow dynamics of mesoscopic non-isothermal systems. To capture
the correct temperature-dependence of a fluid, a many-body dissipative particle
dynamics model with energy conservation (mDPDe) is developed by combining the
temperature-dependent coefficient of the conservative force and weighting terms
of the dissipative and random forces. The momentum and thermal diffusivity,
viscosity, and surface tension of liquid water at various temperatures ranging
from 273 K to 373 K are used as examples for verifying the proposed model.
Simulations of a periodic Poiseuille flow driven by body forces and heat
sources are carried out to validate the diffusivity of the present model. Also,
a steady case of heat conduction for reproducing the Fourier law is used to
validate the thermal boundary conditions. By using this mDPDe simulations, the
thermocapillary motion of liquid water nanodroplets on hydrophobic substrates
with thermal gradients is investigated. The migration of the droplet is
observed on flat substrates with gradient temperature. The velocity of the
migration becomes larger for higher temperature difference, which is in
agreement with the present theoretical analysis and DVDWT simulations. The
results illustrate that the modified model can be used to study Marangoni
effect on a nanodroplet and other heat and mass transfer problems with free
interface.

a bicategory DiffBiBund. Our main result is the following: a bibundle is
biprincipal if and only if it is weakly invertible in this bicategory. This
generalises a well known theorem from the Lie groupoid theory. As an

propose to leverage the vastly available mono data to facilitate the generation

indicated audio separation also maps independent audios to their corresponding
visual positions, which shares a similar objective with stereophonic audio
generation. We integrate both stereo generation and source separation into a
unified framework, Sep-Stereo, by considering source separation as a particular

  Liquid Jet in Cross Flow",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate prediction of spray atomization process using an Euler-Lagrange (EL)
approach is challenging because of high volume fraction of the liquid phase in
dense regimes. This would in reality displace a remarkable portion of the
gaseous phase which is commonly ignored in the standard EL approaches. In
addition, deformation of droplet due to the interaction of aerodynamic force,
surface tension and viscous forces is typically neglected in modeling dense
sprays. In this work, to capture the volumetric displacement effects using an
EL approach, the spatio-temporal changes in the volume fraction of the gaseous
phase are taken into account. This leads to zero-Mach number, variable density
equations that give rise to a source term in both momentum and continuity
equations. It is shown that the continuity source term increases the velocity
and dynamics of the carrier phase close to the nozzle. However, owing to the
jet spread and dispersion of droplets, these effects decrease further
downstream. In order to quantify the droplet deformation effects, different
models are compared together with an experimental data. Different breakup
regimes are studied in order to identify the best model for each regime. The
shape deformation effect is isolated by performing a single droplet injected
into the cross flow with flow conditions similar to the bag-type breakup. A
significant deviation in the motion of droplet is observed compared to a case
where deformation is neglected.

if, as previously suggested, only explicit dynamical computations can lead to
an accurate evaluation of the reaction rate because of strong recrossing
effects and the breakdown of the variational extension of transition state
theory. For this reason, the corresponding potential energy surface has been
thoroughly investigated, thus leading to an accurate characterization of all
stationary points, whose energetics has been computed at the state of the art.
To this end, coupled-cluster theory including up to quadruple excitations has
been employed, together with the extrapolation to the complete basis set limit
and also incorporating core-valence correlation, spin-orbit, and scalar
relativistic effects as well as diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections. This
highly accurate composite scheme has also been paralleled by less expensive yet
promising computational approaches. Moving to kinetics, variational transition
state theory and its variable reaction coordinate extension for barrierless
steps have been exploited, thus obtaining a reaction rate constant (8.16 x
10$^{-11}$ cm$^3$ molecule$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ at 300 K and 1 atm) in remarkable
agreement with the experimental counterpart. Therefore, contrary to previous
claims, there is no need to invoke any failure of the transition state theory,
provided that sufficiently accurate quantum-chemical computations are
performed. The investigation of the puzzling case of the H$_2$S + Cl system
allowed us to present a robust approach for disclosing the thermochemistry and

deep neural network policy representing consumption decisions. The optimal
consumption policy is determined by personal information about the retiree such
as age, wealth, risk aversion and bequest motive, as well as a series of
economic and financial variables including inflation rates and asset returns
jointly simulated from a proposed seven-factor economic scenario generator
calibrated from market data. We use the Australian pension system as an
example, with consideration of the government-funded means-tested Age Pension
and other practical aspects such as fund management fees. The key findings from
our numerical tests are as follows. First, our deep neural network optimal
consumption policy, which adapts to changes in market conditions, outperforms
deterministic drawdown rules proposed in the literature. Moreover, the
out-of-sample outperformance ratios increase as the number of training
iterations increases, eventually reaching outperformance on all testing
scenarios after less than 10 minutes of training. Second, a sensitivity
analysis is performed to reveal how risk aversion and bequest motives change
the consumption over a retiree's lifetime under this utility framework. Third,
we provide the optimal consumption rate with different starting wealth
balances. We observe that optimal consumption rates are not proportional to
initial wealth due to the Age Pension payment. Forth, with the same initial
wealth balance and utility parameter settings, the optimal consumption level is
different between males and females due to gender differences in mortality.

learning approach, a method for non-linear dimension reduction, to extract the
manifold that contains a collection of phase-field-represented initial
microcrack patterns in the representative volume element (RVE). Then the output
data corresponding to any other microcrack pattern, e.g., the evolved phase
field at a fixed load, can be accurately reconstructed using the learned
manifold with minimum computation. The method has two features: a minimum
number of parameters for the scheme, and an input-specific error bar. The
latter feature enables an adaptive strategy for any new input on whether to use
the proposed, less expensive reconstruction, or to use an accurate but costly

leakage problem. Such leakage arises from the presence of `ambiguous' modes
that satisfy properties of both $E$ and $B$ modes. Solving this problem is
critical for primordial polarization $B$ mode detection in partial sky CMB
polarization experiments. In this work we introduce a new method for reducing
the leakage. We demonstrate that if we complement the $E$-mode information
outside the observation patch with ancillary data from full-sky CMB
observations, we can reduce and even effectively remove the $E$-to-$B$ leakage.
For this objective, we produce $E$-mode Stokes $QU$ maps from Wiener filtered
full-sky intensity and polarization CMB observations. We use these maps to fill
the sky region that is not observed by the ground-based experiment of interest,
and thus complement the partial sky Stokes $QU$ maps. Since the $E$-mode
information is now available on the full sky we see a significant reduction in
the $E$-to-$B$ leakage. We evaluate on simulated data sets the performance of
our method for a `shallow' $f_\text{sky}=8\%$, and a `deep' $f_\text{sky}=2\%$
northern hemisphere sky patch, with AliCPT-like properties, and a LSPE-like
$f_\text{sky}=30\%$ sky patch, by combining those observations with Planck-like
full sky polarization maps. We find that our method outperforms the standard
and the pure-$B$ method pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators for all of our simulations.
Our new method gives unbiased estimates of the $B$-mode power spectrum
through-out the entire multipole range with near-optimal pseudo-$C_\ell$ errors
for $\ell>20$. We also study the application of our method to the CMB-S4
experiment combined with LiteBIRD-like full sky data, and show that using
signal-dominated full sky $E$-mode data we can eliminate the $E$-to-$B$ leakage

as data plan, computation capacity and energy storage. Given that some of these
users may not be utilizing fully their wireless resources, device-to-device
(D2D) resource sharing is a promising approach to exploit users' diversity in
resource use and for pooling their resources locally. In this paper, we propose
a novel two-sided D2D trading market model that enables a large number of
locally connected users to trade resources. Traditional resource allocation
solutions are mostly centralized without considering users' local D2D
connectivity constraints, becoming unscalable for large-scale trading. In
addition, there may be market failure since selfish users will not truthfully
report their actual valuations and quantities for buying or selling resources.
To address these two key challenges, we first investigate the distributed
resource allocation problem with D2D assignment constraints. Based on the
greedy idea of maximum weighted matching, we propose a fast algorithm to
achieve near-optimal average allocative efficiency. Then, we combine it with a
new pricing mechanism that adjusts the final trading prices for buying and
selling resources in a way that buyers and sellers are incentivized to
truthfully report their valuations and available resource quantities. Unlike
traditional double auctions with a central controller, this pricing mechanism
is fully distributed in the sense that the final trading prices between each
matched pair of users only depend on their own declarations and hence can be
calculated locally. Finally, we analyze the repeated execution of the proposed
D2D trading mechanism in multiple rounds and determine the best trading
frequency.

metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature have nonnegative mass. We then
introduce a general scheme of proof for a Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality on
non-compact manifolds and prove that it applies to
$\lambda_{\operatorname{ALE}}$ around Ricci-flat metrics. We moreover obtain an
optimal weighted Lojasiewicz exponent for metrics with integrable Ricci-flat

$\lesssim 3.7$ nG for spectral index $n_B=-2.99$. While for $n_B=-1$, we get

difference in the infection rate observed in each region, in addition to
studies seeking the cause due to differences in the social distance (population
density), there is an increasing trend toward studies seeking the cause due to
differences in social capital. However, studies have not yet been conducted on
whether social capital could influence the infection rate even if it controls
the effect of population density. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the
relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital
using statistical data for each prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that
social capital not only correlates with infection rates and population
densities but still has a negative correlation with infection rates controlling
for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the relationship
between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater
correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social
capital mediates the correlation between population density and infection
rates. This means that social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus
infection, and social capital needs to be recharged.

thermocline, we use direct numerical simulations to investigate the interaction
of a sinusoidal shear flow and a large-amplitude internal gravity wave. Despite
strong nonlinearities in the flow and a lack of scale separation, we find that
linear ray tracing theory is qualitatively useful in describing the early
development of the flow as the wave is refracted by the shear. Consistent with
the linear theory, the energy of the wave accumulates in regions of negative
mean shear where we observe evidence of convective and shear instabilities.
Streamwise-aligned convective rolls emerge the fastest, but their contribution
to irreversible mixing is dwarfed by shear-driven billow structures that
develop later. Although the wave strongly distorts the buoyancy field on which
these billows develop, the mixing efficiency of the subsequent turbulence is
similar to that arising from Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a stratified shear
layer. We run simulations at Reynolds numbers of 5000 and 8000, and vary the
initial amplitude of the internal gravity wave. For high values of initial wave
amplitude, the results are qualitatively independent of $Re$. Smaller initial
wave amplitudes delay the onset of the instabilities, and allow for significant
laminar diffusion of the internal wave, leading to reduced turbulent activity.
We discuss the complex interaction between the mean flow, internal gravity wave

selectively exciting feature activations using ground truth. Then we gradually
reduce the weight of ground truth excitations by a curriculum rate and replace
it by a curriculum complementary map for better and faster convergence. In
particular, the spatial excitation strengthens feature activations for clear
object boundaries, while the temporal excitation imposes motions to emphasize
spatio-temporal salient regions. Spatial and temporal excitations can combat
the saliency shifting problem and conflict between spatial and temporal
features of VSOD. Furthermore, our semi-curriculum learning design enables the
first online refinement strategy for VSOD, which allows exciting and boosting

the C++ concurrency that captures most of the common program transformations

programs under PS 2.0 with only release-acquire accesses is already known to be
undecidable. Therefore, we address, in this paper, the reachability problem for
programs running under PS 2.0 with relaxed accesses together with promises. We
show that this problem is undecidable even in the case where the input program
has finite state. Given this undecidability result, we consider the fragment of
PS 2.0 with only relaxed accesses allowing bounded number of promises. We show
that under this restriction, the reachability is decidable, albeit very
expensive: it is non-primitive recursive. Given this high complexity with
bounded number of promises and the undecidability result for the RA fragment of
PS 2.0, we consider a bounded version of the reachability problem. To this end,
we bound both the number of promises and the ""view-switches"", i.e, the number
of times the processes may switch their local views of the global memory. We
provide a code-to-code translation from an input program under PS 2.0, with
relaxed and release-acquire memory accesses along with promises, to a program
under SC. This leads to a reduction of the bounded reachability problem under
PS 2.0 to the bounded context-switching problem under SC. We have implemented a
prototype tool and tested it on a set of benchmarks, demonstrating that many

accreting sub-sample. In particular, the smallest scatter of $\sigma{_{\rm
rms}}=0.17$ dex is associated with the independent parameter R$_\mathrm{FeII}$,
followed by the combination with $F\mathrm{_{var}}$, with $\sigma{_{\rm
rms}}=0.19$ dex. Both of these independent observationally-inferred parameters
are in turn correlated with $\dot{\mathcal{M}}$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{Edd}$.
These results suggest that the large scatter along the R-L relation is driven
$\textit{mainly}$ by the accretion rate intensity.

nonlinear diffusion equations with periodically oscillating (in space and time)
coefficients. Main results consist of a homogenization theorem (i.e.,
convergence of solutions as the period of oscillation goes to zero) as well as
a characterization of homogenized equations. In particular, homogenized
matrices are described in terms of solutions to cell-problems, which have
different forms depending on the log-ratio of the spatial and temporal periods
of the coefficients. At a critical ratio, the cell problem turns out to be a
parabolic equation in microscopic variables (as in linear diffusion) and also
involves the limit of solutions, which is a function of macroscopic variables.
The latter feature stems from the nonlinearity of the equation, and moreover,
some strong interplay between microscopic and macroscopic structures can be
explicitly seen for the nonlinear diffusion. As for the other ratios, the cell
problems are always elliptic (in micro-variable only) and do not involve any
macroscopic variables, and hence, micro- and macrostructures are weakly
interacting each other. Proofs of the main results are based on the two-scale
convergence theory (for space-time homogenization). Furthermore, finer
asymptotics of gradients, diffusion fluxes and time-derivatives with certain
corrector terms will be provided, and a qualitative analysis on homogenized
matrices will be also performed.

fundamental analyzing approach is the classification of medical images, which
serves for skin lesion diagnosis, diabetic retinopathy grading, and cancer
classification on histological images. When learning these discriminative
classifiers, we observe that the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are
vulnerable to distractor interference. This is due to the similar sample
appearances from different categories (i.e., small inter-class distance).
Existing attempts select distractors from input images by empirically
estimating their potential effects to the classifier. The essences of how these
distractors affect CNN classification are not known. In this paper, we explore
distractors from the CNN feature space via proposing a neuron intrinsic
learning method. We formulate a novel distractor-aware loss that encourages
large distance between the original image and its distractor in the feature
space. The novel loss is combined with the original classification loss to
update network parameters by back-propagation. Neuron intrinsic learning first
explores distractors crucial to the deep classifier and then uses them to
robustify CNN inherently. Extensive experiments on medical image benchmark
datasets indicate that the proposed method performs favorably against the
state-of-the-art approaches.

a novel framework which combines generative adversarial networks (GANs) with

search the latent space of state-of-the-art GAN models, with the aim to
automatically generate novel faces, to maximize an individual subject's

participants rated images of themselves generated via performing Bayesian
optimization over the latent space of a GAN. We show how the algorithm can
efficiently locate an individual's optimal face while mapping out their
response across different semantic transformations of a face; inter-individual
analyses suggest how the approach can provide rich information about individual

modes (ELMs) in fusion plasmas is identified by performing, for the first time,
non-linear magnetohydrodynamic simulations of repetitive type-I ELMs. Briefly
prior to the ELM crash, destabilising and stabilising terms are affected at
different timescales by an increasingly ergodic magnetic field caused by
non-linear interactions between the axisymmetric background plasma and growing
non-axisymmetric perturbations. The separation of timescales prompts the
explosive, i.e. faster than exponential, growth of an ELM crash which lasts
${\sim}$ 500 ${\mu}$s. The duration and size of the simulated ELM crashes
compare qualitatively well with type-I ELMs in ASDEX Upgrade. As expected for
type-I ELMs, a direct proportionality between the heating power in the
simulations and the ELM repetition frequency is obtained. The simulations
presented here are a major step forward towards predictive modelling of ELMs
and of the assessment of mitigation techniques in ITER and other future
tokamaks.

  981-990","10.1112/blms.12475",,"math.RA cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A matrix $A$ is totally positive (or non-negative) of order $k$, denoted
$TP_k$ (or $TN_k$), if all minors of size $\leq k$ are positive (or
non-negative). It is well-known that such matrices are characterized by the
variation diminishing property together with the sign non-reversal property. We
do away with the former, and show that $A$ is $TP_k$ if and only if every
submatrix formed from at most $k$ consecutive rows and columns has the sign
non-reversal property. In fact this can be strengthened to only consider test
vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k$ with alternating signs. We also show a similar
characterization for all $TN_k$ matrices - more strongly, both of these
characterizations use a single vector (with alternating signs) for each square
submatrix. These characterizations are novel, and similar in spirit to the
fundamental results characterizing $TP$ matrices by Gantmacher-Krein [Compos.
Math. 1937] and $P$-matrices by Gale-Nikaido [Math. Ann. 1965].
  As an application, we study the interval hull $\mathbb{I}(A,B)$ of two $m
\times n$ matrices $A=(a_{ij})$ and $B = (b_{ij})$. This is the collection of
$C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ such that each $c_{ij}$ is between $a_{ij}$ and
$b_{ij}$. Using the sign non-reversal property, we identify a two-element
subset of $\mathbb{I}(A,B)$ that detects the $TP_k$ property for all of
$\mathbb{I}(A,B)$ for arbitrary $k \geq 1$. In particular, this provides a test
for total positivity (of any order), simultaneously for an entire class of
rectangular matrices. In parallel, we also provide a finite set to test the
total non-negativity (of any order) of an interval hull $\mathbb{I}(A,B)$.

redback millisecond pulsar J1227$-$4853 discovered in 2014 with the GMRT.
Emission from this pulsar is eclipsed at 607 MHz for about 37% of its orbit
around the superior conjunction. We observe eclipse ingress and egress
transition which last 12% and 15% of its orbit respectively, resulting in only
36% of the orbit being unaffected by eclipsing material. We report an excess
dispersion measure (DM) at eclipse boundaries of 0.079(3) pc cm$^{-3}$ and the
corresponding electron column density (N$_e$) is 24.4(8) x 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$.
Simultaneous timing and imaging studies suggests that the eclipses in
J1227$-$4853 are not caused by temporal smearing due to excess dispersion and
scattering but could be caused by removal of pulsar flux due to cyclotron
absorption of the pulsed signal by intra-binary material constraining the
companion's magnetic field. Additionally, near inferior conjunction at orbital
phase 0.71 and 0.82 the pulsed emission is significantly delayed which is
associated with a fading of the pulsed and continuum flux densities. At orbital
phase $\sim$0.82, we measure a change in DM of 0.035(3) pc cm$^{-3}$ and N$_e$
of 10.8(8) x 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ associated with a dimming of up to $\sim$30%
of the peak flux density. Such flux fading around a fixed orbital phase is not
reported for other eclipsing binaries. Moreover, this event around inferior
conjunction could be caused by absorption of pulsed signal by fragmented blobs
of plasma generated from mass loss through the L2 Lagrangian point.

a computer-aided system for the fast and accurate segmentation of cornea and

separation rate between the reconnecting points is compatible with the known
dynamics of quantum vortex reconnections and it is independent of the particle
mass and size. After the reconnection, the particle is pushed away with a
constant velocity and its trajectory is deflected because of the transverse
momentum exchange with the vortex filaments. The momentum exchanges between the
particle, the vortex, and a density pulse are characterized. Finally, the
reconnection of two linked rings, each of them with several initially randomly

provide an estimation of the bounds of a causal effect (i.e. nonunique

efficiency while trying to obtain unique and unbiased causal effect estimation
is how to find a proper adjustment set for confounding control in a fast way,
given the huge covariate space and considering unobserved variables. In this
paper, we approach the problem as a local search task for finding valid

for adjustment sets, and we show that unique and unbiased estimation can be
achieved from observational data even when there exist unobserved variables. We
then propose a data-driven algorithm that is fast and consistent under mild

attention for their potential applications as novel optoelectronic devices.
Remarkably, the Rashba band splitting, together with specific spin orientations
in k space (i.e., spin texture), has been found to be relevant for the
optoelectronic performances. In this work, by using first principles
calculations and symmetry analyses, we study the electric polarization,
magnetism, and spin texture properties of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) HOIP
ferroelectric TMCM_MnCl3 (TMCM = (CH3)3NCH2Cl, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium).
This recently synthesized compound is a prototype of order disorder and
displacement-type ferroelectric with a large piezoelectric response, high
ferroelectric transition temperature, and excellent photoluminescence
properties [You et al., Science 357, 306 (2017)]. The most interesting result
is that the inversion symmetry breaking coupled to the spin orbit coupling
gives rise to a Rashba-like band splitting and a related robust persistent spin
texture (PST) and/or typical spiral spin texture, which can be manipulated by
tuning the ferroelectric or, surprisingly, also by the AFM magnetic order
parameter. The tunability of spin texture upon switching of AFM order parameter
is largely unexplored and our findings not only provide a platform to
understand the physics of AFM spin texture but also support the AFM HOIP
ferroelectrics as a promising class of optoelectronic materials.

tasks, they come at a high memory and computation cost, thus making them
impractical on resource-limited devices. However, these networks are known to
contain a large number of parameters. Recent research has shown that their
structure can be more compact without compromising their performance. In this
paper, we present a sparsity-inducing regularization term based on the ratio
l1/l2 pseudo-norm defined on the filter coefficients. By defining this
pseudo-norm appropriately for the different filter kernels, and removing
irrelevant filters, the number of kernels in each layer can be drastically
reduced leading to very compact Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN)
structures. Unlike numerous existing methods, our approach does not require an
iterative retraining process and, using this regularization term, directly
produces a sparse model during the training process. Furthermore, our approach
is also much easier and simpler to implement than existing methods.
Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that our approach significantly
reduces the number of filters of classical models such as LeNet and VGG while
reaching the same or even better accuracy than the baseline models. Moreover,
the trade-off between the sparsity and the accuracy is compared to other loss
regularization terms based on the l1 or l2 norm as well as the SSL, NISP and

semiconductors with two valleys in their band structure that can be selectively
addressed using circularly polarized light. Their photoluminescence spectrum is
characterized by neutral and charged excitons (trions) that form a chemical
equilibrium governed by the net charge density. Here, we use chemical doping to
drive the conversion of excitons into trions in $\text{WS}_{2}$ monolayers at

photoluminescence measurements under valley-selective optical excitation. We
show that the doping causes the emission to become dominated by trions with a
strong valley polarization associated with rapid non-radiative recombination.
Simultaneously, the doping results in strongly quenched but highly
valley-polarized exciton emission due to the enhanced conversion into trions. A
rate equation model explains the observed valley polarization in terms of the

spectrum of hydrodynamic excitations in the small chemical potential limit.
Then, by studying the spectral curve at complex momenta in every spin channel,
we numerically find points at which hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic poles
collide. We discuss the relation between such collision points and the
convergence radius of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion. Specifically in
the spin 0 channel, we find that within the range $1.1\lesssim \mu/T\lesssim
2$, the radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic sound mode is set by the
absolute value of the complex momentum corresponding to the point at which the
sound pole collides with the hydrodynamic diffusion pole. It shows that in
holographic systems at finite chemical potential, the convergence of the
hydrodynamic derivative expansion in the mentioned range is fully controlled by
hydrodynamic information. As the last result, we explicitly show that the
relevant information about quantum chaos in our system can be extracted from
the pole-skipping points of energy density response function. We find a

coherent receiver DSP chain and successfully trained in the presence of various
hardware impairments. Our results show that LDBP with limited complexity can
achieve better performance than standard DBP by using very short, but jointly

Penalty based NAS (BP-NAS) for mixed precision quantization, which ensures all
the searched models are inside the valid domain defined by the complexity
constraint, thus could return an optimal model under the given constraint by
conducting search only one time. The proposed soft Barrier Penalty is
differentiable and can impose very large losses to those models outside the
valid domain while almost no punishment for models inside the valid domain,
thus constraining the search only in the feasible domain. In addition, a
differentiable Prob-1 regularizer is proposed to ensure learning with NAS is
reasonable. A distribution reshaping training strategy is also used to make
training more stable. BP-NAS sets new state of the arts on both classification

achieves higher mAP (up to 2.7\% mAP improvement) together with lower bit

industrial, vehicular, and environmental domain. In these settings, AoI
provides insights that are complementary to those offered by throughput or
latency, capturing the ability of the system to maintain an up-to-date view of
the status of each transmitting device. From this standpoint, while a good
understanding of the metric has been reached for point-to-point links,
relatively little attention has been devoted to the impact that link layer
solutions employed in IoT systems may have on AoI. In particular, no result is
available for modern random access protocols, which have recently emerged as
promising solutions to support massive machine-type communications. To start
addressing this gap we provide in this paper the first study of the AoI of a

means of a Markovian analysis, we track the AoI evolution at the gateway, prove
that the process is ergodic, and derive a compact closed form expression for
its stationary distribution. Leaning on this, we compute exact formulations for
the average AoI and the age violation probability. The study reveals
non-trivial design trade-offs for IRSA and highlights the key role played by
the protocol operating frame size. Moreover, a comparison with the performance

region-to-region rather than point-to-point correspondences. This has recently
been exploited to create new minimal solvers for classical problems such as
homography, essential and fundamental matrix estimation. The main advantage of
such solvers is that their sample size is smaller, e.g., only two instead of
four matches are required to estimate a homography. Works proposing such
solvers often claim a significant improvement in run-time thanks to fewer
RANSAC iterations. We show that this argument is not valid in practice if the
solvers are used naively. To overcome this, we propose guidelines for effective
use of region-to-region matches in the course of a full model estimation

lesion size imbalance - large lesions overshadows small ones (in the case of

the latter lacks investigation. We propose a loss reweighting approach to
increase the ability of the network to detect small lesions. During the
learning process, we assign a weight to every image voxel. The assigned weights
are inversely proportional to the lesion volume, thus smaller lesions get
larger weights. We report the benefit from our method for well-known loss

inner consistency by modeling the global context, or refine objects detail
along their boundaries by multi-scale feature fusion. In this paper, a new
paradigm for semantic segmentation is proposed. Our insight is that appealing
performance of semantic segmentation requires \textit{explicitly} modeling the
object \textit{body} and \textit{edge}, which correspond to the high and low
frequency of the image. To do so, we first warp the image feature by learning a
flow field to make the object part more consistent. The resulting body feature
and the residual edge feature are further optimized under decoupled supervision
by explicitly sampling different parts (body or edge) pixels. We show that the
proposed framework with various baselines or backbone networks leads to better
object inner consistency and object boundaries. Extensive experiments on four
major road scene semantic segmentation benchmarks including
\textit{Cityscapes}, \textit{CamVid}, \textit{KIITI} and \textit{BDD} show that
our proposed approach establishes new state of the art while retaining high
efficiency in inference. In particular, we achieve 83.7 mIoU \% on Cityscape
with only fine-annotated data. Code and models are made available to foster any
further research (\url{https://github.com/lxtGH/DecoupleSegNets}).

propagation network for depth completion. The proposed network takes RGB and
sparse depth images as inputs and estimates non-local neighbors and their
affinities of each pixel, as well as an initial depth map with pixel-wise
confidences. The initial depth prediction is then iteratively refined by its
confidence and non-local spatial propagation procedure based on the predicted
non-local neighbors and corresponding affinities. Unlike previous algorithms
that utilize fixed-local neighbors, the proposed algorithm effectively avoids
irrelevant local neighbors and concentrates on relevant non-local neighbors
during propagation. In addition, we introduce a learnable affinity
normalization to better learn the affinity combinations compared to
conventional methods. The proposed algorithm is inherently robust to the
mixed-depth problem on depth boundaries, which is one of the major issues for
existing depth estimation/completion algorithms. Experimental results on indoor

conventional algorithms in terms of depth completion accuracy and robustness to
the mixed-depth problem. Our implementation is publicly available on the

limited autonomy on-board, most of its decisions are made by the ground control
team. This hinders the speed at which the Curiosity reacts to its environment,
due to the communication delays between Earth and Mars. Depending on the
orbital position of both planets, it can take 4--24 minutes for a message to be

algorithm can find the criteria weights, reference profiles, and the lambda
cutting level. Our approach is inspired by a Machine Learning ensemble
technique, the Random Forest, and for that, we named our approach as ELECTRE
Tree algorithm. Methodology: First, we generate a set of ELECTRE Tri-B models,
where each model solves a random sample of criteria and alternatives. Each
sample is made with replacement, having at least two criteria and between 10%
to 25% of alternatives. Each model has its parameters optimized by a genetic
algorithm that can use an ordered cluster or an assignment example as a
reference to the optimization. Finally, after the optimization phase, two
procedures can be performed, the first one will merge all models, finding in
this way the elicitated parameters, and in the second procedure each
alternative is classified (voted) by each separated model, and the majority
vote decides the final class. Findings: We have noted that concerning the
voting procedure, non-linear decision boundaries are generated, and they can be
suitable in analyzing problems with the same nature. In contrast, the merged
model generates linear decision boundaries. Originality: The elicitation of
ELECTRE Tri-B parameters is made by an ensemble technique that is composed of a
set of multicriteria models that are engaged in generating robust solutions.

bounds for prediction with the ubiquitous Principal Component Regression (PCR)
method, under the factor regression model, with the number of principal
components adaptively selected from the data -- a form of theoretical guarantee
that is surprisingly lacking from the PCR literature. To accomplish this, we
prove a master theorem that establishes a risk bound for a large class of

the benefit of providing a unified framework for the analysis of a wide range

particular, we use our main theorem to recover known risk bounds for the
minimum-norm interpolating predictor, which has received renewed attention in
the past two years, and a prediction method tailored to a subclass of factor
regression models with identifiable parameters. This model-tailored method can
be interpreted as prediction via clusters with latent centers.
  To address the problem of selecting among a set of candidate predictors, we
analyze a simple model selection procedure based on data-splitting, providing
an oracle inequality under the factor model to prove that the performance of
the selected predictor is close to the optimal candidate. We conclude with a

detailed asymptotics. We give algorithms that allow us to compute these
generating functions and the underlying surfaces, and apply these to almost
60,000 manifolds, providing a wealth of data about them. We use this data to
explore the delicate question of counting only connected essential surfaces and
propose some conjectures. Our methods involve normal and almost normal
surfaces, especially the work of Tollefson and Oertel, combined with techniques
pioneered by Ehrhart for counting lattice points in polyhedra with rational
vertices. We also introduce a new way of testing if a normal surface in an
ideal triangulation is essential that avoids cutting the manifold open along
the surface; rather, we use almost normal surfaces in the original
triangulation.

learning community. This branch of study is composed of some applications such
as machine translation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, question
and answer, and others. Word embeddings are continuous word representations,
they are an essential module for those applications and are generally used as
input word representation to the deep learning models. Word2Vec and GloVe are
two popular methods to learn word embeddings. They achieve good word
representations, however, they learn representations with limited information
because they ignore the morphological information of the words and consider
only one representation vector for each word. This approach implies that
Word2Vec and GloVe are unaware of the word inner structure. To mitigate this
problem, the FastText model represents each word as a bag of characters
n-grams. Hence, each n-gram has a continuous vector representation, and the
final word representation is the sum of its characters n-grams vectors.
Nevertheless, the use of all n-grams character of a word is a poor approach
since some n-grams have no semantic relation with their words and increase the
amount of potentially useless information. This approach also increases the
training phase time. In this work, we propose a new method for training word
embeddings, and its goal is to replace the FastText bag of character n-grams
for a bag of word morphemes through the morphological analysis of the word.
Thus, words with similar context and morphemes are represented by vectors close
to each other. To evaluate our new approach, we performed intrinsic evaluations
considering 15 different tasks, and the results show a competitive performance
compared to FastText.

extends beyond the static realm of predicates, to the dynamic realm of
processes. Understanding the logical parallelism of process propositions and
dynamic types was one of the central problems of the semantics of computation,
albeit not always clear or explicit. It sprung into clarity through the early
work of Samson Abramsky, where the central ideas of denotational semantics and
process calculus were brought together and analyzed by categorical tools, e.g.
in the structure of interaction categories. While some logical structures borne
of dynamics of computation immediately started to emerge, others had to wait,
be it because the underlying logical principles (mainly those arising from
coinduction) were not yet sufficiently well-understood, or simply because the
research community was more interested in other semantical tasks. Looking back,
it seems that the process logic uncovered by those early semantical efforts
might still be starting to emerge and that the vast field of results that have
been obtained in the meantime might be a valley on a tip of an iceberg.
  In the present paper, I try to provide a logical overview of the gamut of
interaction categories and to distinguish those that model computation from
those that capture processes in general. The main coinductive constructions
turn out to be of this latter kind, as illustrated towards the end of the paper
by a compact category of all real numbers as processes, computable and
uncomputable, with polarized bisimulations as morphisms. The addition of the
reals arises as the biproduct, real vector spaces are the enriched
bicompletions, and linear algebra arises from the enriched kan extensions. At
the final step, I sketch a structure that characterizes the computable fragment

multispectral (MS) image in both spatial and spectral domains by fusing a
panchromatic (PAN) image and a corresponding MS image. In this paper, we
propose a novel dual-channel network (DCNet) framework for MS pan-sharpening.
In our DCNet, the dual-channel backbone involves a spatial channel to capture
spatial information with a 2D CNN, and a spectral channel to extract spectral
information with a 3D CNN. This heterogeneous 2D/3D CNN architecture can
minimize causing spectral information distortion, which typically happens in
conventional 2D CNN models. In order to fully integrate the spatial and
spectral features captured from different levels, we introduce a multi-level
fusion strategy. Specifically, a spatial-spectral CLSTM (S$^2$-CLSTM) module is
proposed for fusing the hierarchical spatial and spectral features, which can
effectively capture correlations among multi-level features. The S$^2$-CLSTM
module attaches two fusion ways: the intra-level fusion via bi-directional
lateral connections and inter-level fusion via the cell state in the
S$^2$-CLSTM. Finally, the ideal HR-MS image is recovered by a reconstruction
module. Extensive experiments have been conducted at both simulated lower scale
and the original scale of real-world datasets. Compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, the proposed DCNet achieves superior or competitive
performance.

energy storage devices beyond lithium-ion batteries because of their high
energy density of 2600 Wh/kg and an affordable cost of sulfur. Meanwhile, some
challenges inherent to Li/S batteries remain to be tackled, for instance, the
polysulfide (PS) shuttle effect, the irreversible solidification of Li$_2$S,
and the volume expansion of the cathode material during discharge. On the
molecular level, these issues originate from the structural and solubility
behavior of the PS species in bulk and in the electrode confinement. In this
study, we use classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop a
working model for PS of different chain lengths in applied electrolyte
solutions of lithium bistriflimide (LiTFSI) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and
1,3-dioxolane (DOL) mixtures. We investigate conductivities, diffusion
coefficients, solvation structures, and clustering behavior and verify our
simulation model with experimental measurements available in literature and
newly performed by us. Our results show that diffusion coefficients and
conductivities are significantly influenced by the chain length of PS. The
conductivity contribution of the short chains, like Li$_2$S$_4$, is lower than
of longer PS chains, such as Li$_2$S$_6$ or Li$_2$S$_8$, despite the fact that
the diffusion coefficient of Li$_2$S$_4$ is higher than for longer PS chains.
The low conductivity of Li$_2$S$_4$ can be attributed to its low degree of
dissociation and even to a formation of large clusters in the solution. It is
also found that an addition of 1 M LiTFSI into PS solutions considerably
reduces the clustering behavior. Our simulation model enables future systematic
studies in various solvating and confining systems for the rational design of
Li/S electrolytes.

show that the entire adsorption process can be divided into three parts

\emph{depinning} of the liquid-gas interface from the wall edges; and (iii)

accompanied by a rapid but continuous flattening of its shape. Using a nonlocal

discussed in some detail to reveal the complexity of the entire process and

the depinning first-order transition, if present.

extracted from the forward current-voltage characteristics of the diode,
decreased from 0.8 eV in the as-deposited and 400{\deg}C annealed sample, to
0.56 eV after annealing at 800 {\deg}C. This large reduction of $\Phi$B was
accompanied by a corresponding increase of the reverse bias leakage current.
Transmission electron microscopy coupled to electron energy loss spectroscopy
analyses revealed the presence of oxygen (O) uniformly distributed in the WC
layer, both in the as-deposited and 400{\deg}C annealed sample. Conversely,
oxygen accumulation in a 2-3 nm thin W-O-C layer at the interface with AlGaN
was observed after the annealing at 800 {\deg}C, as well as the formation of

formation of this interfacial W-O-C layer is plausibly the main origin of the

derived. The proposed solver is usable within 1-point RANSAC approaches. Thus,
the processing time of the robust estimation is linear in the number of
correspondences and, therefore, orders of magnitude faster than by using
traditional approaches. The proposed 1AC+D solver is tested both on synthetic

off-the-shelf monocular depth network to provide up-to-scale depth per pixel.
The proposed 1AC+D leads to similar accuracy as traditional approaches while
being significantly faster. When solving large-scale problems, e.g., pose-graph
initialization for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, the overhead of
obtaining ACs and monocular depth is negligible compared to the speed-up gained
in the pairwise geometric verification, i.e., relative pose estimation. This is
demonstrated on scenes from the 1DSfM dataset using a state-of-the-art global

exploration process is formulated as the d-Watchman Route Problem which
consists of two coupled tasks - candidate goals generation and finding an
optimal path through a subset of goals - which are solved in each exploration
step. The latter has been defined as a constrained variant of the Generalized
Traveling Salesman Problem and solved using an evolutionary algorithm. An
evolutionary algorithm that uses an indirect representation and the nearest
neighbor based constructive procedure was proposed to solve this problem.
Individuals evolved in this evolutionary algorithm do not directly code the
solutions to the problem. Instead, they represent sequences of instructions to
construct a feasible solution. The problems with efficiently generating
feasible solutions typically arising when applying traditional evolutionary
algorithms to constrained optimization problems are eliminated this way. The
proposed exploration framework was evaluated in a simulated environment on
three maps and the time needed to explore the whole environment was compared to
state-of-the-art exploration methods. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms the compared ones in environments with a low density of obstacles
by up to 12.5%, while it is slightly worse in office-like environments by 4.5%

clear if, or how, Coulomb interactions affect their behavior under interfacial
confinement. In this work, we combine compression isotherms, atomic force
microscopy imaging, and computer simulations to further investigate the
behavior of pH-responsive microgels at oil-water interfaces. At low
compression, charged microgels can be compressed more than uncharged microgels.
The in-plane effective area of charged microgels is found to be smaller in
comparison to uncharged ones. Thus, the compressibility is governed by in-plane
interactions of the microgels with the interface. At high compression, however,
charged microgels are less compressible than uncharged microgels. Microgel
fractions located in the aqueous phase interact earlier for charged than for
uncharged microgels because of their different swelling perpendicular to the
interface. Therefore, the compressibility at high compression is controlled by
out-of-plane interactions. In addition, the size of the investigated microgels
plays a pivotal role. The charge-dependent difference in compressibility at low
compression is only observed for small but not for large microgels, while the
behavior at high compression does not depend on the size. Our results highlight
the complex nature of soft polymer microgels as compared to rigid colloidal
particles. We clearly demonstrate that electrostatic interactions affect the
interfacial properties of polyelectrolyte microgels.

number, the mass ratio and the damping ratio are fixed. A secondary VIV lock-in
region is found in the cases of high Richardson number Ri=2.0 for high reduced

lock-in region is formed with tremendous energy transfer between fluid and

influences of Prandtl and Richardson numbers on the hydrodynamics, structural

are concentrated around cylinder for the cases of high Prandtl number, which
are associated with high mean Nusselt values. The influence on heat transfer
efficiency over the cylinder's surface is quantified via the calculation of
mean Nusselt number and its fluctuation for different circumstances. The energy
transfer coefficient is employed to quantify the energy transfer between fluid

transverse displacement of cylinder and the lift force is used to support the
discussions of energy transfer. A stabilized finite element formulation in

with both indirect and direct methods of detection. In this paper, we focus our
attention on substellar companions detected with the direct imaging technique,
with the primary goal of investigating their close surroundings and looking for
additional companions and satellites, as well as disks and rings. Any such
discovery would shed light on many unresolved questions, particularly with
regard to their possible formation mechanisms. To reveal bound features of
directly imaged companions we need to suppress the contribution from the source
itself. Therefore, we developed a method based on the negative fake companion
(NEGFC) technique that first estimates the position in the field of view (FoV)
and the flux of the imaged companion, then subtracts a rescaled model point
spread function (PSF) from the imaged companion. Next it performs techniques,
such as angular differential imaging (ADI), to further remove quasi-static
patterns of the star. We applied the method to the sample of substellar objects
observed with SPHERE during the SHINE GTO survey. Among the 27 planets and
brown dwarfs we analyzed, we detected a possible point source close to DH Tau
B. This candidate companion was detected in four different SPHERE observations,
with an estimated mass of $\sim 1$ M\textsubscript{Jup}, and a mass ratio with
respect to the brown dwarf of $1/10$. This binary system, if confirmed, would
be the first of its kind, opening up interesting questions for the formation
mechanism, evolution, and frequency of such pairs. In order to address the
latter, the residuals and contrasts reached for 25 companions in the sample of
substellar objects observed with SPHERE were derived. If the DH Tau Bb
companion is real, the binary fraction obtained is $\sim 7\%$, which is in good
agreement with the results obtained for field brown dwarfs.

to arise because training epochs control the model complexity. In this paper,
we show that such epoch-wise double descent arises for a different reason: It
is caused by a superposition of two or more bias-variance tradeoffs that arise
because different parts of the network are learned at different epochs, and
eliminating this by proper scaling of stepsizes can significantly improve the
early stopping performance. We show this analytically for i) linear regression,
where differently scaled features give rise to a superposition of bias-variance
tradeoffs, and for ii) a two-layer neural network, where the first and second

is investigated for a wireless network in which the base stations (BSs) are

computational task from three types of computational tasks. Since the data size
of each computational task is different, as the requested computational task
varies, the BSs must adjust their resource (subcarrier and transmit power) and
task allocation schemes to effectively serve the users. This problem is
formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the maximal
computational and transmission delay among all users. A multi-stack
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is developed to solve this problem. Using
the proposed algorithm, each BS can record the historical resource allocation
schemes and users' information in its multiple stacks to avoid learning the
same resource allocation scheme and users' states, thus improving the
convergence speed and learning efficiency. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of iterations needed for
convergence and the maximal delay among all users by up to 18% and 11.1%

continuation, employed by Brown, Preston and Singleton (BPS), for calculating
Coulomb energy exchange rates in a plasma. Two important examples of such
processes are the charged particle stopping power and the temperature
equilibration rate between different plasma species. The first lecture was
devoted to understanding the machinery of dimensional continuation, and the
second concentrated on calculating the electron-ion temperature equilibration
rate in the extreme quantum limit. In this lecture, I will examine one of the
main theoretical underpinnings of the BPS theory, namely, the dimensional
reduction of the BBGKY hierarchy. I will prove that to leading order in the
plasma coupling $g$, the BBGKY hierarchy reduces to the BE for dimensions
greater then three and to the LBE for dimensions less than three. We must
eventually return to three dimensions, and the BPS formalism shows that the
simple poles associated with the BE and the LBE exactly cancel, rendering the
limit in three dimensions finite. Furthermore, the leading order behavior of
the LBE becomes next-to-leading order when the dimensions is analytically
continued from less than three to greater than three. This provides the leading
and next-to-leading order terms in $g$ exactly, which is equivalent to an exact
calculation of the so-called Coulomb logarithm with no use of an integral
cut-off. In this way, BPS takes all Coulomb interactions into account to
leading and next-to-leading order in $g$.

neighborhood that is designed with the objective of being zero emission is

operation strategies when designing the energy system of such neighborhoods. It
also suggests methods that can be used in the operation of ZENs to ensure
carbon neutrality. An optimization model for designing the energy system of a
Zero Emission Neighborhood (ZEN) is first presented and used to produce two
designs for a campus in the South of Norway in the case where the amount of PV
is limited (PVlim) and when it is not (Base). Several operation approaches are
then introduced to compare their operation cost and the CO2 emissions and
compensations. These approaches are perfect foresight used as a reference
(Ref.),a purely economic model predictive control (E-MPC), an MPC with
penalization if deviating from emission targets (EmE-MPC)and a receding horizon
MPC where we have a net zero emission constraint over the year (RH-MPC). The
resulting energy systems are, in the Base case, PV, heat pumps, a gas boiler
and heat storage and, in the PVlim case, a smaller amount of PV, a CHP plant,
and heat storage. In the Base case all operation strategies manage to reach net
zero emissions, largely due to the passive compensations obtained from the PV.
RH-MPC offers the lowest cost. In the PVlim case, the passive effect of the PV
is not sufficient to reach net zero emissions and an operation approach
specifically taking into account the emissions is necessary. EmE-MPC achieves
the lowest emissions but it comes at a much higher cost. We conclude that the
best overall strategy is RH-MPC which maintains both the cost and the
emission-compensation balance close to the reference case with perfect
foresight.

  Applications",,,,,"cs.DS cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fair clustering is a constrained variant of clustering where the goal is to
partition a set of colored points, such that the fraction of points of any
color in every cluster is more or less equal to the fraction of points of this
color in the dataset. This variant was recently introduced by Chierichetti et
al. [NeurIPS, 2017] in a seminal work and became widely popular in the
clustering literature. In this paper, we propose a new construction of coresets
for fair clustering based on random sampling. The new construction allows us to
obtain the first coreset for fair clustering in general metric spaces. For
Euclidean spaces, we obtain the first coreset whose size does not depend
exponentially on the dimension. Our coreset results solve open questions
proposed by Schmidt et al. [WAOA, 2019] and Huang et al. [NeurIPS, 2019]. The
new coreset construction helps to design several new approximation and
streaming algorithms. In particular, we obtain the first true
constant-approximation algorithm for metric fair clustering, whose running time
is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). In the Euclidean case, we derive the first
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for fair clustering whose time
complexity is near-linear and does not depend exponentially on the dimension of
the space. Besides, our coreset construction scheme is fairly general and gives
rise to coresets for a wide range of constrained clustering problems. This
leads to improved constant-approximations for these problems in general metrics
and near-linear time $(1+\epsilon)$-approximations in the Euclidean metric.

state can form in semiconductor nanostructures with localized charge carriers
due to the strong hyperfine interaction of the localized electron spin with the
surrounding nuclear spins. Here we develop a kinetic-equation formalism
describing the nuclear-spin polaron formation. We present a derivation of the
kinetic equations for an electron-nuclear spin system coupled to reservoirs of
different electron and nuclear spin temperatures which generate the exact
thermodynamic steady state for equal temperatures independent of the system
size. We illustrate our approach using the analytical solution of the central
spin model in the limit of an Ising form of the hyperfine coupling. For
homogeneous hyperfine coupling constants, i.e., the box model, the model is
reduced to an analytically solvable form. Based on the analysis of the
nuclear-spin distribution function and the electron-nuclear spin correlators,
we derive a relation between the electron and nuclear spin temperatures, where
the correlated nuclear-spin polaron state is formed. In the limit of large
nuclear baths, this temperature line coincides with the critical temperature of
the mean-field theory for polaron formation. The criteria of the polaron
formation in a finite-size system are discussed. We demonstrate that the
system's behavior at the transition temperature does not depend on details of
the hyperfine-coupling distribution function but only on the effective number
of coupled bath spins. In addition, the kinetic equations enable the analysis
of the temporal formation of the nuclear-polaron state, where we find the
build-up process predominated by the nuclear spin-flip dynamics.

engage in exploration: making potentially suboptimal choices for the sake of
acquiring new information. We study the interplay between exploration and
competition: how such platforms balance the exploration for learning and the
competition for users. Here users play three distinct roles: they are customers
that generate revenue, they are sources of data for learning, and they are
self-interested agents which choose among the competing platforms.
  We consider a stylized duopoly model in which two firms face the same
multi-armed bandit problem. Users arrive one by one and choose between the two
firms, so that each firm makes progress on its bandit problem only if it is
chosen. Through a mix of theoretical results and numerical simulations, we
study whether and to what extent competition incentivizes the adoption of
better bandit algorithms, and whether it leads to welfare increases for users.
We find that stark competition induces firms to commit to a ""greedy"" bandit
algorithm that leads to low welfare. However, weakening competition by
providing firms with some ""free"" users incentivizes better exploration
strategies and increases welfare. We investigate two channels for weakening the
competition: relaxing the rationality of users and giving one firm a
first-mover advantage. Our findings are closely related to the ""competition vs.
innovation"" relationship, and elucidate the first-mover advantage in the
digital economy.

considerable code duplication -- code clones -- in sources of traditional

and study the extent to which snippets are recurring across multiple notebooks.
We study both identical clones and approximate clones and conduct a small-scale
ocular inspection of the most common clones. We find that code cloning is
common in Jupyter notebooks -- more than 70% of all code snippets are exact
copies of other snippets (with possible differences in white spaces), and
around 50% of all notebooks do not have any unique snippet, but consists solely
of snippets that are also found elsewhere. In notebooks written in Python, at
least 80% of all snippets are approximate clones and the prevalence of code
cloning is higher in Python than in other languages. We further find that
clones between different repositories are far more common than clones within
the same repository. However, the most common individual repository from which
a Jupyter notebook contains clones is the repository in which itself resides.

combined by a radio frequency (RF) network of the hybrid array. This paper
presents a novel hybrid uniform circular cylindrical array (UCyA) for mIoT
networks. We design a nested hybrid beamforming structure based on sparse array
techniques and propose the corresponding channel estimation method based on the
second-order channel statistics. As a result, only a small number of RF chains
are required to preserve the DoF of the UCyA. We also propose a new
tensor-based two-dimensional (2-D) direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation
algorithm tailored for the proposed hybrid array. The algorithm suppresses the
noise components in all tensor modes and operates on the signal data model
directly, hence improving estimation accuracy with an affordable computational
complexity. Corroborated by a Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis,
simulation results show that the proposed hybrid UCyA array and the DoA
estimation algorithm can accurately estimate the 2-D DoAs of a large number of

filaments, the matter is highly ionised such that it absorbs and emits far-UV
and soft X-ray photons. Athena, the proposed European Space Agency X-ray
observatory, aims to detect the `missing' baryons in the WHIM up to redshifts
of $z=1$ through absorption in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst
afterglow spectra, allowing for the study of the evolution of these large-scale
structures of the Universe. This work simulates WHIM filaments in the spectra
of GRB X-ray afterglows with Athena using the SImulation of X-ray TElescopes
(SIXTE) framework. We investigate the feasibility of their detection with the
X-IFU instrument, through O VII ($E=573$ eV) and O VIII ($E=674$ eV) absorption
features, for a range of equivalent widths imprinted onto GRB afterglow spectra
of observed starting fluxes ranging between $10^{-12}$ and $10^{-10}$ erg

worldwide lock-down. Contact tracing based on smartphones' applications (apps)
has emerged as a possible solution to trace contagions and enforce a more
sustainable selective quarantine. However, a massive adoption of these apps is
required to reach the critical mass needed for effective contact tracing. As an
alternative, geo-location technologies in next generation networks (e.g., 5G)
can enable Mobile Operators (MOs) to perform passive tracing of users' mobility
and contacts with a promised accuracy of down to one meter. To effectively
detect contagions, the identities of positive individuals, which are known only
by a Governmental Authority (GA), are also required. Note that, besides being
extremely sensitive, these data might also be critical from a business
perspective. Hence, MOs and the GA need to exchange and process users'
geo-locations and infection status data in a privacy-preserving manner. In this
work, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol that enables multiple MOs and
the GA to share and process users' data to make only the final users discover
the number of their contacts with positive individuals. The protocol is based
on existing privacy-enhancing strategies that guarantee that users' mobility
and infection status are only known to their MOs and to the GA, respectively.
From extensive simulations, we observe that the cost to guarantee total privacy
(evaluated in terms of data overhead introduced by the protocol) is acceptable,
and can also be significantly reduced if we accept a negligible compromise in
users' privacy.

years, yet it encounters new challenges in the large-scale data situation where
massive and diverse hard cases occur. Especially in the range of low false
accept rate (FAR), there are various hard cases in both positives (intra-class)
and negatives (inter-class). In this paper, we study how to make better use of
these hard samples for improving the training. The literature approaches this
by margin-based formulation in either positive logit or negative logits.
However, the correlation between hard positive and hard negative is overlooked,
and so is the relation between the margins in positive and negative logits. We
find such correlation is significant, especially in the large-scale dataset,
and one can take advantage from it to boost the training via relating the
positive and negative margins for each training sample. To this end, we propose
an explicit collaboration between positive and negative margins sample-wisely.
Given a batch of hard samples, a novel Negative-Positive Collaboration loss,
named NPCFace, is formulated, which emphasizes the training on both negative
and positive hard cases via the collaborative-margin mechanism in the softmax
logits, and also brings better interpretation of negative-positive hardness
correlation. Besides, the emphasis is implemented with an improved formulation
to achieve stable convergence and flexible parameter setting. We validate the
effectiveness of our approach on various benchmarks of large-scale face
recognition, and obtain advantageous results especially in the low FAR range.

  Bayesian approach","11 pages, 5 figures",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) has been widely applied to causal
inference in medical research. It uses genetic variants as instrumental
variables (IVs) to investigate putative causal relationship between an exposure
and an outcome. Traditional MR methods have dominantly focussed on a two-sample
setting in which IV-exposure association study and IV-outcome association study
are independent. However, it is not uncommon that participants from the two
studies fully overlap (one-sample) or partly overlap (overlapping-sample).
Methods: We proposed a method that is applicable to all the three sample
settings. In essence, we converted a two- or overlapping- sample problem to a
one-sample problem where data of some or all of the individuals were
incomplete. Assume that all individuals were drawn from the same population and
unmeasured data were missing at random. Then the unobserved data were treated
au pair with the model parameters as unknown quantities, and thus, could be
imputed iteratively conditioning on the observed data and estimated parameters
using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We generalised our model to allow for
pleiotropy and multiple exposures and assessed its performance by a number of
simulations using four metrics: mean, standard deviation, coverage and power.
Results: Higher sample overlapping rate and stronger instruments led to
estimates with higher precision and power. Pleiotropy had a notably negative
impact on the estimates. Nevertheless, overall the coverages were high and our
model performed well in all the sample settings. Conclusions: Our model offers
the flexibility of being applicable to any of the sample settings, which is an
important addition to the MR literature which has restricted to one- or two-
sample scenarios. Given the nature of Bayesian inference, it can be easily
extended to more complex MR analysis in medical research.

measurements from spectroscopy and asteroseismology allows us to attain greater
accuracy with regard to the stellar parameters needed to characterise the
stellar populations of the Milky Way. The aim of this Gaia-ESO Survey special
project is to produce a catalogue of self-consistent stellar parameters by
combining measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy and precision
asteroseismology. We carried out an iterative analysis of 90 K2@Gaia-ESO red
giants. The spectroscopic values of Teff were used as input in the seismic
analysis to obtain log(g) values. The seismic estimates of log(g) were then
used to re-determine the spectroscopic values of Teff and [Fe/H]. Only one
iteration was required to obtain parameters that are in good agreement for both
methods and thus, to obtain the final stellar parameters. A detailed analysis
of outliers was carried out to ensure a robust determination of the parameters.
The results were then combined with Gaia DR2 data to compare the seismic log(g)
with a parallax-based log(g) and to investigate instances of variations in the
velocity and possible binaries within the dataset. This analysis produced a
high-quality catalogue of stellar parameters for 90 red giant stars observed by
both K2 and Gaia-ESO that were determined through iterations between
spectroscopy and asteroseismology. We compared the seismic gravities with those
based on Gaia parallaxes to find an offset which is similar to other studies
that have used asteroseismology. Our catalogue also includes spectroscopic
chemical abundances and radial velocities, as well as indicators for possible
binary detections.

determined explicitly by the fundamental solutions of a pair of linear
$q$-difference equations. We further conjecture that for a hyperbolic knot, a
distinguished entry of those matrices equals to the Dimofte-Gaiotto-Gukov
3D-index, and thus is given by a counting of BPS states. We illustrate our
conjectures explicitly by matching theoretically and numerically computed
integers for the cases of the $4_1$ and the $5_2$ knots.

  computations","28 pages,9 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The complex Langevin (CL) method is a classical numerical strategy to
alleviate the numerical sign problem in the computation of lattice field
theories. Mathematically, it is a simple numerical tool to compute a wide class
of high-dimensional and oscillatory integrals. However, it is often observed
that the CL method converges but the limiting result is incorrect. The
literature has several unclear or even conflicting statements, making the
method look mysterious. By an in-depth analysis of a model problem, we reveal
the mechanism of how the CL result turns biased as the parameter changes, and
it is demonstrated that such a transition is difficult to capture. Our analysis
also shows that the method works for any observables only if the probability
density function generated by the CL process is localized. To generalize such
observations to lattice field theories, we formulate the CL method on general
groups using rigorous mathematical languages for the first time, and we
demonstrate that such localized probability density function does not exist in
the simulation of lattice field theories for general compact groups, which
explains the unstable behavior of the CL method. Fortunately, we also find that
the gauge cooling technique creates additional velocity that helps confine the
samples, so that we can still see localized probability density functions in
certain cases, as significantly broadens the application of the CL method. The
limitations of gauge cooling are also discussed. In particular, we prove that
gauge cooling has no effect for Abelian groups, and we provide an example
showing that biased results still exist when gauge cooling is insufficient to
confine the probability density function.

two-phase flow model to predict the suspension of mono-dispersed finite-sized
solid particles in a boundary layer flow are investigated. For
heavier-than-fluid particles, having settling velocity of the order of the bed
friction velocity, the two-fluid model significantly under-estimates the
turbulent dispersion of particles. It is hypothesized that finite-size effects
are important and a correction model for the drag law is proposed. This model
is based on the assumption that the turbulent flow scales larger than the
particle diameter will contribute to the resolved relative velocity between the
two phases, whereas eddies smaller than the particle diameter will have two
effects: (i) they will reduce the particle response time by adding a
sub-particle scale eddy viscosity to the drag coefficient, and (ii) they will
contribute to increase the production of granular temperature. Integrating
finite-size effects allows us to quantitatively predict the concentration
profile for heavier-than-fluid particles without any tuning parameter. The
proposed modification of the two-fluid model extends its range of applicability
to tackle particles having a size belonging to the inertial range of turbulence
and allows us to envision more complex applications in terms of flow forcing
conditions, i.e. sheet flow, wave-driven transport, turbidity currents and/or
flow geometries, i.e. ripples, dunes, scour.

interaction is turned on, so long as the interaction does not cause a phase
transition. Understanding what determines the Fermi surface size is a crucial
and yet unsolved problem in strongly interacting systems such as high-$T_{c}$
superconductors. Here we present a precise test of the Luttinger theorem for a
two-dimensional Fermi liquid system where the exotic quasi-particles themselves
emerge from the strong interaction, namely for the Fermi sea of composite
fermions (CFs). Via direct, geometric resonance measurements of the CFs' Fermi
wavevector down to very low electron densities, we show that the Luttinger
theorem is obeyed over a significant range of interaction strengths, in the
sense that the Fermi sea area is determined by the density of the
\textit{minority carriers} in the lowest Landau level. Our data also address
the ongoing debates on whether or not CFs obey particle-hole symmetry, and if
they are Dirac particles. We find that particle-hole symmetry is obeyed, but
the measured Fermi sea area differs quantitatively from that predicted by the
Dirac model for CFs.

Objective:This systematic literature review aims at providing an aggregate view
of the relevant studies on Software Development Analytics in the past decade,
with an emphasis on its application in practical settings. Method:Definition
and execution of a search string upon several digital libraries, followed by a
quality assessment criteria to identify the most relevant papers. On those, we
extracted a set of characteristics (study type, data source, study perspective,
development life-cycle activities covered, stakeholders, mining methods, and
analytics scope) and classified their impact against a taxonomy. Results:Source
code repositories, experimental case studies, and developers are the most
common data sources, study types, and stakeholders, respectively. Product and
project managers are also often present, but less than expected. Mining methods
are evolving rapidly and that is reflected in the long list identified.
Descriptive statistics are the most usual method followed by correlation
analysis. Being software development an important process in every
organization, it was unexpected to find that process mining was present in only
one study. Most contributions to the software development life cycle were given
in the quality dimension. Time management and costs control were lightly
debated. The analysis of security aspects suggests it is an increasing topic of
concern for practitioners. Risk management contributions are scarce.
Conclusions:There is a wide improvement margin for software development

form of the drag coefficient ($C_D$) of a single sphere subjected to uniform
fluid flow consists of a series of logarithmic and power terms of the Reynolds
number ($Re$).\ In this paper, we will explore the validity of the above
statement for Reynolds numbers up to $10^{6}$ by using a symbolic regression
machine learning method.\ The algorithm is trained by available experimental
data and data from well-known correlations from the literature for $Re$ ranging
from $0.1$ to $2\times 10^5$.\ Our results show that the functional form of the
$C_D$ contains powers of $\log(Re)$, plus the Stokes term, fulfilling partially
the statement made above. The logarithmic $C_D$ expressions can generalize
(extrapolate) beyond the training data and are the first in the literature to
predict with acceptable accuracy the rapid decrease (drag crisis) of the $C_D$
at high $Re$.\ We also find a connection between the root of the $Re$-dependent
terms in the $C_D$ expression and the first point of laminar separation.\ We
did the same analysis for the problem of heat transfer under forced convection
around a sphere and found that the logarithmic terms of $Re$ and Peclect number
$Pe$ play an essential role in the variation of the Nusselt number $Nu$.\ The

Embeddings where speech or text of arbitrary length are mapped to a vector

accepts speech signals in the form of frame-wise subword posterior
probabilities obtained from an acoustic model and a text encoder that accepts
text in the form of subword transcriptions. Compared to a triplet loss
criterion, the proposed method is shown to have more effective gradients for
neural network training. Experimentally, it also gives more accurate results
with low-dimensional embeddings when the two encoder networks are used in
tandem in a word (name) recognition task, and when the text encoder network is
used standalone in an approximate phonetic matching task. In particular, in an
isolated name recognition task depending solely on Euclidean nearest-neighbor
search between the proposed embedding vectors, the recognition accuracy is
identical to that of conventional finite state transducer(FST)-based decoding

based on the evidence that the brain computes on high-dimensional, distributed,
representations of data. The main operation of HD is encoding, which transfers
the input data to hyperspace by mapping each input feature to a hypervector,
accompanied by so-called bundling procedure that simply adds up the
hypervectors to realize encoding hypervector. Although the operations of HD are
highly parallelizable, the massive number of operations hampers the efficiency
of HD in embedded domain. In this paper, we propose SHEARer, an
algorithm-hardware co-optimization to improve the performance and energy
consumption of HD computing. We gain insight from a prudent scheme of
approximating the hypervectors that, thanks to inherent error resiliency of HD,
has minimal impact on accuracy while provides high prospect for hardware
optimization. In contrast to previous works that generate the encoding
hypervectors in full precision and then ex-post quantizing, we compute the
encoding hypervectors in an approximate manner that saves a significant amount
of resources yet affords high accuracy. We also propose a novel FPGA
implementation that achieves striking performance through massive parallelism
with low power consumption. Moreover, we develop a software framework that
enables training HD models by emulating the proposed approximate encodings. The
FPGA implementation of SHEARer achieves an average throughput boost of 104,904x

study exhibits a preliminary experiment that evaluates the performance of a
model that downscales synoptic temperature fields to mesoscale temperature
fields every 6 hours. The deep learning model was trained with operational
22-km gridded global analysis surface winds and temperatures as the input,
operational 5-km gridded regional analysis surface temperatures as the desired
output, and a target domain covering central Japan. The results confirm that
our deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is capable of estimating the
locations of coastlines and mountain ridges in great detail, which are not
retained in the inputs, and providing high-resolution surface temperature
distributions. For instance, while the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) is
2.7 K between the global and regional analyses at altitudes greater than 1000
m, the RMSE is reduced to 1.0 K, and the correlation coefficient is improved
from 0.6 to 0.9 by the surrogate model. Although this study evaluates a
surrogate model only for surface temperature, it probably can be improved by
augmenting the downscaling variables and vertical profiles. Surrogate models of
DCNNs require only a small amount of computational power once their training is
finished. Therefore, if the surrogate models are implemented at short time
intervals, they will provide high-resolution weather forecast guidance or
environment emergency alerts at low cost.

In addition to investigation of $p$-adic string for a particular prime number
$p$, it is also interesting to study collective effects taking into account all
primes $p$. An idea behind this approach is that a zeta string is a whole thing
with infinitely many faces which we see as $p$-adic strings. The name zeta
string has origin in the Riemann zeta function contained in related Lagrangian.
The starting point in construction a zeta string is Lagrangian for a $p$-adic
open string. There are two types of approaches to get a Lagrangian for zeta
string from Lagrangian for $p$-adic strings: additive and multiplicative
approaches, that are related to two forms of the definition of the Riemann zeta
function. As a result of differences in approaches, one obtains several
different Lagrangians for zeta strings. We briefly discuss some properties of
these Lagrangians, related potentials, equations of motion, mass spectrum and
possible connection with ordinary strings. This is a review of published papers

innovations. While it may be obvious that replacing humans with machine would
increase efficiency, it is not clear whether and where machines can make better
decisions than humans. We answer this question in the context of crowd lending,
where decisions are traditionally made by a crowd of investors. Using data from
Prosper.com, we show that a reasonably sophisticated ML algorithm predicts
listing default probability more accurately than crowd investors. The dominance
of the machine over the crowd is more pronounced for highly risky listings. We
then use the machine to make investment decisions, and find that the machine
benefits not only the lenders but also the borrowers. When machine prediction
is used to select loans, it leads to a higher rate of return for investors and
more funding opportunities for borrowers with few alternative funding options.
We also find suggestive evidence that the machine is biased in gender and race
even when it does not use gender and race information as input. We propose a
general and effective ""debasing"" method that can be applied to any prediction
focused ML applications, and demonstrate its use in our context. We show that
the debiased ML algorithm, which suffers from lower prediction accuracy, still
leads to better investment decisions compared with the crowd. These results
indicate that ML can help crowd lending platforms better fulfill the promise of

Optimal Latin hypercube technique, combined with a genetic algorithm, is then
implemented on the microstructures to achieve optimized design parameters. The
optimized microstructures can accurately approximate the behavior of
transformed materials. We design such devices and numerically characterize good
thermal-energy harvesting performances. To validate the wide-range application

  unequal-mass three-body orbits","5 pages, 3 figures",,,,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Broucke-Hadjidemetriou-H\'{e}non's (BHH) orbits are a family of periodic
orbits of the three-body system with the simplest topological free group word
$a$, while the BHH satellites have free group words $a^k$ ($k>1$), where $k$ is
the topological exponent. Jankovi\'{c} and Dmitra\v{s}inovi\'{c} [Phy. Rev.
Lett. 116, 064301 (2016)] reported 57 new BHH satellites with equal mass and
found that at a fixed energy the relationship between the angular momentum
($L$) and the topologically rescaled period ($T/k$) is the same for both of the
BHH orbits ($k=1$) and the BHH satellites ($k>1$). In this letter, we report
419,743 new BHH orbits ($k=1$) and 179,253 new BHH satellites ($k>1$) of the
three-body system with unequal mass, which have never been reported, to the
best of our knowledge. Among these newly-found 598,996 BBH orbits and
satellites, about 33.5 % (i.e., 200,686) are linearly stable and thus many
among them might be observed in practice. Besides, we discover that, for the
three-body system with unequal mass at a fixed energy, relationship between the
angular momentum ($L$) and topologically rescaled period ($T/k$) of the BHH
satellites ($k>1$) is different from that of the BHH orbits ($k=1$).

analytical approximate l-wave solutions of the Schrodinger equation with the
general molecular oscillator (GMO). The energy eigenvalues equation and the
corresponding wave -functions have been obtained explicitly. Improved
Pekeris-type approximation Schemes have been used to deal with the orbital
centrifugal term. We have deduced expressions for the bound-state energy
eigenvalues of the Morse and shifted Deng-Fan oscillator as special cases of
the GMO, and computed their resulting bound-state energy eigenvalues for H2,
CO, HCl and LiH diatomic molecules. Our results are in good agreement with
other results in the literature.
