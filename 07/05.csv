any level of performance when executing a task and, in fact, not even ensure

multiple grasp affordance configuration candidates. Using these candidates, we
forward simulate the outcome of executing the affordance task to analyse the
relation between task outcome and grasp candidates. The relations are ranked by
performance success with a heuristic confidence function and used to build a

one-shot transfer estimation of the best grasp configuration on new objects.

beyond a cumulative sum of rewards have gained traction, such as in constrained

consider policy optimization in Markov Decision Problems, where the objective
is a general concave utility function of the state-action occupancy measure,
which subsumes several of the aforementioned examples as special cases. Such
generality invalidates the Bellman equation. As this means that dynamic
programming no longer works, we focus on direct policy search. Analogously to
the Policy Gradient Theorem \cite{sutton2000policy} available for RL with
cumulative rewards, we derive a new Variational Policy Gradient Theorem for RL
with general utilities, which establishes that the parametrized policy gradient
may be obtained as the solution of a stochastic saddle point problem involving
the Fenchel dual of the utility function. We develop a variational Monte Carlo
gradient estimation algorithm to compute the policy gradient based on sample
paths. We prove that the variational policy gradient scheme converges globally
to the optimal policy for the general objective, though the optimization
problem is nonconvex. We also establish its rate of convergence of the order
$O(1/t)$ by exploiting the hidden convexity of the problem, and proves that it
converges exponentially when the problem admits hidden strong convexity. Our
analysis applies to the standard RL problem with cumulative rewards as a

for the parameters of the Log-Normal distribution defined on the manifold of $N

the Log-Euclidean metric as its Riemannian metric since it is easy to compute
and is widely used in applications. By using the Log-Euclidean distance in the
loss function, we derive a shrinkage estimator in an analytic form and show
that it is asymptotically optimal within a large class of estimators including
the MLE, which is the sample Fr\'echet mean of the data. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed shrinkage estimator via several simulated data
experiments. Furthermore, we apply the shrinkage estimator to perform
statistical inference in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging problems.

origin in studies two-dimensional magnetization phenomena. This metaphor has
proven quite useful, as it allowed to use well known techniques, relating
individual behaviours of single spins and their interactions, to large scale
properties, such as magnetization or magnetic domains creation. These physical
properties were then ``mapped'' to social concepts: spin orientation to a
person's views on a specific issue, magnetization to global opinion on the
issue, etc. During the past 20 years, the models were significantly expanded,
using more complex individual agent characteristics and even more complex types
of the interactions, but the power of the metaphor remained unchanged. In the
current paper we propose to use a new physical system as the basis for new
ideas in sociophysics. We shall argue that the concepts and tools devoted to
studies of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) could significantly broaden the range of
social concepts ``addressable'' by sociophysics, by focusing on a wider range
of global phenomena, arising from atomic properties, interactions and
arrangements. We illustrate the new idea by calculating a few characteristics
of a simple HEA system and their possible ``mapping'' into social concepts.

structure, namely to cluster vertices into groups, or blocks, according to some
measure of similarity. Beyond mere adjacency matrices, many real networks also
involve vertex covariates that carry key information about underlying block
structure in graphs. To assess the effects of such covariates on block
recovery, we present a comparative analysis of two model-based spectral
algorithms for clustering vertices in stochastic blockmodel graphs with vertex
covariates. The first algorithm uses only the adjacency matrix, and directly
estimates the block assignments. The second algorithm incorporates both the
adjacency matrix and the vertex covariates into the estimation of block
assignments, and moreover quantifies the explicit impact of the vertex
covariates on the resulting estimate of the block assignments. We employ
Chernoff information to analytically compare the algorithms' performance and
derive the information-theoretic Chernoff ratio for certain models of interest.
Analytic results and simulations suggest that the second algorithm is often
preferred: we can often better estimate the induced block assignments by first
estimating the effect of vertex covariates. In addition, real data examples
also indicate that the second algorithm has the advantages of revealing
underlying block structure and taking observed vertex heterogeneity into
account in real applications. Our findings emphasize the importance of
distinguishing between observed and unobserved factors that can affect block
structure in graphs.

face anti-spoofing as a material recognition problem and combine it with
classical human material perception [1], intending to extract discriminative
and robust features for FAS. To this end, we propose the Bilateral
Convolutional Networks (BCN), which is able to capture intrinsic material-based

Furthermore, Multi-level Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and multi-head

terms of roles to access resources. This research proposes a scalable, flexible

security requirements of organizations. The EOS blockchain platform for
developing smart contract and decentralized applications (DAPPs) aims to
address the scalability problem found in existing blockchain platforms. This
smart contract platform aims to eliminate transaction fees while conducting
millions of transactions per second. In our proposed approach, the EOS
blockchain transparently stores RBAC policies. Administrative roles control
access to resources at a higher level according to the way organisations
perform operations. An organisation creates roles, role hierarchies and
constraints to regulate user actions. Therefore, once an RBAC framework is
established, the administrative user (issuer) only needs to grant and revoke
roles to support changes in the organisational structure. Our proposed
blockchain-based RBAC supports delegation capabilities using gaseless
transactions which makes it adoptable and appealing in a large number of
application scenarios. Our proposed solution is application-agnostic and
well-suited for diverse use cases. Existing state-of-the art security
frameworks are not suitable due to the difficulty of scale, higher cost and
single point of failure. Consequently, organisations demand a scalable,
cost-effective and lightweight access control solution which can better protect
their privacy as well. A proof of concept implementation is developed based on
the EOS blockchain. Our experimental results and analysis clearly show that our
EOS blockchain-based RBAC outperforms existing blockchain platforms in terms of
cost, latency, block generation time, contract execution time and throughput.

The dynamics of the motor and cargo in each phase are governed by stochastic
differential equations, and the switching rates depend on the spatial
configuration of the motor and cargo. This system is analyzed in a limit where
the detached motors have faster dynamics than the cargo, which in turn has
faster dynamics than the attached motors. The attachment and detachment rates
are also taken to be slow relative to the spatial dynamics. Through an
application of iterated stochastic averaging to this system, and the use of
renewal-reward theory to stitch together the progress within each switching
phase, we obtain explicit analytical expressions for the effective drift,
diffusivity, and processivity of the motor-cargo system. Our approach accounts
in particular for jumps in motor-cargo position that occur during attachment
and detachment events, as the cargo tracking variable makes a rapid adjustment

experiment, a single layer of microparticles was levitated in a radio-frequency
glow-discharge plasma. In this layer, the microparticles were self-organized as
a 2D solid-like strongly coupled plasma, which was perturbed by the piston-like
mechanical movement of a wire. To excite a blast wave, the wire's motion was
abruptly stopped, so that the input of mechanical energy ceased at a known

amplitude persisted with little decay. This result extends similar findings, in
previous experiments with 3D microparticle clouds, to the case of 2D clouds. In
our cloud, out-of-plane displacements were observed, lending support to the
possibility that an instability, driven by wakes in the ion flow, provides

causing an existential health crisis. Thus, having a system that automatically
detects COVID-19 in tomography (CT) images can assist in quantifying the
severity of the illness. Unfortunately, labelling chest CT scans requires
significant domain expertise, time, and effort. We address these labelling
challenges by only requiring point annotations, a single pixel for each
infected region on a CT image. This labeling scheme allows annotators to label
a pixel in a likely infected region, only taking 1-3 seconds, as opposed to
10-15 seconds to segment a region. Conventionally, segmentation models train on
point-level annotations using the cross-entropy loss function on these labels.
However, these models often suffer from low precision. Thus, we propose a
consistency-based (CB) loss function that encourages the output predictions to
be consistent with spatial transformations of the input images. The experiments
on 3 open-source COVID-19 datasets show that this loss function yields
significant improvement over conventional point-level loss functions and almost
matches the performance of models trained with full supervision with much less
human effort. Code is available at:

In particular, suitable rank correlations have been used for consistent tests

appealing for continuous data as tests become distribution-free. However, the
traditional concept of ranks relies on ordering data and is, thus, tied to
univariate observations. As a result, it has long remained unclear how one may
construct distribution-free yet consistent tests of independence between random
vectors. This is the problem addressed in this paper, in which we lay out a
general framework for designing dependence measures that give tests of
multivariate independence that are not only consistent and distribution-free
but which we also prove to be statistically efficient. Our framework leverages
the recently introduced concept of center-outward ranks and signs, a
multivariate generalization of traditional ranks, and adopts a common standard
form for dependence measures that encompasses many popular examples. In a
unified study, we derive a general asymptotic representation of center-outward
rank-based test statistics under independence, extending to the multivariate
setting the classical H\'{a}jek asymptotic representation results. This
representation permits direct calculation of limiting null distributions and
facilitates a local power analysis that provides strong support for the
center-outward approach by establishing, for the first time, the nontrivial
power of center-outward rank-based tests over root-$n$ neighborhoods within the
class of quadratic mean differentiable alternatives.

If one could learn how to control and streamline their chaotic motion, that
would open technological opportunities in areas such as the transformation of
stored or environmental energy into systematic motion, micro-robotics, and
transport of matter at the microscale. This overview presents an approach to
command microscale dynamics by replacing an isotropic medium such as water with
an anisotropic fluid, a nematic liquid crystal. Orientational order leads to
new dynamic effects, such as propagation of particle-like solitary waves. Many
of these effects are still awaiting their detailed mathematical description. By
using plasmonic metamask photoalignment, the nematic director can be patterned
into predesigned structures that control dynamics of inanimate particles
through the liquid crystal enabled nonlinear electrokinetics. Moreover,
plasmonic patterning of liquid crystals allows one to command the dynamics of
swimming bacteria, guiding their trajectories, polarity of swimming, and
concentration in space. The patterned director design can also be extended to
liquid crystal elastomers, in which case the director gradients define the
dynamic profile of elastomer coatings. Some of these systems form an
experimental playground for the exploration of out-of-equilibrium active
matter, in which the levels of activity, degree of orientational order and
patterns of alignment can all be controlled independently of each other.

adopted in many domains beyond the object-oriented paradigm (cloud computing,
mobile, web, etc.), used in industrial settings and considered objectives
beyond improving the design to include other non-functional requirements (e.g.,
improve performance, security, etc.). Thus, challenges to be addressed by
refactoring work are, nowadays, beyond code transformation to include, but not
limited to, scheduling the opportune time to carry refactoring, recommendations
of specific refactoring activities, detection of refactoring opportunities, and
testing the correctness of applied refactorings. Therefore, the refactoring
research efforts are fragmented over several research communities, various
domains, and objectives. To structure the field and existing research results,
this paper provides a systematic literature review and analyzes the results of
3183 research papers on refactoring covering the last three decades to offer
the most scalable and comprehensive literature review of existing refactoring
research studies. Based on this survey, we created a taxonomy to classify the
existing research, identified research trends, and highlighted gaps in the
literature and avenues for further research.

measure-preserving, ergodic dynamical systems is studied using kernel integral
operator techniques. An approach is proposed whereby complex-valued observables
with approximately cyclical behavior are constructed from a pair eigenfunctions
of integral operators built from delay-coordinate mapped data. It is shown that
these observables are $\epsilon$-approximate eigenfunctions of the Koopman
evolution operator of the system, with a bound $\epsilon$ controlled by the
length of the delay-embedding window, the evolution time, and appropriate
spectral gap parameters. In particular, $ \epsilon$ can be made arbitrarily
small as the embedding window increases so long as the corresponding
eigenvalues remain sufficiently isolated in the spectrum of the integral
operator. It is also shown that the time-autocorrelation functions of such
observables are $\epsilon$-approximate Koopman eigenvalue, exhibiting a
well-defined characteristic oscillatory frequency (estimated using the Koopman
generator) and a slowly-decaying modulating envelope. The results hold for
measure-preserving, ergodic dynamical systems of arbitrary spectral character,
including mixing systems with continuous spectrum and no non-constant Koopman
eigenfunctions in $L^2$. Numerical examples reveal a coherent observable of the
Lorenz 63 system whose autocorrelation function remains above 0.5 in modulus

This disparity has only grown in recent years as our ability to collect data
improves. Under these constraints, it makes sense to select only the most
informative instances from the unlabeled pool and request an oracle (e.g., a
human expert) to provide labels for those samples. The goal of active learning
is to infer the informativeness of unlabeled samples so as to minimize the
number of requests to the oracle. Here, we formulate active learning as an
open-set recognition problem. In this paradigm, only some of the inputs belong
to known classes; the classifier must identify the rest as unknown. More
specifically, we leverage variational neural networks (VNNs), which produce
high-confidence (i.e., low-entropy) predictions only for inputs that closely
resemble the training data. We use the inverse of this confidence measure to
select the samples that the oracle should label. Intuitively, unlabeled samples
that the VNN is uncertain about are more informative for future training. We
carried out an extensive evaluation of our novel, probabilistic formulation of
active learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100. Additionally, unlike current active learning methods, our algorithm
can learn tasks without the need for task labels. As our experiments show, when
the unlabeled pool consists of a mixture of samples from multiple datasets, our
approach can automatically distinguish between samples from seen vs. unseen
tasks.

communicative value: perhaps to the vandal themselves, to some audience at whom

community participants despite their antinormative behavior offers the
possibility of engaging with or countering their choices in novel ways.
Rational choice theory (RCT) as applied in value expectancy theory (VET) offers
a strategy for characterizing behaviors in a framework of rational choices, and
begins with the supposition that subject to some weighting of personal
preferences and constraints, individuals maximize their own utility by
committing acts of vandalism. This study applies the framework of RCT and VET
to gain insight into vandals' preferences and constraints. Using a
mixed-methods analysis of Wikipedia, I combine social computing and
criminological perspectives on vandalism to propose an ontology of vandalism

  Operation of Hierarchical Electrical Power Grids","27 pages",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multilevel, multiarea, and hierarchically interconnected electrical power
grids confront substantial challenges with the increasing integration of many
volatile energy resources. The traditional isolated operation of interconnected
power grids is uneconomical due to a lack of coordination; it may result in
severe accidents that affect operational safety. However, the centralized
operation of interconnected power grids is impractical, considering the
operational independence and information privacy of each power grid. This paper
proposes a nested decomposition method for the coordinated operation of
hierarchical electrical power grids, which can achieve global optimization by
iterating among upper- and lower-level power grids with exchange of boundary
information alone. During each iteration, a projection function, which embodies
the optimal objective value of a lower-level power grid projected onto its
boundary variable space, is computed with second-order exactness. Thus, the
proposed method can be applied widely to nonlinear continuous optimizations and
can converge much more rapidly than existing decomposition methods. We
conducted numerical tests of coordinated operation examples with a trilevel
power grid that demonstrate the validity and performance of the proposed
method.

systems subject to the constraints of thermodynamics. Using examples I show
that these constraints necessarily limit the performance of clocks and that
good clocks require large energy dissipation. For periodic clocks, operating on
a limit cycle, this is a consequence of phase diffusion. It is also true for
non periodic clocks (for example, radio carbon dating) but due to telegraph
noise not to phase diffusion. In this case a key role is played by accurate
measurements that decrease entropy, thereby raising the free energy of the
clock, and requires access to a low entropy reservoir. In the quantum case, for
which thermal noise is replaced by quantum noise (spontaneous emission or

The latest generation of autocompleters uses neural language models, trained on

  We demonstrate that neural code autocompleters are vulnerable to poisoning
attacks. By adding a few specially-crafted files to the autocompleter's
training corpus (data poisoning), or else by directly fine-tuning the
autocompleter on these files (model poisoning), the attacker can influence its
suggestions for attacker-chosen contexts. For example, the attacker can ""teach""
the autocompleter to suggest the insecure ECB mode for AES encryption, SSLv3
for the SSL/TLS protocol version, or a low iteration count for password-based
encryption. Moreover, we show that these attacks can be targeted: an
autocompleter poisoned by a targeted attack is much more likely to suggest the
insecure completion for files from a specific repo or specific developer.
  We quantify the efficacy of targeted and untargeted data- and model-poisoning

180$^0$ deg. correspond to binary fission or to the decay into three cluster

physics of fission-phenomena of heavy nuclei. These experimental results for
the collinear cluster tripartition (CCT), refer to the decay into three
clusters of comparable masses. In the present work we discuss the various
aspects of this ternary fission (FFF) mode. The question of collinearity is
analysed on the basis of recent publications. Further insight into the possible
decay modes is obtained by the discussion of the path towards larger
deformation, towards hyper-deformation and by inspecting details of the
potential energy surfaces (PES). In the path towards the extremely deformed
states leading to ternary fission, the concept of deformed shells is most
important. At the scission configuration the phase space determined by the
PES's leads to the final mass distributions. The possibility of formation of
fragments of almost equal size ($Z_i$ = 32, 34, 32, for $Z$=98) and the
observation of several other fission modes in the same system can be predicted
by the PES. The PES's show pronounced minima and valleys, namely for several
mass/charge combinations of ternary fragments, which correspond to a variety of
collinear ternary fission (multi-modal) decays. The case of the decay of
$^{252}$Cf(sf,fff) turns out to be unique due to the presence of deformed
shells in the total system and of closed shells in all three nuclei in the
decay.

topological current distribution in a single crystal and thin film of
topological insulator material, Bi2Se3. The single crystal, at low
temperatures, has uniform topological surface current sheets which are about
3.6 nm thick. With increasing temperature, the current partially diverts into
the crystal bulk and concomitantly, the sheet break up into a patchy network of
high and low current density regions. The temperature dependence of the high
current density areas shows that the surface to bulk transformation in the
crystal has features of classical phase transition phenomena. The surface area
fraction with topological high current density behaves like an order parameter.
This phase transition is driven by disorder. In Bi2Se3 thin film we show the
presence of quasi one-dimensional topological edge currents which are
suppressed with a weak applied magnetic field. The edge current transforms into
a uniform bulk current in the film.

investigate reasons for such overfitting by studying a weakly supervised

that a URE gives an unbiased gradient estimator(UGE). Practically, however,
UGEs may suffer from huge variance, which causes empirical gradients to be
usually far away from true gradients during minimization. To this end, we
propose a novel surrogate complementary loss(SCL) framework that trades zero

mitigates the overfitting issue and improves URE-based methods.

the standard IOU setting of 0.5, most networks perform well with mAP scores
greater than 80% in detecting the relatively simple objects in plots. However,
the performance drops drastically when evaluated at a stricter IOU of 0.9 with
the best model giving a mAP of 35.70%. Note that such a stricter evaluation is
essential when dealing with scientific plots where even minor localisation
errors can lead to large errors in downstream numerical inferences. Given this
poor performance, we propose minor modifications to existing models by
combining ideas from different object detection networks. While this
significantly improves the performance, there are still 2 main issues: (i)
performance on text objects which are essential for reasoning is very poor, and
(ii) inference time is unacceptably large considering the simplicity of plots.

region proposal method based on Laplacian edge detectors, (b) a feature
representation of region proposals that includes neighbouring information, (c)
a linking component to join multiple region proposals for detecting longer

at extreme IOU values achieving a mAP of 93.44%@0.9 IOU. Simultaneously, our

transfer calculations of type II SNe at 300d after explosion. Guided by results
for a large set of stellar evolution simulations, we craft ejecta models for
type II SNe from the explosion of a 12, 15, 20, and 25Msun star. The ejecta
density structure and kinetic energy, the 56Ni mass, and the level of chemical
mixing are parametrized. Our model spectra are sensitive to the adopted line
Doppler width, a phenomenon we associate with the overlap of FeII and OI lines
with Lyalpha and Lybeta. Our spectra show a strong sensitivity to 56Ni mixing
since it determines where decay power is absorbed. Even at 300d after
explosion, the H-rich layers reprocess the radiation from the inner metal rich
layers. In a given progenitor model, variations in 56Ni mass and distribution
impact the ejecta ionization, which can modulate the strength of all lines.
Such ionization shifts can quench CaII line emission. In our set of models, the
OI6300 doublet strength is the most robust signature of progenitor mass.
However, we emphasize that convective shell merging in the progenitor massive
star interior can pollute the O-rich shell with Ca, which will weaken the
OI6300 doublet flux in the resulting nebular SN II spectrum. This process may
occur in Nature, with a greater occurrence in higher mass progenitors, and may
explain in part the preponderance of progenitor masses below 17Msun inferred

have significantly reduced the burden of feature engineering in many domains,
for niche tasks such as the one we consider in this paper, they result in two
major problems. First, they use a very large number of features (that may or

expensive. Further, more importantly, the large feature-space makes it very
hard to interpret which features are truly important for predictions. Thus, a
criticism of such methods is that learning algorithms pose opaque black boxes
to its users, in this case, medical experts. The recommendation of such
algorithms can be understood easily, but the reason for their recommendation is
not clear. This is the problem of non-interpretability of the model, and the
best-performing algorithms are usually the least interpretable. To address
these issues, in this paper, we propose an approach to extract a very small

spatial-angular attention module specifically for the high-dimensional light

multi-scale reconstruction structure to efficiently implement the non-local

superior performance of the proposed spatial-angular attention network for
reconstructing sparsely-sampled light fields with non-Lambertian effects.

mathematicians and physicists alike since the Milne half-space problem was
introduce in 1921 [1]. Numerous numerical solutions exist, but understandably,
there are only a few analytical solutions, with the prominent one being the
singular eigenfunction expansion (SEE) introduced by Case [2] in 1960. For the
half-space, the method, though yielding, an elegant analytical form resulting
from half-range completeness, requires numerical evaluation of complicated
integrals. In addition, one finds closed form analytical expressions only for
the infinite medium and half-space cases. One can find the flux in a slab only
iteratively. That is to say, in general one must expend a considerable
numerical effort to get highly precise benchmarks from SEE. As a result,
investigators have devised alternative methods, such as the CN [3], FN [4] and
Greens Function Method (GFM) [5] based on the SEE have been devised. These
methods take the SEE at their core and construct a numerical method around the
analytical form. The FN method in particular has been most successful in
generating highly precise benchmarks. No method yielding a precise numerical
solution has yet been based solely on a fundamental discretization until now.
Here, we show for the albedo problem with a source on the vacuum boundary of a
homogeneous medium, a precise numerical solution is possible via Lagrange
interpolation over a discrete set of directions.

The goal in this paper is to establish Bavard's duality theorem of

  Our duality theorem provides a connection between $G$-invariant

These eigenvalues are thresholds in the essential spectrum of the operator

where $\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter and ${\cal L}(\epsilon)$ is an

bifurcate into eigenvalues and resonances of the operator ${\cal H}$ in the

simple conditions determining the existence of these resonances and eigenvalues

to generic non-self-adjoint perturbations and, in particular, to perturbations
characterized by the parity-time ($PT$) symmetry. Potential applications of our
result embrace a broad class of physical systems governed by dispersive or
diffractive effects. We use our findings to develop a scheme for a controllable
generation of non-Hermitian optical states with normalizable power and real

corresponding eigenfunctions can be interpreted as an optical generalization of
bound states embedded in the continuum. For a particular example, the

tackle the challenge and propose an adaptive multi-channel graph convolutional

selecting, editing, and generating impressive images. This trend increases the
importance of evaluating image aesthetics as a complementary function of
automatic image processing. We propose a multi-patch method, named MPA-Net
(Multi-Patch Aggregation Network), to predict image aesthetics scores by
maintaining the original aspect ratios of contents in the images. Through an
experiment involving the large-scale AVA dataset, which contains 250,000
images, we show that the effectiveness of the equal-interval multi-patch
selection approach for aesthetics score prediction is significant compared to
the single-patch prediction and random patch selection approaches. For this
dataset, MPA-Net outperforms the neural image assessment algorithm, which was
regarded as a baseline method. In particular, MPA-Net yields a 0.073 (11.5%)
higher linear correlation coefficient (LCC) of aesthetics scores and a 0.088
(14.4%) higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC). MPA-Net also
reduces the mean square error (MSE) by 0.0115 (4.18%) and achieves results for
the LCC and SRCC that are comparable to those of the state-of-the-art
continuous aesthetics score prediction methods. Most notably, MPA-Net yields a
significant lower MSE especially for images with aspect ratios far from 1.0,
indicating that MPA-Net is useful for a wide range of image aspect ratios.
MPA-Net uses only images and does not require external information during the
training nor prediction stages. Therefore, MPA-Net has great potential for
applications aside from aesthetics score prediction such as other human
subjectivity prediction.

mobile networks. In ImageNet classification, by simply replacing the inverted

silicon regions result in formation of potential wells (PW) in the source and
drain regions of FDSOI MOSFET and thus, the device being called as Potential
Well Based FDSOI MOSFET (PWFDSOI MOSFET). Simulation and device physics study
on PWFDSOI MOSFET showed reduction in the OFF current of the device by orders
of magnitude. A low IOF F of 22 pA/um, high ION /IOF F ratio of 1.5 x 107 and
subthreshold swing of 76 mV/decade were achieved in 20 nm gate length PWFDSOI
MOSFET. The study was performed on devices with unstrained silicon channel.

discrete-time uncertain systems under linear temporal logic (LTL)
specifications. We construct temporal logic trees (TLT) from LTL formulae via
reachability analysis. In contrast to automaton-based methods, the construction
of the TLT is abstraction-free for infinite systems, that is, we do not
construct discrete abstractions of the infinite systems. Moreover, for a given
transition system and an LTL formula, we prove that there exist both a
universal TLT and an existential TLT via minimal and maximal reachability
analysis, respectively. We show that the universal TLT is an underapproximation
for the LTL formula and the existential TLT is an overapproximation. We provide
sufficient conditions and necessary conditions to verify whether a transition
system satisfies an LTL formula by using the TLT approximations. As a major
contribution of this work, for a controlled transition system and an LTL
formula, we prove that a controlled TLT can be constructed from the LTL formula
via control-dependent reachability analysis. Based on the controlled TLT, we
design an online control synthesis algorithm, under which a set of feasible
control inputs can be generated at each time step. We also prove that this
algorithm is recursively feasible. We illustrate the proposed methods for both
finite and infinite systems and highlight the generality and online scalability
with two simulated examples.

challenges posed by the satellite and aerial imagery, and demonstrates its
effectiveness on the built-up region segmentation problem. Built-up area
estimation is an important component in understanding the human impact on the
environment, the effect of public policy, and general urban population
analysis. The diverse nature of aerial and satellite imagery and lack of
labeled data covering this diversity makes machine learning algorithms
difficult to generalize for such tasks, especially across multiple domains. On
the other hand, due to the lack of strong spatial context and structure, in
comparison to the ground imagery, the application of existing unsupervised
domain adaptation methods results in the sub-optimal adaptation. We thoroughly
study the limitations of existing domain adaptation methods and propose a
weakly-supervised adaptation strategy where we assume image-level labels are
available for the target domain. More specifically, we design a built-up area
segmentation network (as encoder-decoder), with an image classification head
added to guide the adaptation. The devised system is able to address the
problem of visual differences in multiple satellite and aerial imagery
datasets, ranging from high resolution (HR) to very high resolution (VHR). A
realistic and challenging HR dataset is created by hand-tagging the 73.4 sq-km
of Rwanda, capturing a variety of build-up structures over different terrain.
The developed dataset is spatially rich compared to existing datasets and
covers diverse built-up scenarios including built-up areas in forests and
deserts, mud houses, tin, and colored rooftops. Extensive experiments are
performed by adapting from the single-source domain, to segment out the target
domain. We achieve high gains ranging 11.6%-52% in IoU over the existing
state-of-the-art methods.

instance of the tiling problem. Namely, we seek a non-periodic tiling of an
arbitrary 2D shape using one or more types of tiles: the tiles maximally fill
the shape's interior without overlaps or holes. To start, we reformulate tiling
as a graph problem by modeling candidate tile locations in the target shape as
graph nodes and connectivity between tile locations as edges. Further, we build
a graph convolutional neural network, coined TilinGNN, to progressively
propagate and aggregate features over graph edges and predict tile placements.
TilinGNN is trained by maximizing the tiling coverage on target shapes, while
avoiding overlaps and holes between the tiles. Importantly, our network is
self-supervised, as we articulate these criteria as loss terms defined on the
network outputs, without the need of ground-truth tiling solutions. After
training, the runtime of TilinGNN is roughly linear to the number of candidate
tile locations, significantly outperforming traditional combinatorial search.
We conducted various experiments on a variety of shapes to showcase the speed
and versatility of TilinGNN. We also present comparisons to alternative methods
and manual solutions, robustness analysis, and ablation studies to demonstrate
the quality of our approach.

For the single NG junction, the profile of the maximum transmission which has

similarity to that of the conductance of the system. The minor effect of the
incidence energy on transmission can also be found in conductance of the single
NG junction whose tunneling behavior poses a striking difference from that of
the NGN junction. Concerning with NGN junction, the transmission and
conductance show more abundant structures when subjected to different incidence
energies, interface hopping, and strain strengths. The increase of strain
strength always induces more resonance peaks at different angles in
transmission and can therefore enhance the conductance. The increase of length
of the middle graphene segment can accommodate more quasi-resonance states,
leading to the more resonance peaks and richer structures in transmission. In
both single NG and NGN junctions, the increase of the wavefunction period on
metal side(s) can be observed due to the enhancement of strain strength, which
can serve as the sensor for the detection of the strain strength in graphene.

underlying peer-to-peer network to send and receive transactions. It is
critical that a client is connected to at least one honest peer, as otherwise
the client can be convinced to accept a maliciously forked view of the
blockchain. In such an eclipse attack, the client is unable to reliably
distinguish the canonical view of the blockchain from the view provided by the
attacker. The consequences of this can be catastrophic if the client makes
business decisions based on a distorted view of the blockchain transactions. In
this paper, we investigate the design space and propose two approaches for
Bitcoin clients to detect whether an eclipse attack against them is ongoing.
Each approach chooses a different trade-off between average attack detection
time and network load. The first scheme is based on the detection of suspicious
block timestamps. The second scheme allows blockchain clients to utilize their
natural connections to the Internet (i.e., standard web activity) to gossip
about their blockchain views with contacted servers and their other clients.
Our proposals improve upon previously proposed eclipse attack countermeasures
without introducing any dedicated infrastructure or changes to the Bitcoin
protocol and network, and we discuss an implementation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the gossip-based schemes through rigorous analysis using
original Internet traffic traces and real-world deployment. The results

relations derived from the so-called ""quasi-static"" gyrokinetic linear theory
where the fields are assumed to propagate with a parallel phase velocity much
smaller than the parallel particle thermal velocities. The main properties of
this model, primarily aimed at exploring basic phenomena of interest for space
plasmas such as the solar wind, are its ability to provide a reasonable
agreement with kinetic theory for linear low-frequency modes, and at the same
time to ensure a Hamiltonian structure in the absence of explicit dissipation.
The model accounts for equilibrium temperature anisotropy, ion and electron
finite Larmor radius corrections, electron inertia, magnetic fluctuations along
the direction of a strong guide field, and parallel Landau damping. Remarkably,
the quasi-static closure leads to exact expressions for the nonlinear terms
involving gyroaveraged electromagnetic perturbations. One of the consequences
is that a rather natural identification of the Hamiltonian structure of the
model becomes possible when Landau damping is neglected. A slight variant of
the model consists of a four-field Hamiltonian reduction of the original
six-field model, which we use for the subsequent linear analysis. In the
latter, the dispersion relations of kinetic Alfv\'en waves and the firehose
instability are shown to be correctly reproduced, relatively far in the sub-ion
range (depending on the plasma parameters), while the spectral range where the
slow-wave dispersion relation and the field-swelling instabilities are
precisely described is less extended. This loss of accuracy originates from the
breaking of the condition of small phase velocity, relative to the parallel
thermal velocity of the electrons (for kinetic Alfv\'en waves and firehose
instability) or of the ions (in the case of the field-swelling instabilities).

even l, the other for odd l. This improves the solutions accuracy with respect

non-directional ion migration, as was confirmed by large-scale device

adoption in 42 embedded operating systems, showing the embedded world to
significantly lag behind the general-purpose world. To improve the security of
deeply embedded systems, we subsequently present {\mu}Armor, an approach to
address some of the key gaps identified in our quantitative analysis.
{\mu}Armor raises the bar for exploitation of embedded memory corruption

  Programming","Published in 4th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy
  (EuroS&P'19)",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The wide-spread adoption of system defenses such as the randomization of
code, stack, and heap raises the bar for code-reuse attacks. Thus, attackers
utilize a scripting engine in target programs like a web browser to prepare the
code-reuse chain, e.g., relocate gadget addresses or perform a just-in-time
gadget search. However, many types of programs do not provide such an execution
context that an attacker can use. Recent advances in data-oriented programming
(DOP) explored an orthogonal way to abuse memory corruption vulnerabilities and
demonstrated that an attacker can achieve Turing-complete computations without
modifying code pointers in applications. As of now, constructing DOP exploits
requires a lot of manual work.
  In this paper, we present novel techniques to automate the process of
generating DOP exploits. We implemented a compiler called Steroids that
compiles our high-level language SLANG into low-level DOP data structures
driving malicious computations at run time. This enables an attacker to specify
her intent in an application- and vulnerability-independent manner to maximize
reusability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques and prototype
implementation by specifying four programs of varying complexity in SLANG that
calculate the Levenshtein distance, traverse a pointer chain to steal a private
key, relocate a ROP chain, and perform a JIT-ROP attack. Steroids compiles each
of those programs to low-level DOP data structures targeted at five different
applications including GStreamer, Wireshark, and ProFTPd, which have vastly
different vulnerabilities and DOP instances. Ultimately, this shows that our
compiler is versatile, can be used for both 32- and 64-bit applications, works
across bug classes, and enables highly expressive attacks without conventional
code-injection or code-reuse techniques in applications lacking a scripting
engine.

motion, which are derived directly from the gravitational action, form a system
of differential equations with respect to Hubble's parameter and the inflaton

minimal coupling case. In this paper, we present a variety of different
approximations which could be used, along with the constraint $c_T^2=1$, in
order to produce an inflationary phenomenology compatible with recent

approaches contain different approximations which must be obeyed during the
first horizon crossing, in order for the model to be rendered correct. Models
which may lead to a non-viable phenomenology are presented as well in order to

unpredictability: as compilers are tailored to operate fast, costly
interprocedural analysis procedures are not used in practice to detect such

memory reads remain undiscovered in binary code. Recent vulnerability reports
show the versatility on how uninitialized memory reads are utilized in

of FL, the clients update local models based on their own data and upload their
local updates via wireless channels. However, latency caused by hundreds to
thousands of communication rounds remains a bottleneck in FL. To minimize the
training latency, this work provides a multi-armed bandit-based framework for
online client scheduling (CS) in FL without knowing wireless channel state
information and statistical characteristics of clients. Firstly, we propose a
CS algorithm based on the upper confidence bound policy (CS-UCB) for ideal
scenarios where local datasets of clients are independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) and balanced. An upper bound of the expected performance
regret of the proposed CS-UCB algorithm is provided, which indicates that the
regret grows logarithmically over communication rounds. Then, to address
non-ideal scenarios with non-i.i.d. and unbalanced properties of local datasets
and varying availability of clients, we further propose a CS algorithm based on
the UCB policy and virtual queue technique (CS-UCB-Q). An upper bound is also
derived, which shows that the expected performance regret of the proposed
CS-UCB-Q algorithm can have a sub-linear growth over communication rounds under
certain conditions. Besides, the convergence performance of FL training is also
analyzed. Finally, simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed

a method to improve the computational performance of orbit propagators through
an efficient numerical integration that meets the accuracy requirements set by
the specific application. This is achieved by appropriately tuning the
parameters of the numerical propagator (relative tolerance and maximum time
step), establishing a threshold for the perturbing accelerations (Earth's
gravitational potential, atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, third-body
perturbations, relativistic correction to gravity) below which they can be
neglected without altering the quality of the results and implementing an
efficient and precise algorithm for the harmonic synthesis of the geo-potential
and its first-order gradient. In particular, when performing the harmonic
synthesis, the number of spherical harmonics to retain (i.e., the expansion
degree) is determined by the accuracy requirement. Given that higher-order
harmonics decay rapidly with altitude, the expansion degree necessary to meet
the target accuracy decreases with height. To improve the computational
efficiency, the number of degrees to retain is determined dynamically while the
trajectory is being computed. The optimum expansion degree for each altitude is
determined by ensuring that the truncation error of the harmonic synthesis is
below the threshold acceleration. The work is a generalization to arbitrary
orbits of a previous study that focused on communication satellites in
geosynchronous inclined orbits. The method is presented and a set of test cases

which have become one of the major public health concerns during this severe

issues according to the findings made by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health
problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs
included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19
pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on
multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multi-modal
features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific
perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter
users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel
classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities which may
be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The
results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19.
The measures implemented by the government such as the state lockdown also
increased depression levels. Further analysis in the Local Government Area

different LGAs. Such granular level analysis of depression dynamics not only
can help authorities such as governmental departments to take corresponding

at first sight, but the comprehensive evaluation of bug-finding techniques
suffers from a lack of ground truth and the scarcity of bugs.
  In this paper, we propose EvilCoder, a system to automatically find
potentially vulnerable source code locations and modify the source code to be
actually vulnerable. More specifically, we leverage automated program analysis
techniques to find sensitive sinks which match typical bug patterns (e.g., a
sensitive API function with a preceding sanity check), and try to find
data-flow connections to user-controlled sources. We then transform the source
code such that exploitation becomes possible, for example by removing or
modifying input sanitization or other types of security checks. Our tool is
designed to randomly pick vulnerable locations and possible modifications, such
that it can generate numerous different vulnerabilities on the same software
corpus. We evaluated our tool on several open-source projects such as for
example libpng and vsftpd, where we found between 22 and 158 unique connected
source-sink pairs per project. This translates to hundreds of potentially
vulnerable data-flow paths and hundreds of bugs we can insert. We hope to
support future bug-finding techniques by supplying freshly generated,
bug-ridden test corpora so that such techniques can (finally) be evaluated and
compared in a comprehensive and statistically meaningful way.

which are designed for a specific type of channel, our most general universal
code makes communication resilient on every channel, provided the noise level
is below the tolerated bound, where the noise level t of a channel is the
logarithm of its ambiguity (the maximum number of strings that can be distorted
into a given one). The other more restricted universal codes still work for
large classes of natural channels. In a universal code, encoding is
channel-independent, but the decoding function knows the type of channel. We
allow the encoding and the decoding functions to share randomness, which is
unavailable to the channel. There are two scenarios for the type of attack that
a channel can perform. In the oblivious scenario, codewords belong to an
additive group and the channel distorts a codeword by adding a vector from a
fixed set. The selection is based on the message and the encoding function, but
not on the codeword. In the Hamming scenario, the channel knows the codeword
and is fully adversarial. For a universal code, there are two parameters of
interest: the rate, which is the ratio between the message length k and the
codeword length n, and the number of shared random bits. We show the existence
in both scenarios of universal codes with rate 1-t/n - o(1), which is optimal
modulo the o(1) term. The number of shared random bits is O(log n) in the
oblivious scenario, and O(n) in the Hamming scenario, which, for typical values
of the noise level, we show to be optimal, modulo the constant hidden in the
O() notation. In both scenarios, the universal encoding is done in time
polynomial in n, but the channel-dependent decoding procedures are in general
not efficient. For some weaker classes of channels we construct universal codes
with polynomial-time encoding and decoding.

The key to the success of precise user targeting lies in learning the accurate

studies have suggested hyperbolic manifold learning for the distinct projection
of complex network properties emerging from real-world datasets such as social

set as the centroid of each user cluster. The user preference for each ad is
estimated using the distance between two entities in the hyperbolic space, and
the final prediction is determined by aggregating the values calculated from

the local Hardy space and the inhomogeneous Lipschitz space on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
In this article, applying the inhomogeneous renormalization of wavelets, the
authors establish a bilinear decomposition for multiplications of elements in
$h^p(\mathbb R^n)$ [or $H^p(\mathbb R^n)$] and
$\Lambda_{n\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and prove that these bilinear decompositions
are sharp in some sense. As applications, the authors also obtain some
estimates of the product of elements in the local Hardy space $h^p(\mathbb

n\alpha\rfloor$-inhomogeneous curl and zero divergence, where $\lfloor
n\alpha\rfloor$ denotes the largest integer not greater than $n\alpha$.
Moreover, the authors find new structures of $h^{\Phi_p}(\mathbb R^n)$ and
$H^{\Phi_p}(\mathbb R^n)$ by showing that $h^{\Phi_p}(\mathbb R^n)=h^1(\mathbb
R^n)+h^p(\mathbb R^n)$ and $H^{\Phi_p}(\mathbb R^n)=H^1(\mathbb

dual spaces of both $h^{\Phi_p}(\mathbb R^n)$ and $h^p(\mathbb R^n)$ coincide.
These results give a complete picture on the multiplication between the local

follow Rouse scaling D {\ alpha} c^(-0.54) for c < 0.8, resembling unentangled

matrix slows down probe diffusion 3-7 times, with heterogeneous dynamics. With
addition of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in PEG matrix, probe diffusion is
homogeneous with negligibly small enhancement in diffusion time. The macroscale
storage modulii for PEG, PEG+B, and PEG + CMC solutions scale as viscous
fluid-like, followed by short elastic plateau. Beyond the elastic plateau, the
scaling is a concentration-dependent power law greater than the Rouse scaling

intermolecular interactions in PEG, such that for {\omega}>{\tau}_b^(-1) ,
Rouse scaling is recovered. Addition of CMC to PEG also restores Rouse scaling.
Addition of B gives contributions from both polymer matrix and network of B

unified framework for sensitivity analysis to censoring at random in survival
data using multiple imputation and martingale, called SMIM. The proposed
framework adopts the \delta-adjusted and control-based models, indexed by the
sensitivity parameter, entailing censoring at random and a wide collection of
censoring not at random assumptions. Also, it targets for a broad class of
treatment effect estimands defined as functionals of treatment-specific
survival functions, taking into account of missing data due to censoring.
Multiple imputation facilitates the use of simple full-sample estimation;
however, the standard Rubin's combining rule may overestimate the variance for
inference in the sensitivity analysis framework. We decompose the multiple
imputation estimator into a martingale series based on the sequential
construction of the estimator and propose the wild bootstrap inference by
resampling the martingale series. The new bootstrap inference has a theoretical
guarantee for consistency and is computationally efficient compared to the
non-parametric bootstrap counterpart. We evaluate the finite-sample performance
of the proposed SMIM through simulation and an application on a HIV clinical
trial.

time between collision events. Our study focuses on the density of spreading
particles all starting from a common origin, which is limited by a `light' cone
$-v_0 t<x<v_0 t$. In particular we study this density close to its maximum in
the vicinity of the `light' cone. The spreading density follows the
Lamperti-arcsine law describing typical fluctuations far from the `light' cone.
However this law blows up in the vicinity of the `light' cone horizon which is
nonphysical, in the sense that any finite time observation will never diverge.
We claim that one can find two laws for the spatial density, the first one is
the mentioned Lamperti-arcsine law describing the central part of the
distribution and the second is an infinite density illustrating the dynamics
for large $x$. We identify the relationship between a large position and the
longest traveling time describing the single big jump principle. From the
renewal theory we find that the distribution of rare events of the position is
related to the derivative of the average of the number of renewals at a short
`time' using a rate formalism.

pipeline of word embedding for unsegmentated language while avoiding

in the embedding vocabulary that do not have strong association strength
between characters would limit the quality of learned word embedding. To deal
with this problem, a new version of segmentation-free word embedding model is
proposed by collecting n-grams vocabulary via a novel unsupervised association
measure called pointwise association with times information(PATI). Comparing
with the commonly used n-gram filtering method like frequency used in sembei
and pointwise mutual information(PMI), the proposed method leverages more
latent information from the corpus and thus is able to collect more valid
n-grams that have stronger cohesion as embedding targets in unsegmented
language data, such as Chinese texts. Further experiments on Chinese SNS data
show that the proposed model improves performance of word embedding in
downstream tasks.

crafted at training time. A backdoor attack installs a backdoor into the victim
model by injecting a backdoor pattern into a small proportion of the training

consistently predicts a specific (likely incorrect) target class whenever the
backdoor pattern is present in a test example. While existing backdoor attacks
are effective, they are not stealthy. The modifications made on training data

filtering or human inspection. In this paper, we present a new type of backdoor
attack inspired by an important natural phenomenon: reflection. Using
mathematical modeling of physical reflection models, we propose reflection
backdoor (Refool) to plant reflections as backdoor into a victim model. We

properties are required in many diverse applications such as sensing, and
stealth technologies. Here, a novel 3D reconfigurable metamaterial absorber
(MMA) consisting of honeycomb and VO2 films is proposed. The proposed MMA
exhibits a strong absorptivity above 90\% in the widest incident angle up to
$87^\circ$ for TM- and TE- polarized oblique incidences for THz wave
propagating in yoz-plane. According to simulation results, under normal
incidence, when VO2 films are in the insulating state, the proposed absorber
exhibits high absorptivity in the frequency band of 1-4 THz. By increasing the
temperature of the whole structure, the structural transformation of VO2 occurs
and turns into the metallic phase. We have shown that under oblique incidence,
the ohmic losses of VO2 films especially those parallel to the direction of the
incident electric field are the most important absorption principles of the
proposed MMA. Furthermore, to understand the physical mechanism of absorption,
the induced electric field as well as the power loss density of the proposed
structure are investigated. In addition, it is shown that the presented VO2
based honeycomb absorber retains its full-coverage incident angle
characteristics for TM-polarized incidences propagating in the xoz-plane. Due
to the ultra wide-angle absorption (angular stability) and mechanical
performance, it is expected that the presented MMA may find potential
applications, such as camouflage technologies, electromagnetic interference,
imaging, and sensing. To the best knowledge of authors, the proposed MMA
configuration exhibits the absorptivity in the widest incident angle ever
reported.

bottom-up object detection method. Inspired by the Generalized Hough Transform,
HoughNet determines the presence of an object at a certain location by the sum
of the votes cast on that location. Votes are collected from both near and
long-distance locations based on a log-polar vote field. Thanks to this voting
mechanism, HoughNet is able to integrate both near and long-range,
class-conditional evidence for visual recognition, thereby generalizing and
enhancing current object detection methodology, which typically relies on only
local evidence. On the COCO dataset, HoughNet's best model achieves 46.4 $AP$
(and 65.1 $AP_{50}$), performing on par with the state-of-the-art in bottom-up
object detection and outperforming most major one-stage and two-stage methods.
We further validate the effectiveness of our proposal in another task, namely,
""labels to photo"" image generation by integrating the voting module of HoughNet
to two different GAN models and showing that the accuracy is significantly
improved in both cases. Code is available at

paper, we introduce a molecular based flow velocity meter consisting of a
molecule releasing node and a receiver that counts these molecules. We consider
both flow velocity detection and estimation problems, which are employed in
different applications. For the flow velocity detection, we obtain the maximum
a posteriori (MAP) decision rule. To analyze the performance of the proposed
flow velocity detector, we obtain the error probability, its Gaussian
approximation and Chernoff information (CI) upper bound, and investigate the
optimum and sub-optimum sampling times accordingly. We show that, for binary
hypothesis, the sub-optimum sampling times using CI upper bound are the same.
Further, the sub-optimum sampling times are close to the optimum sampling
times. For the flow velocity estimation, we obtain the MAP and minimum mean
square error (MMSE) estimators. We consider the mean square error (MSE) to
investigate the error performance of the flow velocity estimators and obtain
the Bayesian Cramer-Rao (BCR) and expected Cramer-Rao (ECR) lower bounds.
Further, we obtain the optimum sampling times for each estimator. It is seen
that the optimum sampling times for each estimator are nearly the same. The
proposed flow velocity meter can be used to design a new modulation technique
in molecular communication (MC), where information is encoded in the flow
velocity of the medium instead of the concentration, type, or release time of
the molecules. The setup and performance analysis of the proposed flow velocity

assist surgeons during knee arthroscopy in terms of situational awareness.
However, due to poor imaging conditions (e.g., low texture, overexposure,

justifies the scarce literature on this topic. In this paper, we propose a
novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation to regularise the training of
the semantic segmentation in knee arthroscopy. To further regularise the depth
estimation, we propose the use of clean training images captured by the stereo
arthroscope of routine objects (presenting none of the poor imaging conditions
and with rich texture information) to pre-train the model. We fine-tune such
model to produce both the semantic segmentation and self-supervised monocular
depth using stereo arthroscopic images taken from inside the knee. Using a data
set containing 3868 arthroscopic images captured during cadaveric knee
arthroscopy with semantic segmentation annotations, 2000 stereo image pairs of
cadaveric knee arthroscopy, and 2150 stereo image pairs of routine objects, we
show that our semantic segmentation regularised by self-supervised depth
estimation produces a more accurate segmentation than a state-of-the-art
semantic segmentation approach modeled exclusively with semantic segmentation
annotation.

function, however, is only concave over a finite region including the feasible
region. To cope with this issue, we employ the inner approximation optimization
algorithm which only operates within the region where the objective function is

can handle the situation where there is no prior information about the values

is guaranteed to be robust. Moreover, its most computationally expensive
subroutine is a linear assignment problem which can be efficiently solved.
Experimental results demonstrate the better robustness of the proposed method

Swampland criteria are used and, only later, the results of the fit are

Bayesian Learning approach is applied to two models and the results are
validated by means of available $H(z)$ data. For the first model, a
parametrization of the Hubble constant is considered and, for the second, a
parametrization of the deceleration parameter. This study is motivated by a
recent work, where constraints on string Swampland criteria have been obtained
from a Gaussian Process and $H(z)$ data. However, the results obtained here are
fully independent of the observational data and allow to estimate how the
high-redshift behavior of the Universe will affect the low-redshift one.
Moreover, both parameterizations in the generative process, for the Hubble and
for the deceleration parameters, are independent of the dark energy model. The
outcome, both data- and dark energy model-independent, may highlight, in the
future, the borders of the Swampland for the low-redshift Universe and help to
develop new string-theory motivated dark-energy models. The string Swampland
criteria considered might be in tension with recent observations indicating
that phantom dark energy cannot be in the Swampland. Finally, a spontaneous

corruption attack that bypasses various forms of code randomization.
Execute-only memory (XOM) can potentially prevent these attacks, but requires
source code. In contrast, destructive code reads (DCR) provide a trade-off
between security and legacy compatibility. The common belief is that DCR
provides strong protection if combined with a high-entropy code randomization.
  The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, we demonstrate that DCR can
be bypassed regardless of the underlying code randomization scheme. To this
end, we show novel, generic attacks that infer the code layout for highly
randomized program code. Second, we present the design and implementation of
BGDX (Byte-Granular DCR and XOM), a novel mitigation technique that protects
legacy binaries against code inference attacks. BGDX enforces memory
permissions on a byte-granular level allowing us to combine DCR and XOM for
legacy, off-the-shelf binaries. Our evaluation shows that BGDX is not only
effective, but highly efficient, imposing only a geometric mean performance

institutions from across the world have been discussing ways and means to make
online education effective, via various means, such as webinars, talks and
short workshops. However, a general observation has been that there is a lack
of data on online education, particularly in the Indian context. Anticipating
this, we decided to conduct a pan-IIT survey on online education and compiled
two sets of questionnaires (one each for faculty members and students) in
discussion with the members of the pan-IIT group on Online Pedagogy
(https://www.paniit-onlinepedagogy-researchgroup.net/), that has been formed
for conducting research on the broad area of online education. The current
survey has been steered by IIT Dharwad and IIT Jammu along with the members of
the pan-IIT group on online pedagogy. The survey data was collected from 5th
May 2020 to 25th May 2020. We received about 11,890 and 840 responses from
students and faculty members, respectively. About 82% and 86% of the

the following, we present and discuss the survey responses pertaining to
various aspects of online education. An infographic representation of the

change, have triggered massive and precipitous changes in human mobility. The
ability to quickly predict traffic patterns in different scenarios has become
more urgent to support short-term operations and long-term transportation
planning. This requires modeling entire metropolitan areas to recognize the
upstream and downstream effects on the network. However, there is a well-known
trade-off between increasing the level of detail of a model and decreasing
computational performance. To achieve the level of detail required for traffic
microsimulation, current implementations often compromise by simulating small
spatial scales, and those that operate at larger scales often require access to
expensive high-performance computing systems or have computation times on the
order of days or weeks that discourage productive research and real-time
planning. This paper addresses the performance shortcomings by introducing a
new platform, MANTA (Microsimulation Analysis for Network Traffic Assignment),
for traffic microsimulation at the metropolitan-scale. MANTA employs a highly
parallelized GPU implementation that is capable of running metropolitan-scale
simulations within a few minutes. The runtime to simulate all morning trips,
using half-second timesteps, for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area is just
over four minutes, not including routing and initialization. This computational
performance significantly improves the state of the art in large-scale traffic
microsimulation. MANTA expands the capacity to analyze detailed travel patterns

(RMAB) setting in which each arm follows a binary-state Markovian process with
a special structure: when an arm is played, the state is fully observed, thus
""collapsing"" any uncertainty, but when an arm is passive, no observation is
made, thus allowing uncertainty to evolve. The goal is to keep as many arms in
the ""good"" state as possible by planning a limited budget of actions per round.
Such Collapsing Bandits are natural models for many healthcare domains in which
workers must simultaneously monitor patients and deliver interventions in a way
that maximizes the health of their patient cohort. Our main contributions are
as follows: (i) Building on the Whittle index technique for RMABs, we derive
conditions under which the Collapsing Bandits problem is indexable. Our
derivation hinges on novel conditions that characterize when the optimal
policies may take the form of either ""forward"" or ""reverse"" threshold policies.
(ii) We exploit the optimality of threshold policies to build fast algorithms
for computing the Whittle index, including a closed-form. (iii) We evaluate our
algorithm on several data distributions including data from a real-world
healthcare task in which a worker must monitor and deliver interventions to
maximize their patients' adherence to tuberculosis medication. Our algorithm
achieves a 3-order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art RMAB
techniques while achieving similar performance.

transfer (SWIPT) is presented as a means of not only helping to communicate and
access information with increasing efficiency in the next generation of mobile
data networks but also contributing to minimizing a network's overall power
consumption by providing a green energy source. First, a unique architecture is
proposed that harvests energy from an access point (AP) without the receiver
needing a splitter. In the proposed system model, a portion of the spectrum is
used for information decoding (ID) while the remaining portion is exploited for
energy harvesting (EH) in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) network. To investigate the performance gain, an optimization problem
is formulated that maximizes the harvested energy of a multi-user single-cell
OFDMA downlink (DL) network with SWIPT and also satisfies a minimum data-rate
requirement for all users. A locally optimal solution for the underlying
problem, which is essentially non-convex due to the coupling of the integer
variable, is obtained by using optimization tools. Second, the proposed system
model is improved in order to investigate the resource allocation problem of
needing to maximize throughput based on the separated receiver architecture in
an OFDMA multi-user multi-cell system that uses SWIPT. The resulting problem,
which jointly optimizes the subcarrier assignment and power allocation, is a
mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) that is difficult to solve. Third, a
state-of-the-art harvesting technique at the receiver that is based on receiver
antenna selection with a co-located architecture is explored to optimize the

the absence of direct statistically based measurement of infection rates. By
examining the death rates of Canada in general and Quebec, Ontario and Alberta
in particular, one can easily figured out that there are substantial
overdispersion relative to the Poisson so that the negative binomial
distribution is an appropriate choice for the analysis. Generalized additive
models (GAMs) are one of the main modeling tools for data analysis. GAMs can
efficiently combine different types of fixed, random and smooth terms in the
linear predictor of a regression model to account for different types of
effects. GAMs are a semi-parametric extension of the generalized linear models
(GLMs), used often for the case when there is no a priori reason for choosing a
particular response function such as linear, quadratic, etc. and need the data
to 'speak for themselves'. GAMs do this via the smoothing functions and take
each predictor variable in the model and separate it into sections delimited by
'knots', and then fit polynomial functions to each section separately, with the
constraint that there are no links at the knots - second derivatives of the
separate functions are equal at the knots.
