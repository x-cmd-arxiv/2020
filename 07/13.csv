focus on diffuse optical tomography (DOT) in medical imaging to recover unknown
images of interest, such as cancerous tissue in a given medium, using a
mathematical (forward) model. The forward model in DOT is a
diffusion-absorption model for the photon flux. The main bottleneck in these
problems is the repeated evaluation of the large-scale forward model. For DOT,
this corresponds to solving large linear systems for each source and frequency
at each optimization step. Moreover, Newton-type methods, often the method of
choice, require additional linear solves with the adjoint to compute derivative
information. Emerging technology allows for large numbers of sources and
detectors, making these problems prohibitively expensive. Reduced order models
(ROM) have been used to drastically reduce the system size in each optimization
step, while solving the inverse problem accurately. However, for large numbers
of sources and detectors, just the construction of the candidate basis for the
ROM projection space incurs a substantial cost, as matching the full parameter
gradient matrix in interpolatory model reduction requires large linear solves
for all sources and frequencies and all detectors and frequencies for each
parameter interpolation point. As this candidate basis numerically has low
rank, this construction is followed by a rank-revealing factorization that
typically reduces the number of vectors in the candidate basis substantially.
We propose to use randomization to approximate this basis with a drastically
reduced number of large linear solves. We also provide a detailed analysis for
the low-rank structure of the candidate basis for our problem of interest. Even
though we focus on the DOT problem, the ideas presented are relevant to many
other large scale inverse problems and optimization problems.

previous methods, we use alteration along three orthogonal axes to pre-train
Transformer Encoders on a large amount of unlabeled speech. The model learns
through the reconstruction of acoustic frames from their altered counterpart,

extraction or fine-tuning with downstream models. We evaluate TERA on several
downstream tasks, including phoneme classification, keyword spotting, speaker

strong representation learners than larger models, while larger models are more
effective for downstream fine-tuning than smaller models. Furthermore, we show
the proposed method is transferable to downstream datasets not used in

diffusiophoretic flow, caused by a solutal concentration gradient along a
reacting surface. The important control parameter is the Peclet number Pe,
which quantifies the ratio of the solutal advection rate to the diffusion rate.
First, we study the diffusiophoretic flow on a catalytic plane in two
dimensions. From a linear stability analysis, we obtain that for Pe larger than
8pi, mass transport by convection overtakes that by diffusion, and a
symmetry-breaking mode arises, which is consistent with numerical results. For
even larger Pe, non-linear terms become important. For Pe larger than 16pi,
multiple concentration plumes are emitted from the catalytic plane, which
eventually merges into a single larger one. When Pe is even larger, there are
continuous emissions and merging events of the concentration plumes. This
newly-found flow state reflects the non-linear saturation of the system. The
critical Peclet number for the transition to this state depends on Schmidt
number Sc. In the second part of the paper, we conduct three-dimensional
simulations for spherical catalytic particles, and beyond a critical Peclet
number again find continuous plume emission and plume merging, now leading to
chaotic motion of the phoretic particle. Our results thus help to understand
the experimentally observed chaotic motion of catalytic particles in the high
Pe regime.

graph vertexes. The graph coloring determines the graph structure in clusters
of graph vertices (events) that can be monochromatic (homogeneous loops) or
polychromatic (inhomogeneous loops). The probability is conserved after the
graph conformal expansion from an initial seed graph state to higher
(conformally expanded) graph states. The emerging structure has self-similar
characteristics on different scales (states). From the coloring, different
levels of vertices and thus graph levels arise as new aggregates of colored
vertices. In this second (derived) graphs level, the derived graph vertices
correspond to the polychromatic edges (with differently colored vertices) of
the initial graph. Vertex aggregates are related, as some levels (graph states)
to plexors and twistors (involving Clifford statistics). Two metric levels are
defined on the colored graph, the first level is a natural metric defined on
the graph, the second level emerges from the first and related, due to
symmetries. Metric structure reflects the graph colored structure under
conformal transformations evolving with its states under conformal expansion.
In some special cases vertices/events chains could be related to strings
generalizations.

application. The proposed uVOC facilitates synchronization with an arbitrarily
low grid voltage and fast over-current limiting; this enables effective fault
ride-through unlike existing GFM controllers which typically switch to a
back-up controller during fault. GFM operation with uVOC is achieved in both
grid connected and islanded modes with seamless transition between the two. In
GFL converters, bidirectional power flow control and DC bus voltage regulation

the strong field-direction dependence of the impurity spin polarization and

convergence of $K$-regular and $K$-weak regular splittings, where $K$ is a
proper cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, the convergence theory of a two-stage
iteration scheme in general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature.
Especially, the same study for weak regular splittings of type II (even if in
standard proper cone setting, i.e., $K=\mathbb{R}^n_+$), is open. To this end,
we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme for $K$-weak
regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some
sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a
two-stage iterative scheme is a $K$-regular splitting and then establish some
comparison theorems. We also study $K$-monotone convergence theory of the
stationary two-stage iterative method in case of a $K$-weak regular splitting

dynamics during the protostellar collapse remains a poorly investigated field.
Recent studies seem to indicate that dust may decouple efficiently from the gas
during these early stages. We aim to understand how much and in which regions
dust grains concentrate during the early phases of the protostellar collapse,
and see how it depends on the properties of the initial cloud and of the solid
particles. We use the multiple species dust dynamics solver of the grid-based
code RAMSES to perform various simulations of dusty collapses. We perform
hydrodynamical and MHD simulations where we vary the maximum grain size, the
thermal-to-gravitational energy ratio and the magnetic properties of the cloud.
We simulate the simultaneous evolution of ten neutral dust grains species with
grain sizes varying from a few nm to a few hundredth of microns. We obtain a
significant decoupling between the gas and the dust for grains of typical sizes
a few 10 microns. This decoupling strongly depends on the
thermal-to-gravitational energy ratio, the grain sizes or the inclusion of a
magnetic field. With a semi-analytic model calibrated on our results, we show
that the dust ratio mostly varies exponentially with the initial Stokes number
at a rate that depends on the local cloud properties. We find that larger
grains tend to settle and drift efficiently in the first-core and in the newly
formed disk. This can produce dust-to-gas ratios of several times the initial
value. Dust concentrates in high density regions and is depleted in low density
regions. The size at which grains decouple from the gas depends on the initial
properties of the clouds. Since dust can not necessarily be used as a proxy for
gas during the collapse, we emphasize on the necessity of including the
treatment of its dynamics in collapse simulations.

While the gravitational-wave analysis of the LVC suggests that GW190814 likely

the heaviest neutron star observed to date. We use our previously derived
nuclear-physics-multimessenger astrophysics framework to address the nature of

that this observation has on our understanding of the nuclear equation of state
by analyzing the allowed region in the mass-radius diagram of neutron stars for
both a binary black hole or neutron star--black hole scenario. We find that the
unlikely scenario in which the secondary object was a neutron star requires
rather stiff equations of state with a maximum speed of sound $c_s\geq

  of WG 2020",,,,"math.CO cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A $k$-linear coloring of a graph $G$ is an edge coloring of $G$ with $k$
colors so that each color class forms a linear forest -- a forest whose each
connected component is a path. The linear arboricity $\chi_l'(G)$ of $G$ is the
minimum integer $k$ such that there exists a $k$-linear coloring of $G$.
Akiyama, Exoo and Harary conjectured in 1980 that for every graph $G$,
$\chi_l'(G)\leq \left \lceil \frac{\Delta(G)+1}{2}\right\rceil$ where
$\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of $G$. First, we prove the conjecture for
3-degenerate graphs. This establishes the conjecture for graphs of treewidth at
most 3 and provides an alternative proof for the conjecture in some classes of
graphs like cubic graphs and triangle-free planar graphs for which the
conjecture was already known to be true. Next, for every 2-degenerate graph
$G$, we show that $\chi'_l(G)=\left\lceil\frac{\Delta(G)}{2}\right\rceil$ if
$\Delta(G)\geq 5$. We conjecture that this equality holds also when
$\Delta(G)\in\{3,4\}$ and show that this is the case for some well-known
subclasses of 2-degenerate graphs. All our proofs can be converted into linear
time algorithms.

inner lining of the colon or rectum, called 'polyp'. Not all polyps are
cancerous, but some can develop into cancer. Early detection and recognition of
the type of polyps is critical to prevent cancer and change outcomes. However,
visual classification of polyps is challenging due to varying illumination
conditions of endoscopy, variant texture, appearance, and overlapping
morphology between polyps. More importantly, evaluation of polyp patterns by
gastroenterologists is subjective leading to a poor agreement among observers.
Deep convolutional neural networks have proven very successful in object
classification across various object categories. In this work, we compare the
performance of the state-of-the-art general object classification models for
polyp classification. We trained a total of six CNN models end-to-end using a

impairment can be useful for developing interventions to alleviate the motor
symptom, the major symptom of the disease. However, the effects from the brain
regions to motor impairment may vary for different groups of patients. Hence,
our interest is not only to identify the brain regions but also to understand
how their effects on motor impairment differ by patient groups. This can be
cast as a model selection problem for a varying-coefficient regression.
However, this is challenging when there is a pre-specified group structure
among variables. We propose a novel variable selection method for a
varying-coefficient regression with such structured variables. Our method is
empirically shown to select relevant variables consistently. Also, our method
screens irrelevant variables better than existing methods. Hence, our method
leads to a model with higher sensitivity, lower false discovery rate and higher
prediction accuracy than the existing methods. Finally, we found that the
effects from the brain regions to motor impairment differ by disease severity
of the patients. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to
identify such interaction effects between the disease severity and brain
regions, which indicates the need for customized intervention by disease

little is yet known about why these techniques work for machine learning. The
goal of this paper is to investigate entanglement properties of tensor network
models in a current machine learning application, in order to uncover general
principles that may guide future developments. We revisit the use of tensor
networks for supervised image classification using the MNIST data set of
handwritten digits, as pioneered by Stoudenmire and Schwab [Adv. in Neur.
Inform. Proc. Sys. 29, 4799 (2016)]. Firstly we hypothesize about which state
the tensor network might be learning during training. For that purpose, we
propose a plausible candidate state $|\Sigma_{\ell}\rangle$ (built as a
superposition of product states corresponding to images in the training set)
and investigate its entanglement properties. We conclude that
$|\Sigma_{\ell}\rangle$ is so robustly entangled that it cannot be approximated
by the tensor network used in that work, which must therefore be representing a
very different state. Secondly, we use tensor networks with a block product
structure, in which entanglement is restricted within small blocks of $n \times
n$ pixels/qubits. We find that these states are extremely expressive (e.g.
training accuracy of $99.97 \%$ already for $n=2$), suggesting that long-range
entanglement may not be essential for image classification. However, in our
current implementation, optimization leads to over-fitting, resulting in test
accuracies that are not competitive with other current approaches.

delocalization transition into a bad metal. Using a realistic multiorbital
Hubbard model as a prototype for narrow band moire systems, we realize such a
fragile insulator and demonstrate a nematic order in this state as well as in
the nearby bad metal regime. Our results are consistent with the observed
electronic anisotropy in the graphene moire systems and provide a natural
understanding of what happens when the insulator is tuned into a bad metal. We
propose the fragile insulator and the accompanying bad metal as competing
states at integer fillings that analogously anchor the overall phase diagram of
the correlated moire systems and beyond.

producing successful explosions and explosion-energy predictions. In general,
the explosion-energy evolution is monotonic and relatively smooth, suggesting a
possible analytic solution. We derive analytic solutions for the expansion of
the gain region under the following assumptions: spherical symmetry, one-zone
shell, and powered by neutrinos and $\alpha$ particle recombination. We
consider two hypotheses: I) explosion energy is powered by neutrinos and
$\alpha$ recombination, II) explosion energy is powered by neutrinos alone.
Under these assumptions, we derive the fundamental dimensionless parameters and
analytic scalings. For the neutrino-only hypothesis (II), the asymptotic
explosion energy scales as $E_{\infty} \approx 1.5 M_g v_0^2 \eta^{2/3}$, where
$M_g$ is the gain mass, $v_0$ is the free-fall velocity at the shock, and
$\eta$ is a ratio of the heating and dynamical time scales. Including both
neutrinos and recombination (hypothesis I), the asymptotic explosion energy is
$E_{\infty} \approx M_g v_0^2 (1.5\eta^{2/3} + \beta f(\rho_0))$, where $\beta$
is the dimensionless recombination parameter. We use Bayesian inference to fit
these analytic models to simulations. Both hypotheses fit the simulations of
the lowest progenitor masses that tend to explode spherically. The fits do not
prefer hypothesis I or II; however, prior investigations suggest that $\alpha$
recombination is important. As expected, neither hypothesis fits the
higher-mass simulations that exhibit aspherical explosions. In summary, this
explosion-energy theory is consistent with the spherical explosions of low
progenitor masses; the inconsistency with higher progenitor-mass simulations
suggests that a theory for them must include aspherical dynamics.

successfully applied abstract interpretation, primarily using the interval
abstract domain. In this paper, we study the theoretical power and limits of
the interval domain for neural-network verification.
  First, we introduce the interval universal approximation (IUA) theorem. IUA
shows that neural networks not only can approximate any continuous function $f$
(universal approximation) as we have known for decades, but we can find a
neural network, using any well-behaved activation function, whose interval
bounds are an arbitrarily close approximation of the set semantics of $f$ (the
result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs). We call this notion of
approximation interval approximation. Our theorem generalizes the recent result
of Baader et al. (2020) from ReLUs to a rich class of activation functions that
we call squashable functions. Additionally, the IUA theorem implies that we can
always construct provably robust neural networks under $\ell_\infty$-norm using
almost any practical activation function.
  Second, we study the computational complexity of constructing neural networks
that are amenable to precise interval analysis. This is a crucial question, as
our constructive proof of IUA is exponential in the size of the approximation
domain. We boil this question down to the problem of approximating the range of
a neural network with squashable activation functions. We show that the range
approximation problem (RA) is a $\Delta_2$-intermediate problem, which is
strictly harder than $\mathsf{NP}$-complete problems, assuming
$\mathsf{coNP}\not\subset \mathsf{NP}$. As a result, IUA is an inherently hard
problem: No matter what abstract domain or computational tools we consider to
achieve interval approximation, there is no efficient construction of such a
universal approximator.

These
singularities can be modeled by self-shrinkers, surfaces that shrink by
dilations under the flow. Singularities modeled on classical self-shrinkers,
namely spheres and cylinders, are stable under perturbations of the flow. In
contrast, singularities modeled on other self-shrinkers, such as the Angenent
torus, are unstable: perturbing the flow will generally change the kind of
singularity. One can measure the degree of instability by computing the Morse
index of the self-shrinker, viewed as a critical point of an appropriate
functional.
  In this paper, we present a numerical method for computing the index of
rotationally symmetric self-shrinkers. We apply this method to the Angenent
torus, the first known nontrivial example of a self-shrinker. We find that,
excluding dilations and translations, the index of the Angenent torus is $5$,
which is consistent with the lower bound of $3$ from the work of Liu and the
upper bound of $29$ from our earlier work. Also, we unexpectedly discover two
additional variations of the Angenent torus with eigenvalue $-1$.

scientific and industrial interest due to its capability of finding a neural
architecture with high accuracy for various artificial intelligence tasks such
as image classification or object detection. In particular, gradient-based NAS
approaches have become one of the more popular approaches thanks to their
computational efficiency during the search. However, these methods often
experience a mode collapse, where the quality of the found architectures is
poor due to the algorithm resorting to choosing a single operation type for the
entire network, or stagnating at a local minima for various datasets or search

  To address these defects, we present a differentiable variational
inference-based NAS method for searching sparse convolutional neural networks.
Our approach finds the optimal neural architecture by dropping out candidate
operations in an over-parameterised supergraph using variational dropout with
automatic relevance determination prior, which makes the algorithm gradually
remove unnecessary operations and connections without risking mode collapse.
The evaluation is conducted through searching two types of convolutional cells
that shape the neural network for classifying different image datasets. Our

characterized by tens of thousands of gene expression features. Due to the size
of the gene expression feature set machine learning methods are exposed to
noisy variables and complexity. Tumor types present heterogeneity and can be
subdivided in tumor subtypes. In many cases tumor data does not include tumor
subtype labeling thus unsupervised learning methods are necessary for tumor
subtype discovery. This work aims to learn meaningful and low dimensional
representations of tumor samples and find tumor subtype clusters while keeping
biological signatures without using tumor labels. The proposed method named
Latent Kernel Feature Selection (LKFS) is an unsupervised approach for gene
selection in tumor gene expression profiles. By using Autoencoders a low
dimensional and denoised latent space is learned as a target representation to
guide a Multiple Kernel Learning model that selects a subset of genes. By using
the selected genes a clustering method is used to group samples. In order to
evaluate the performance of the proposed unsupervised feature selection method
the obtained features and clusters are analyzed by clinical significance. The
proposed method has been applied on three tumor datasets which are Brain, Renal
and Lung, each one composed by two tumor subtypes. When compared with benchmark
unsupervised feature selection methods the results obtained by the proposed
method reveal lower redundancy in the selected features and a better clustering
performance.

value achievable by a gambler who sequentially observes random variables
$X_1,\dots,X_n$ and selects one of them is at least an $\alpha$ fraction of the
maximum value in the sequence. We obtain three distinct improvements for a
setting that was first studied by Correa et al. (EC, 2019) and is particularly
relevant to modern applications in algorithmic pricing. In this setting, the
random variables are i.i.d. from an unknown distribution and the gambler has
access to an additional $\beta n$ samples for some $\beta\geq 0$. We first give
improved lower bounds on $\alpha$ for a wide range of values of $\beta$;
specifically, $\alpha\geq(1+\beta)/e$ when $\beta\leq 1/(e-1)$, which is tight,
and $\alpha\geq 0.648$ when $\beta=1$, which improves on a bound of around
$0.635$ due to Correa et al. (SODA, 2020). Adding to their practical appeal,
specifically in the context of algorithmic pricing, we then show that the new
bounds can be obtained even in a streaming model of computation and thus in
situations where the use of relevant data is complicated by the sheer amount of
data available. We finally establish that the upper bound of $1/e$ for the case
without samples is robust to additional information about the distribution, and
applies also to sequences of i.i.d. random variables whose distribution is
itself drawn, according to a known distribution, from a finite set of known
candidate distributions. This implies a tight prophet inequality for
exchangeable sequences of random variables, answering a question of Hill and
Kertz (Contemporary Mathematics, 1992), but leaves open the possibility of
better guarantees when the number of candidate distributions is small, a
setting we believe is of strong interest to applications.

comparing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of high quality exfoliated TMD

in-plane strain redistribution is identified in our WSe2/WS2 moir\'e

narrow and highly localized K-point moir\'e flat band at the valence band edge

different energies that exhibit varying degrees of localization. Our
observations contradict previous simplified theoretical models but agree
quantitatively with ab initio simulations that fully capture the 3D structural

tunneling and rotational misalignment conspire to create a pair of low energy
flat band that have been found to host various correlated phenomena at partial
filling. Most work to date has focused on the zero magnetic field phase
diagram, with magnetic field (B) used as a probe of the B=0 band structure.
Here, we show that twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) in a B as low as 2T hosts a
cascade of ferromagnetic Chern insulators with Chern number |C|=1,2 and 3. We
argue that the emergence of the Chern insulators is driven by the interplay of
the moire superlattice with the B, which endow the flat bands with a
substructure of topologically nontrivial subbands characteristic of the
Hofstadter butterfly. The new phases can be accounted for in a Stoner picture
in which exchange interactions favor polarization into one or more spin- and
valley-isospin flavors; in contrast to conventional quantum Hall ferromagnets,
however, electrons polarize into between one and four copies of a single
Hofstadter subband with Chern number C=-1. In the case of the C=\pm3 insulators
in particular, B catalyzes a first order phase transition from the spin- and
valley-unpolarized B=0 state into the ferromagnetic state. Distinct from other
moire heterostructures, tBLG realizes the strong-lattice limit of the
Hofstadter problem and hosts Coulomb interactions that are comparable to the
full bandwidth W and are consequently much stronger than the width of the
individual Hofstadter subbands. In our experimental data, the dominance of
Coulomb interactions manifests through the appearance of Chern insulating
states with spontaneously broken superlattice symmetry at half filling of a
C=-2 subband. Our experiments show that that tBLG may be an ideal venue to
explore the strong interaction limit within partially filled Hofstadter bands.

dimensionality reduction that has been widely used for text mining, computer
vision, pattern discovery, and bioinformatics. In this paper, a framework
called ARkNLS (Alternating Rank-k Nonnegativity constrained Least Squares) is
proposed for computing NMF. First, a recursive formula for the solution of the
rank-k nonnegativity-constrained least squares (NLS) is established. This
recursive formula can be used to derive the closed-form solution for the Rank-k
NLS problem for any integer k $\ge$ 1. As a result, each subproblem for an
alternating rank-k nonnegative least squares framework can be obtained based on
this closed form solution. Assuming that all matrices involved in rank-k NLS in
the context of NMF computation are of full rank, two of the currently best NMF
algorithms HALS (hierarchical alternating least squares) and ANLS-BPP
(Alternating NLS based on Block Principal Pivoting) can be considered as
special cases of ARkNLS with k = 1 and k = r for rank r NMF, respectively. This
paper is then focused on the framework with k = 3, which leads to a new
algorithm for NMF via the closed-form solution of the rank-3 NLS problem.
Furthermore, a new strategy that efficiently overcomes the potential
singularity problem in rank-3 NLS within the context of NMF computation is also
presented. Extensive numerical comparisons using real and synthetic data sets
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides state-of-the-art performance
in terms of computational accuracy and cpu time.

we have witnessed significant progress in object detection in ground imagery,
but it is still in its infancy in airborne imagery, mostly due to the scarcity
of diverse and large-scale datasets. Despite being a useful tool for different
applications, current airborne datasets only partially reflect the challenges
of real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce EAGLE (oriEnted
vehicle detection using Aerial imaGery in real-worLd scEnarios), a large-scale
dataset for multi-class vehicle detection with object orientation information
in aerial imagery. It features high-resolution aerial images composed of
different real-world situations with a wide variety of camera sensor,
resolution, flight altitude, weather, illumination, haze, shadow, time, city,
country, occlusion, and camera angle. The annotation was done by airborne
imagery experts with small- and large-vehicle classes. EAGLE contains 215,986
instances annotated with oriented bounding boxes defined by four points and
orientation, making it by far the largest dataset to date in this task. It also
supports researches on the haze and shadow removal as well as super-resolution
and in-painting applications. We define three tasks: detection by (1)
horizontal bounding boxes, (2) rotated bounding boxes, and (3) oriented
bounding boxes. We carried out several experiments to evaluate several
state-of-the-art methods in object detection on our dataset to form a baseline.
Experiments show that the EAGLE dataset accurately reflects real-world
situations and correspondingly challenging applications.

structure learning from 2D images because they can bridge the gap between 3D
and 2D. To optimize 3D shape parameters, current renderers rely on pixel-wise
losses between rendered images of 3D reconstructions and ground truth images
from corresponding viewpoints. Hence they require interpolation of the
recovered 3D structure at each pixel, visibility handling, and optionally
evaluating a shading model. In contrast, here we propose a Differentiable
Renderer Without Rendering (DRWR) that omits these steps. DRWR only relies on a
simple but effective loss that evaluates how well the projections of
reconstructed 3D point clouds cover the ground truth object silhouette.
Specifically, DRWR employs a smooth silhouette loss to pull the projection of
each individual 3D point inside the object silhouette, and a structure-aware
repulsion loss to push each pair of projections that fall inside the silhouette
far away from each other. Although we omit surface interpolation, visibility
handling, and shading, our results demonstrate that DRWR achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies under widely used benchmarks, outperforming
previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, our
training times are significantly lower due to the simplicity of DRWR.

machine learning tasks. Because of its computational costs, there is a growing
interest in accelerating SGD on HPC resources like GPU clusters. However, the
performance of parallel SGD is still bottlenecked by the high communication
costs even with a fast connection among the machines. A simple approach to
alleviating this problem, used in many existing efforts, is to perform
communication every few iterations, using a constant averaging period. In this
paper, we show that the optimal averaging period in terms of convergence and
communication cost is not a constant, but instead varies over the course of the
execution. Specifically, we observe that reducing the variance of model
parameters among the computing nodes is critical to the convergence of periodic
parameter averaging SGD. Given a fixed communication budget, we show that it is
more beneficial to synchronize more frequently in early iterations to reduce
the initial large variance and synchronize less frequently in the later phase
of the training process. We propose a practical algorithm, named ADaptive
Periodic parameter averaging SGD (ADPSGD), to achieve a smaller overall
variance of model parameters, and thus better convergence compared with the
Constant Periodic parameter averaging SGD (CPSGD). We evaluate our method with
several image classification benchmarks and show that our ADPSGD indeed
achieves smaller training losses and higher test accuracies with smaller
communication compared with CPSGD. Compared with gradient-quantization SGD, we
show that our algorithm achieves faster convergence with only half of the
communication. Compared with full-communication SGD, our ADPSGD achieves 1:14x

speedups increase to 1:46x ~ 1:95x with a 10Gbps connection.

that by assembling two new facial image databases: 1) a racially balanced

improves the traditional classification methods significantly by integrating
various views optimally. Although most of the previous efforts have been
demonstrated the superiority of multi-view learning, it can be further improved
by comprehensively embedding more powerful cross-view interactive information
and a more reliable multi-view fusion strategy in intensive studies. To fulfill
this goal, we propose a novel multi-view learning framework to make the
multi-view classification better aimed at the above-mentioned two aspects. That
is, we seamlessly embed various intra-view information, cross-view
multi-dimension bilinear interactive information, and a new view ensemble
mechanism into a unified framework to make a decision via the optimization. In
particular, we train different deep neural networks to learn various intra-view
representations, and then dynamically learn multi-dimension bilinear
interactive information from different bilinear similarities via the bilinear
function between views. After that, we adaptively fuse the representations of
multiple views by flexibly tuning the parameters of the view-weight, which not
only avoids the trivial solution of weight but also provides a new way to
select a few discriminative views that are beneficial to make a decision for
the multi-view classification. Extensive experiments on six publicly available
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Distillation (KD) has been widely used for semi-supervised image
classification. However, adapting these methods for SSOD has the following
obstacles. (1) The teacher model serves a dual role as a teacher and a student,
such that the teacher predictions on unlabeled images may be very close to
those of student, which limits the upper-bound of the student. (2) The class
imbalance issue in SSOD hinders an efficient knowledge transfer from teacher to
student. To address these problems, we propose a novel method Temporal
Self-Ensembling Teacher (TSE-T) for SSOD. Differently from previous KD based
methods, we devise a temporally evolved teacher model. First, our teacher model
ensembles its temporal predictions for unlabeled images under stochastic
perturbations. Second, our teacher model ensembles its temporal model weights
with the student model weights by an exponential moving average (EMA) which
allows the teacher gradually learn from the student. These self-ensembling
strategies increase data and model diversity, thus improving teacher
predictions on unlabeled images. Finally, we use focal loss to formulate
consistency regularization term to handle the data imbalance problem, which is
a more efficient manner to utilize the useful information from unlabeled images
than a simple hard-thresholding method which solely preserves confident
predictions. Evaluated on the widely used VOC and COCO benchmarks, the mAP of
our method has achieved 80.73% and 40.52% on the VOC2007 test set and the
COCO2014 minval5k set respectively, which outperforms a strong fully-supervised

state-of-the-art in SSOD on VOC2007 test set which outperforms the baseline

quantum dot subject to an applied electric field. The electromagnetic response
of the topological insulator is derived from axion electrodynamics in the
quasistatic approximation. Localized modes are quantized in terms of dipolar
bosonic modes, which couples dipolarly to the quantum dot. Hence, we treat the
hybrid as a two-level system interacting with a single bosonic mode, where the
coupling strength encodes the information concerning the nontrivial topology of
the nanoparticle. The interaction of the hybrid with the environment is
implemented through the coupling with a continuum reservoir of radiative output
modes and a reservoir of phonon modes. In particular, we use the method of
Zubarev's Green functions to derive an expression for the optical absorption
spectrum of the system. We apply our results to a realistic system which
consists of a topological insulator nanoparticle made of TlBiSe$_{2}$

exhibits Fano resonances with a line shape that strongly depends on the

applied to nontopological magnetoelectric materials such as Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$.

people in an image, which lacks low-level fine-grained information of the
crowd. For many practical applications, the total number of people in an image
is not as useful as the number of people in each sub-category. E.g., knowing
the number of people waiting inline or browsing can help retail stores; knowing
the number of people standing/sitting can help restaurants/cafeterias; knowing
the number of violent/non-violent people can help police in crowd management.
In this paper, we propose fine-grained crowd counting, which differentiates a
crowd into categories based on the low-level behavior attributes of the
individuals (e.g. standing/sitting or violent behavior) and then counts the
number of people in each category. To enable research in this area, we
construct a new dataset of four real-world fine-grained counting tasks:
traveling direction on a sidewalk, standing or sitting, waiting in line or not,
and exhibiting violent behavior or not. Since the appearance features of
different crowd categories are similar, the challenge of fine-grained crowd
counting is to effectively utilize contextual information to distinguish
between categories. We propose a two branch architecture, consisting of a
density map estimation branch and a semantic segmentation branch. We propose
two refinement strategies for improving the predictions of the two branches.
First, to encode contextual information, we propose feature propagation guided
by the density map prediction, which eliminates the effect of background
features during propagation. Second, we propose a complementary attention model
to share information between the two branches. Experiment results confirm the
effectiveness of our method.

Inspired by a common flowchart based on the human decision-making process that
first narrows down the probable classes and then applies a ""rethinking"" process
for finer-level recognition, we propose an effective universal-to-specific
(U2S) framework for complex action recognition. The U2S framework is composed
of three subnetworks: a universal network, a category-specific network, and a
mask network. The universal network first learns universal feature
representations. The mask network then generates attention masks for confusing
classes through category regularization based on the output of the universal
network. The mask is further used to guide the category-specific network for
class-specific feature representations. The entire framework is optimized in an
end-to-end manner. Experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets, e.g., the
Something-Something, UCF101, and HMDB51 datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness
of the U2S framework; i.e., U2S can focus on discriminative spatiotemporal
regions for confusing categories. We further visualize the relationship between
different classes, showing that U2S indeed improves the discriminability of
learned features. Moreover, the proposed U2S model is a general framework and
may adopt any base recognition network.

(2D) materials is proposed in the present study. Simple charge neutral radical
functionalizations typically detach from the basal planes upon reduction. For
example, epoxy oxygens irreversibly detach from graphene when reduced by an
alkali metal. The radical anion functionalization of 2D materials results in a
stable reduced state that can reversibly be oxidized and has high ionic
conductivity due to the great mobility of the cations between the negatively
charged functional groups on the surface. Depending on the oxidation state of
these systems, a high concentration of hole states can also be realized
allowing for good electronic conductivity. These properties can further allow
for improved energy storage devices via transition metal free cathode active
species, solid electrolytes, electroconductive additives, separators, coatings
for metal anodes and heat conductors through a single material. One possible
realization of the above principles is the 2D salt An(BN)2OBX3, where A is an
alkali atom (Li, Na, etc; 0=<n=<2) or alkaline earth (Mg, etc; 0=<n=<1) and X
is a halide (typically F or Cl). This material can be derived from the basal
plane functionalization of hexagonal boron nitride, h-BN, with .OBX3^- radical
anions in the presence of the A cations. One potential source of .OBX3^-
radical anions is their recombined form, the [X3B-O-O-BX3]2- anion, which can
be found in the Lewis adduct of an AnO2 ionic peroxide with BX3:
An[X3B-O-O-BX3]. The individual radical anions can be obtained by thermally
splitting the O-O bond in the recombined anion. Transition metal free
all-solid-state batteries with Li, Na and Mg anodes, thermal stability and high

challenging, expensive, and time-consuming. More importantly, it is nearly
impossible to alter real data post-acquisition (e.g., change the illumination
of a room), making it very difficult to measure how specific properties of the
data affect performance. In this paper, we present AI Playground (AIP), an
open-source, Unreal Engine-based tool for generating and labeling virtual image
data. With AIP, it is trivial to capture the same image under different
conditions (e.g., fidelity, lighting, etc.) and with different ground truths
(e.g., depth or surface normal values). AIP is easily extendable and can be
used with or without code. To validate our proposed tool, we generated eight
datasets of otherwise identical but varying lighting and fidelity conditions.
We then trained deep neural networks to predict (1) depth values, (2) surface
normals, or (3) object labels and assessed each network's intra- and
cross-dataset performance. Among other insights, we verified that sensitivity
to different settings is problem-dependent. We confirmed the findings of other
studies that segmentation models are very sensitive to fidelity, but we also
found that they are just as sensitive to lighting. In contrast, depth and
normal estimation models seem to be less sensitive to fidelity or lighting and
more sensitive to the structure of the image. Finally, we tested our trained
depth-estimation networks on two real-world datasets and obtained results
comparable to training on real data alone, confirming that our virtual

any two points lie on at most one line, and (ii) given a line L and a point p
not incident with L, there is a unique point on L collinear with p. They are a
specific case of the generalised polygons introduced by Tits, and these
structures and their automorphism groups are of some importance in finite
geometry. An integral part of understanding the automorphism groups of finite
generalised quadrangles is knowing which groups can act primitively on their
points, and in particular, which almost simple groups arise as automorphism
groups. We show that no almost simple sporadic group can act primitively on the
points of a finite (thick) generalised quadrangle. We also present two new
ideas contributing towards analysing point-primitive groups acting on
generalised quadrangles. The first is the outline and implementation of an
algorithm for determining whether a given group can act primitively on the
points of some generalised quadrangle. The second is the discussion of a
conjecture resulting from observations made in the course of this work: any
group acting primitively on the points of a generalised quadrangle must either
act transitively on lines or have exactly two line-orbits, each containing half

introduced estimation approach that seeks to identify the unknown or uncertain
function in the governing equations of a nonlinear set of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). While the original state estimate evolves in Euclidean space,
the function estimate is constructed in an infinite-dimensional RKHS that must
be approximated in practice. When a finite-dimensional approximation is
constructed using a basis defined in terms of shifted kernel functions centered
at the observations along a trajectory, the RKHS embedding method can be
understood as a data-driven approach. This paper derives sufficient conditions
that ensure that approximations of the unknown function converge in a Sobolev
norm over a submanifold that supports the dynamics. Moreover, the rate of
convergence for the finite-dimensional approximations is derived in terms of
the fill distance of the samples in the embedded manifold. Numerical simulation
of an example problem is carried out to illustrate the qualitative nature of
convergence results derived in the paper.

exponential time decay of the particle distribution, provided that local

scheme to become infeasible. Therefore, it is crucial to be able to promptly
and maybe frequently develop high-quality replanned observation schemes that
minimize the effects on the scheduled tasks. A bottom-up distributed
coordinated framework together with an improved contract net are proposed to
facilitate the dynamic task replanning for heterogeneous Earth observation
resources. This hierarchical framework consists of three levels, namely,
neighboring resource coordination, single planning center coordination, and
multiple planning center coordination. Observation tasks affected by
unpredicted factors are assigned and treated along with a bottom-up route from
resources to planning centers. This bottom-up distributed coordinated framework
transfers part of the computing load to various nodes of the observation
systems to allocate tasks more efficiently and robustly. To support the prompt

to obtain the promising planning scheme more quickly. The experiments
demonstrate that the MCA method can achieve a better task completion rate for

at least 30~km, heated from below at the ocean-core interface and cooled at the
top, where the ocean loses heat to the icy lithosphere above. This scenario
suggests an important role for vertical convection to influence the interior
properties and circulation of Enceladus' ocean. Additionally, the ice shell
that encompasses the ocean has dramatic meridional thickness variations that,
in steady state, must be sustained against processes acting to remove these ice
thickness anomalies. One mechanism that would maintain variations in the ice
shell thickness involves spatially-separated regions of freezing and melting at
the ocean-ice interface. Here, we use an idealized, dynamical ocean model
forced by an observationally-guided density forcing at the ocean-ice interface
to argue that Enceladus' interior ocean should support a meridional overturning
circulation. This circulation establishes an interior density structure that is
more complex than in studies that have focused only on convection, including a
shallow freshwater lens in the polar regions. Spatially-separated sites of ice
formation and melt enable Enceladus to sustain a significant vertical and
horizontal stratification, which impacts interior heat transport, and is
critical for understanding the relationship between a global ocean and the
planetary energy budget. The presence of low salinity layers near the polar
ocean-ice interface also influences whether samples measured from the plumes
are representative of the global ocean.

then easily imposed. We then apply the EKI-based sparse learning methodology to
various examples governed by stochastic differential equations (a noisy Lorenz
63 system), ordinary differential equations (Lorenz 96 system and coalescence
equations), and a partial differential equation (the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky

that the spectral fits with Vazdekis models could give basically the consistent
predictions of [$\alpha$/Fe] with previous studies when the Mg$_b$ index is

Quasiparticle $GW$ calculations for two dimensional (2D) materials are
especially difficult. The unusual analytical behaviors of the dielectric
screening and the electron self-energy of 2D materials make the conventional
Brillouin zone (BZ) integration approach rather inefficient and require an
extremely dense $k$-grid to properly converge the calculated quasiparticle
energies. In this work, we present a combined non-uniform sub-sampling and
analytical integration method that can drastically improve the efficiency of
the BZ integration in 2D $GW$ calculations. Our work is distinguished from
previous work in that, instead of focusing on the intricate dielectric matrix
or the screened Coulomb interaction matrix, we exploit the analytical behavior
of various terms of the convolved self-energy $\Sigma(\mathbf{q})$ in the small
$\mathbf{q}$ limit. This method, when combined with another accelerated $GW$
method that we developed recently, can drastically speed-up (by over three
orders of magnitude) $GW$ calculations for 2D materials. Our method allows
fully converged $GW$ calculations for complex 2D systems at a fraction of

quasiparticle properties of 2D semiconductors for various applications. To
demonstrate the capability and performance of our new method, we have carried

feasibility of deployment on different input image resolutions for a specific
model. To achieve efficient and flexible image classification at runtime, we
employ meta learners to generate convolutional weights of main networks for
various input scales and maintain privatized Batch Normalization layers per
scale. For improved training performance, we further utilize knowledge
distillation on the fly over model predictions based on different input
resolutions. The learned meta network could dynamically parameterize main
networks to act on input images of arbitrary size with consistently better
accuracy compared to individually trained models. Extensive experiments on the

emerged as a new resistive switching memory which exploit
polarization-dependent tunnel current across a thin ferroelectric barrier. Here
we demonstrate FTJs with CMOS-compatible Zr-doped HfO$_2$ (Zr:HfO$_2$)
ferroelectric barriers of just 1 nm thickness, grown by atomic layer deposition
on silicon. These 1 nm Zr:HfO$_2$ tunnel junctions exhibit large
polarization-driven electroresistance (19000$\%$), the largest value reported

these junctions provide large tunnel current (> 1 A/cm$^2$) at low read
voltage, orders of magnitude larger than reported thicker HfO$_2$-based FTJs.
Therefore, our proof-of-principle demonstration provides an approach to
simultaneously overcome three major drawbacks of prototypical FTJs: a
Si-compatible ultrathin ferroelectric, large electroresistance, and large read

Convolution (PSConv), mixes up a spectrum of dilation rates and tactfully
allocate them in the individual convolutional kernels of each filter regarding
a single convolutional layer. Specifically, dilation rates vary cyclically
along the axes of input and output channels of the filters, aggregating
features over a wide range of scales in a neat style. PSConv could be a drop-in

trainability: the deeper the network, the lower the probability of finding a
valid initialization. In this work, we derive both upper and lower bounds on
the probability that a ReLU network is initialized to a trainable point, as a
function of model hyperparameters. We show that it is possible to increase the
depth of a network indefinitely, so long as the width increases as well.
Furthermore, our bounds are asymptotically tight under reasonable assumptions:
first, the upper bound coincides with the true probability for a single-layer
network with the largest possible input set. Second, the true probability
converges to our lower bound as the input set shrinks to a single point, or as
the network complexity grows under an assumption about the output variance. We
confirm these results by numerical simulation, showing rapid convergence to the
lower bound with increasing network depth. Then, motivated by the theory, we
propose a practical sign flipping scheme which guarantees that the ratio of
living data points in a $k$-layer network is at least $2^{-k}$. Finally, we
show how these issues are mitigated by network design features currently seen
in practice, such as batch normalization, residual connections, dense networks

small sampling window sizes the latent space is degenerate, and variability is
observed only in the direction of a single latent variable that can be
identified with the presence of domain wall. For larger window sizes, the
latent space is 2D, and the disentangled latent variables can be generally
interpreted as the degree of switching and complexity of domain structure.
Applied to multiple consecutive PFM images acquired while monitoring domain
switching, the polarization switching mechanism can thus be visualized in the

Iteration} (S-PI) for LQR, a method capable of deriving a structured linear
policy. Such a structured policy with (block) sparsity or low-rank can have
significant advantages over the standard LQR policy: more interpretable,
memory-efficient, and well-suited for the distributed setting. In order to
derive such a policy, we first cast a regularized LQR problem when the model is
known. Then, our Structured Policy Iteration (S-PI) algorithm, which takes a
policy evaluation step and a policy improvement step in an iterative manner,
can solve this regularized LQR efficiently. We further extend the S-PI
algorithm to the model-free setting where a smoothing procedure is adopted to
estimate the gradient. In both the known-model and model-free setting, we prove
convergence analysis under the proper choice of parameters. Finally, the
experiments demonstrate the advantages of S-PI in terms of balancing the LQR
performance and level of structure by varying the weight parameter.

detailed balance criterion is presented that, amongst the measures that
describe spatially independent and identically/alternately distributed

given. These results are applied to various examples of discrete integrable
systems, namely the ultra-discrete and discrete KdV equations, for which it is
shown that the relevant invariant measures are of exponential/geometric and
generalized inverse Gaussian form, respectively, as well as the ultra-discrete

are found to be of exponential/geometric and gamma form. Ergodicity is
demonstrated in the case of the KdV-type models. Links between the invariant

technique that autonomously investigates the characteristics of the surrounding
environment using sensor data accumulated while users use a positioning
application. Using the collected sensor data, the device trajectory can be
regenerated, and a Wi-Fi ranging module is trained to make the shape of the
estimated trajectory using Wi-Fi similar to that obtained from sensors. In this
process, the ranging module learns the way to identify the channel conditions
from each Wi-Fi access point (AP) and produce ranging results accordingly.
Furthermore, we collect the channel state information (CSI) from beacon frames
and evaluate the benefit of using CSI in addition to received signal strength
(RSS) measurements. When CSI is available, the ranging module can identify more
diverse channel conditions from each AP, and thus more precise positioning
results can be achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed learning technique
is verified using a real-time positioning application implemented on a PC

the largest object of the so-called Taurid complex. We compare the reflectance
spectrum of this comet with the laboratory spectra of some Antarctic ungrouped
carbonaceous chondrites to investigate whether some of these meteorites could
be associated with evolved comets. Methods. We compared the spectral behaviour
of 2P/Encke with laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites. Different
specimens of the common carbonaceous chondrite groups do not match the overall
features and slope of comet 2P/Encke. Trying anomalous carbonaceous chondrites,
we found two meteorites, Meteorite Hills 01017 and Grosvenor Mountains 95551,
which could be good proxies for the dark materials forming this short-period
comet. We hypothesise that these two meteorites could be rare surviving
samples, either from the Taurid complex or another compositionally similar
body. In any case, it is difficult to get rid of the effects of terrestrial
weathering in these Antarctic finds, and further studies are needed. Future
sample return from the so-called dormant comets could be also useful to
establish a ground truth on the materials forming evolved short-period comets.
Results. As a natural outcome, we think that identifying good proxies of
2P/Encke-forming materials might have interesting implications for future
sample-return missions to evolved, potentially dormant or extinct comets. To
understand the compositional nature of evolved comets is particularly relevant
in the context of the future mitigation of impact hazard from these dark and

Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) at the interface (or quantum well)
separating two possibly magnetized reservoirs. The particle and spin currents
between the two reservoirs are driven by chemical potentials that are
(possibly) different for each spin direction. These currents are also tuned by
varying the strength of the SOI, which changes the amount of the rotation of
the spins of electrons crossing the heterostructure. Here we investigate the
dependence of these currents on additional Zeeman fields on the heterostructure
and on variations of the reservoir magnetizations. In contrast to the particle
current, the spin currents are not necessarily conserved; an additional spin
polarization is injected into the reservoirs. If a reservoir has a finite
(equilibrium) magnetization, then we surprisingly find that the spin current
into that reservoir can only have spins which are parallel to the reservoir
magnetization, independent of all the other fields. This spin current can be
enhanced by increasing the magnetization of the other reservoir, and can also
be tuned by the SOI and the various magnetic fields. When only one reservoir is
magnetized then the spin current into the other reservoir has arbitrary tunable
size and direction. In particular, this spin current changes as the
magnetization of the other reservoir is rotated. The optimal conditions for
accumulating spin polarization on an unpolarized reservoir are to either apply
a Zeeman field in addition to the SOI, or to polarize the other reservoir.

upper BH mass-gap. With the advent of gravitational-wave astrophysics it has
become possible to test this prediction, and there is an important associated
effort to understand what theoretical uncertainties modify the boundaries of
this gap. In this work we study the impact of rotation on the hydrodynamics of
PISNe, which leave no compact remnant, as well as the evolution of
pulsational-PISNe (PPISNe), which undergo thermonuclear eruptions before
forming a compact object. We perform simulations of non-rotating and
rapidly-rotating stripped helium stars in a metal poor environment
$(Z_\odot/50)$ in order to resolve the lower edge of the upper mass-gap. We
find that the outcome of our simulations is dependent on the efficiency of
angular momentum transport, with models that include efficient coupling through
the Spruit-Tayler dynamo shifting the lower edge of the mass-gap upwards by
$\sim 4\%$, while simulations that do not include this effect shift it upwards
by $\sim 15\%$. From this, we expect the lower edge of the upper mass-gap to be
dependent on BH spin, which can be tested as the number of observed BH mergers
increases. Moreover, we show that stars undergoing PPISNe have extended
envelopes ($R\sim 10-1000~R_\odot$) at iron-core collapse, making them

hydrogen-free progenitor with a radius of 1962 Rsun. Thanks to the large
progenitor radius, the ejecta experience slow cooling after the shock breakout
and they become rapidly evolving (<~ 10 days) luminous (>~ 1e43 erg/s) SNe in
optical even without the energy input from the 56Ni nuclear decay when the
explosion energy is more than 1e52 erg. The 56Ni decay energy input can affect
the light curves after the optical light-curve peak and make the light-curve
decay slow when the 56Ni mass is around 1 Msun. They also have fast
photospheric velocity above 10,000 km/s and hot photospheric temperature above
10,000 K at around the peak luminosity. We find that the rapid rise and
luminous peak found in the optical light curve of SN 2011kl, which is
associated with the ultra-long GRB 111209A, can be explained as the cooling
phase of the extended progenitor. The ultra-long GRB progenitors proposed in
Marchant & Moriya (2020) can explain both the ultra-long GRB duration and the
accompanying SN properties. When the GRB jet is off-axis or choked, the
luminous SNe could be observed as fast blue optical transients without
accompanying GRBs. (abridged)

distributed in time, is critical to information diffusion in physical and

burstiness on generic dynamics is lacking. We develop a master equation
formalism to study cascades on temporal networks with burstiness modelled by
renewal processes. Supported by numerical and data-driven simulations, we
describe the interplay between heterogeneous temporal interactions and models
of threshold-driven and epidemic spreading. We find that increasing interevent
time variance can both accelerate and decelerate spreading for threshold
models, but can only decelerate epidemic spreading. When accounting for the
skewness of different interevent time distributions, spreading times collapse
onto a universal curve. Our framework uncovers a deep yet subtle connection
between generic diffusion mechanisms and underlying temporal network structures
that impacts on a broad class of networked phenomena, from spin interactions to
epidemic contagion and language dynamics.

facilitate equivalence testing from noisy stimulus-response pairs. Second, a

the quality of bounding boxes, indicating the spatial relations, is not only

score, which acts as a location reference during the inference stage. The
proposed localization score leads to an independent regression branch and
calibrates the bounding box quality by scoring the predicted localization score
so that the best-qualified bounding boxes can be picked up in NMS. Experiments

samples are available but fail with few-shot classification tasks. Recently,
meta-learning methods have received much attention, which train a meta-learner
on massive additional tasks to gain the knowledge to instruct the few-shot
classification. Usually, the training tasks are randomly sampled and performed
indiscriminately, often making the meta-learner stuck into a bad local optimum.
Some works in the optimization of deep neural networks have shown that a better
arrangement of training data can make the classifier converge faster and
perform better. Inspired by this idea, we propose an easy-to-hard expert
meta-training strategy to arrange the training tasks properly, where easy tasks
are preferred in the first phase, then, hard tasks are emphasized in the second
phase. A task hardness aware module is designed and integrated into the
training procedure to estimate the hardness of a task based on the
distinguishability of its categories. In addition, we explore multiple hardness
measurements including the semantic relation, the pairwise Euclidean distance,
the Hausdorff distance, and the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion.
Experimental results on the miniImageNet and tieredImageNetSketch datasets show
that the meta-learners can obtain better results with our expert training
strategy.

It
is used in a large variety of algorithms from areas ranging from iterative

nature and require the online computation of the reciprocal. Such an iterative
structure often prevents effective use of pipelining for implementation of the
reciprocal. For this reason, a reciprocal algorithm requiring only a low amount
of clock cycles is desired. Many real-time algorithms, often being of
approximate nature, can tolerate the use of only an approximate solution of the
reciprocal.
  For this reason, we present a low complexity non-iterative approximation of
the reciprocal function. This approximation can be calculated using only
combinatorial logic. We present synthesis results showing that the proposed
approach can be implemented with low area requirements at high clock
frequencies. We analytically describe the error of the approximation and show
that by optimizing a constant value used in the approximation, different
variants with different error behaviors can be obtained. We furthermore present
performance results of application examples that, when using our proposed

impact the social welfare? A quantitative measure of this impact is the price

on the price of fairness also studies the setting of indivisible goods.
  In this paper, we resolve the price of two well-studied fairness notions for
the allocation of indivisible goods: envy-freeness up to one good (EF1), and
approximate maximin share (MMS). For both EF1 and 1/2-MMS guarantees, we show,
via different techniques, that the price of fairness is $O(\sqrt{n})$, where
$n$ is the number of agents. From previous work, it follows that our bounds are
tight. Our bounds are obtained via efficient algorithms. For 1/2-MMS, our bound
holds for additive valuations, whereas for EF1, our bound holds for the more
general class of subadditive valuations. This resolves an open problem posed by

fluctuations that arise from non-orthogonal spherical harmonics on an
incomplete sky, which for recent CMB data sets (such as Planck) is the dominant
source of uncertainty. For an accepted sky fraction of 81% and an angular CMB

are found for the corresponding directional parameters and other sky fractions.
We note that the Wiener filter algorithm is generally applicable to any dipole

computationally tractable model is available for the unmasked higher-order
fluctuations. The methodology described in this paper forms the numerical basis

entanglement. In the present review, we provide a comparative analysis of the
relevant existing approaches, which is based on the characterization of
bipartite entanglement in terms of the behaviour of correlation functions. Such

classical grand-canonical treatment of the solvent using molecular density
functional theory. Unlike previous work, both densities are minimized self
consistently, accounting for mutual polarization of the molecular solvent and
the solute. The electrostatic interaction is accounted using the full electron
density of the solute rather than fitted point charges. The introduced
methodology represents a good compromise between the two main strategies to
tackle solvation effect in quantum calculation. It is computationally more
effective than a direct quantum-mechanics/molecular mechanics coupling,
requiring the exploration of many solvent configurations. Compared to continuum
methods it retains the full molecular-level description of the solvent. We
validate this new framework onto two usual benchmark systems: a water solvated

dimensions, this order is generically trivial, which prevents relating
multipartite states to each other with respect to any entanglement measure. In
order to obtain a non-trivial partial ordering, we study a physically motivated
extension of LOCC: multi-state LOCC. Here, one considers simultaneous LOCC
transformations acting on a finite number of entangled pure states. We study
both multipartite and bipartite multi-state transformations. In the
multipartite case, we demonstrate that one can change the stochastic LOCC

one can perform state conversions not possible in the single copy case; provide
examples of multipartite entanglement catalysis; and demonstrate improved
probabilistic protocols. In the bipartite case, we identify numerous

thereby provide a proper understanding of the ""meaning"" of the exchanged
characters within an interaction. The key idea is to approach the semantics of
an interaction as we do for a formal language. This approach consists of two
steps: first to assign values to variables and second to provide meaning by an
interpretation function. A natural choice for the variables are the state
functions of the interacting systems, assigning values at each time step.
Thereby the description of a system's behaviour with an input/output-transition
system (I/O-TS) becomes a representation of the variable-to-value
assignments.To identify the interpretation function I propose to model the
interaction of systems based on Shannon's theory of information with the
protocol concept, complemented by decisions to form a ""game in interactive form
(GIF)"". Decisions in this sense determine the transition relation and thereby
create a transition function. Then the natural choice for the interpretation
function is the transition function of the GIF. In this sense, the
interpretation of the interaction becomes its execution. Now we can say that
the interpretation of the characters during the GIF's execution results in
their meaning, the result of the mapping. Equivalent meaning is based on
resulting equivalent states of the GIF. Based on the decisions we can partition
any GIF into a deterministic traditional automaton where the states represent
equivalance classes of GIF-states related to a single decision. Except for the
utility function, this automaton is equivalent to a traditional game in

exploiting information already present in a knowledge base (KB). A promising
approach for KBC is to embed knowledge into latent spaces and make predictions
from learned embeddings. However, existing embedding models are subject to at
least one of the following limitations: (1) theoretical inexpressivity, (2)
lack of support for prominent inference patterns (e.g., hierarchies), (3) lack
of support for KBC over higher-arity relations, and (4) lack of support for
incorporating logical rules. Here, we propose a spatio-translational embedding
model, called BoxE, that simultaneously addresses all these limitations. BoxE
embeds entities as points, and relations as a set of hyper-rectangles (or
boxes), which spatially characterize basic logical properties. This seemingly
simple abstraction yields a fully expressive model offering a natural encoding
for many desired logical properties. BoxE can both capture and inject rules
from rich classes of rule languages, going well beyond individual inference
patterns. By design, BoxE naturally applies to higher-arity KBs. We conduct a
detailed experimental analysis, and show that BoxE achieves state-of-the-art
performance, both on benchmark knowledge graphs and on more general KBs, and we
empirically show the power of integrating logical rules.

consider two possible reasons for that, both related to the approach of on-peak
resonance searching for. As is believed usually, a new particle suits the
conditions that the ratio of the width to the mass is less than $1-3 \%$ and a
narrow width approximation (NWA) is applicable to identify the such type
resonant peak in the invariant mass spectrum of collision products.
  In the present paper, in the framework of generalized Yukawa model, we find
out the properties of the searched particle when its width is larger than a
maximal one expected during experiments and so this state could be missed as a
noise. We also ascertain the values of particle's parameters when the NWA is
not applicable and estimate the width value when it happens. These estimations
are relevant to interactions between the Standard model and dark matter
particles. Such approach is focused on the role of couplings and mass values
introduced in the model describing interaction of visible and dark matter.

$\epsilon$ inside the microdosimeter divided by the mean chord length, whose
value is based on geometrical assumptions on both the detector and the
radiation field. This work presents an innovative two-stages hybrid detector
(HDM: hybrid detector for microdosimetry) composed by a Tissue Equivalent
Proportional Counter (TEPC) and a silicon tracker made of 4 Low Gain Avalanche
Diode (LGAD). This design provides a direct measurement of energy deposition in
tissue as well as particles tracking with a submillimeter spatial resolution.
The data collected by the detector allow to obtain the real track length
traversed by each particle in the TEPC and thus estimates microdosimetry
spectra without the mean chord length approximation. Using Geant4 toolkit, we
investigated HDM performances in terms of detection and tracking efficiencies
when placed in water and exposed to protons and carbon ions in the therapeutic
energy range. The results indicate that the mean chord length approximation
underestimate particles with short track, which often are characterized by a
high energy deposition and thus can be biologically relevant. Tracking
efficiency depends on the LGAD configurations: 34 strips sensors have a higher
detection efficiency but lower spatial resolution than 71 strips sensors.
Further studies will be performed both with Geant4 and experimentally to
optimize the detector design on the bases of the radiation field of interest.
The main purpose of HDM is to improve the assessment of the radiation
biological effectiveness via microdosimetric measurements, exploiting a new
definition of the lineal energy ($y_{T}$), defined as the energy deposition

obtain. To alleviate annotation scarcity, many approaches have been developed
to efficiently utilize extra information, e.g.,semi-supervised learning further
exploring plentiful unlabeled data, domain adaptation including multi-modality
learning and unsupervised domain adaptation resorting to the prior knowledge
from additional modality. In this paper, we aim to investigate the feasibility
of simultaneously leveraging abundant unlabeled data and well-established
cross-modality data for annotation-efficient medical image segmentation. To
this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised domain adaptation approach, namely
Dual-Teacher, where the student model not only learns from labeled target data
(e.g., CT), but also explores unlabeled target data and labeled source data
(e.g., MR) by two teacher models. Specifically, the student model learns the
knowledge of unlabeled target data from intra-domain teacher by encouraging
prediction consistency, as well as the shape priors embedded in labeled source
data from inter-domain teacher via knowledge distillation. Consequently, the
student model can effectively exploit the information from all three data
resources and comprehensively integrate them to achieve improved performance.
We conduct extensive experiments on MM-WHS 2017 dataset and demonstrate that
our approach is able to concurrently utilize unlabeled data and cross-modality
data with superior performance, outperforming semi-supervised learning and
domain adaptation methods with a large margin.

both group activities and the outcome (score or not). Motion patterns can be an
effective means to identify different activities. Global and local motions have
their respective emphasis on different activities, which are difficult to
capture from the optical flow due to the mixture of global and local motions.
Hence it calls for a more effective way to separate the global and local
motions. When it comes to the specific case for basketball game analysis, the
successful score for each round can be reliably detected by the appearance
variation around the basket. Based on the observations, we propose a scheme to
fuse global and local motion patterns (MPs) and key visual information (KVI)
for semantic event recognition in basketball videos. Firstly, an algorithm is
proposed to estimate the global motions from the mixed motions based on the
intrinsic property of camera adjustments. And the local motions could be
obtained from the mixed and global motions. Secondly, a two-stream 3D CNN
framework is utilized for group activity recognition over the separated global
and local motion patterns. Thirdly, the basket is detected and its appearance
features are extracted through a CNN structure. The features are utilized to
predict the success or failure. Finally, the group activity recognition and
success/failure prediction results are integrated using the kronecker product
for event recognition. Experiments on NCAA dataset demonstrate that the
proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance.

the infected people's blood type in both the virus infectivity and the
progression of the disease. A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both
aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that in the subject-to-subject
transfer SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the
source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune
reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific
antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood
type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood
type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the
observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an
epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood
types are taken into account and compare our model outcomes with the exiting

wherever upwards band bending takes place. Focusing on the common 4|4E mirror
twin boundary, density functional theory calculations give an estimate of its
charging, which agrees well with electrostatic modeling. We show that the line

the gradual erosion of soil around a bridge foundation due to fast-flowing
water. A reliable technique for monitoring scour would help bridge engineers
take timely countermeasures to safeguard against failure. Although
vibration-based techniques for monitoring structural damage have had limited
success, primarily due to insufficient sensitivity, these have tended to focus
on the detection of local damage. High natural frequency sensitivity has
recently been reported for scour damage. Previous experiments to investigate
this have been limited as a result of the cost of full-scale testing and the
fact that scaled-down soil structure models tested outside a centrifuge do not
adequately simulate full-scale behaviour. This paper describes the development
of what is believed to be the first-ever centrifuge-testing programme to
establish the sensitivity of bridge natural frequency to scour. For the
fundamental mode of vibration, these tests found up to a 40% variation in
natural frequency for 30% loss of embedment. Models of three other types of
foundation, which represent a shallow pad foundation, a deep pile bent and a
deep monopile, were also tested in the centrifuge at different scour levels.
The shallow foundation model showed lower frequency sensitivity to scour than
the deep foundation models. The level of frequency sensitivity (3.1 to 44% per
scour depth equivalent to 30% of embedment of scour) detected in this
experiment demonstrates the potential for using natural frequency as an
indicator of both local and global scour of bridges, particularly those with
deep foundations.

$S(\Lambda)$ associated with a bounded (sub)region $\Lambda\subset \mathbb R^2$
as the von Neumann entropy of the (mixed) local substate obtained by reducing
the infinite-area ground state to this region $\Lambda$ of finite area

has the form $L\sqrt{B}|\partial\Lambda|$ up to a precisely given (positive

information by taking an RGB sequence of entire image regions as input. While
being effective in exploiting contextual information around humans, e.g., human
appearance and scene category, they are easily fooled by out-of-context action
videos where the contexts do not exactly match with target actions. In
contrast, pose-based methods, which take a sequence of human skeletons only as
input, suffer from inaccurate pose estimation or ambiguity of human pose per
se. Integrating these two approaches has turned out to be non-trivial; training
a model with both appearance and pose ends up with a strong bias towards
appearance and does not generalize well to unseen videos. To address this
problem, we propose to learn pose-driven feature integration that dynamically
combines appearance and pose streams by observing pose features on the fly. The
main idea is to let the pose stream decide how much and which appearance
information is used in integration based on whether the given pose information
is reliable or not. We show that the proposed IntegralAction achieves highly

are independent vectors of exactly $n/2$ zero components. We show that the
smallest singular value $s_n(Q_n)$ of $Q_n$ satisfies \[
\mathbb{P}\Big\{s_n(Q_n)\le \frac{\varepsilon}{\sqrt{n}}\Big\} \le C\varepsilon
+ 2 e^{-cn} \quad \forall \varepsilon \ge 0, \] which is optimal up to the
constants $C,c>0$. This improves on earlier results of Ferber, Jain, Luh and
Samotij, as well as Jain. In particular, for $\varepsilon=0$, we obtain the
first exponential bound in dimension for the singularity probability \[
\mathbb{P}\big\{Q_n \,\,\text{is singular}\big\} \le 2 e^{-cn}.\] To overcome
the lack of independence between entries of $Q_n$, we introduce an
arithmetic-combinatorial invariant of a pair of vectors, which we call a
Combinatorial Least Common Denominator (CLCD). We prove a small ball
probability inequality for the combinatorial statistic
$\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_iv_{\sigma(i)}$ in terms of the CLCD of the pair $(a,v)$,
where $\sigma$ is a uniformly random permutation of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ and
$a:=(a_1,\ldots,a_n), v:=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ are real vectors. This inequality
allows us to derive strong anti-concentration properties for the distance
between a fixed row of $Q_n$ and the linear space spanned by the remaining
rows, and prove the main result.

inequalities is called vertex enumeration. The inverse problem, which is
equivalent by polarity, is called the convex hull problem. We introduce
`approximate vertex enumeration' as the problem to compute the vertices of a
polytope which is close to the original polytope given by affine inequalities.
In contrast to exact vertex enumerations, both polytopes are not required to be
combinatorially equivalent.
  Two algorithms for this problem are introduced. The first one is an
approximate variant of Motzkin's double description method. Only under certain
strong conditions, which are not acceptable for practical reasons, we were able
to prove correctness of this method for polytopes of arbitrary dimension. The
second method, called shortcut algorithm, is based on constructing a plane
graph and is restricted to polytopes of dimension 2 and 3. We prove correctness
of the shortcut algorithm. As a consequence, we also obtain correctness of the
approximate double description method, only for dimension 2 and 3 but without
any restricting conditions as still required for higher dimensions. We show
that for dimension 2 and 3 both algorithm remain correct if imprecise
arithmetic is used and the computational error caused by imprecision is not too
high. Both algorithms were implemented. The numerical examples motivate the
approximate vertex enumeration problem by showing that the approximate problem
is often easier to solve than the exact vertex enumeration problem.
  It remains open whether or not the approximate double description method
(without any restricting condition) is correct for polytopes of dimension 4 and
higher.

number of hyperons is typically small compared to the number of nucleons in the
hypernuclei of interest. This allows us to use the impurity lattice Monte Carlo
method, where the minority species of fermions in the full nuclear Hamiltonian
is integrated out and treated as a worldline in Euclidean projection time. The
majority fermions (nucleons) are treated as explicit degrees of freedom, with
their mutual interactions described by auxiliary fields. This is the first
application of the impurity lattice Monte Carlo method to systems where the
majority particles are interacting. Here, we show how the impurity Monte Carlo
method can be applied to compute the binding energy of the light hypernuclei.
In this exploratory work we use spin-independent nucleon-nucleon and
hyperon-nucleon interactions to test the computational power of the method. We
find that the computational effort scales approximately linearly in the number
of nucleons. The results are very promising for future studies of larger

for atmospheric re-entry manoeuvres. Re-entry flows at high altitudes are in
the rarefied regime and are governed by high enthalpies and thermodynamic
non-equilibrium. Additionally, catalytic gas-surface reactions change the gas
flow composition and can have a major influence on the heat transfer. Our goal
is to estimate the heat loads without a priori fitting of simulation parameters
to experiments. We use the tool PICLas for simulations of such rarefied gas
flows. It combines different particle methods, including the Direct Simulation
Monte Carlo method, for modelling of gases. Recently it has been extended to
include different catalysis models to treat reactions on surfaces. We evaluate
a kinetic Monte Carlo approach to model catalytic gas-surface interactions in
combination with flow simulations using particle methods. Here, the adsorbate
distribution is modelled by reproducing a surface system using a kinetic Monte
Carlo approach and estimating the necessary parameters using model assumptions.
This catalytic model is compared to a simple recombination model. We present
simulations that show the capability of the implemented models for a
$\mathrm{SiO_2}$ surface in an Oxygen flow. Furthermore, simulation results are
compared to heat fluxes and recombination coefficient obtained from the
respective experiment. The results show that simulations using the kinetic
Monte Carlo approach match the experimentally obtained values. Thus, the
approach can be used to estimate the reactivity of oxygen flows over
$\mathrm{SiO_2}$ surfaces.

accelerated in the laser electric field and gain kinetic energy; the
electron-hole pairs then recombine in the ground state by emitting a single

quantized representation of a given timbre distribution. Timbre transfer can be
performed by encoding any variable-length input signals into the quantized
latent features that are decoded according to the learned timbre. We detail
results for translating audio between orchestral instruments and singing voice,

modality to drive sound synthesis. Furthermore, we can map the discrete latent

widely used to distinguish increases of free water (FW) partial volume effects
from tissue's diffusion in healthy ageing and degenerative diseases. Since the
FWE-DTI fitting is only well posed for multi-shell acquisitions, a regularized
gradient descent (RGD) method was proposed to enable application to
single-shell data, more common in the clinic. However, the validity of the RGD
method has been poorly assessed. This study aims to quantify the specificity of
FWE-DTI procedures on single- and multi-shell data. Methods: Different FWE-DTI
fitting procedures were tested on an open-source in vivo diffusion dataset and
single- and multi-shell synthetic signals, including the RGD and standard
non-linear least squares (NLS) methods. Single-voxel simulations were carried
out to compare initialization approaches. A multi-voxel phantom simulation was
performed to evaluate the impact of spatial regularization when comparing
between methods. To test the algorithms' specificity, phantoms with two
different types of lesions were simulated: with increased mean diffusivity (MD)
or with increased FW. Result: Plausible parameter maps were obtained with RGD
from single-shell in vivo data. The plausibility of these maps was shown to be
determined by the initialization. Tests with simulated lesions inserted into
the in vivo data revealed that the RGD approach cannot distinguish FW from
tissue MD alterations, contrarily to the NLS algorithm. Conclusion: RGD FWE-DTI
has limited specificity and, thus, its results from single-shell data should be
carefully interpreted. When possible, multi-shell acquisitions and the NLS
approach should be preferred instead.

from the alphabet $\{ \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots \alpha_m \}$ and append it to
the string, the process continues until we see $n$ instances of a specific

  Consider a random variable $\xi_{m,n}$ that represents a length of a string

$\mathbb{E}[\xi_{m,n}]$ and variance $\mathrm{Var}[\xi_{m,n}]$ depend on $m$

criteria of the string generation process). Also, let's denote the sum of the
common path length over all 2-tuples of nodes of $G$ as $S_{m,n}$, and let's
denote the total number of edges in $G$ as $T_{m,n}$. In scope of this paper we
prove that the following relations are true for all $m,n \geq 1$:
$\mathbb{E}[\xi_{m,n}] = T_{m,n}$ and $\mathrm{Var}[\xi_{m,n}] = (m-1) \cdot

mode overlap of the emitted light of different emitters, which necessitates the
use of single mode fibers. Here we present an advanced manufacturing approach
to accomplish this task: we combine 3D printed complex micro-optics such as

Interestingly, the use of hemispherical solid immersion lenses further

acquiring micro-photoluminescence maps. The system can be joined together and
permanently fixed. This integrated system can be cooled by dipping into liquid
helium, by a Stirling cryocooler or by a closed-cycle helium cryostat without

existing approaches are either non-data-driven or limited in applicability. In
this paper, we present the Class-Correlation Learning Network (CCL-Net) to
learn interclass visual correlations from given training data, and produce soft

finding and representing the essential characteristics of simulation data. This
task is particularly crucial in enhanced sampling simulations. There we seek a
few generalized degrees of freedom, referred to as collective variables (CVs),
to represent and drive the sampling of the free energy landscape. In theory,
these CVs should separate different metastable states and correspond to the
slow degrees of freedom of the studied physical process. To this aim, we
propose a new method that we call multiscale reweighted stochastic embedding
(MRSE). Our work builds upon a parametric version of stochastic neighbor
embedding. The technique automatically learns CVs that map a high-dimensional
feature space to a low-dimensional latent space via a deep neural network. We
introduce several new advancements to stochastic neighbor embedding methods
that make MRSE especially suitable for enhanced sampling simulations: (1)
weight-tempered random sampling as a landmark selection scheme to obtain
training data sets that strike a balance between equilibrium representation and
capturing important metastable states lying higher in free energy; (2) a
multiscale representation of the high-dimensional feature space via a Gaussian
mixture probability model; and (3) a reweighting procedure to account for
training data from a biased probability distribution. We show that MRSE
constructs low-dimensional CVs that can correctly characterize the different

  Federated Learning in UAV-Enabled Internet of Vehicles",,,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the advanced capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components
such as vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) and smart devices as well as the
increasing amount of data generated, Federated Learning (FL) becomes a
promising tool given that it enables privacy-preserving machine learning that
can be implemented in the IoV. However, the performance of the FL suffers from
the failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when
continuous exchanges of model parameters are required. Therefore, we propose
the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the
communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving
the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources
to provide services for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we
present a joint auction-coalition formation framework to solve the allocation
of UAV coalitions to groups of IoV components. Specifically, the coalition
formation game is formulated to maximize the sum of individual profits of the
UAVs. The joint auction-coalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a
stable partition of UAV coalitions in which an auction scheme is applied to
solve the allocation of UAV coalitions. The auction scheme is designed to take
into account the preferences of IoV components over heterogeneous UAVs. The
simulation results show that the grand coalition, where all UAVs join a single
coalition, is not always stable due to the profit-maximizing behavior of the
UAVs. In addition, we show that as the cooperation cost of the UAVs increases,
the UAVs prefer to support the IoV components independently and not to form any
coalition.

few rules that could be used for interpreting the random forest model.
Moreover, the resulting set of rules closely matches the accuracy level of the
random forest model. Inspired by the column generation algorithm in linear
programming, our second algorithm uses a rule generation scheme for boosting
decision trees. We use the dual optimal solutions of the linear programming
models as sample weights to obtain only those rules that would improve the

that is an important tool in remote sensing. Most existing SAR image formation
methods result in a maximum a posteriori image which approximates the
reflectivity of an unknown ground scene. This single image provides no
quantification of the certainty with which the features in the estimate should
be trusted. In addition, finding the mode is generally not the best way to
interrogate a posterior. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a
sampling framework to SAR image formation. A hierarchical Bayesian model is
constructed using conjugate priors that directly incorporate coherent imaging
and the problematic speckle phenomenon which is known to degrade image quality.
Samples of the resulting posterior as well as parameters governing speckle and
noise are obtained using a Gibbs sampler. These samples may then be used to
compute estimates, and also to derive other statistics like variance which aid
in uncertainty quantification. The latter information is particularly important
in SAR, where ground truth images even for synthetically-created examples are
typically unknown. An example result using real-world data shows that the
sampling-based approach introduced here to SAR image formation provides
parameter-free estimates with improved contrast and significantly reduced
speckle, as well as unprecedented uncertainty quantification information.

power-of-two terms in binary expressions of values. In computing a dot-product
computation, TR dynamically selects a fixed number of largest terms to use from
the values of the two vectors in the dot product. By exploiting normal-like
weight and data distributions typically present in DNNs, TR has a minimal
impact on DNN model performance (i.e., accuracy or perplexity). We use TR to
facilitate tightly synchronized processor arrays, such as systolic arrays, for
efficient parallel processing. We show an FPGA implementation that can use a
small number of control bits to switch between conventional quantization and
TR-enabled quantization with a negligible delay. To enhance TR efficiency
further, we use a signed digit representation (SDR), as opposed to classic
binary encoding with only nonnegative power-of-two terms. To perform conversion
from binary to SDR, we develop an efficient encoding method called HESE (Hybrid
Encoding for Signed Expressions) that can be performed in one pass looking at
only two bits at a time. We evaluate TR with HESE encoded values on an MLP for
MNIST, multiple CNNs for ImageNet, and an LSTM for Wikitext-2, and show
significant reductions in inference computations (between 3-10x) compared to
conventional quantization for the same level of model performance.

facing fluctuating environmental conditions. To this end, we compare the long
term behaviour of `1-type' Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson branching processes
(describing populations consisting of `active' individuals only) with that of a
class of `2-type' branching processes, describing populations consisting of
`active' and `dormant' individuals. All processes are embedded in an
environment changing randomly between `harsh' and `healthy' conditions,
affecting the reproductive behaviour of the populations accordingly. For the
2-type branching processes, we consider several different switching regimes
between active and dormant states. We also impose overall resource limitations
which incorporate the potentially different `production costs' of active and
dormant offspring, leading to the notion of `fair comparison' between different
populations, and allow for a reproductive trade-off due to the maintenance of
the dormancy trait. Our switching regimes include the case where switches from
active to dormant states and vice versa happen randomly, irrespective of the
state of the environment (`spontaneous switching'), but also the case where
switches are triggered by the environment (`responsive switching'), as well as
combined strategies. It turns out that there are rather natural scenarios under
which either switching strategy can be super-critical, while the others, as
well as complete absence of a seed bank, are strictly sub-critical, even under
`fair comparison' wrt. available resources. In such a case, we see a clear
selective advantage of the super-critical strategy, which is retained even
under the presence of a (potentially small) reproductive trade-off. [...]

minimize the requirement of limited propellant availability and can also be
applied to any planet with atmosphere, enabling new mission at low altitude
ranges for longer times. Challenging is also the presence of reactive chemical
species, such as atomic oxygen in Earth orbit. Such species cause erosion of
(not only) propulsion system components, i.e. acceleration grids, electrodes,
and discharge channels of conventional EP systems. IRS is developing within the
DISCOVERER project, an intake and a thruster for an ABEP system. The paper
describes the design and implementation of the RF helicon-based inductive
plasma thruster (IPT). This paper deals in particular with the design and
implementation of a novel antenna called the birdcage antenna, a device well
known in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and also lately employed for
helicon-wave based plasma sources in fusion research. The IPT is based on RF
electrodeless operation aided by an externally applied static magnetic field.
The IPT is composed by an antenna, a discharge channel, a movable injector, and
a solenoid. By changing the operational parameters along with the novel antenna
design, the aim is to minimize losses in the RF circuit, and accelerate a
quasi-neutral plasma plume. This is also to be aided by the formation of
helicon waves within the plasma that are to improve the overall efficiency and
achieve higher exhaust velocities. Finally, the designed IPT with a particular
focus on the birdcage antenna design procedure is presented

fashion for specific tasks such as object recognition, face identification, or
character recognition, among many examples. This specificity often leads to
overconfident models that generalize poorly to samples that are not from the
original training distribution. Moreover, such standard DNNs do not allow to
leverage information from heterogeneously annotated training data, where for
example, labels may be provided with different levels of granularity.
Furthermore, DNNs do not produce results with simultaneous different levels of
confidence for different levels of detail, they are most commonly an all or
nothing approach. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of
nested learning: how to obtain a hierarchical representation of the input such
that a coarse label can be extracted first, and sequentially refine this
representation, if the sample permits, to obtain successively refined
predictions, all of them with the corresponding confidence. We explicitly
enforce this behavior by creating a sequence of nested information bottlenecks.
Looking at the problem of nested learning from an information theory
perspective, we design a network topology with two important properties. First,
a sequence of low dimensional (nested) feature embeddings are enforced. Then we
show how the explicit combination of nested outputs can improve both the
robustness and the accuracy of finer predictions. Experimental results on
Cifar-10, Cifar-100, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Dbpedia, and Plantvillage
demonstrate that nested learning outperforms the same network trained in the
standard end-to-end fashion.

selectively disclosing hard evidence about an unknown state of the world.
Evidence games often have multiple equilibria. Hart et al. (2017) propose to
focus on truth-leaning equilibria, i.e., perfect Bayesian equilibria where the
sender discloses truthfully when indifferent, and the receiver takes off-path
disclosure at face value. They show that a truth-leaning equilibrium is an
equilibrium of a perturbed game where the sender has an infinitesimal reward
for truth-telling. We show that, when the receiver's action space is finite,
truth-leaning equilibrium may fail to exist, and it is not equivalent to
equilibrium of the perturbed game. To restore existence, we introduce a
disturbed game with a small uncertainty about the receiver's payoff. A
purifiable truthful equilibrium is the limit of a sequence of truth-leaning
equilibria in the disturbed games as the disturbances converge to zero. It
exists and features a simple characterization. A truth-leaning equilibrium that
is also purifiable truthful is an equilibrium of the perturbed game. Moreover,
purifiable truthful equilibria are receiver optimal and give the receiver the
same payoff as the optimal deterministic mechanism.

In this paper, we consider the problem of cross-subject decoding,
where neural activity data collected from the prefrontal cortex of a given
subject (destination) is used to decode motor intentions from the neural
activity of a different subject (source). Approach. We cast the problem of
neural activity mapping in a probabilistic framework where we adopt deep
generative modelling. Our proposed algorithm uses deep conditional variational
autoencoder to infer the representation of the neural activity of the source
subject into an adequate feature space of the destination subject where neural
decoding takes place. Results. We verify our approach on an experimental data
set in which two macaque monkeys perform memory-guided visual saccades to one
of eight target locations. The results show a peak cross-subject decoding
improvement of $8\%$ over subject-specific decoding. Conclusion. We demonstrate
that a neural decoder trained on neural activity signals of one subject can be
used to robustly decode the motor intentions of a different subject with high
reliability. This is achieved in spite of the non-stationary nature of neural
activity signals and the subject-specific variations of the recording
conditions. Significance. The findings reported in this paper are an important
step towards the development of cross-subject brain-computer that generalize

energies (1 ZeV = $10^{21}$ eV). Schemes, most notably the internal shock
model, have been proposed to explain the acceleration of ultra-high-energy
cosmic-ray (UHECR) particles that have been sporadically detected reaching
Earth since 1962. Here, the cyclotron auto-resonance acceleration (CARA)
mechanism is tailored and used to demonstrate possible acceleration of
particles ejected as a result of violent astrophysical processes such as the
merger of a binary system or a supernova explosion. Such events result in
emission of highly-energetic particles and ultra-intense beamed radiation. In
the simultaneous presence of a super-strong magnetic field, the condition for
cyclotron auto-resonance may be met. Thus CARA can act like a {\it booster} for
particles pre-accelerated inside their progenitor by shock waves, possibly
among other means. As examples, it is shown that nuclei of hydrogen, helium,
and iron-56, may reach ZeV energies by CARA, under which conditions the
particles, while gyrating around the lines of an ultra-strong magnetic field,
also surf on the waves of a super-intense radiation field. When
radiation-reaction is taken into account, it is shown that the ZeV energy
gained by a particle can fall off by less than an order-of-magnitude if the
resonance condition is missed by roughly less than 20\%.

multi-planet system (a transiting 4 M$_\oplus$ planet at $\sim$0.07 au, and a
sub-stellar companion on a $\sim$2100-day eccentric orbit) which is
particularly appealing for a precise multi-technique characterization. With the
new ESPRESSO observations, that cover a time span of 200 days, we aim to
improve the precision and accuracy of the planet parameters and search for
additional low-mass companions. We also take advantage of new photometric
transits of $\pi$ Men c observed by TESS over a time span that overlaps with
that of the ESPRESSO follow-up campaign. We analyse the enlarged spectroscopic
and photometric datasets and compare the results to those in the literature. We
further characterize the system by means of absolute astrometry with Hipparcos
and Gaia. We used the spectra of ESPRESSO for an independent determination of
the stellar fundamental parameters. We present a precise characterization of
the planetary system around $\pi$ Men. The ESPRESSO radial velocities alone
(with typical uncertainty of 10 cm/s) allow for a precise retrieval of the
Doppler signal induced by $\pi$ Men c. The residuals show an RMS of 1.2 m/s,
and we can exclude companions with a minimum mass less than $\sim$2 M$_\oplus$
within the orbit of $\pi$ Men c). We improve the ephemeris of $\pi$ Men c using
18 additional TESS transits, and in combination with the astrometric
measurements, we determine the inclination of the orbital plane of $\pi$ Men b
with high precision ($i_{b}=45.8^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ deg). This leads to the precise
measurement of its absolute mass $m_{b}=14.1^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ M$_{Jup}$, and
shows that the planetary orbital planes are highly misaligned.

providing the PNS with additional artificial outputs. In this framework, the
BCIs based on the P300 Event-Related Potentials (ERP), which represent the
electrical responses recorded from the brain after specific events or stimuli,
have proven to be particularly successful and robust. The presence or the
absence of a P300 evoked potential within the EEG features is determined
through a classification algorithm. Linear classifiers such as SWLDA and SVM
are the most used for ERPs' classification. Due to the low signal-to-noise
ratio of the EEG signals, multiple stimulation sequences (a.k.a. iterations)
are carried out and then averaged before the signals being classified. However,
while augmenting the number of iterations improves the Signal-to-Noise Ratio

iterations was fixed (no stopping), but recently, several early stopping
strategies have been proposed in the literature to dynamically interrupt the
stimulation sequence when a certain criterion is met to enhance the
communication rate. In this work, we explore how to improve the classification
performances in P300 based BCIs by combining optimization and machine learning.
First, we propose a new decision function that aims at improving classification
performances in terms of accuracy and Information Transfer Rate both in a no
stopping and early stopping environment. Then, we propose a new SVM training
problem that aims to facilitate the target-detection process. Our approach
proves to be effective on several publicly available datasets.

widely used for in situ combustion diagnostics, yielding images of both species
concentration and temperature. The temperature image is generally obtained from
the reconstructed absorbance distributions for two spectral transitions, i.e.
two-line thermometry. However, the inherently ill-posed nature of tomographic
data inversion leads to noise in each of the reconstructed absorbance
distributions. These noise effects propagate into the absorbance ratio and
generate artefacts in the retrieved temperature image. To address this problem,
we have developed a novel algorithm, which we call Relative Entropy Tomographic
RecOnstruction (RETRO), for TDLAS tomography. A relative entropy regularisation
is introduced for high-fidelity temperature image retrieval from jointly
reconstructed two-line absorbance distributions. We have carried out numerical
simulations and proof-of-concept experiments to validate the proposed
algorithm. Compared with the well-established Simultaneous Algebraic
Reconstruction Technique (SART), the RETRO algorithm significantly improves the
quality of the tomographic temperature images, exhibiting excellent robustness
against TDLAS tomographic measurement noise. RETRO offers great potential for
industrial field applications of TDLAS tomography, where it is common for
measurements to be performed in very harsh environments.

the redshift range $z\lesssim 4 \times 10^3$ to prevent free-free processes
from thermalizing the injected energy. The injected energy should be nearly
200--1000 times the CMB intensity at $x_e \simeq 10^{-3}$ to obtain the
requisite residue. A large fraction of the injected energy gets thermalized and
therefore distorts the CMB spectrum. We compute CMB spectral distortion for
both the models and show that the fractional change in CMB energy density,

synthesizing realistic images in recent years. However, they are often trained
on image datasets with either too few samples or too many classes belonging to
different data distributions. Consequently, GANs are prone to underfitting or
overfitting, making the analysis of them difficult and constrained. Therefore,
in order to conduct a thorough study on GANs while obviating unnecessary
interferences introduced by the datasets, we train them on artificial datasets
where there are infinitely many samples and the real data distributions are
simple, high-dimensional and have structured manifolds. Moreover, the
generators are designed such that optimal sets of parameters exist.
Empirically, we find that under various distance measures, the generator fails
to learn such parameters with the GAN training procedure. We also find that
training mixtures of GANs leads to more performance gain compared to increasing
the network depth or width when the model complexity is high enough. Our
experimental results demonstrate that a mixture of generators can discover
different modes or different classes automatically in an unsupervised setting,
which we attribute to the distribution of the generation and discrimination
tasks across multiple generators and discriminators. As an example of the
generalizability of our conclusions to realistic datasets, we train a mixture
of GANs on the CIFAR-10 dataset and our method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of popular metrics, i.e., Inception Score (IS) and

equations, however, remains an open question. The answer to this question
affects accuracy, and potentially the reliability of conclusions drawn from
numerical studies based on such formulations. A numerical approximation can
converge to the continuum limit only for well-posed systems; for the initial
value problem in the $L^2$ norm this is characterized by strong hyperbolicity.
We find that, due to a shared pathological structure, the systems arising from
the aforementioned formulations are however only weakly hyperbolic. We present
numerical tests for toy models that demonstrate the consequence of this
shortcoming in practice for the characteristic initial boundary value problem.
Working with alternative norms in which our model problems may be well-posed we
show that convergence may be recovered. Finally we examine well-posedness of a

the role of GR in Bondi gauge on characteristic slices. We find that, due to
the incompatibility of the norms associated with the two systems, the composite

placing the maximum age of the proposed impact crater at 80 ka to 130 ka. Three
other competing hypotheses for the formation of the structure, namely a

feasibly detectable. Interestingly, the self-lensing signal is stronger in
binaries with large separations, which is the exact opposite of the case for
all other techniques. Thus, a dedicated self-lensing survey would complement
X-ray and radial-velocity techniques, by extending the parameter space for

periodic orbits for high-dimensional spatio-temporally chaotic systems remains
challenging as known methods either show poor convergence properties because
they are based on time-marching of a chaotic system causing exponential error

and some composite wave function theories (cWFTs). Alas, the accuracies of
popular range-separated hybrid, `rung-4' DFAs, and cWFTs that offer the best
accuracy-vs.-cost trade-off have as yet been established only for datasets
predominantly comprising small molecules, hence, their transferability to
larger datasets remains vague. In this study, we present an extended benchmark
dataset of over 1600 values of $\Delta H_f^\circ$ for structurally and
electronically diverse molecules. We apply quartile-ranking based on
boundary-corrected kernel density estimation to filter outliers and arrive at
Probabilistically Pruned Enthalpies of 1694 compounds (PPE1694). For this
dataset, we rank the prediction accuracies of G4, G4(MP2), ccCA, CBS-QB3 and 23
popular DFAs using conventional and probabilistic error metrics. We discuss
systematic prediction errors and highlight the role an empirical higher-level
correction (HLC) plays in the G4(MP2) model. Furthermore, we comment on
uncertainties associated with the reference empirical data for atoms and the
systematic errors stemming from these that grow with the molecular size. We
believe these findings to aid in identifying meaningful application domains for
quantum thermochemical methods.

needs to trade off the exploration of the environment and the exploitation of
the samples to optimize its behavior. Whether we optimize for regret, sample
complexity, state-space coverage or model estimation, we need to strike a
different exploration-exploitation trade-off. In this paper, we propose to
tackle the exploration-exploitation problem following a decoupled approach
composed of: 1) An ""objective-specific"" algorithm that (adaptively) prescribes
how many samples to collect at which states, as if it has access to a
generative model (i.e., a simulator of the environment); 2) An
""objective-agnostic"" sample collection exploration strategy responsible for
generating the prescribed samples as fast as possible. Building on recent
methods for exploration in the stochastic shortest path problem, we first
provide an algorithm that, given as input the number of samples $b(s,a)$ needed
in each state-action pair, requires $\tilde{O}(B D + D^{3/2} S^2 A)$ time steps
to collect the $B=\sum_{s,a} b(s,a)$ desired samples, in any unknown
communicating MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions and diameter $D$. Then we show
how this general-purpose exploration algorithm can be paired with
""objective-specific"" strategies that prescribe the sample requirements to
tackle a variety of settings -- e.g., model estimation, sparse reward
discovery, goal-free cost-free exploration in communicating MDPs -- for which
we obtain improved or novel sample complexity guarantees.

authority aiming to maximize social welfare at equilibrium can intervene by
paying some cost to shift individual incentives, and the optimal intervention
can be computed using the spectral decomposition of the graph, yet this is
infeasible in practice if the adjacency matrix is unknown. In this paper, we
study the question of designing intervention strategies for graphs where the
adjacency matrix is unknown and is drawn from some distribution. For several
commonly studied random graph models, we show that there is a single
intervention, proportional to the first eigenvector of the expected adjacency
matrix, which is near-optimal for almost all generated graphs when the budget
is sufficiently large. We also provide several efficient sampling-based
approaches for approximately recovering the first eigenvector when we do not
know the distribution. On the whole, our analysis compares three categories of
interventions: those which use no data about the network, those which use some
data (such as distributional knowledge or queries to the graph), and those
which are fully optimal. We evaluate these intervention strategies on synthetic
and real-world network data, and our results suggest that analysis of random
graph models can be useful for determining when certain heuristics may perform
well in practice.

  Non-Replicable Value and Damage: When the Social Discount Rate may become
  Negative","40 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-fin.MF q-fin.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a model that adds a non-linearity to discounting:
the discounting factor may depend on the notional (i.e., discounted values are
no longer linear in the notional). In the first part of the paper, we provide a
discounting when discount factors cannot be derived from market products. That
is, a risk-neutralising trading strategy cannot be performed. This is the case
when one needs a risk-free (default-free) discounting, but default protection
on funding providers is not traded. For this case, we derive a default
compensation factor that describes the present value of a strategy to
compensate for default (like buying default protection would do). In a second
part of the paper, we introduce a model where the survival probability, and
hence the discount factor, depends on the notional. This model introduces an
effect not present in the classical modelling of a time-dependent survival
probability. Our model allows that large liquidity requirements are more likely
to default instantly than small ones. Combined, the two models build a
framework where discounting (and hence valuation) is non-linear: discount
factors depend on the amount to be discounted.
  Our approach builds on top of the classical theory of discounting (which may
either be given as market-implied or be derived from a model of utility,
consumption and production). In that sense, it is rather a generalisation than
an alternative. The modelling approach has specific relevance for climate
models, where discounting is an important aspect in assessing the severity of
future events. Our model may result in non-decaying discount factors (negative
discount rates) for certain scenarios.

in 2019 corresponding to an increase of 12 million attendances over the past
ten years. The steadily rising demand at EDs creates a constant challenge to
provide adequate quality of care while maintaining standards and productivity.
Managing hospital demand effectively requires an adequate knowledge of the
future rate of admission. Using 8 years of electronic admissions data from two
major acute care hospitals in London, we develop a novel ensemble methodology
that combines the outcomes of the best performing time series and machine
learning approaches in order to make highly accurate forecasts of demand, 1, 3
and 7 days in the future. Both hospitals face an average daily demand of 208
and 106 attendances respectively and experience considerable volatility around
this mean. However, our approach is able to predict attendances at these
emergency departments one day in advance up to a mean absolute error of +/- 14
and +/- 10 patients corresponding to a mean absolute percentage error of 6.8%
and 8.6% respectively. Our analysis compares machine learning algorithms to
more traditional linear models. We find that linear models often outperform
machine learning methods and that the quality of our predictions for any of the
forecasting horizons of 1, 3 or 7 days are comparable as measured in MAE. In
addition to comparing and combining state-of-the-art forecasting methods to
predict hospital demand, we consider two different hyperparameter tuning
methods, enabling a faster deployment of our models without compromising
performance. We believe our framework can readily be used to forecast a wide
range of policy relevant indicators.

destruction of the carbon skeleton under the physical conditions of two
well-studied PDRs, the Orion Bar and the Horsehead nebula which represent
prototypical examples of PDRs irradiated by ""high"" and ""low"" ultraviolet
radiation field. PAHs are described as microcanonical systems. The acetylene
molecule is considered as the main carbonaceous fragment of the PAH
dissociation as it follows from laboratory experiments and theory. We estimated
the rates of acetylene production in gas phase chemical reactions and compared
them with the rates of the acetylene production through the PAH dissociation.
It is found that the latter rates can be higher than the former rates in the
Orion Bar at $A_{\rm V}<1$ and also at $A_{\rm V}>3.5$. In the Horsehead
nebula, the chemical reactions provide more acetylene than the PAH
dissociation. The produced acetylene participate in the reactions of the
formation of small hydrocarbons (C$_2$H, C$_3$H, C$_3$H$^{+}$, C$_3$H$_2$,
C$_4$H). Acetylene production via the PAH destruction may increase the
abundances of small hydrocarbons produced in gas phase chemical reactions in
the Orion Bar only at $A_{\rm V}>3.5$. In the Horsehead nebula, the
contribution of PAHs to the abundances of the small hydrocarbons is negligible.
We conclude that the PAHs are not a major source of small hydrocarbons in both

real-time performance, however, they are dominated by anchor-based detectors
which are inefficient and require additional post-processing. In this paper, we
eliminate anchors and model an object as a single point--the center point of
its bounding box. Based on the center point, we propose an anchor-free
CenterNet3D network that performs 3D object detection without anchors. Our
CenterNet3D uses keypoint estimation to find center points and directly
regresses 3D bounding boxes. However, because inherent sparsity of point
clouds, 3D object center points are likely to be in empty space which makes it
difficult to estimate accurate boundaries. To solve this issue, we propose an
extra corner attention module to enforce the CNN backbone to pay more attention
to object boundaries. Besides, considering that one-stage detectors suffer from
the discordance between the predicted bounding boxes and corresponding
classification confidences, we develop an efficient keypoint-sensitive warping
operation to align the confidences to the predicted bounding boxes. Our
proposed CenterNet3D is non-maximum suppression free which makes it more
efficient and simpler. We evaluate CenterNet3D on the widely used KITTI dataset

scheme for continuum and rarefied flows which combines the benefits of both
Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS). By
reconstruction of gas distribution function using particle velocity
characteristic line, flux contains more detailed information of fluid flow and
more concrete physical nature. In this work, a simplified DUGKS is proposed
with reconstruction stage on a whole time step instead of half time step in
original DUGKS. Using temporal/spatial integral Boltzmann Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
(BGK) equation, the transformed distribution function with inclusion of
collision effect is constructed. The macro and mesoscopic fluxes of the cell on
next time step is predicted by reconstruction of transformed distribution
function at interfaces along particle velocity characteristic lines. According
to the conservation law, the macroscopic variables of the cell on next time
step can be updated through its macroscopic flux. Equilibrium distribution
function on next time step can also be updated. Gas distribution function is
updated by FV scheme through its predicted mesoscopic flux in a time step.
Compared with the original DUGKS, the computational process of the proposed
method is more concise because of the omission of half time step flux
calculation. Numerical time step is only limited by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
(CFL) condition and relatively good stability has been preserved. Several test
cases, including the Couette flow, lid-driven cavity flow, laminar flows over a
flat plate, a circular cylinder, and an airfoil, as well as micro cavity flow
cases are conducted to validate present scheme. The numerical simulation
results agree well with the references' results.

parking availability sensing to predict parking occupancy in areas in which the
parking data is insufficient to feed into data-hungry models. This framework
overcomes two main challenges: 1) many real-world cases cannot provide enough
data for most existing data-driven models, and 2) it is difficult to merge
sensor data and heterogeneous contextual information due to the differing urban
fabric and spatial characteristics. Our work adopts a widely-used concept,
adversarial domain adaptation, to predict the parking occupancy in an area
without abundant sensor data by leveraging data from other areas with similar
features. In this paper, we utilise more than 35 million parking data records
from sensors placed in two different cities, one a city centre and the other a
coastal tourist town. We also utilise heterogeneous spatio-temporal contextual
information from external resources, including weather and points of interest.
We quantify the strength of our proposed framework in different cases and
compare it to the existing data-driven approaches. The results show that the
proposed framework is comparable to existing state-of-the-art methods and also

basin of attraction of a dynamical system? This is a question of quite general
interest, and has stimulated a lot of activities in dynamical and stochastic
systems where the metric of this estimation is often known as the transient or
first passage time. In nonlinear systems, one often experiences long transients
due to their underlying dynamics. We apply resetting or restart, an emerging
concept in statistical physics and stochastic process, to mitigate the
detrimental effects of prolonged transients in deterministic dynamical systems.
We show that stopping an ongoing process at intermittent time only to restart
all over from a spatial control line, can dramatically expedite its completion,
resulting in a huge decrease in mean transient time. Moreover, our study
unfolds a net reduction in fluctuations around the mean. Our claim is
established with detailed numerical studies on the Stuart-Landau limit cycle

analysis opens up a door to control the mean and fluctuations in transient time
by unifying the original dynamics with an external stochastic or periodic

multidimensional state measurements. These devices often operate in distinct
modes based on external conditions (day/night, occupied/vacant, etc.), and to
prevent complete or partial system outage, we would like to recognize as early
as possible when these devices begin to operate outside the normal modes.
Unfortunately, it is often impractical or impossible to predict failures using
rules or supervised machine learning, because failure modes are too complex,
devices are too new to adequately characterize in a specific environment, or
environmental change puts the device into an unpredictable condition. We
propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method that creates a negative sample
from the positive, observed sample, and trains a classifier to distinguish
between positive and negative samples. Using the Contraction Principle, we
explain why such a classifier ought to establish suitable decision boundaries
between normal and anomalous regions, and show how Integrated Gradients can
attribute the anomaly to specific variables within the anomalous state vector.
We have demonstrated that negative sampling with random forest or neural
network classifiers yield significantly higher AUC scores than Isolation
Forest, One Class SVM, and Deep SVDD, against (a) a synthetic dataset with
dimensionality ranging between 2 and 128, with 1, 2, and 3 modes, and with and

multidimensional, multimodal dataset from real climate control devices.
Finally, we describe how negative sampling with neural network classifiers have
been successfully deployed at large scale to predict failures in real time in

behavior of structures beyond their elastic limits. The purpose of multiscale
materials science models, among them crystal plasticity models, is to
understand the material behavior and design the material for a given target.
The current successful continuum hyperelastoplastic models are based in the
multiplicative decomposition from crystal plasticity, but significant
differences in the computational frameworks of both approaches remain, making
comparisons not straightforward.
  In previous works we have presented a theory for multiplicative continuum
elastoplasticity which solved many long-standing issues, preserving the
appealing structure of additive infinitesimal Wilkins algorithms. In this work
we extend the theory to crystal plasticity. We show that the new formulation
for crystal plasticity is parallel and comparable to continuum plasticity,
preserving the attractive aspects of the framework: (1) simplicity of the
kinematics reaching a parallelism with the infinitesimal framework; (2)
possibility of very large elastic strains and unrestricted type of hyperelastic
behavior; (3) immediate plain backward-Euler algorithmic implementation of the
continuum theory avoiding algorithmically motivated exponential mappings, yet
preserving isochoric flow; (4) absence of Mandel-type stresses in the
formulation; (5) objectiveness and weak-invariance by construction due to the
use of flow rules in terms of elastic corrector rates. We compare the results
of our crystal plasticity formulation with the classical formulation from
Kalidindi and Anand based on quadratic strains and an exponential mapping
update of the plastic deformation gradient.

while they are also difficult to solve due to their characteristics of
nonlinearity and multiple roots. Evolutionary algorithm (EA) is one of the
methods for solving NESs, given their global search capability and an ability
to locate multiple roots of a NES simultaneously within one run. Currently, the
majority of research on using EAs to solve NESs focuses on transformation
techniques and improving the performance of the used EAs. By contrast, the
problem domain knowledge of NESs is particularly investigated in this study,
using which we propose to incorporate the variable reduction strategy (VRS)
into EAs to solve NESs. VRS makes full use of the systems of expressing a NES
and uses some variables (i.e., core variable) to represent other variables
(i.e., reduced variables) through the variable relationships existing in the
equation systems. It enables to reduce partial variables and equations and
shrink the decision space, thereby reducing the complexity of the problem and
improving the search efficiency of the EAs. To test the effectiveness of VRS in
dealing with NESs, this paper integrates VRS into two existing state-of-the-art
EA methods (i.e., MONES and DRJADE), respectively. Experimental results show
that, with the assistance of VRS, the EA methods can significantly produce
better results than the original methods and other compared methods.

is carried out to investigate the behaviours of Renyi dimensions, Dq and
Multifractal Spectral Function, $f(\alpha_q)$. The Renyi dimensions, $D_q$, are
observed to decrease with increasing order of the moments, $q$. However, the
Multifractal Spectra are concave downwards with their maxima occurring around
$\alpha_q = 1.21 \pm 0.01$. A continuous curve representing Multifractal
Spectral Function, $f(\alpha_q)$, characterizes manifestation of fluctuations
in the rapidity space.

Lefschetz property on $M^{2n}$. We also prove that the complete symplectic
manifold $M^{2n}$ satisfies $L^{2}$-hard Lefschetz property if and only if
every class of $L^{2}$-harmonic forms contains a $L^{2}$ symplectic harmonic
form. As an application, we get if $M^{2n}$ is a closed symplectic parabolic
manifold which satisfies the hard Lefschetz property, then its Euler
characteristic satisfies the inequality $(-1)^{n}\chi(M^{2n})\geq0$.
