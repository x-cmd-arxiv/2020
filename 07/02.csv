$T$ a renewal process independent of $X$ with inter-arrival times $\tau$. We
show general conditions under which the sampled process
$(X_{T_i},T_i-T_{i-1})^{\top}$ is strongly mixing or weakly dependent.
Moreover, we explicitly compute the strong mixing or weak dependence
coefficients of the renewal sampled process and show that exponential or power
decay of the coefficients of $X$ is preserved (at least asymptotically). Our
results imply that essentially all central limit theorems available in the

are assumed to occur instantaneously. For describing the dynamics of those
systems, Markov models that require exponentially distributed inter-event times
have been used widely. However, some biophysical processes such as gene
transcription and translation are known to have a significant gap between the
initiation and the completion of the processes, which renders the usual
assumption of exponential distribution untenable. In this paper, we consider
relaxing this assumption by incorporating age-dependent random time delays into
the system dynamics. We do so by constructing a measure-valued Markov process
on a more abstract state space, which allows us to keep track of the ""ages"" of
molecules participating in a chemical reaction.
  We study the large-volume limit of such age-structured systems. We show that,
when appropriately scaled, the stochastic system can be approximated by a
system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in the large-volume limit, as
opposed to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in the classical theory. We
show how the limiting PDE system can be used for the purpose of further model
reductions and for devising efficient simulation algorithms. In order to
describe the ideas, we use a simple transcription process as a running example.
We, however, note that the methods developed in this paper apply to a wide
class of biophysical systems.

this `trinity' of relational quantum dynamics holds in relativistic settings
per frequency superselection sector. We ascribe the time according to the clock
subsystem to a POVM which is covariant with respect to its (quadratic)

observable conjugate to the clock momentum. It also resolves Kucha\v{r}'s
criticism that the Page-Wootters formalism yields incorrect localization
probabilities for the relativistic particle when conditioning on a Minkowski

results in a Newton-Wigner type localization probability commonly used in
relativistic quantum mechanics. By establishing the equivalence mentioned
above, we also assign a consistent conditional-probability interpretation to
relational observables and deparametrizations. Finally, we expand a recent
method of changing temporal reference frames, and show how to transform states
and observables frequency-sector-wise. We use this method to discuss an
indirect clock self-reference effect and explore the state and temporal

of a closed curve $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^1\to M$ immersed in a complete Riemannian
manifold $(M,g)$ as the sum of the length of the curve and the $L^p$--norm of
its curvature (with respect to the length measure). We are interested in the
convergence of the $(L^p,L^{p'})$--gradient flow of these energies to critical
points. By means of parabolic estimates, it is usually possible to prove
sub-convergence of the flow, that is, convergence to critical points up to
reparametrizations and, more importantly, up to isometry of the ambient.
Assuming that the flow sub-converges, we are interested in proving the smooth
convergence of the flow, that is, the existence of the full limit of the
evolving flow. We first give an overview of the general strategy one can apply
for proving such a statement. The crucial step is the application of a
Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality, of which we present a versatile version.
Then we apply such strategy to the flow of $\mathscr{E}$ of curves into
manifolds, proving the desired improvement of sub-convergence to full smooth
convergence of the flow to critical points. As corollaries, we obtain the
smooth convergence of the flow for $p=2$ in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$,
in the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$, and in the two-dimensional sphere

organization in tissue via cell-graphs to tumor grades. Though cell
organization is imperative, it is insufficient to entirely represent the
histopathological structure. We propose a novel hierarchical
cell-to-tissue-graph (HACT) representation to improve the structural depiction
of the tissue. It consists of a low-level cell-graph, capturing cell morphology
and interactions, a high-level tissue-graph, capturing morphology and spatial
distribution of tissue parts, and cells-to-tissue hierarchies, encoding the
relative spatial distribution of the cells with respect to the tissue
distribution. Further, a hierarchical graph neural network (HACT-Net) is
proposed to efficiently map the HACT representations to histopathological
breast cancer subtypes. We assess the methodology on a large set of annotated
tissue regions of interest from H\&E stained breast carcinoma whole-slides.
Upon evaluation, the proposed method outperformed recent convolutional neural
network and graph neural network approaches for breast cancer multi-class
subtyping. The proposed entity-based topological analysis is more inline with
the pathological diagnostic procedure of the tissue. It provides more command
over the tissue modelling, therefore encourages the further inclusion of
pathological priors into task-specific tissue representation.

several advantages over conventional X-ray imaging. By performing measurements
with two distinct X-ray spectra, differences in energy-dependent attenuation
are exploited to obtain material-specific information. This information is used
in various imaging applications to improve clinical diagnosis. In recent years,
grating-based X-ray dark-field imaging has received increasing attention in the
imaging community. The X-ray dark-field signal originates from ultra
small-angle scattering within an object and thus provides information about the
microstructure far below the spatial resolution of the imaging system. This
property has led to a number of promising future imaging applications that are
currently being investigated. However, different microstructures can hardly be
distinguished with current X-ray dark-field imaging techniques, since the
detected dark-field signal only represents the total amount of ultra
small-angle scattering. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel
concept called dual-energy X-ray dark-field material decomposition, which
transfers the basic material decomposition approach from attenuation-based
dual-energy imaging to the dark-field imaging modality. We develop a physical
model and algorithms for dual-energy dark-field material decomposition and
evaluate the proposed concept in experimental measurements. Our results suggest
that by sampling the energy-dependent dark-field signal with two different
X-ray spectra, a decomposition into two different microstructured materials is
possible. Similar to dual-energy imaging, the additional
microstructure-specific information could be useful for clinical diagnosis.

an early example, with large $N$ free fields subjected to a singlet constraint.
This study in dimensions $d>2$ motivates technical modifications of the
original OTH to allow for generalised free fields. Furthermore, Huygens'
principle, valid for wave equations only in even dimensions, leads to
differences in thermalisation. It works straightforwardly when Huygens'
principle applies, but thermalisation is more elusive if it does not apply.
Instead, in odd dimensions we find a link to resurgence theory by noting that
exponential relaxation is analogous to non-perturbative corrections to an
asymptotic perturbation expansion. Without applying the power of resurgence
technology we still find support for thermalisation in odd dimensions, although

these connections a large scale heterogeneous weighted graph is formulated. In
this labyrinth of interactions that are continuously updated, there exists a
variety of similarity-based patterns that can provide insights into the
dynamics of the financial system. With the current work, we propose the
application of Graph Representation Learning in a scalable dynamic setting as a
means of capturing these patterns in a meaningful and robust way. We proceed to
perform a rigorous qualitative analysis of the latent trajectories to extract
real world insights from the proposed representations and their evolution over
time that is to our knowledge the first of its kind in the financial sector.
Shifts in the latent space are associated with known economic events and in
particular the impact of the recent Covid-19 pandemic to consumer patterns.
Capturing such patterns indicates the value added to financial modeling through
the incorporation of latent graph representations.

that a non-improvable initial data set without local symmetries must sit inside
a null perfect fluid spacetime carrying a global Killing vector field. We also
show that the dominant energy scalar is always almost improvable in a precise

stationary conjecture.
  Along the way we observe that in dimensions greater than eight there exist
pp-wave counterexamples (without the optimal decay rate for asymptotically
flatness) to the equality case of the spacetime positive mass theorem. As a
consequence, there exist counterexamples to Bartnik's stationary and strict

that the eigen-basis (a $p \times k$ matrix) is approximately sparse. We
propose a method that presumes the $p \times k$ matrix becomes approximately
sparse after a $k \times k$ rotation. The simplest version of the algorithm
initializes with the leading $k$ principal components. Then, the principal
components are rotated with an $k \times k$ orthogonal rotation to make them
approximately sparse. Finally, soft-thresholding is applied to the rotated
principal components. This approach differs from prior approaches because it
uses an orthogonal rotation to approximate a sparse basis. One consequence is
that a sparse component need not to be a leading eigenvector, but rather a
mixture of them. In this way, we propose a new (rotated) basis for sparse PCA.
In addition, our approach avoids ""deflation"" and multiple tuning parameters
required for that. Our sparse PCA framework is versatile; for example, it
extends naturally to a two-way analysis of a data matrix for simultaneous
dimensionality reduction of rows and columns. We provide evidence showing that
for the same level of sparsity, the proposed sparse PCA method is more stable
and can explain more variance compared to alternative methods. Through three
applications -- sparse coding of images, analysis of transcriptome sequencing
data, and large-scale clustering of social networks, we demonstrate the modern
usefulness of sparse PCA in exploring multivariate data.

cameras (to increase the signal-to-noise) and, given the many observations of
the source, we were able to compute the time-lags spectra in three different
flux levels/periods. We fitted the time-lags and energy spectra,
simultaneously, using a new X-ray reverberation code which computes the time
dependent reflection spectra of the disc as a response to an X-ray flash from a
point source located on the axis of the black-hole (BH) accretion disc
(lamp-post geometry). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time for
an AGN that both time-lags and energy spectra are fitted by a model
simultaneously in different flux periods. The model fits in the case when the
BH is rapidly rotating are significantly better than the model fits in the case
of a Schwarzschild BH. This result strongly favours the hypothesis of a
rotating central BH in this source. We also detect significant variations in
the height of the X-ray corona. The X-ray height appears to increase from 3-5
gravitational radii when the X-ray luminosity is of the order of 1.5-3 percent

public debates. Additionally, extreme opinions on different topics often show
significant correlations. The dynamics leading to these polarized ideological
opinions pose a challenge: How can such correlations emerge, without assuming
them a priori in the individual preferences or in a preexisting social
structure? Here we propose a simple model that qualitatively reproduces
ideological opinion states found in survey data, even between rather unrelated,
but sufficiently controversial, topics. Inspired by skew coordinate systems
recently proposed in natural language processing models, we solidify these
intuitions in a formalism of opinions unfolding in a multidimensional space
where topics form a non-orthogonal basis. Opinions evolve according to the
social interactions among the agents, which are ruled by homophily: two agents
sharing similar opinions are more likely to interact. The model features phase
transitions between a global consensus, opinion polarization, and ideological
states. Interestingly, the ideological phase emerges by relaxing the assumption
of an orthogonal basis of the topic space, i.e. if topics thematically overlap.
Furthermore, we analytically and numerically show that these transitions are
driven by the controversialness of the topics discussed, the more controversial
the topics, the more likely are opinion to be correlated. Our findings shed
light upon the mechanisms driving the emergence of ideology in the formation of
opinions.

German sign language videos, we demonstrate that on the relatively scarce
training data of 2.800 videos, modern deep learning architectures for video

this leaves us with a probability of under 25% that a 5 letter word is spelled

The contribution of this paper is to propose a convolutional neural network for
spell-correction that expects the softmax outputs of the character recognition
network (instead of a misspelled word) as an input. We demonstrate that purely
learning on softmax inputs in combination with scarce training data yields
overfitting as the network learns the inputs by heart. In contrast, training
the network on several variants of the logits of the classification output i.e.
scaling by a constant factor, adding of random noise, mixing of softmax and
hardmax inputs or purely training on hardmax inputs, leads to better
generalization while benefitting from the significant information hidden in

address this ambiguity, we develop a model that couples crust and mantle

chemical structure and evolution. We demonstrate that magmatic segregation and
volcanic eruptions lead to differentiation of the mantle, the extent of which
depends on how easily high temperature melts from the more refractory lower

originate from this lower mantle region, and that such eruptions act to limit

conditions, arising from complex interactions of biological and environmental

Current methods for detecting anxiety heavily rely on in-person interviews,
which can be expensive, time-consuming, and blocked by social stigmas. In this
work, we propose an alternative method to identify individuals with anxiety and
further estimate their levels of anxiety using personal online activity
histories from YouTube and the Google Search engine, platforms that are used by
millions of people daily. We ran a longitudinal study and collected multiple
rounds of anonymized YouTube and Google Search logs from volunteering
participants, along with their clinically validated ground-truth anxiety
assessment scores. We then developed explainable features that capture both the
temporal and contextual aspects of online behaviors. Using those, we were able
to train models that (i) identify individuals having anxiety disorder with an
average F1 score of 0.83 and (ii) assess the level of anxiety by predicting the
gold standard Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scores (ranges from 0 to 21)

cost-effective, time-saving, scalable, and opens the door for it to be deployed

biased ($-20$ V or $-130$ V), nitrogen doped micro-crystalline diamond films
are introduced to a low pressure deuterium plasma (helicon source operated in
capacitive mode, 2 Pa, 26 W) and negative ion energy distribution functions
(NIEDFs) are measured via mass spectrometry with respect to the surface
temperature (30$^{\circ}$C to 750$^{\circ}$C) and dopant concentration. The
results suggest that nitrogen doping has little influence on the yield when the
sample is biased at $-130$ V, but when a relatively small bias voltage of $-20$
V is applied the yield is increased by a factor of 2 above that of un-doped
diamond when its temperature reaches 550$^{\circ}$C. The doping of diamond with
nitrogen is a new method for controlling the surface production of negative

simply-typed lambda calculus and cartesian closed categories to the
bicategorical setting, then use the resulting type theory to prove a coherence
result for cartesian closed bicategories. Cartesian closed
bicategories---2-categories `up to isomorphism' equipped with similarly weak
products and exponentials---arise in logic, categorical algebra, and game
semantics. I show that there is at most one 2-cell between any parallel pair of
1-cells in the free cartesian closed bicategory on a set and hence---in terms
of the difficulty of calculating---bring the data of cartesian closed
bicategories down to the familiar level of cartesian closed categories.
  In fact, I prove this result in two ways. The first argument is closely
related to Power's coherence theorem for bicategories with flexible bilimits.
For the second, which is the central preoccupation of this thesis, the proof
strategy has two parts: the construction of a type theory, and the proof that
it satisfies a form of normalisation I call ""local coherence"". I synthesise the
type theory from algebraic principles using a novel generalisation of the
(multisorted) abstract clones of universal algebra, called ""biclones"". Using a
bicategorical treatment of M. Fiore's categorical analysis of
normalisation-by-evaluation, I then prove a normalisation result which entails
the coherence theorem for cartesian closed bicategories. In contrast to
previous coherence results for bicategories, the argument does not rely on the
theory of rewriting or strictify using the Yoneda embedding. Along the way I
prove bicategorical generalisations of a series of well-established
category-theoretic results, present a notion of glueing of bicategories, and
bicategorify the folklore result providing sufficient conditions for a glueing
category to be cartesian closed.

coherent structures evolving in the turbulent boundary layer. The analysis is
performed using data from a large-eddy simulation of a Mach 0.4 jet. Azimuthal
decomposition of the velocity field in the nozzle shows that turbulent kinetic
energy predominantly resides in high azimuthal wavenumbers; the first three
azimuthal wavenumbers, that are important for sound generation, contain much
lower, but non-zero amplitudes. Using two-point statistics, low azimuthal modes
in the nozzle boundary layer are shown to exhibit significant correlations with
modes of same order in the free-jet region. Spectral Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (SPOD) is used to distill a low-rank approximation of the flow
dynamics. This reveals the existence of tilted coherent structures within the
nozzle boundary layer and shows that these are coupled with wavepackets in the
jet. The educed nozzle boundary-layer structures are modelled using a local
linear stability analysis of the nozzle mean flow. Projection of the leading
SPOD modes on the stability eigenmodes shows that the organised boundary-layer
structures can be modelled using a small number of stable eigenmodes of the
boundary-layer branch of the eigenspectrum, indicating the prevalence of
non-modal effects. Finally local and global resolvent analysis of the mean-flow

successfully described with optimal resolvent response modes, whose associated
forcing modes are observed to tilt against the nozzle boundary-layer,

data from unknown interventions on the underlying system; thus, we can hope to
discover the correct underlying causal graph without explicit interventions. We
evaluate our method in a planar multi-body interaction environment and
scenarios involving fabrics of different shapes like shirts and pants.
Experiments demonstrate that our model can correctly identify the interactions

SrBi$_4$Ti$_4$O$_{15}$ (as a matrix) and a perovskite phase material (e.g.,
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ or, La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ as filler). Such a
colossal value of $\alpha$ can be attributed to contributions from the enhanced
density of states due to the effective low dimensional character of Bi$_2$O$_2$
layer. The corresponding thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) and the electrical
conductivity ($\sigma$) lies in the range 0.7 - 1.25 W/m-K and 10 - 100
$\mu$S/m, respectively at 300\,K. Attributed to the high $\alpha$ values, such
oxide composites can be used as thermopile sensors and highly sensitive
bolometric applications. We anticipate that the demonstration of colossal
$\alpha$ in oxide composites using a simple synthesis strategy also sets the
stage for future material innovations for high temperature thermoelectric
applications.

multiferroic, GaV$_4$S$_8$, as a function of magnetic field and temperature to
determine the magnetic properties for the single electron that is located on
the tetrahedrally coordinated V$_4$ molecular unit. Our results are in good
agreement with the structural transition at 44 K from cubic to rhombohedral
symmetry where the system becomes a robust ferroelectric, while long range
magnetic order develops below 13 K in the form of an incommensurate cycloidal
magnetic structure, which can transform into a N\'eel-type skyrmion phase in a
modest applied magnetic field. Below 5.9(3) K, the crystal enters a
ferromagnetic phase, and we find the magnetic order parameter indicates a long
range ordered ground state with an ordered moment of 0.23(1) ${\mu}_\mathrm{B}$
per V ion. Both polarized and unpolarized neutron data in the
ferroelectric-paramagnetic phase have been measured to determine the magnetic
form factor. The data are consistent with a model of the single spin being
uniformly distributed across the V$_4$ molecular unit, rather than residing on
the single apical V ion, in substantial agreement with the results of
first-principles theory. In the magnetically ordered state, polarized neutron
measurements are important since both the cycloidal and ferromagnetic order
parameters are clearly coupled to the ferroelectricity, causing the structural
peaks to be temperature and field dependent. For the ferromagnetic ground
state, the spins are locked along the $[1,1,1]$ direction by a surprisingly
large anisotropy.

determined at which frequency this homogenized model deviated from a full-wave

decoding protocol as independent task. In this work, we take one step forward
to design a true end-to-end heterogeneous residual convolutional neural network
(HR-CNN) with spectrum decomposition and heterogeneous reconstruction
mechanism. Benefitting from the full CNN architecture and GPU acceleration, the
proposed model considerably improves the reconstruction efficiency. Numerical
experiments show that the overall reconstruction speed reaches to the same
magnitude of the standard CPU JPEG decoding protocol, while both decoding and
artifacts suppression are completed together. We formulate the JPEG artifacts
suppression task as an interactive process of decoding and image detail
reconstructions. A heterogeneous, fully convolutional, mechanism is proposed to
particularly address the uncorrelated nature of different spectral channels.
Directly starting from the JPEG code in k-space, the network first extracts the
spectral samples channel by channel, and restores the spectral snapshots with
expanded throughput. These intermediate snapshots are then heterogeneously
decoded and merged into the pixel space image. A cascaded residual learning
segment is designed to further enhance the image details. Experiments verify
that the model achieves outstanding performance in JPEG artifacts suppression,
while its full convolutional operations and elegant network structure offers
higher computational efficiency for practical online usage compared with other
deep learning models on this topic.

a manifold of dimension NG(P):=d(f_0+f_{d-1})-f_{0,d-1}, which is the natural
guess for the dimension given by the number of variables minus the number of
quadratic equations that are used in the definition of the realization space.
While this indeed holds for many natural classes of polytopes (including simple
and simplicial polytopes, as well as all polytopes of dimension at most 3),and
Robertson claimed this to be true for all polytopes, Mnev's (1986/1988)
Universality Theorem implies that it is not true in general: Indeed, (1) the
centered realization space is not a smoothly embedded manifold in general, and
(2) it does not have the dimension NG(P) in general.
  In this paper we develop Jacobian criteria for the analysis of realization
spaces. From these we get easily that for various large and natural classes of
polytopes the realization spaces are indeed manifolds, whose dimensions are
given by NG(P). However, we also identify the smallest polytopes where the
dimension count (2) and thus Robertson's claim fails, among them the bipyramid

  Era",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper revisits the issue of the performance of DNS resolution services
available to Internet users. While several prior studies addressed this
important issue, significant developments, namely, the IPv6 finally getting
traction and the adoption of the ECS extension to DNS by major DNS resolution
services, warrant a reassessment under these new realities. We find that DNS
resolution services differ drastically -- by an order of magnitude in some
locations -- in their query response time. We also find established resolvers
(Google DNS and OpenDNS) to lag far behind relative newcomers (Cloudflair and
Quad9) in terms of DNS latency, and trace the cause to drastically lower cache
hit rates, which we further trace to less cache sharing within the resolver
platform. In addition, we find that public resolvers have largely closed the
gap with ISP resolvers in the quality of CDNs' client-to-edge-server mappings
as measured by latency. Finally, in most locations, we observe IPv6 penalty in
the latency of client-to-CDN-edge-server mappings produced by the resolvers.
Moreover, this penalty, while often significant, still does not rise above
typical thresholds employed by the Happy Eyeballs algorithm for preferring IPv4
communication. resolvers. Thus, dual-stacked clients in these locations may
experience suboptimal performance.

the Swapping Autoencoder, a deep model designed specifically for image

with two independent components and enforce that any swapped combination maps
to a realistic image. In particular, we encourage the components to represent
structure and texture, by enforcing one component to encode co-occurrent patch
statistics across different parts of an image. As our method is trained with an
encoder, finding the latent codes for a new input image becomes trivial, rather
than cumbersome. As a result, it can be used to manipulate real input images in
various ways, including texture swapping, local and global editing, and latent
code vector arithmetic. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our model
produces better results and is substantially more efficient compared to recent

commonly attributed to dark matter $-$ arise instead from a non-standard
velocity-dependent force that causes two-body near-Keplerian orbits to expand.
We show that the predicted expansion of the Earth-Moon orbit is incompatible
with lunar laser ranging data at $>200\sigma$. Moreover, SID predicts that the
gravitating mass of any object was much smaller in the past. If true, a
low-mass red giant star must be significantly older than in standard theory.
This would make it much older than the conventional age of the Universe, which
however is expected to be similarly old in SID. Moreover, it is not completely
clear whether SID truly contains new physics beyond General Relativity, with
several previous works arguing that the extra degree of freedom is purely
mathematical. We conclude that the SID model is falsified at high significance
by observations across a range of scales, even if it is theoretically well

Probe (e-POP) satellite at low altitudes ($\sim$400 km)[Shen et al., 2018]. We
argue that in order to reproduce ion temperatures observed at e-POP altitudes,
the most effective ion heating mechanism is through cyclotron acceleration by
short-scale electrostatic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves with perpendicular
wavelengths $\lambda_{\perp}$$\leq$200 m. The interplay between finite
perpendicular wavelengths, wave amplitudes, and ion-neutral collision
frequencies collectively determine the ionospheric ion heating limit, which
begins to decrease sharply with decreasing altitude below approximately 500 km,
where the ratio $\frac{\nu_c}{f_{ci}}$ becomes larger than 10$^{-3}$, $\nu_c$
and $f_{ci}$ denoting the O$^+$--O collision frequency and ion cyclotron
frequency. We derive, both numerically and analytically, the ion gyroradius
limit from heating by an EIC wave at half the cyclotron frequency. The limit is
0.28$\lambda_{\perp}$. The ion gyroradius limit from an EIC wave can be
surpassed either through adding waves with different $\lambda_{\perp}$, or
through stochastic ""breakout"", meaning ions diffuse in energy beyond the
gyroradius limit due to stochastic heating from large-amplitude waves. Our
two-dimensional simulations indicate that small-scale ($<$1 km) Alfv\'en waves

decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ in the distance $r$ provide an experimentally
realizable resource for information processing, whilst still retaining

implement a fast quantum fanout gate with an arbitrary number of targets. Our
implementation allows the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and Shor's algorithm

convolution. A two-SSP model suggests intrinsic gradients are as strong as
observed in local PSB galaxies ($\approx -0.8$ \r{A}$/R_e$). We interpret these
results in terms of inside-out growth (for the bulk of the quiescent

At $z\approx0.8$, central starbursts are often the result of gas-rich mergers,
as evidenced by the high fraction of PSB galaxies with disturbed morphologies

paths to quiescence: a standard path, associated with inside-out disc formation

centrally-concentrated starbursts, leaving an inverse age gradient and smaller

violations of this quintessential property of lattice gauge theories can have
dramatic consequences, e.g., the generation of a photon mass in quantum
electrodynamics. Here, we introduce an experimentally friendly method to
protect gauge invariance in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theories against
coherent errors in a controllable way. Our method employs only single-body
energy-penalty terms, thus enabling practical implementations. As we derive
analytically, some sets of penalty coefficients render undesired gauge sectors
inaccessible by unitary dynamics for exponentially long times, and, for
few-body error terms, with resources independent of system size. These findings
constitute an exponential improvement over previously known results from
energy-gap protection or perturbative treatments. In our method, the
gauge-invariant subspace is protected by an emergent global symmetry, meaning
it can be immediately applied to other symmetries. In our numerical benchmarks
for continuous-time and digital quantum simulations, gauge protection holds for
all calculated evolution times (up to $t>10^{10}/J$ for continuous time, with
$J$ the relevant energy scale). Crucially, our gauge-protection technique is
simpler to realize than the associated ideal gauge theory, and can thus be
readily implemented in current ultracold-atom analog simulators as well as

operators involving right-handed neutrinos, focussing on the regime where the
right-handed neutrinos decay promptly on collider scales to a photon and a
Standard Model neutrino. This scenario arises naturally for right-handed
neutrinos with masses of the order $m_N \sim 0.1 \dots 10\, \text{GeV}$. We
limit the relevant dimension-six operator coefficients using LEP and LHC
searches with photons and missing energy in the final state as well as pion and
tau decays. While bounds on new physics contributions are generally in the TeV
scale for order one operator coefficients, some coefficients, however, remain
very poorly constrained or even entirely evade bounds from current data.
Consequently, we identify such weakly constrained scenarios and propose new
searches for rare top and tau decays involving photons to probe potential new
physics in the $\nu$SMEFT parameter space. Our analysis highlights the
importance of performing dedicated searches for new rare tau and top decays.

protocols is automatically broken if the Adversary is allowed to perform
superposition queries and the honest players forced to perform actions
coherently on quantum states. Another widely held intuition is that enforcing
measurements on the exchanged messages is enough to protect protocols from
these attacks.
  However, the reality is much more complex. Security models dealing with
superposition attacks only consider unconditional security. Conversely,
security models considering computational security assume that all supposedly
classical messages are measured, which forbids by construction the analysis of
superposition attacks. Boneh and Zhandry have started to study the quantum
computational security for classical primitives in their seminal work at
Crypto'13, but only in the single-party setting. To the best of our knowledge,
an equivalent model in the multiparty setting is still missing.
  In this work, we propose the first computational security model considering
superposition attacks for multiparty protocols. We show that our new security
model is satisfiable by proving the security of the well-known One-Time-Pad
protocol and give an attack on a variant of the equally reputable Yao Protocol
for Secure Two-Party Computations. The post-mortem of this attack reveals the
precise points of failure, yielding highly counter-intuitive results: Adding
extra classical communication, which is harmless for classical security, can
make the protocol become subject to superposition attacks. We use this newly
imparted knowledge to construct the first concrete protocol for Secure
Two-Party Computation that is resistant to superposition attacks. Our results
show that there is no straightforward answer to provide for either the
vulnerabilities of classical protocols to superposition attacks or the adapted
countermeasures.

is limited and there is a strong interaction among subsystems, learning local
models and control policies offers great potential for designing
high-performance controllers. At the same time, the lack of safety guarantees,
here considered in the form of constraint satisfaction, prevents the use of
data-driven techniques to safety-critical distributed systems. This paper
presents a safety framework that guarantees constraint satisfaction for
uncertain distributed systems while learning. The framework considers linear
systems with coupling in the dynamics and subject to bounded parametric
uncertainty, and makes use of robust invariance to guarantee safety. In
particular, a robust non-convex invariant set, given by the union of multiple
ellipsoidal invariant sets, and a nonlinear backup control law, given by the
combination of multiple stabilizing linear feedbacks, are computed offline. In
presence of unsafe inputs, the safety framework applies the backup control law,
preventing the system to violate the constraints. As the robust invariant set
and the backup stabilizing controller are computed offline, the online
operations reduce to simple function evaluations, which enables the use of the
proposed framework on systems with limited computational resources. The
capabilities of the safety framework are illustrated by three numerical
examples.

vanishes (the generalized `superconducting' plasma state), the horizon profile

difference between the source and target domains and respect their specific
discriminative information, by establishing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)
and the discriminative distances. However, they usually accumulate to consider
those statistics and deal with their relationships by estimating parameters
blindly. This paper theoretically proves two essential facts: 1) minimizing the
MMD equals to maximize the source and target intra-class distances respectively
but jointly minimize their variance with some implicit weights, so that the
feature discriminability degrades; 2) the relationship between the intra-class
and inter-class distances is as one falls, another rises. Based on this, we
propose a novel discriminative MMD. On one hand, we consider the intra-class
and inter-class distances alone to remove a redundant parameter, and the
revealed weights provide their approximate optimal ranges. On the other hand,
we design two different strategies to boost the feature discriminability: 1) we
directly impose a trade-off parameter on the implicit intra-class distance in
MMD to regulate its change; 2) we impose the similar weights revealed in MMD on
inter-class distance and maximize it, then a balanced factor could be
introduced to quantitatively leverage the relative importance between the
feature transferability and its discriminability. The experiments on several
benchmark datasets not only prove the validity of theoretical results but also
demonstrate that our approach could perform better than the comparative
state-of-art methods substantially.

sequential decision-making problems, such as control tasks in robotics. Since
policies are overfitted to training environments, RL methods have often failed
to be generalized to safety-critical test scenarios. Robust adversarial RL
(RARL) was previously proposed to train an adversarial network that applies
disturbances to a system, which improves the robustness in test scenarios.
However, an issue of neural network-based adversaries is that integrating
system requirements without handcrafting sophisticated reward signals are
difficult. Safety falsification methods allow one to find a set of initial
conditions and an input sequence, such that the system violates a given
property formulated in temporal logic. In this paper, we propose
falsification-based RARL (FRARL): this is the first generic framework for
integrating temporal logic falsification in adversarial learning to improve
policy robustness. By applying our falsification method, we do not need to
construct an extra reward function for the adversary. Moreover, we evaluate our
approach on a braking assistance system and an adaptive cruise control system
of autonomous vehicles. Our experimental results demonstrate that policies
trained with a falsification-based adversary generalize better and show less
violation of the safety specification in test scenarios than those trained
without an adversary or with an adversarial network.

are commonly used to derive specialized message passing algorithms that are
often interpreted as coordinate descent on the dual LP. To achieve more

accelerating these algorithms by leveraging techniques that underlie classical
accelerated gradient methods. The proposed algorithms incorporate the familiar
steps of standard smooth message passing algorithms, which can be viewed as
coordinate minimization steps. We show that these accelerated variants achieve
faster rates for finding $\epsilon$-optimal points of the unregularized

recover the true MAP solution in fewer iterations than standard message passing

so that it can capture spatial dispersion well beyond the quasistatic regime
(where $\omega$ and ${\bf k}_I$ are frequency and wavevector of the incident

exactly account for multiple scattering for the range of wavenumbers for which
our extended homogenization theory applies, i.e., $0 \le |{\bf k}_I| \ell
\lesssim 1$ (where $\ell$ is a characteristic heterogeneity length scale). Due
to the fast-convergence properties of such expansions, their lower-order
truncations yield accurate closed-form approximate formulas for
${\varepsilon}_e({\bf k}_I,\omega)$ that incorporate microstructural
information via the spectral density, which is easy to compute for any
composite. The accuracy of these microstructure-dependent approximations is
validated by comparison to full-waveform simulation methods for both 2D and 3D

formulas enable one to predict accurately and efficiently the effective wave
characteristics well beyond the quasistatic regime without having to perform

dominates with strengths between 18muG and 24muG, while the regular field

18muG exceeds that of the turbulent field of 11muG. The regular field strengths
in the halo are 3-5muG. The observed RMs in the disk-halo transition region are
probably dominated by tangled regular fields, as predicted from models of

simulations of Parker instabilities or galactic winds. Both types of magnetic
fields have frequent reversals on scales similar to or larger than the beam

distortions of any large-scale pattern of the regular field. Our study devises

either an additional Dark Matter (DM) component or a Supernova Remnant (SNR).
We show that the CRE break at $\sim 1$ TeV, together with the known CR positron

lead to sub-optimality. By recursively splitting the search space into regions
with high/low function values, recent works like LaNAS shows good performance
in Neural Architecture Search (NAS), reducing the sample complexity
empirically. In this paper, we coin LA-MCTS that extends LaNAS to other
domains. Unlike previous approaches, LA-MCTS learns the partition of the search
space using a few samples and their function values in an online fashion. While
LaNAS uses linear partition and performs uniform sampling in each region, our
LA-MCTS adopts a nonlinear decision boundary and learns a local model to pick
good candidates. If the nonlinear partition function and the local model fits
well with ground-truth black-box function, then good partitions and candidates
can be reached with much fewer samples. LA-MCTS serves as a
\emph{meta-algorithm} by using existing black-box optimizers (e.g., BO, TuRBO)
as its local models, achieving strong performance in general black-box

misbehavior at training using samples with a mark or trigger, which is
exploited at inference or testing time. In this work, we analyze the

during the classification. The generic applicability of the approach is
demonstrated in the context of a traffic sign and a face recognition
application. Each of them is exposed to a different attack with a variety of

Testing of the no-mediation hypothesis is inherently problematic due to the

traditional tests in the partially linear setting, with drastic improvement

orientation with respect to gravity, is a powerful representation of real-world

images. For close-range vision tasks, height and orientation have been derived
directly from stereo-computed depth and more recently from monocular depth
predicted by deep networks. For long-range vision tasks such as Earth
observation, depth cannot be reliably estimated with monocular images. Inspired
by recent work in monocular height above ground prediction and optical flow
prediction from static images, we develop an encoding of geocentric pose to
address this challenge and train a deep network to compute the representation
densely, supervised by publicly available airborne lidar. We exploit these
attributes to rectify oblique images and remove observed object parallax to
dramatically improve the accuracy of localization and to enable accurate
alignment of multiple images taken from very different oblique viewpoints. We
demonstrate the value of our approach by extending two large-scale public

microscope that is capable of obtaining quantitative birefringence retardance

only requiring the addition of one polarizer/analyzer pair to an existing

holographic images from a single state of polarization can be transformed into
images equivalent to those captured using a single-shot computational polarized

can extract the birefringence information using both the sample specific
morphological features as well as the holographic amplitude and phase
distribution. To demonstrate the efficacy of this method, we tested it by
imaging various birefringent samples including e.g., monosodium urate (MSU) and
triamcinolone acetonide (TCA) crystals. Our method achieves similar results to

magnetic stimulation (TMS) coils. TMS requires high currents (several thousand
amperes) to be pulsed through the coil, which generates a loud acoustic impulse
whose peak sound pressure level (SPL) can exceed 130 dB(Z). This sound poses a
risk to hearing and elicits unwanted neural activation of auditory brain
circuits. Methods: We propose a new double-containment coil with enhanced
winding mounting (DCC), which utilizes acoustic impedance mismatch to contain
and dissipate the impulsive sound within an air-tight outer casing. The coil
winding is potted in a rigid block, which is mounted to the outer casing by its
acoustic nodes that are subject to minimum vibration during the pulse. The rest
of the winding block is isolated from the casing by an air gap, and sound is
absorbed by foam within the casing. The casing thickness under the winding
center is minimized to maximize the coil electric field output. Results:
Compared to commercial figure-of-eight TMS coils, the DCC prototype has 10-33
dB(Z) lower SPL at matched stimulation strength, whilst providing 22% higher
maximum stimulation strength than equally focal commercial coils. Conclusion:
The DCC design greatly reduces the acoustic noise of TMS while increasing the
achievable stimulation strength. Significance: The acoustic noise reduction
from our coil design is comparable to that provided by typical hearing
protection devices. This coil design approach can enhance hearing safety and
reduce auditory co-activations in the brain and other detrimental effects of
TMS sound.

segmentation helps to overcome these issues and also provides explainable deep
learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the semantic
segmentation of medical chest X-ray images with only image-level class labels
as supervision. We improve the disease localization accuracy by combining three
approaches as consecutive steps. First, we generate pseudo segmentation labels
of abnormal regions in the training images through a supervised classification
model enhanced with a regularization procedure. The obtained activation maps
are then post-processed and propagated into a second classification
model-Inter-pixel Relation Network, which improves the boundaries between
different object classes. Finally, the resulting pseudo-labels are used to
train a proposed fully supervised segmentation model. We analyze the robustness
of the presented method and test its performance on two distinct datasets:
PASCAL VOC 2012 and SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax. We achieve significant results in
the segmentation on both datasets using only image-level annotations. We show
that this approach is applicable to chest X-rays for detecting an anomalous
volume of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Our

posts that have become famous on Reddit. To establish the utility of Reddit
legends for both computational science/HCI and folkloristics, we investigate
two main questions: (1) whether they can be considered folklore, i.e. if they
have consistent form, cultural significance, and undergo spontaneous
transmission, and (2) whether they can be studied in a systematic manner.
Through several subtasks, including the creation of a typology, an analysis of
references to Reddit legends, and an examination of some of the textual
characteristics of referencing behaviour, we show that Reddit legends can
indeed be considered as folklore and that they are amendable to systematic
text-based approaches. We discuss how these results will enable future analyses
of folklore on Reddit, including tracking subreddit-wide and individual-user
behaviour, and the relationship of this behaviour to other cultural markers.

robust type system that enables programmers to write memory-safe and data-race
free code. To allow access to a machine's hardware and to support low-level
performance optimizations, a second language, Unsafe Rust, is embedded in Rust.
It contains support for operations that are difficult to statically check, such
as C-style pointers for access to arbitrary memory locations and mutable global
variables. When a program uses these features, the compiler is unable to
statically guarantee the safety properties Rust promotes. In this work, we
perform a large-scale empirical study to explore how software developers are
using Unsafe Rust in real-world Rust libraries and applications. Our results
indicate that software engineers use the keyword unsafe in less than 30% of
Rust libraries, but more than half cannot be entirely statically checked by the
Rust compiler because of Unsafe Rust hidden somewhere in a library's call
chain. We conclude that although the use of the keyword unsafe is limited, the
propagation of unsafeness offers a challenge to the claim of Rust as a
memory-safe language. Furthermore, we recommend changes to the Rust compiler
and to the central Rust repository's interface to help Rust software developers
be aware of when their Rust code is unsafe.

particularly drastic measure, the 'lockdown', urged people to stay at home and

we analyse data from two megacities: London as an example for Europe and Delhi
as an example for Asia. We consider data during first and second wave lockdowns

high-pollutant states and an increased tendency towards extreme events (a
higher kurtosis of the probability density during lockdown) during 2020 and low

higher pollution levels in 2021. These results could help to design policies to

Here we evaluate multiple digital data streams as early warning indicators of

June 2020. We estimate the timing of sharp changes in each data stream using a
simple Bayesian model that calculates in near real-time the probability of
exponential growth or decay. Analysis of COVID-19-related activity on social
network microblogs, Internet searches, point-of-care medical software, and a
metapopulation mechanistic model, as well as fever anomalies captured by smart
thermometer networks, shows exponential growth roughly 2-3 weeks prior to
comparable growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3-4 weeks prior to comparable
growth in COVID-19 deaths across the US over the last 6 months. We further
observe exponential decay in confirmed cases and deaths 5-6 weeks after
implementation of NPIs, as measured by anonymized and aggregated human mobility
data from mobile phones. Finally, we propose a combined indicator for
exponential growth in multiple data streams that may aid in developing an early

introduce OxyGAN: a data-driven, content-aware method to estimate tissue
oxygenation directly from single structured light images using end-to-end
generative adversarial networks. Conventional SFDI is used to obtain ground
truth tissue oxygenation maps for ex vivo human esophagi, in vivo hands and
feet, and an in vivo pig colon sample under 659 nm and 851 nm sinusoidal
illumination. We benchmark OxyGAN by comparing to SSOP and to a two-step hybrid
technique that uses a previously-developed deep learning model to predict
optical properties followed by a physical model to calculate tissue
oxygenation. When tested on human feet, a cross-validated OxyGAN maps tissue
oxygenation with an accuracy of 96.5%. When applied to sample types not
included in the training set, such as human hands and pig colon, OxyGAN
achieves a 93.0% accuracy, demonstrating robustness to various tissue types. On
average, OxyGAN outperforms SSOP and a hybrid model in estimating tissue
oxygenation by 24.9% and 24.7%, respectively. Lastly, we optimize OxyGAN
inference so that oxygenation maps are computed ~10 times faster than previous

the projected graph is common, but we do not have a good understanding of the

random graph model to study what properties we can expect from the projection
step. Our model is based on a Chung-Lu random graph for constructing the
bipartite representation, which enables us to rigorously analyze the projected
graph. We show that common network properties such as sparsity, heavy-tailed
degree distributions, local clustering at nodes, the inverse relationship
between node degree, and global transitivity can be explained and analyzed
through this simple model. We also develop a fast sampling algorithm for our

that much of the clustering behavior in some datasets can just be explained by
the projection step.

evaluation demonstrates that $\textit{N&P}$ improves the accuracy on
adversarial inputs by as much as 70% over the vanilla models. More importantly,
$\textit{N&P}$ also increases robust accuracy to 45% higher than adversarial

often suggests that such asymptotic models are too rigidly constrained, and
that they do not adequately capture the frequent situation where more severe
events tend to be spatially more localized. In other words, these asymptotic
models have a strong tail dependence that persists at increasingly high levels,
while data usually suggest that it should weaken instead. Another well-known
limitation of classical spatial extremes models is that they are either
computationally prohibitive to fit in high dimensions, or they need to be
fitted using less efficient techniques. In this review paper, we describe
recent progress in the modeling and inference for spatial extremes, focusing on
new models that have more flexible tail structures that can bridge asymptotic
dependence classes, and that are more easily amenable to likelihood-based
inference for large datasets. In particular, we discuss various types of random

multi-tasking robots with multi-robot tasks. Given a set of tasks, each
achievable by a coalition of robots, our approach allows the coalitions to
overlap and task synergies to be exploited by reasoning about the physical
constraints that can be synergistically satisfied for achieving the tasks. The
key contribution of this work is a general and flexible framework to achieve
this ability for multi-robot systems in resource-constrained situations to
extend their capabilities. The proposed approach is built on the information
invariant theory, which specifies the interactions between information
requirements. In our work, we map physical constraints to information
requirements, thereby allowing task synergies to be identified via the
information invariant framework. We show that our algorithm is sound and
complete under a problem setting with multi-tasking robots. Simulation results
show its effectiveness under resource-constrained situations and in handling
challenging situations in a multi-UAV simulator.

order, but, are limited by the computational effort needed to simulate the
thousands of required atoms. To relieve this issue, we use the novel multi-site

simulate thin PTO films on STO substrates with system sizes $>2000$ atoms. In

exact nature of this bias field depends sensitively on the film boundary

order on the nanoscale through the careful choice of substrate, surface
termination or use of overlayers. Antiferrodistortive (AFD) order locally
interacts with these polar textures giving rise to strong FE/AFD coupling at

generation of faces with minimal variations and a poor synthesis accuracy. In
addition, recent age-oriented face synthesis methods use the L1 or L2

implicitly limits the identity permanence capabilities when these constraints

a high synthesis accuracy, our method tackles the mode collapse issue with a

hampered by the need for costly exploration to learn a good policy. Imitation
learning (IL) mitigates this shortcoming by using an oracle policy during
training as a bootstrap to accelerate the learning process. However, in many
practical situations, the learner has access to multiple suboptimal oracles,
which may provide conflicting advice in a state. The existing IL literature
provides a limited treatment of such scenarios. Whereas in the single-oracle
case, the return of the oracle's policy provides an obvious benchmark for the
learner to compete against, neither such a benchmark nor principled ways of
outperforming it are known for the multi-oracle setting. In this paper, we
propose the state-wise maximum of the oracle policies' values as a natural
baseline to resolve conflicting advice from multiple oracles. Using a reduction
of policy optimization to online learning, we introduce a novel IL algorithm
MAMBA, which can provably learn a policy competitive with this benchmark. In
particular, MAMBA optimizes policies by using a gradient estimator in the style
of generalized advantage estimation (GAE). Our theoretical analysis shows that
this design makes MAMBA robust and enables it to outperform the oracle policies
by a larger margin than the IL state of the art, even in the single-oracle
case. In an evaluation against standard policy gradient with GAE and
AggreVaTe(D), we showcase MAMBA's ability to leverage demonstrations both from
a single and from multiple weak oracles, and significantly speed up policy
optimization.

as coverage. The proposed approach is better than learning the dominant class

the advantage of dealing with coarse polygon annotation, which will cause the

the Aland region of Finland, summarized as an island-dense strait with shallow
bathymetry that hosts complex surface circulation patterns. Hufaidh Insulae
could host seafloor bedforms formed by tidal currents with an abundant sediment

(mpMRI) in diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa), further investigation is needed
for how to incorporate the specific structures of the mpMRI data, such as the
regional heterogeneity and between-voxel correlation within a subject. This
paper proposes a machine learning-based method for improved voxel-wise PCa
classification by taking into account the unique structures of the data. We
propose a multi-resolution modeling approach to account for regional
heterogeneity, where base learners trained locally at multiple resolutions are
combined using the super learner, and account for between-voxel correlation by
efficient spatial Gaussian kernel smoothing. The method is flexible in that the
super learner framework allows implementation of any classifier as the base
learner, and can be easily extended to classifying cancer into more
sub-categories. We describe detailed classification algorithm for the binary
PCa status, as well as the ordinal clinical significance of PCa for which a
weighted likelihood approach is implemented to enhance the detection of the
less prevalent cancer categories. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed
approach over conventional modeling and machine learning approaches through
simulations and application to in vivo data.

It leads to the extensive modification of the Fermi surface from six separated

critical temperatures $T_c \sim 55-75$ K are obtained within anisotropic
Eliashberg theory depending on varying amounts of the Coulomb potential from

the combination of the temperature dependence of the bare susceptibility and
the strong electron-phonon interaction gives rise to a charge density wave that
emerged at a temperature far above the corresponding $T_c$. Having included
non-adiabatic effects, we could carefully analyze conditions for which either a
superconductive or charge density wave phase occurs in the system. In addition,
monolayer InSe becomes dynamically stable by including non-adiabatic effects

theoretically investigated in the past few years. The availability of this
homogeneous materials dataset is an opportunity to examine trends in their
defect properties and identify criteria to find new defect-tolerant materials
in this vast chemical space. We find that substitutions on the Zn site lead to
a smooth decrease in band tailing as the ionic radius of the substituting
cation increases. Unfortunately, this substitution strategy does not ensure the
suppression of deeper defects and non-radiative recombination. Trends across
the full dataset suggest that Gaussian and Urbach band tails in
kesterite-inspired semiconductors are two separate phenomena caused by two
different antisite defect types. Deep Urbach tails are correlated with the
calculated band gap narrowing caused by the (2I$_\mathrm{II}$+IV$_\mathrm{II}$)
defect cluster. Shallow Gaussian tails are correlated with the energy
difference between the kesterite and stannite polymorphs, which points to the
role of (I$_\mathrm{II}$+II$_\mathrm{I}$) defect clusters involving Group IB
and Group IIB atoms swapping across \textit{different} cation planes. This
finding can explain why \textit{in-plane} cation disorder and band tailing are
uncorrelated in kesterites. Our results provide quantitative criteria for
discovering new kesterite-inspired photovoltaic materials with low band

exploit the following three novel aspects: leveraging camera motions in videos,
including context cuesand incorporating long-term video information.
Specifically, we introduce a model that aims to enforce prediction consistency
in videos. Our model consists of one LSTM and one Feature Transform Module
(FTM). The former implicitly incorporates the consistency constraint with its
hidden states, and the latter explicitly takes the camera motion into
consideration when aggregating information along videos. Moreover, we propose
to incorporate context information by introducing road participants, e.g.
objects, into our model. When the entire video sequence is available, our model
is also able to encode both local and global cues, e.g. information from both
past and future frames. Experiments on two data sets show that: (1)
Incorporating either globalor contextual cues improves the prediction accuracy

  Koopman Theoretic Approach",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years there has been a considerable drive towards data-driven
analysis, discovery and control of dynamical systems. To this end, operator
theoretic methods, namely, Koopman operator methods have gained a lot of
interest. In general, the Koopman operator is obtained as a solution to a
least-squares problem, and as such, the Koopman operator can be expressed as a
closed-form solution that involves the computation of Moore-Penrose inverse of
a matrix. For high dimensional systems and also if the size of the obtained
data-set is large, the computation of the Moore-Penrose inverse becomes
computationally challenging. In this paper, we provide an algorithm for
computing the Koopman operator for high dimensional systems in a time-efficient
manner. We further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on two
different systems, namely a network of coupled oscillators (with state-space
dimension up to 2500) and IEEE 68 bus system (with state-space dimension 204
and up to 24,000 time-points).

issue because the validity of the results from a meta-analysis is threatened if

deal with publication bias is the Copas selection model, which provides a
flexible sensitivity analysis for correcting the estimates with considerable
insight into the data suppression mechanism. However, rigorous testing
procedures under the Copas selection model to detect bias are lacking. To fill
this gap, we develop a score-based test for detecting publication bias under
the Copas selection model. We reveal that the behavior of the standard score
test statistic is irregular because the parameters of the Copas selection model
disappear under the null hypothesis, leading to an identifiability problem. We
propose a novel test statistic and derive its limiting distribution. A
bootstrap procedure is provided to obtain the p-value of the test for practical
applications. We conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the

By using Long Short-Term Memory and a fully-connected network, the plantar
force can be predicted using only data measured by inertial measurement unit
sensors, not only during the walking period but also at the start and end of
walking. From the predicted plantar force, the walking status and the desired
assistance timing can also be determined. By considering the time-delay and
sending the control commands beforehand, the exoskeleton can be moved precisely
on the desired assistance timing. In experiments, the prediction accuracy of
the plantar force and the assistance timing are confirmed. The performance of
the proposed method is also evaluated by using the trained model to control the

temperature obtained by semi-inelastic (SI) approximation (which gives
scattering rates in excellent agreement with the full inelastic scattering
rates) are compared with those obtained by quasi-elastic (QE) approximation and
the commonly adopted value of $\Theta^{LA}_{F} = 2\hbar v_{LA} k_F/k_B$. It is
found that the commonly adopted BG temperature in graphene ($\Theta^{LA}_{F}$)
is about 5 times larger than the value obtained by the QE approximation and
about 2.5 times larger than that by the SI approximation, when using the
crossing-point temperature where low-temperature and high-temperature limits of
the resistivity meet. The corrected analytic relation based on SI approximation
agrees extremely well with the transition temperatures determined by fitting
the the low- and high-$T$ behavior of available experimental data of graphene's
resistivity. We also introduce a way to determine the BG temperature including
the full inelastic EAP scattering rate and the deviation of electron energy
from the chemical potential ($\mu$) numerically by finding the maximum of
$\partial \rho(\mu,T)/\partial T$. Using the analytic expression of
$\Theta_{BG,1}$ we can prove that the normalized resistivity defined as

and an important step in geometry processing is to remove these noise
components from these surfaces (given as points-set or triangulated mesh). The
noise-removal process (denoising) can be performed by filtering the surface
normals first and by adjusting the vertex positions according to filtered
normals afterwards. Therefore, in many available denoising algorithms, the
computation of noise-free normals is a key factor. A variety of filters have
been introduced for noise-removal from normals, with different focus points
like robustness against outliers or large amplitude of noise. Although these
filters are performing well in different aspects, a unified framework is
missing to establish the relation between them and to provide a theoretical
analysis beyond the performance of each method.
  In this paper, we introduce such a framework to establish relations between a
number of widely-used nonlinear filters for face normals in mesh denoising and
vertex normals in point set denoising. We cover robust statistical estimation
with M-smoothers and their application to linear and non-linear normal
filtering. Although these methods originate in different mathematical theories
- which include diffusion-, bilateral-, and directional curvature-based
algorithms - we demonstrate that all of them can be cast into a unified
framework of robust statistics using robust error norms and their corresponding
influence functions. This unification contributes to a better understanding of
the individual methods and their relations with each other. Furthermore, the
presented framework provides a platform for new techniques to combine the
advantages of known filters and to compare them with available methods.

interacting spin-1/2 fermions on a lattice consisting of $N$ sites (it includes

found in recent literature, is comprised of the well-known $\eta$-pairing
states. We find another family of scar states which is $U(N)$ invariant. Both
families and most of the group-invariant scar states produced by our
construction in general, give rise to the off-diagonal long range order which
survives at high temperatures and is insensitive to the details of the
dynamics. Such states could be used for reliable quantum information processing
because the information is stored non-locally, and thus cannot be easily erased
by local perturbations. In contrast, other scar states we find are product
states which could be easily prepared experimentally. The dimension of scar
subspace is directly controlled by the choice of group $G$ and can be made
exponentially large.

Modelling the rotational velocity distribution with both the halo and disk

decreases almost linearly with increasing vertical distance to the galactic
disk plane, $Z$, at fixed galactocentric radius, $R$. The samples are separated
into two parts with
  $6<R<12$ kpc and $12<R<20$ kpc. We derive that the decreasing rates along $Z$
for the two subsamples are $-3.07\pm0.63$ and $-1.89\pm0.37$ km s$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. Compared with the TNG simulations, we suggest that
this trend is probably caused by the interaction between the disk and halo. The
results from the simulations show that only the oblate halo can provide a
decreasing rotational velocity with an increasing $Z$. This indicates that the
Galactic halo is oblate with galactocentric radius $R<20$ kpc. On the other
hand, the flaring of the disk component (mainly the thick disk) is clearly
traced by this study, with $R$ between 12 and 20 kpc, the disk can vertically

examine the effect of random errors on Single Transferable Vote (STV)
elections, a common approach to deciding multi-seat elections. It is usually
expected that random errors should have nearly equal effects on all candidates,
and thus be fair. We find to the contrary that random errors can introduce
systematic bias into election results. This is because, even if the errors are
random, votes for different candidates occur in different patterns that are
affected differently by random errors. In the STV context, the most important
effect of random errors is to invalidate the ballot. This removes far more
votes for those candidates whose supporters tend to list a lot of preferences,
because their ballots are much more likely to be invalidated by random error.
Different validity rules for different voting styles mean that errors are much
more likely to penalise some types of votes than others. For close elections
this systematic bias can change the result of the election.

positive correlation with the entanglement entropy. Thus, the violation plays
an equivalent role as Quantum Entanglement. We first provide an analytical
estimation of the relation between quantum entanglement quantities and the dip
when a subregion only has one qubit. The time of the first dip is monotone for
entanglement entropy. The dynamics in a subregion is independent of the initial
state at a late time. It is one of the signaling conditions for classical
chaos. We also extend our analysis to the Gaussian random 3-qubit state, and it
indicates a similar result. The simulation shows that the level spacing
distribution function approaches GUE at a late time. In the end, we develop a
technique within QFT to the spectral form factor for its relation to an
$n$-sheet manifold. We apply the technology to a single interval in CFT$_2$ and
the spherical entangling surface in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.
The result is one for both cases, but the R\'enyi entropy can depend on the

However, mmWave communications suffer from severe propagation attenuation and

(HBF) design for train-to-ground communications. First, we develop a two-stage
HBF algorithm in blockage-free scenarios. In the first stage, the minimum mean
square error method is adopted for optimal hybrid beamformer design with low
complexity and fast convergence; in the second stage, the orthogonal matching
pursuit method is utilized to approximately recover the analog and digital
beamformers. Second, in blocked scenarios, we design an anti-blockage scheme by
adaptively invoking the proposed HBF algorithm, which can efficiently deal with
random blockages. Extensive simulation results are presented to show the sum
rate performance of the proposed algorithms under various configurations,
including transmission power, velocity of the train, blockage probability, etc.
It is demonstrated that the proposed anti-blockage algorithm can improve the

which has a high clinical incidence and can cause various complications. In the
biopsy microscope slide of membranous nephropathy, spikelike projections on the
glomerular basement membrane is a prominent feature of the MN. However, due to
the whole biopsy slide contains large number of glomeruli, and each glomerulus
includes many spike lesions, the pathological feature of the spikes is not
obvious. It thus is time-consuming for doctors to diagnose glomerulus one by
one and is difficult for pathologists with less experience to diagnose. In this
paper, we establish a visualized classification model based on the multi-scale
annotation multi-instance learning (MSA-MIL) to achieve glomerular
classification and spikes visualization. The MSA-MIL model mainly involves
three parts. Firstly, U-Net is used to extract the region of the glomeruli to
ensure that the features learned by the succeeding algorithm are focused inside
the glomeruli itself. Secondly, we use MIL to train an instance-level
classifier combined with MSA method to enhance the learning ability of the
network by adding a location-level labeled reinforced dataset, thereby
obtaining an example-level feature representation with rich semantics. Lastly,
the predicted scores of each tile in the image are summarized to obtain
glomerular classification and visualization of the classification results of
the spikes via the usage of sliding window method. The experimental results
confirm that the proposed MSA-MIL model can effectively and accurately classify
normal glomeruli and spiked glomerulus and visualize the position of spikes in
the glomerulus. Therefore, the proposed model can provide a good foundation for
assisting the clinical doctors to diagnose the glomerular membranous

Moreover, the domain can have an irregular boundary with cusp-like features and

a function space $\mathscr{N}^{s(\cdot),p}(\Omega)\subseteq

oscillations in the function values as $\Gamma$ is approached, but does not
imply any regularity away from $\Gamma$. Under connectivity assumptions between
$\Omega$ and $\Gamma$, we produce a linear trace operator from
$\mathscr{N}^{s(\cdot),p}(\Omega)$ to the space of measurable functions on

$1$-sided nontangentially accessible domains. If $\Gamma$ is upper
Ahlfors-regular, then the trace is a continuous operator into a

close to Van Hove points, where the density of states diverges, and study
potential instabilities in the particle-hole channel within a patch model with
two valley degrees of freedom. The hexagonal symmetry of twisted bilayer
graphene allows for either six or twelve Van Hove points. We consider both

an SU(2)-breaking spin state with ferromagnetism within a valley. A subleading
inter-valley hopping induces antiferromagnetism between the valleys. The same
state has also been obtained in strong coupling approaches, indicating that
this order is robust. The other is a mixed state with $120^\circ$ complex spin

assist the operator in carrying a heavy payload, reaching and maintaining
difficult postures, and ultimately better performing their job. The Extra
Robotic Legs (XRL) system is worn by the operator and consists of two
articulated robotic legs that move with the operator to bear a heavy payload.
The design was driven by a need to increase the effectiveness of hazardous
material emergency response personnel who are encumbered by their personal
protective equipment (PPE). The legs will ultimately walk, climb stairs, crouch
down, and crawl with the operator while eliminating all external PPE loads on
the operator. The forces involved in the most extreme loading cases were
analyzed to find an effective strategy for reducing actuator loads. The
analysis reveals that the maximum torque is exerted during the transition from
the crawling to standing mode of motion. Peak torques are significantly reduced
by leveraging redundancy in force application resulting from a closed-loop
kinematic chain formed by a particular posture of the XRL. The actuators, power
systems, and transmission elements were designed from the results of these
analyses. Using differential mechanisms to combine the inputs of multiple
actuators into a single degree of freedom, the gear reductions needed to bear
the heavy loads could be kept at a minimum, enabling high bandwidth force
control due to the near-direct-drive transmission. A prototype was fabricated
utilizing the insights gained from these analyses and initial tests indicate
the feasibility of the XRL system.

solved: suppressing the coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ between the ALP and photon, and
generating the proper coupling $g_{ae}$ between the ALP and electron as well as
the correct ALP mass. We propose three models to solve these problems. In our
models, the $g_{ae}$ couplings are produced by integrating out the vector-like
leptons, and the correct ALP masses arise from high-dimensional operators. In
the KSVZ axion model, the coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ can be suppressed by choosing
proper sets of vector-like fermions, but we need some fine-tunings to obtain
the ALP mass. Similarly, one can study the DFSZ axion model. In the $Z_8$ and $
U(1)_X$ models with approximate Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Bosons (PNGBs), the
coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ is suppressed due to $SU(3)_C \times U(1)_{\rm EM}$
anomaly free. In the $Z_8$ model, the PNGB mass can be generated naturally at
the keV scale via the dimension-8 operator. To solve the PNGB quality problem
in the $ Z_8$ model, we embed it into the model with $ U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry.

based on uniform circular arrays (UCAs). First, we verify that UCA can generate
multi-mode OAM radio beam with both the RF analog synthesis method and the

MCMM-OAM communication system, a distance and AoA estimation method is proposed
based on the two-dimensional ESPRIT (2-D ESPRIT) algorithm. A salient feature
of the proposed LoS MCMM-OAM and LoS MCMM-OAM-MIMO systems is that the channel
matrices are completely characterized by three parameters, namely, the azimuth
angle, the elevation angle and the distance, independent of the numbers of
subcarriers and antennas, which significantly reduces the burden by avoiding
estimating large channel matrices, as traditional MIMO-OFDM systems. After

estimated AoA and the amplitude detection with the estimated distance. At last,
the proposed methods are extended to the LoS MCMM-OAM-MIMO system equipped with
uniform concentric circular arrays (UCCAs). Both mathematical analysis and

eliminate the effect of the misalignment error of a practical OAM channel and
approaches the performance of an ideally aligned OAM channel.

representative results were obtained: (1) A training error bound was derived to
show that networks can fit any finite training sample perfectly by reflecting a
tighter characterization of training speed depending on the data complexity.
(2) A generalization error bound invariant of network size was derived by using
a data-dependent complexity measure (CMD). It follows from this CMD bound that
networks can generalize arbitrary smooth functions. (3) A simple and analytic
kernel function was derived as indeed equivalent to a fully-trained network.
This kernel outperforms its corresponding network and the existing gold
standard, Random Forests, in few shot learning. For all of these results to
hold, the network scaling factor $\kappa$ should decrease w.r.t. sample size n.
In this case of decreasing $\kappa$, however, we prove that the aforementioned
results are surprisingly erroneous. It is because the output value of trained

binomial filters (transfer-functions) is introduced. First, the butterworth
filter response is represented as a damped-binomial filter response. To extend
the maximum-overshoot response of the second-order butterworth to higher
orders, the binomial theorem is extended to the uniformly-damped binomial
theorem. It is shown that the five-percent uniformly-damped binomial filter is
a compromise between the butterworth filter and the standard binomial filter,
with respect to the filter-approximation problem in the time and frequency
domain. Finally, this paper concludes that in applications of interest, such as
step-tracking, where both strong filtering and a fast, smooth
transient-response, with negligible overshoot are desired, the response of the
normalized five-percent uniformly-damped binomial form is a candidate
replacement for both the butterworth and standard binomial filter forms.

under the action of any global unitary transformation. These states may or may
not have quantum correlation and these correlations can be measured by quantum
discord. We find that the absolute separable states are useful in quantum
computation even if it contains infinitesimal quantum correlation in it. Thus
to search for the class of two-qubit absolute separable states with zero
discord, we have derived an upper bound for $Tr(\varrho^{2})$, where $\varrho$
denoting all zero discord states. In general, the upper bound depends on the
state under consideration but if the state belong to some particular class of
zero discord states then we found that the upper bound is state independent.
Later, it is shown that among these particular classes of zero discord states,
there exist sub-classes which are absolutely separable. Furthermore, we have
derived necessary conditions for the separability of a given qubit-qudit
states. Then we used the derived conditions to construct a ball for $2\otimes
d$ quantum system described by $Tr(\rho^{2})\leq Tr(X^{2})+2Tr(XZ)+Tr(Z^{2})$,
where the $2\otimes d$ quantum system is described by the density operator
$\rho$ which can be expressed by block matrices $X,Y$ and $Z$ with $X,Z\geq 0$.
In particular, for qubit-qubit system, we show that the newly constructed ball
contain larger class of absolute separable states compared to the ball
described by $Tr(\rho^{2})\leq \frac{1}{3}$. Lastly, we have derived the
necessary condition in terms of purity for the absolute separability of a
qubit-qudit system under investigation.

elements, remains a fundamental question in nuclear physics. Its description is
a challenge for microscopic nuclear energy density functionals, as it must take
into account in a realistic way not only the nuclear potential, but also
pairing correlations, deformation effects and coupling to the continuum. The
recently developed deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum
(DRHBc) aims to provide a unified description of even-even nuclei throughout
the nuclear chart. Here, the DRHBc with the successful density functional
PC-PK1 is used to investigate whether and how deformation influences the
prediction for the neutron drip-line location for even-even nuclei with
8<=Z<=20, where many isotopes are predicted deformed. The results are compared
with those based on the spherical relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov
(RCHB) theory and discussed in terms of shape evolution and the variational
principle. It is found that the Ne and Ar drip-line nuclei are different after
the deformation effect is included. The direction of the change is not
necessarily towards an extended drip line, but rather depends on the evolution
of the degree of deformation towards the drip line. Deformation effects as well
as pairing and continuum effects treated in a consistent way can affect
critically the theoretical description of the neutron drip-line location.

decentralized and permissionless blockchain protocol, named \textit{Bychain}.
Specifically, 1) a privacy-preserving SRC protocol for activity-tracking and
corresponding generalized block structure is developed, by connecting an
interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol and the key escrow mechanism. As a
result, connections between personal identity and the ownership of on-chain
location information are decoupled. Meanwhile, the owner of the on-chain
location data can still claim its ownership without revealing the private key
to anyone else. 2) An artificial potential field-based incentive allocation
mechanism is proposed to incentivize IoT witnesses to pursue the maximum
monitoring coverage deployment. We implemented and evaluated the proposed
blockchain protocol in the real-world using the Bluetooth 5.0. The storage, CPU
utilization, power consumption, time delay, and security of each procedure and
performance of activities are analyzed. The experiment and security analysis is
shown to provide a real-world performance evaluation.

closely related to the symmetry-breaking of the initial state. These relations
bridge the information leakage problem to macroscopic physics of quantum

class of CMEs that are characterized by a gradual swelling of the overlying
streamer and a slow CME containing a flux-rope structure. SBO CMEs arising from
the streamer flank fall into a special category of SBO CMEs involving three
lower arches under the higher streamer arcade. However, the initiation
mechanism for this special category of SBO CMEs remains elusive, due to the
observational limitations. Here we report critical observations of a SBO CME
associated with the eruption of a polar crown filament that originated from the
streamer flank. The filament slowly rose toward the solar equator with the
writhing motion, and underwent a sudden acceleration before its eruption.
Interestingly, during the rising, the filament fields experienced gradual
external reconnections, which is evidenced by the dip-shaped bottom of the
enveloping flux-rope structure changing from a smooth concave, the slow inflows
($\sim$1.8 km s$^{-1}$) from both the filament fields and the coronal loops
beneath, and the persistent brightenings around the interface between the
filament fields and the coronal loops beneath. The newly formed lower loops at
the filament source and the Y-shaped structure in the stretched tail fields
indicate the internal reconnections for the filament eruption. The clear
signatures of the external and internal reconnections shed light on the
initiation mechanisms of SBO CMEs.

electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can facilitate early diagnosis and
treatment. Previous studies suggested that the Gaussianity of EEG distributions
changes depending on the presence or absence of seizures; however, no general
EEG signal models can explain such changes in distributions within a unified
scheme. Methods: This paper describes the formulation of a stochastic EEG model
based on a multivariate scale mixture distribution that can represent changes
in non-Gaussianity caused by stochastic fluctuations in EEG. In addition, we
propose an EEG analysis method by combining the model with a filter bank and
introduce a feature representing the non-Gaussianity latent in each EEG
frequency band. Results: We applied the proposed method to multichannel EEG
data from twenty patients with focal epilepsy. The results showed a significant
increase in the proposed feature during epileptic seizures, particularly in the
high-frequency band. The feature calculated in the high-frequency band allowed
highly accurate classification of seizure and non-seizure segments [area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.881] using only a simple
threshold. Conclusion: This paper proposed a multivariate scale mixture
distribution-based stochastic EEG model capable of representing non-Gaussianity
associated with epileptic seizures. Experiments using simulated and real EEG
data demonstrated the validity of the model and its applicability to epileptic
seizure detection. Significance: The stochastic fluctuations of EEG quantified
by the proposed model can help detect epileptic seizures with high accuracy.

  different from standard inflationary models. These differences
  arise due to the particle production mechanism. The scalar

relations (FDR) in linear and nonlinear open quantum systems [1-3], here we
consider such relations when a linear system is in a nonequilibrium steady
state (NESS). With the model of two-oscillators (considered as a short harmonic
chain with the two ends) each connected to a thermal bath of different
temperatures we find that when the chain is fully relaxed due to interaction
with the baths, the relation that connects the noise kernel and the imaginary
part of the dissipation kernel of the chain in one bath does not assume the
conventional form for the FDR in equilibrium cases. There exists an additional
term we call the `bias current' that depends on the difference of the bath's
initial temperatures and the inter-oscillator coupling strength. We further
show that this term is related to the steady heat flow between the two baths
when the system is in NESS. The ability to know the real-time development of
the inter-heat exchange (between the baths and the end-oscillators) and the
intra-heat transfer (within the chain) and their dependence on the parameters
in the system offers possibilities for quantifiable control and in the design
of quantum heat engines or thermal devices.

information. There are $N$ projects and the principal must select exactly one

consider the principal's problem of finding an optimal mechanism for two
different objectives: maximizing expected profit and maximizing the probability
of choosing the most profitable project. Importantly, we assume partial
verifiability so that the agent cannot report a project to be more profitable
to the principal than it actually is. Under this no-overselling constraint, we
characterize the set of implementable mechanisms. Using this characterization,
we find that in the case of two projects, the optimal mechanism under both

the optimal mechanism also allows us to find evidence in support of the
well-known ally-principle which says that principal delegates more authority to
an agent who shares their preferences.

stitching and looping manipulations. To achieve this goal, the acquisition of a
suture's three-dimensional (3D) information is critical. Towards this
objective, we adopt a transfer-learning strategy first to fine-tune a
pre-trained model by learning the information from large legacy surgical data
and images obtained by the on-site equipment. Thus, a robust suture
segmentation can be achieved regardless of inherent environment noises. We
further leverage a searching strategy with termination policies for a suture's
sequence inference based on the analysis of multiple topologies. Exact results
of the pixel-level sequence along a suture can be obtained, and they can be
further applied for a 3D shape reconstruction using our optimized shortest path
approach. The grasping point considering the suturing criterion can be
ultimately acquired. Experiments regarding the suture 2D segmentation and
ordering sequence inference under environmental noises were extensively

in light nuclei with prior and ongoing measurements in heavier systems, the
contribution to NSD-PV from $Z^0$-boson exchange between the electrons and the
nuclei may be separated from the contribution of the nuclear anapole moment.
Furthermore, light triatomic molecules offer the possibility to search for new

sensitive measurement scheme and present high-accuracy molecular and nuclear
calculations needed for interpretation of NSD-PV experiments on triatomic

a reliable prediction of the magnitude of different contributions to the NSD-PV

of including many-body effects in such calculations. In order to extract the
NSD-PV contributions from measurements, a parity-violating interaction

Using 3D kinematic profiles of CMEs, we connect the evolution of true
acceleration with the evolution of true width in the inner and outer corona.
Thereby providing the observational evidence for the influence of the Lorentz
force on the kinematics to lie in the height range of $2.5-3$ R$_{\odot}$. We
find a broad range in the distribution of peak 3D speeds and accelerations

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), resulting in a novel PCA-assisted BO
(PCA-BO) algorithm. Specifically, the PCA procedure learns a linear
transformation from all the evaluated points during the run and selects
dimensions in the transformed space according to the variability of evaluated
points. We then construct the GPR model, and the infill-criterion in the space
spanned by the selected dimensions. We assess the performance of our PCA-BO in
terms of the empirical convergence rate and CPU time on multi-modal problems
from the COCO benchmark framework. The experimental results show that PCA-BO
can effectively reduce the CPU time incurred on high-dimensional problems, and
maintains the convergence rate on problems with an adequate global structure.
PCA-BO therefore provides a satisfactory trade-off between the convergence rate
and computational efficiency opening new ways to benefit from the strength of
BO approaches in high dimensional numerical optimization.

viscous resistance, the grounding time and the flying distance of faeces can be
expressed in terms of Lambert {\it W} function. Furthermore, we address the

used to obtain the Hardness Intensity Diagram (HID). The source follows a
`c'-shaped profile in agreement with earlier findings. Based on the HIDs of
previous outbursts, we attempt to track the evolution of the source during a
`super'-outburst and `mini'-outbursts. We model the broadband energy spectra
($0.7-20.0$ keV) of \textit{AstroSat} observations of both outbursts using
phenomenological and physical models. No Keplerian disc signature is observed
at the beginning of 2016 outburst. However, the disc appears within a few hours
after which it remains prominent with temperature ($T_{in}$) $\sim$ 1.3 keV and
increase in photon index ($\Gamma$) from 1.8 to 2.0, whereas the source was at
a disc dominant state throughout the \textit{AstroSat} campaign of 2018
outburst. Based on the HIDs and spectral properties, we classify the outbursts
into three different states - the `canonical' hard and soft states along with
an intermediate state. Evolution of rms along different states is seen although
no Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) are detected. We fit the observed spectra
using a dynamical accretion model and estimate the accretion parameters. Mass
of the black hole is estimated using inner disc radius, bolometric luminosity
and two component flow model to be $3-9$ $M_{\odot}$. Finally, we discuss the
possible implications of our findings.

radiative transfer simulations of reionization driven by sources such as stars,
X-ray binaries, accreting black holes and shock heated interstellar medium, and
simulations of a high-z quasar to characterize the signal and analyze its
prospects of detection. We find that the peak of the signal lies in the range
1-50 $\mu$K for both environments, but while around the quasar it is always in
emission, in the case of cosmic reionization a brief period of absorption is
expected. As the evolution of HeII is determined by stars, we find that it is
not possible to distinguish reionization histories driven by more energetic
sources. On the other hand, while a bright QSO produces a signal in 21cm that
is very similar to the one from a large collection of galaxies, its signature
in 3.5cm is very peculiar and could be a powerful probe to identify the
presence of the QSO. We analyze the prospects of the signal's detectability

discrimination between regular and chaotic behavior. Over the years several
methods of chaos detection have been developed. Some of them, such as the
construction of the system's Poincar\'e Surface of Section, are appropriate for
low-dimensional systems. However, an enormous number of real-world problems are
described by high-dimensional systems. Thus, modern numerical methods like the
Smaller (SALI) and the Generalized (GALI) Alignment Index, which can also be
used for lower-dimensional systems, are appropriate for investigating regular
and chaotic motion in high-dimensional systems. In this work, we numerically
investigate the behavior of the GALIs in the neighborhood of simple stable
periodic orbits of the well-known Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice model. In
particular, we study how the values of the GALIs depend on the width of the
stability island and the system's energy. We find that the asymptotic GALI
values increase when the studied regular orbits move closer to the edge of the
stability island for fixed energy, while these indices decrease as the system's
energy increases. We also investigate the dependence of the GALIs on the
initial distribution of the coordinates of the deviation vectors used for their

answers in a renormalizable class of field theories. We claim, however, that it
is redundant if one reduces the requirement of finiteness to S-matrix elements
only and does not require finiteness of intermediate quantities like the
off-shell Green functions. We suggest a novel view on the renormalization
procedure. It is based on the usual BPHZ R-operation, which is equally
applicable to any local QFT, renormalizable or not. The key point is the
replacement of the multiplicative renormalization, used in renormalizable
theories, by an operation when the renormalization constants depend on the
fields and momenta that have to be integrated inside the subgraphs. This
approach does not distinguish between renormalizable and non-renormalizable
interactions and provides the basis for getting finite scattering amplitudes in
both cases. The arbitrariness of the subtraction procedure is fixed by imposing
a normalization condition on the scattering amplitude as a whole rather than on
an infinite series of new operators appearing in non-renormalizable theories.
  Using the property of locality of counter-terms, we get recurrence relations
connecting leading, subleading, etc., UV divergences in all orders of PT in any
local theory. This allows one to get generalized RG equations that have an
integro-differential form and sum up the leading logarithms. This way one can
cure the problem of violation of unitarity in non-renormalizable theories by
summing up the leading asymptotics. We illustrate the basic features of our
approach by several examples.
  Our main statement is that non-renormalizable theories are self-consistent,
they can be well treated within the usual BPHZ R-operation, and the
arbitrariness can be fixed to a finite number of parameters just as in the
renormalizable case.

cyclic pursuit controlled by an external broadcast signal detected by a random
set of the agents. Two types of cyclic pursuit are analyzed: 1)linear cyclic
pursuit, where each agent senses the relative position of its target or leading
agent 2)non-linear cyclic pursuit, where the agents can sense only bearing to
their leading agent and colliding agents merge and continue on the path of the
pursued agent (a so-called ""bugs"" model). Cyclic pursuit is, in both cases, a
gathering algorithm, which has been previously analyzed. The novelty of our
work is the derivation of emergent behaviours, in both linear and non-linear
cyclic pursuit, in the presence of an exogenous broadcast control detected by a
random subset of agents. We show that the emergent behavior of the swarm
depends on the type of cyclic pursuit. In the linear case, the agents
asymptotically align in the desired direction and move with a common speed
which is a proportional to the ratio of the number of agents detecting the
broadcast control to the total number of agents in the swarm, for any magnitude
of input (velocity) signal. In the non-linear case, the agents gather and move
with a shared velocity, which equals the input velocity signal, independently
of the number of agents detecting the broadcast signal.

classification and segmentation, this class of methods offers a serious
alternative to perform image restoration but stays challenging to solve inverse
problems. In this work, we design a deep network, named DeepPDNet, built from
primal-dual proximal iterations associated with the minimization of a standard
penalized likelihood with an analysis prior, allowing us to take advantage of
both worlds.
  We reformulate a specific instance of the Condat-Vu primal-dual hybrid

parameters are both the PDHG algorithm step-sizes and the analysis linear
operator involved in the penalization (including the regularization parameter).

learning strategies: ""Full learning"" and ""Partial learning"" are proposed, the
first one is the most efficient numerically while the second one relies on
standard constraints ensuring convergence in the standard PDHG iterations.
Moreover, global and local sparse analysis prior are studied to seek a better

The expansive growth of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry
outlines the need and opportunity for addressing oracle consensus in a manner
both technologically and economically efficient as well as futureproof.
Blockchain-agnosticism is inherently limited if proposing a technological
solution involves adding one more architectural layer. As such, Gravity
protocol is designed to be a truly blockchain-agnostic protocol. By ensuring
parity through direct integration and by leveraging the stability and security
of the respective interconnected ecosystems, Gravity circumvents the need for a
dedicated, public blockchain and a native token. Ultimately, Gravity protocol
intends to address scalability challenges by providing a solid infrastructure
for the creation of gateways, cross-chain applications, and sidechains. This
paper introduces and defines the concept of Oracle Consensus and its
implementation in the Gravity protocol named the Pulse Consensus algorithm. The
proposed consensus architecture allows Gravity to be considered a singular

epidemiological and clinical outcomes over time. It is common to assume that
the models are Markov, but the assumption can often be unrealistic. The Markov
assumption is seldomly checked and violations can lead to biased estimation for
many parameters of interest. As argued by Datta and Satten (2001), the
Aalen-Johansen estimator of occupation probabilities is consistent also in the
non-Markov case. Putter and Spitoni (2018) exploit this fact to construct a
consistent estimator of state transition probabilities, the landmark
Aalen-Johansen estimator, which does not rely on the Markov assumption. A
disadvantage of landmarking is data reduction, leading to a loss of power. This
is problematic for less traveled transitions, and undesirable when such
transitions indeed exhibit Markov behaviour. Using a framework of partially
non-Markov multi-state models we suggest a hybrid landmark Aalen-Johansen
estimator for transition probabilities. The proposed estimator is a compromise
between regular Aalen-Johansen and landmark estimation, using transition
specific landmarking, and can drastically improve statistical power. The

low-resolution image, which typically has irregular object shapes, colors, and
interaction between objects. This initial image is then improved by
conditioning on the text. However, these methods mainly address the problem of
using text representation efficiently in the refinement of the initially
generated image, while the success of this refinement process depends heavily
on the quality of the initially generated image, as pointed out in the DM-GAN
paper. Hence, we propose a method to provide good initialized images by
incorporating perceptual understanding in the discriminator module. We improve
the perceptual information at the first stage itself, which results in
significant improvement in the final generated image. In this paper, we have
applied our approach to the novel StackGAN architecture. We then show that the
perceptual information included in the initial image is improved while modeling
image distribution at multiple stages. Finally, we generated realistic
multi-colored images conditioned by text. These images have good quality along
with containing improved basic perceptual information. More importantly, the
proposed method can be integrated into the pipeline of other state-of-the-art
text-based-image-generation models to generate initial low-resolution images.
We also worked on improving the refinement process in StackGAN by augmenting
the third stage of the generator-discriminator pair in the StackGAN
architecture. Our experimental analysis and comparison with the
state-of-the-art on a large but sparse dataset MS COCO further validate the

Although ride-sourcing is the most notorious service TNCs provide, little is

while replacing other transportation modes, or when a large number of idle
vehicles is cruising for passengers. We experimentally analyze the efficiency
of TNCs using taxi trip data from a Chinese megacity and a agent-based

investigate the effect of expanding fleet sizes for TNCs, passengers'
inclination towards sharing rides, and strategies to alleviate urban

Moreover, allowing shared rides is not capable of decreasing total distance
traveled due to higher empty kilometers traveled. Elegant parking management
strategies can prevent idle vehicles from cruising without assigned passengers

attempt to optimize energy efficiency in the proposed system. An energy
efficiency maximization problem is formulated where the transmit beamforming at
base station and the reflect beamforming at IRSs are jointly considered. To
solve this non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm based on the alternating
optimization technique. In the proposed algorithm, the transmit beamforming is
handled by the sequential convex approximation method and the reflect
beamforming is optimized based on the quadratic transform method. Our
simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant
energy efficiency improvement under various scenarios.

intensively investigated in the last decade. In this paper, we present a novel
approach to surrogating the response distribution of a stochastic simulator
which uses generalized lambda distributions, whose parameters are represented
by polynomial chaos expansions of the model inputs. As opposed to most existing
approaches, this new method does not require replicated runs of the simulator

which combines maximum conditional likelihood estimation with (modified)

nonparametric kernel estimation on four different applications stemming from
mathematical finance and epidemiology. Its performance is illustrated in terms
of the accuracy of both the mean/variance of the stochastic simulator and the
response distribution. As the proposed approach can also be used with
experimental designs containing replications, we carry out a comparison on two
of the examples, showing that replications do not necessarily help to get a
better overall accuracy and may even worsen the results (at a fixed total
number of runs of the simulator).

tempered chondritic dust under vacuum up to 1400 K. Afterwards, we measured the
splitting tensile strength of millimetre-sized dust aggregates. The deduced
effective surface energy starts out as $\gamma_e = 0.07\,\rm J/m^2$. This value
is dominated by abundant iron-oxides as measured by M\""ossbauer spectroscopy.
Up to 1250 K, $\gamma_e$ continuously decreases by up to a factor five.
Olivines dominate at higher temperature. Beyond 1300 K dust grains
significantly grow in size. The $\gamma_e$ no longer decreases but the large

aggregation is no longer possible. Overall, under the conditions probed, the

In this paper, we develop a Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach, called DeepOPF,
for solving AC-OPF problems in a fraction of the time used by conventional
solvers. A key difficulty for applying machine learning techniques for solving
AC-OPF problems lies in ensuring that the obtained solutions respect the
equality and inequality physical and operational constraints. Generalized the
2-stage procedure in [1], [2], DeepOPF first trains a DNN model to predict a
set of independent operating variables and then directly compute the remaining
dependable ones by solving power flow equations. Such an approach not only
preserves the power-flow balance equality constraints but also reduces the
number of variables to predict by the DNN, cutting down the number of neurons
and training data needed. DeepOPF then employs a penalty approach with a
zero-order gradient estimation technique in the training process to preserve
the remaining inequality constraints. As another contribution, we drive a
condition for tuning the size of the DNN according to the desired approximation
accuracy, which measures the DNN generalization capability. It provides
theoretical justification for using DNN to solve the AC-OPF problem. Simulation
results of IEEE 30/118/300-bus and a synthetic 2000-bus test cases show that
DeepOPF speeds up the computing time by up to two orders of magnitude as
compared to a state-of-the-art solver, at the expense of $<$0.1% cost
difference.

technology for reliable link acquisition. Unlike conventional cellular
communication, beam tracking in UAV communication addresses new issues such as
mobility and abrupt channel disconnection from UAV's perturbation. To deal with
these issues, we propose a beam tracking scheme based on extended Kalman filter
(EKF) using a monopulse signal, which can provide (1) higher robustness by
offering a reliable link in the estimated spatial direction and (2) lower
complexity compared with the existing conventional beam tracking schemes. We
point out the limitations of using a beamformed signal as a measurement model
for a Kalman filter (KF) based scheme and instead utilize the monopulse signal
as a more plausible model. For the performance evaluation, we derive the upper
bound of the mean square error for spatial angle estimation of UAV and confirm
that the proposed scheme is stable with a certain bounded error. We also show
from various simulations that the proposed scheme can efficiently track UAV and
detect beam disconnection every time frame using a beamformed signal.

celebrated and broadly useful discrete structures in Hilbert space. We
introduce a more sophisticated discrete structure compounded by several SICs. A
SIC-compound is defined to be a collection of $d^3$ vectors in $d$-dimensional
Hilbert space that can be partitioned in two different ways: into $d$ SICs and
into $d^2$ orthonormal bases. While a priori their existence may appear
unlikely when $d>2$, we surprisingly answer it in the positive through an
explicit construction for $d=4$. Remarkably this SIC-compound admits a close
relation to mutually unbiased bases, as is revealed through quantum state
discrimination. Going beyond fundamental considerations, we leverage these
exotic properties to construct a protocol for quantum key distribution and
analyze its security under general eavesdropping attacks. We show that
SIC-compounds enable secure key generation in the presence of errors that are
large enough to prevent the success of the generalisation of the six-state

temperature) limit of a more general theory due to Lifshitz. The temperature
dependent theory includes correlations in coupled quantum and classical

might act as a coupling spring, transferring thermal energy from the hotter to
the colder even through a vacuum. Recent experiments have appeared to confirm
this prediction, but the data were compared with the predictions of Casimir's
original expression, rather than those of the full temperature-dependent

the fact that real conducting surfaces (gold in this case) can be far from
ideal, and that a correction factor of up to 25% may be required. Here we give
numerical values for both of these corrections. It appears that they may not

of radio luminosity to its spin-down power $\dot{E}$), and death line in the
diagram of magnetic field (B) versus spin period (P), and found that the
dependence of pulsar radio luminosity on its spin-down power ($L-\dot{E}$) is
very weak, shown as $L\sim\dot{E}^{0.06}$, which deduces an equivalent inverse
correlation between emission efficiency and spin-down power as $\xi\sim
\dot{E}^{-0.94}$. Furthermore, we examined the distributions of radio
luminosity of millisecond and normal pulsars, and found that, for the similar
spin-down powers, the radio luminosity of millisecond pulsars is about one
order of magnitude lower than that of the normal pulsars. The analysis of
pulsar radio flux suggests that this correlations are not due to a selective
effect, but are intrinsic to the pulsar radio emission physics. Their radio
radiations may be dominated by the different radiation mechanisms. The cut-off
phenomenon of currently observed radio pulsars in B-P diagram is usually
referred as the ""pulsar death line"", which corresponds to $\dot{E}\approx
10^{30}$ erg/s and is obtained by the cut-off voltage of electron acceleration
gap in the polar cap model of pulsar proposed by Ruderman and Sutherland.
Observationally, this death line can be inferred by the actual observed pulsar
flux $S\approx $1mJy and 1kpc distance, together with the maximum radio
emission efficiency of 1\%. At present, the actual observed pulsar flux can
reach 0.01mJy by FAST telescope, which will arise the observational limit of
spin-down power of pulsar as low as $\dot{E}\approx 10^28$ erg/s. This means
that the new death line is downward shifted two orders of magnitude, which
might be favorably referred as the ""observational limit-line"", and accordingly
the pulsar theoretical model for the cut-off voltage of gap should be heavily
modified.

  Optimization","Accepted by the 2020 International Joint Conference on Neural
  Networks (IJCNN 2020)",,,,"cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional DNN training paradigms typically rely on one training set and
one validation set, obtained by partitioning an annotated dataset used for
training, namely gross training set, in a certain way. The training set is used
for training the model while the validation set is used to estimate the
generalization performance of the trained model as the training proceeds to
avoid over-fitting. There exist two major issues in this paradigm. Firstly, the
validation set may hardly guarantee an unbiased estimate of generalization
performance due to potential mismatching with test data. Secondly, training a
DNN corresponds to solve a complex optimization problem, which is prone to
getting trapped into inferior local optima and thus leads to undesired training
results. To address these issues, we propose a novel DNN training framework. It
generates multiple pairs of training and validation sets from the gross
training set via random splitting, trains a DNN model of a pre-specified
structure on each pair while making the useful knowledge (e.g., promising
network parameters) obtained from one model training process to be transferred
to other model training processes via multi-task optimization, and outputs the
best, among all trained models, which has the overall best performance across
the validation sets from all pairs. The knowledge transfer mechanism featured
in this new framework can not only enhance training effectiveness by helping
the model training process to escape from local optima but also improve on
generalization performance via implicit regularization imposed on one model
training process from other model training processes. We implement the proposed
framework, parallelize the implementation on a GPU cluster, and apply it to
train several widely used DNN models. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed framework over the conventional training paradigm.

valuable for experiments where the kinetic energy of ions or electrons from
rare processes has to be measured with utmost sensitivity and precision.
Examples are direct neutrino mass experiments like KATRIN which investigate the
energy of electrons in the endpoint region of the tritium $\beta$-spectrum.
However, the MAC-E-filter is a very sharp energy high-pass filter but not a
differential spectrometer. To determine a spectral shape of a charged particle
source, different electric retarding potentials have to be used sequentially,
reducing the statistics.
  In a previous work we have shown that the advantages of the standard
MAC-E-filter can be combined with a measurement of the time-of-flight (TOF),
allowing to determine spectral information over a certain energy range with one
retarding potential only, with the corresponding gain in statistics. This TOF
method requires to know the start time of the charged particles, which is not
always possible. Therefore, we propose a new method which does not require the
determination of the start time and which we call ""time-focusing
Time-of-Flight"" (tfTOF): By applying a time dependent acceleration and
deceleration potential at a subsequent MAC-E-filter, an energy dependent
post-bunching of the charged particles is achieved.

$\xi \in [0,1]$ that indicates the local level of material damage. The model
also permits the representation of arbitrarily complex geometries via a diffuse
interface approach based on the solid volume fraction function $\alpha \in
[0,1]$. Neither of the two scalar fields $\xi$ and $\alpha$ needs to be
mesh-aligned, allowing thus faults and cracks with complex topology and the use
of adaptive Cartesian meshes (AMR). The model shares common features with
phase-field approaches but substantially extends them. We show a wide range of
numerical applications that are relevant for dynamic earthquake rupture in
fault zones, including the co-seismic generation of secondary off-fault shear
cracks, tensile rock fracture in the Brazilian disc test, as well as a natural
convection problem in molten rock-like material.

Shapley values stand out as a sound method to explain predictions from any type

dependent features with an underlying continuous distribution. In this paper,
we propose a method to explain mixed (i.e. continuous, discrete, ordinal, and
categorical) dependent features by modeling the dependence structure of the
features using conditional inference trees. We demonstrate our proposed method
against the current industry standards in various simulation studies and find
that our method often outperforms the other approaches. Finally, we apply our

consensus-based blockchain managed by a peer-to-peer network. Several
re-entrancy attacks that aim to steal Ether, the cryptocurrency used in
Ethereum, stored in deployed smart contracts have been found in the recent
years. A countermeasure to such attacks is based on dynamic analysis that
executes the smart contracts themselves, but it requires the spending of Ether
and knowledge of attack patterns for analysis in advance. In this paper, we
present a static analysis tool named \textit{RA (Re-entrancy Analyzer)}, a
combination of symbolic execution and equivalence checking by a satisfiability
modulo theories solver to analyze smart contract vulnerabilities to re-entrancy
attacks. In contrast to existing tools, RA supports analysis of inter-contract
behaviors by using only the Etherum Virtual Machine bytecodes of target smart
contracts, i.e., even without prior knowledge of attack patterns and without
spending Ether. Furthermore, RA can verify existence of vulnerabilities to
re-entrancy attacks without execution of smart contracts and it does not
provide false positives and false negatives. We also present an implementation
of RA to evaluate its performance in analyzing the vulnerability of deployed
smart contracts to re-entrancy attacks and show that RA can precisely determine

two decades. However, EGFs emerge with high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs),
which needs us to stack a large number of cross-correlations. Here, we retrieve
EGFs with high SNRs from ambient seismic noise released by hurricane Dorian
moving along the eastern coast of the United States during 3 days in Sept 2019.
We systematically analyze the energy sources of seismic noise records with
time-frequency analysis and beam-forming. We find that the energy exhibits very
strongly when hurricane Dorian progresses along the coast from 4th to 6th Sept.
Our results suggest that EGFs exhibit strong directionality and only emerge in
the negative part of cross-correlation time functions due to the noise sources
of Dorian. We extract clear multimodal dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves from
retrieved EGFs. Our results, indeed, reveal that multimodal dispersion curves

Dorian for several days or even a single day, which means that we enlarge the

metric systems, behavioural distances provide a more fine-grained comparison of
states than two-valued notions of behavioural equivalence or behaviour
inclusion. Like in the two-valued case, the wide variation found in system
types creates a need for generic methods that apply to many system types at
once. Approaches of this kind are emerging within the paradigm of universal
coalgebra, based either on lifting pseudometrics along set functors or on
lifting general real-valued (fuzzy) relations along functors by means of fuzzy
lax extensions. An immediate benefit of the latter is that they allow bounding
behavioural distance by means of fuzzy (bi-)simulations that need not
themselves be hemi- or pseudometrics; this is analogous to classical
simulations and bisimulations, which need not be preorders or equivalence
relations, respectively. The known generic pseudometric liftings, specifically
the generic Kantorovich and Wasserstein liftings, both can be extended to yield
fuzzy lax extensions, using the fact that both are effectively given by a
choice of quantitative modalities. Our central result then shows that in fact
all fuzzy lax extensions are Kantorovich extensions for a suitable set of
quantitative modalities, the so-called Moss modalities. For nonexpansive fuzzy
lax extensions, this allows for the extraction of quantitative modal logics
that characterize behavioural distance, i.e. satisfy a quantitative version of
the Hennessy-Milner theorem; equivalently, we obtain expressiveness of a
quantitative version of Moss' coalgebraic logic. All our results explicitly

that it is possible to construct PDE-limits of the exact stochastic SIS
epidemics on regular and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks. To do this we first
approximate the exact stochastic process at population level by a
Birth-and-Death process (BD) (with a state space of $O(N)$ rather than
$O(2^N)$) whose coefficients are determined numerically from Gillespie
simulations of the exact epidemic on explicit networks. We numerically
demonstrate that the coefficients of the resulting BD process are
density-dependent, a crucial condition for the existence of a PDE limit.
Extensive numerical tests for Regular and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks show
excellent agreement between the outcome of simulations and the numerical
solution of the Fokker-Planck equations. Apart from a significant reduction in
dimensionality, the PDE also provides the means to derive the epidemic outbreak
threshold linking network and disease dynamics parameters, albeit in an
implicit way. Perhaps more importantly, it enables the formulation and

error is required on average before a valid block is generated. One of the main
concerns raised with regard to this kind of system is the inherent need to
""waste"" energy on ""meaningless"" problems. In fact, the Bitcoin system is
believed to consume more electricity than several small countries.
  In this work we formally define three properties that are necessary for
wasteless PoW systems: (1) solve ""meaningful"" problems (2) solve them
efficiently and (3) be secure against double-spend attacks. These properties
aim to create an open market for problem-solving, in which miners produce
solutions to problems in the most efficient way (wasteless). The security of
the system stems from the economical incentive created by the demand for
solutions to these problems.
  We analyze these properties, and deduce constraints that must apply to such
PoW systems. In our main result, we conclude that under realistic assumptions,
the set of allowed problems must be preimage resistant functions in order to
keep the system secure and efficient.

Disorder is disruptive to electron transport, as it causes coherent electron

order amidst disorder, in that the device Hamiltonians are disordered but when
the device is attached to proper leads the LDOS is ordered. These nanodevices
also are quantum dragons, as they have complete electron transmission, ${\cal

find that the different measures provide different estimates of object

estimates. Indeed, the most selective units had a poor hit-rate or a high
false-alarm rate (or both) in object classification, making them poor object
detectors. We fail to find any units that are even remotely as selective as the
'grandmother cell' units reported in recurrent neural networks. In order to
generalize these results, we compared selectivity measures on units in VGG-16

easy task, but it is crucial to understand the formation history of planets.
The purpose of this work is to show that the observability of TiO features at
optical wavelengths in the transmission spectra of hot Jupiter atmospheres is
sensitive to the bulk chemical properties of the atmosphere. For that, we run a
grid of chemical models which include TiO formation and destruction, for the
ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-19b and an ultra-hot version of HD~209458b. We take into
account non-equilibrium chemistry and changes in the temperature and pressure
structure of these atmospheres caused by different C/O ratios. We calculate
synthetic transmission spectra for these models, and study the relative
strengths of TiO and \ce{H2O} features quantitatively. To compare with
observations, we use a model independent metric for molecular abundances,
$\Delta Z_{\rm TiO-H_2O}/H_{\rm eq}$ that has been previously used in
observational studies of exoplanetary atmospheres. We find that with this
metric we can differentiate between different chemical models and place
constraints on the atmosphere's bulk carbon and oxygen abundance. From chemical
considerations we expected that the TiO abundance would depend on the bulk
nitrogen, however found that any change to N/H did not result in changes to the
resulting TiO. We apply our method to a set of known exoplanets that have been
observed in the relevant optical wavelengths and find good agreement between
low resolution observations and our model for WASP-121b, marginally good
agreement with WASP-79b, WASP-76b, and WASP-19b, and poorer agreement with HD

As possible causes of the insulating behavior, we studied the effects of the
on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) by
investigating the electronic state and the transport coefficient using the
Hartree approximation and the $T$-matrix approximation. The calculations at a
finite $T$ demonstrated that a spin-ordered massive Dirac electron (SMD)
appeared due to the on-site Coulomb interaction. We had an interest in the
anomalous competitive effect with $U$ and SOI when the SMD phase is present in
$\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$, and we investigated these contributions to the
electronic state and conductivity. The SMD is not a conventional spin order,
but it exhibits the spin-valley Hall effect. Direct current resistivity in the
presence of a spin order gap increased divergently and exhibited negative
magnetoresistance in the low $T$ region with decreasing $T$. The charge density
hardly changed below and above the $T$ at which this insulating behavior
appeared. However, when considering the SOI alone, the state changed to a
topological insulator phase, and the electrical resistivity is saturated by
edge conduction at quite low $T$. When considering both the SMD and the SOI,
the spin order gap was suppressed by the SOI, and gaps with different sizes
opened in the left and right Dirac cones. This phase transition leads to
distinct changes in microwave conductivity, such as a discontinuous jump and a
peak structure.

IRS to alleviate the blockage effect and enhance the performance of the mmWave
system. Considering the impact of IRS on user association, we formulate a sum
rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the passive beamforming at IRS
and user association, which is an intractable non-convex problem. Then an
alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem
efficiently. In the proposed algorithm, passive beamforming at IRS is optimized
by utilizing the fractional programming method and user association is solved
through the network optimization based auction algorithm. We provide numerical
comparisons between the proposed algorithm and different reference algorithms.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve
significant gains in the sum rate of all users.

monochromatic circularly and linearly polarized light on the Hofstadter
butterfly in the square lattice, which is induced by uniform perpendicular
magnetic field. In the absence of laser, the butterfly has a fractal,
self-similar structure particle-hole symmetry and reflection symmetry about
magnetic flux $\phi = 1/2$. These symmetries are preserved by the sub-lattice
and the time-reversal symmetry, respectively. As the system is exposed to
circularly polarized light, the original Hofsatdter butterfly in equilibrium is
deformed by breaking both the particle-hole symmetry and the mirror symmetry,
while the inversion symmetry about energy $E=0$ and magnetic flux $\phi=1/2$ is
preserved. Our study show that, the circularly polarized light break both the
sub-lattice symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry. The inversion symmetry is
preserved because the Hamiltonian at magnetic flux $\phi$ and $1-\phi$ is
connected through the sub-lattice transformation. Focusing on the small flux
region, we study the Landau level and the influence of circularly polarized
light on the Landau level. On the contrary, the linearly polarized light
deforms the original Hofstadter butterfly by breaking the rotational symmetry
while preserving sub-lattice and the time-reversal symmetry. Further, we study
the influence of the periodic drive on the Chern number of the lowest band in
middle Floquet copy within the off-resonance regime. We found strong circularly
polarized light will change the Chern number. For linearly polarized light, the
Chern number will not change and the values stay independent of laser
polarization direction. Our work highlights the generic features expected for
the periodically driven Hofstadter problem on square lattice and provide the
strategy to engineering the Hofstadter butterfly with laser.

the objects and their semantic and spatial relationships present in the scene.
As a first step, we derive a scene graph which describes the objects in the

reinforcement agent then learns to autonomously navigate over the extracted

interaction. Solutions of instanton-like equations without pairing and actions
they produce are studied for the Woods-Saxon potential along realistic fission

to a large overestimate of the fission hindrance factors. Actions with

described by a rocky model with a H2 envelope. The maximum collision stripping

representative nature of our sample extends its import well beyond previous
findings. We find no evidence of segregation between cool-core and
non-cool-core systems beyond $\sim 0.3 R_{500}$, implying that, as was found
for thermodynamic properties (Ghirardini et al, 2019), the physical state of
the core does not affect global cluster properties. Our mean abundance within
$R_{500}$ shows a very modest scatter, $< $15%, suggesting the enrichment
process must be quite similar in all these massive systems. This is a new
finding and has significant implications on feedback processes. Together with
results from thermodynamic properties presented in a previous X-COP paper, it
affords a coherent picture where feedback effects do not vary significantly
from one system to another. By combing ICM with stellar measurements we have
found the amount of Fe diffused in the ICM to be about ten times higher than
that locked in stars. Although our estimates suggest, with some strength, that
the measured iron mass in clusters is well in excess of the predicted one,
systematic errors prevent us from making a definitive statement. Further
advancements will only be possible when systematic uncertainties, principally
those associated to stellar masses, both within and beyond $R_{500}$, can be

virtual model (2-DoF) to generate balancing actions through a previously
derived four-term balance controller and transforms them to the robot through a
derived kinematic mapping. The capabilities of this controller are tested in
simulation, where we show the 90kg quadruped robot HyQ crossing a bridge of
only 6 cm width (compared to its 4 cm diameter spherical foot), by balancing on
two feet at any time while moving along a line. Lastly, we present our
preliminary experimental results showing HyQ balancing on two legs while being
disturbed.

  Videos",,,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Highlight detection in sports videos has a broad viewership and huge
commercial potential. It is thus imperative to detect highlight scenes more
suitably for human interest with high temporal accuracy. Since people
instinctively suppress blinks during attention-grabbing events and
synchronously generate blinks at attention break points in videos, the
instantaneous blink rate can be utilized as a highly accurate temporal
indicator of human interest. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel,
automatic highlight detection method based on the blink rate. The method trains
a one-dimensional convolution network (1D-CNN) to assess blink rates at each
video frame from the spatio-temporal pose features of figure skating videos.
Experiments show that the method successfully estimates the blink rate in 94%
of the video clips and predicts the temporal change in the blink rate around a
jump event with high accuracy. Moreover, the method detects not only the
representative athletic action, but also the distinctive artistic expression of
figure skating performance as key frames. This suggests that the
blink-rate-based supervised learning approach enables high-accuracy highlight
detection that more closely matches human sensibility.

prior work usually relies on active scans by researchers or services such as
Shodan. While such scans can identify publicly open ports, they cannot identify
legitimate use of insecure industrial traffic. In particular, source-based
filtering in Network Address Translation or Firewalls prevent detection by
active scanning, but do not ensure that insecure communication is not
manipulated in transit. In this work, we compare Shodan-only analysis with
large-scale traffic analysis at a local Internet Exchange Point (IXP), based on
sFlow sampling. This setup allows us to identify ICS endpoints actually
exchanging industrial traffic over the Internet. Besides, we are able to detect

substantially stronger theoretical guarantees: our algorithms output
$(1+\varepsilon)z$ outliers while achieving an $O(1 /
\varepsilon)$-approximation to the objective function. In the sequential world,
we achieve this by adapting a recent algorithm of Lattanzi and Sohler (ICML
2019). In the distributed setting, we adapt a simple algorithm of Guha et al.
(IEEE Trans. Know. and Data Engineering 2003) and the popular $k$-means$\|$ of
Bahmani et al. (PVLDB 2012).
  A theoretical application of our techniques is an algorithm with running time
$\tilde{O}(nk^2/z)$ that achieves an $O(1)$-approximation to the objective
function while outputting $O(z)$ outliers, assuming $k \ll z \ll n$. This is
complemented with a matching lower bound of $\Omega(nk^2/z)$ for this problem
in the oracle model.

multiple consumers and producers, coordination among the nodes is required to
efficiently use the network resources. Network coding (NC) is a promising tool
to address this issue. The challenge in the case of NC is to be able to get
independent coded content in response to multiple parallel interests by one or
several consumers. In this work, we propose a novel construction called MILIC
(Multiple Interests for Linearly Independent Contents) that impose constraints
on how the replies to interests are coded, intending to get linearly
independent contents in response to multiple interests. Several protocol
variants, called MICN (MILIC-ICN), built on top of NDN (Named Data Networking),
are proposed to integrate these interest constraints and NC of data packets.
Numerical analysis and simulations illustrate that the MILIC construction
performs well and that the MICN protocols are close to optimal throughput on
some scenarios. MICN protocols compare favorably to existing protocols and show
significant benefits when considering the total number of transmitted packets
in the network, and in the case of high link loss rate.

an impact typically leads to less than 10 particles being ejected from the

diameter above the surface. That is, the observed impacts are highly
dissipative and only a small fraction of the impact energy is imparted onto the
ejecta. While the impactor itself still rebounds, it typically slows down
significantly to an average of about 20 % of its impact velocity. Scaled to
asteroids, impactor and ejecta generated from impacts of sand sized grains are
not able to spread over the asteroid's surface but will stay close to the
impact site. Therefore these highly inelastic impacts into soft granular beds
efficiently trap grains, in contrast to more elastic impacts on bare, rocky
surfaces confirming suggestions by Shinbrot (2017). This is also in agreement
to observed features on asteroids as this topological elasticity bias suggests
that redistribution of grains leads to a size segregation.

analysis of documents with complex layouts. This has traditionally been carried
out in uncompressed documents, although most of the documents in real life
exist in a compressed form warranted by the requirement to make storage and
transfer efficient. However, carrying out page segmentation directly in
compressed documents without going through the stage of decompression is a
challenging goal. This research paper proposes demonstrating the possibility of
carrying out a page segmentation operation directly in the run-length data of
the CCITT Group-3 compressed text document, which could be single- or
multi-columned and might even have some text regions in the inverted text color
mode. Therefore, before carrying out the segmentation of the text document into
columns, each column into paragraphs, each paragraph into text lines, each line
into words, and, finally, each word into characters, a pre-processing of the
text document needs to be carried out. The pre-processing stage identifies the
normal text regions and inverted text regions, and the inverted text regions
are toggled to the normal mode. In the sequel to initiate column separation, a
new strategy of incremental assimilation of white space runs in the vertical
direction and the auto-estimation of certain related parameters is proposed. A
procedure to realize column-segmentation employing these extracted parameters
has been devised. Subsequently, what follows first is a two-level horizontal
row separation process, which segments every column into paragraphs, and in
turn, into text-lines. Then, there is a two-level vertical column separation
process, which completes the separation into words and characters.

axis. Some of the solutions describe geometries resembling that of Melvin's
static magnetic universe and contain a regular symmetry axis, while some others
(in the case $w > 0$) describe traversable wormhole geometries which do not
contain a symmetry axis. Unlike Melvin's solution, those with rotation and a
magnetic field cannot be vacuum and require a current. The wormhole solutions
admit matching with flat-space regions on both sides of the throat, thus
forming a cylindrical wormhole configuration potentially visible for distant
observers residing in flat or weakly curved parts of space. The thin shells,
located at junctions between the inner (wormhole) and outer (flat) regions,
consist of matter satisfying the Weak Energy Condition under a proper choice of
the free parameters of the model, and thus we obtain new examples of
phantom-free wormhole models in general relativity. In the limit $w \to 1$, the

the foundational literature of Quantum Mechanics (QM) according to which
'superpositions are never actually observed in the lab'. In order to do so, we
begin by providing a critical analysis of the famous measurement problem which,
we will argue, was originated by the strict application of the
empirical-positivist requirements to subsume the quantum formalism under their
specific understanding of 'theory'. In this context, the ad hoc introduction of
the projection postulate (or measurement rule) can be understood as a necessary
requirement coming from a naive empiricist standpoint which presupposes that
observations are self evident givens of ""common sense"" experience --independent
of metaphysical (categorical) presuppositions. We then turn our attention to
two ""non-collapse"" interpretations of QM --namely, modal and many worlds--
which even though deny that the ""collapse"" is a real physical process anyhow
retain the measurement rule as a necessary element of the theory. In
contraposition, following Einstein's claim according to which ""it is only the
theory which decides what can be observed"", we propose a return to the realist
representational understanding of 'physical theories' in which 'observation' is
considered as derived from theoretical presuppositions. It is from this
standpoint that we discuss a new non-classical conceptual representation which
allows us to understand quantum phenomena in an intuitive (anschaulicht)
manner. Leaving behind the projection postulate, we discuss the general
physical conditions for measuring and observing quantum superpositions.

attention gating mechanism, which we condition with adversarial signals to act

Subject to adversarial conditioning, the segmentor learns attention maps that
are semantic, suppress the noisy activations outside the objects, and reduce

existing bounds by providing tighter convergence rates for both strongly convex

present-day calculations, quantum computation strategies still require the
restriction to a finite system size, including a finite, usually periodic,
spatial volume. In this work, we investigate the consequences of this in the
extraction of hadronic and Compton-like scattering amplitudes. Using the

are very large by the standards of present-day Euclidean calculations. We then
present an improvement strategy, based in the fact that the finite volume has a
reduced symmetry. This implies that kinematic points, which yield the same
Lorentz invariants, may still be physically distinct in the finite-volume
system. As we demonstrate, both numerically and analytically, averaging over
such sets can significantly suppress the unwanted volume distortions and
improve the extraction of the physical scattering amplitudes.

decomposition based on local Koopman spectral theory are revealed. However,
nonlinear dynamics are distinguished from the linear by local exponential
dynamics and infinite dimension, where the latter is due to nonlinear
interaction and characterized by recursively proliferated Koopman eigenspaces.
The new framework provides foundations for dynamic analysis techniques such as
global stability analysis (GSA) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) technique.
Additionally, linear structure via Mercer eigenfunction decomposition derives
the well-known proper-orthogonal decomposition (POD). A Hopf bifurcation
process of flow past fixed cylinder is decomposed numerically by the DMD
technique. The equivalence of Koopman decomposition to the GSA is verified at
the primary instability stage. The Fourier modes, the least stable Floquet
modes, and their high-order derived modes around the limit cycle solution are
found to be the superposition of countably infinite number of Koopman modes
when the flows reach periodic. The nonlinear modulation effects on the mean
flow is the saturation of the superimposed monotonic Koopman modes. The
nonlinear resonance phenomenon is attributed to the alignment of infinite

relies on the properties of continuity of Koopman spectrums and
state-invariance of Koopman modes discussed in part 1. The coherent structures

viewed as a smooth approximation to a superquantile method. We develop batch

the problem can be efficiently solved relative to common alternatives. Finally,
we demonstrate that TERM can be used for a multitude of applications, such as
enforcing fairness between subgroups, mitigating the effect of outliers, and

tailored to these individual problems, but can also enable entirely new

structures. Corrosion related maintenance and repair of reinforced concrete
structures cost multibillion USD per annum globally. It is often triggered by
the ingression of carbon dioxide and/or chloride into the pores of concrete.
Estimation of these corrosion causing factors using the conventional models
results in suboptimal assessment since they are incapable of capturing the
complex interaction of parameters. Hygrothermal interaction also plays a role
in aggravating the corrosion of reinforcement bar and this is usually
counteracted by applying surface-protection systems. These systems have
different degree of protection and they may even cause deterioration to the

provide a framework that enhances the assessment reliability of the corrosion

data-driven carbonation depth, chloride profile and hygrothermal performance
prediction models. The carbonation depth prediction model integrates neural
network, decision tree, boosted and bagged ensemble decision trees. The
ensemble tree based chloride profile prediction models evaluate the
significance of chloride ingress controlling variables from various
perspectives. The hygrothermal interaction prediction models are developed
using neural networks to evaluate the status of corrosion and other unexpected

classes for the approximation of high-dimensional functions in computational
and data science. They correspond to sum-product neural networks with a sparse
connectivity associated with a dimension tree and widths given by a tuple of
tensor ranks. The approximation power of these models has been proved to be
(near to) optimal for classical smoothness classes. However, in an empirical
risk minimization framework with a limited number of observations, the
dimension tree and ranks should be selected carefully to balance estimation and
approximation errors. We propose and analyze a complexity-based model selection
method for tree tensor networks in an empirical risk minimization framework and
we analyze its performance over a wide range of smoothness classes. Given a
family of model classes associated with different trees, ranks, tensor product
feature spaces and sparsity patterns for sparse tensor networks, a model is
selected (\`a la Barron, Birg\'e, Massart) by minimizing a penalized empirical
risk, with a penalty depending on the complexity of the model class and derived
from estimates of the metric entropy of tree tensor networks. This choice of
penalty yields a risk bound for the selected predictor. In a least-squares
setting, after deriving fast rates of convergence of the risk, we show that our
strategy is (near to) minimax adaptive to a wide range of smoothness classes
including Sobolev or Besov spaces (with isotropic, anisotropic or mixed
dominating smoothness) and analytic functions. We discuss the role of sparsity
of the tensor network for obtaining optimal performance in several regimes. In
practice, the amplitude of the penalty is calibrated with a slope heuristics
method. Numerical experiments in a least-squares regression setting illustrate
the performance of the strategy.

should at least cover the expected costs during the contract horizon. As these
expected costs may depend on several machine-dependent characteristics, e.g.
operational environment, the service fees should also be differentiated based
on these characteristics. If not, customers that are less prone to high

lead to adverse selection and leave the service provider with a
maintenance-heavy portfolio, which may be detrimental to the profitability of

extracting eigencomponents of interest from random vectors or matrices. This
study extends a projection method for regular eigenproblems to the singular
nonsquare case, thus replacing the standard matrix inverse in the resolvent
with the pseudoinverse. The extended method involves complex moments given by
the contour integrals of generalized resolvents associated with nonsquare

computations, the contour integrals are approximated using numerical
quadratures. The primary cost lies in the solutions of linear least squares
problems that arise from quadrature points, and they can be readily
parallelized in practice. Numerical experiments on large matrix pencils
illustrate this method. The new method is more robust and efficient than
previous methods, and based on experimental results, it is conjectured to be
more efficient in parallelized settings. Notably, the proposed method does not
fail in cases involving pairs of extremely close eigenvalues, and it overcomes
the issue of problem size.

gas within the interstellar medium (ISM) on a Galactic scale, including the
CO-dark component. Here we report the discovery of the 13CH isotopologue in the
ISM using the upGREAT receiver on board SOFIA. We have detected the three
hyperfine structure components of the 2THz frequency transition from its
ground-state toward four high-mass star-forming regions and determine 13CH
column densities. The ubiquity of molecules containing carbon in the ISM has
turned the determination of the ratio between the abundances of carbon's two
stable isotopes, 12C/13C, into a cornerstone for Galactic chemical evolution
studies. Whilst displaying a rising gradient with Galactocentric distance, this
ratio, when measured using observations of different molecules (CO, H2CO, and
others) shows systematic variations depending on the tracer used. These
observed inconsistencies may arise from optical depth effects, chemical
fractionation or isotope-selective photo-dissociation. Formed from C+ either
via UV-driven or turbulence-driven chemistry, CH reflects the fractionation of
C+, and does not show any significant fractionation effects unlike other
molecules previously used to determine the 12C/13C isotopic ratio which make it
an ideal tracer for the 12C/13C ratio throughout the Galaxy. Therefore, by
comparing the derived column densities of 13CH with previously obtained SOFIA
data of the corresponding transitions of the main isotopologue 12CH, we derive
12C/13C isotopic ratios toward Sgr B2(M), G34.26+0.15, W49(N) and W51E. Adding
our values derived from 12/13CH to previous calculations of the Galactic

phones may use ad-hoc connections via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi in addition to the
cellular network to solve tasks more efficiently. Like in this case, the
different communication modes may differ considerably in range, bandwidth, and
flexibility. We build upon the model of Augustine et al. [SODA '20], which
captures these differences by a local and a global mode. Specifically, the
local edges model a fixed communication network in which $O(1)$ messages of
size $O(\log n)$ can be sent over every edge in each synchronous round. The
global edges form a clique, but nodes are only allowed to send and receive a
total of at most $O(\log n)$ messages over global edges, which restricts the
nodes to use these edges only very sparsely. We demonstrate the power of hybrid
networks by presenting algorithms to compute Single-Source Shortest Paths and
the diameter very efficiently in sparse graphs. Specifically, we present exact
$O(\log n)$ time algorithms for cactus graphs (i.e., graphs in which each edge
is contained in at most one cycle), and $3$-approximations for graphs that have
at most $n + O(n^{1/3})$ edges and arboricity $O(\log n)$. For these graph
classes, our algorithms provide exponentially faster solutions than the best

scientific discoveries of novel patterns have primarily been relying on manual

discovery in these systems was recently introduced [26, 62], highlighting that
two key ingredients are autonomous exploration and unsupervised representation
learning to describe ""relevant"" degrees of variations in the patterns. In this
paper, we motivate the need for what we call Meta-diversity search, arguing
that there is not a unique ground truth interesting diversity as it strongly
depends on the final observer and its motives. Using a continuous game-of-life
system for experiments, we provide empirical evidences that relying on
monolithic architectures for the behavioral embedding design tends to bias the
final discoveries (both for hand-defined and unsupervisedly-learned features)
which are unlikely to be aligned with the interest of a final end-user. To
address these issues, we introduce a novel dynamic and modular architecture
that enables unsupervised learning of a hierarchy of diverse representations.
Combined with intrinsically motivated goal exploration algorithms, we show that
this system forms a discovery assistant that can efficiently adapt its
diversity search towards preferences of a user using only a very small amount
of user feedback.

to certain separating cycles, our subgraph isomorphism algorithm can decide the
vertex connectivity of a planar graph (with high probability) in asymptotically
near-linear work and poly-logarithmic depth. Previously, no sub-quadratic work
and poly-logarithmic depth bound was known in planar graphs (in particular for
distinguishing between four-connected and five-connected planar graphs).

whether a new genetic profile has enough compatibility with the data on which
the network was trained and is thus suitable for prediction. The code and

the training of deep SNNs is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a
novel ANN-to-SNN conversion and layer-wise learning framework for rapid and
efficient pattern recognition, which is referred to as progressive tandem
learning of deep SNNs. By studying the equivalence between ANNs and SNNs in the
discrete representation space, a primitive network conversion method is
introduced that takes full advantage of spike count to approximate the
activation value of analog neurons. To compensate for the approximation errors
arising from the primitive network conversion, we further introduce a
layer-wise learning method with an adaptive training scheduler to fine-tune the
network weights. The progressive tandem learning framework also allows hardware
constraints, such as limited weight precision and fan-in connections, to be
progressively imposed during training. The SNNs thus trained have demonstrated
remarkable classification and regression capabilities on large-scale object
recognition, image reconstruction, and speech separation tasks, while requiring
at least an order of magnitude reduced inference time and synaptic operations
than other state-of-the-art SNN implementations. It, therefore, opens up a
myriad of opportunities for pervasive mobile and embedded devices with a

linear functions are usually utilized as the consequent parts of the fuzzy
rules, but they cannot effectively describe the behavior within local regions
defined by the antecedent parts. In this article, a theoretical and practical
design methodology is developed to address this problem. First, the information
granulation (Fuzzy C-Means) method is applied to capture the structure in the
data and split the input space into subspaces, as well as form the antecedent
parts. Second, the quadratic polynomials (QPs) are employed as the consequent
parts. Compared with constant and linear functions, QPs can describe the
input-output behavior within the local regions (subspaces) by refining the
relationship between input and output variables. However, although QP can
improve the approximation ability of the model, it could lead to the
deterioration of the prediction ability of the model (e.g., overfitting). To
handle this issue, we introduce an exponential weight approach inspired by the
weight function theory encountered in harmonic analysis. More specifically, we
adopt the exponential functions as the targeted penalty terms, which are
equipped with l2 regularization (l2) (i.e., exponential weighted l2, ewl_2) to
match the proposed reinforced second-order fuzzy rule-based model (RSFRM)
properly. The advantage of el 2 compared to ordinary l2 lies in separately
identifying and penalizing different types of polynomial terms in the
coefficient estimation, and its results not only alleviate the overfitting and
prevent the deterioration of generalization ability but also effectively
release the prediction potential of the model.

One significant feature that makes such attacks particularly powerful is
transferability, where the adversarial examples generated from one model can be
effective against other similar models as well. A large number of works have
been done to increase the transferability. However, how to decrease the
transferability and craft malicious samples only for specific target models are
not explored yet.
  In this paper, we design novel attack methodologies to generate adversarial
examples with controllable non-transferability. With these methods, an
adversary can efficiently produce precise adversarial examples to attack a set
of target models he desires, while keeping benign to other models. The first
method is Reversed Loss Function Ensemble, where the adversary can craft
qualified examples from the gradients of a reversed loss function. This
approach is effective for the white-box and gray-box settings. The second
method is Transferability Classification: the adversary trains a
transferability-aware classifier from the perturbations of adversarial
examples. This classifier further provides the guidance for the generation of
non-transferable adversarial examples. This approach can be applied to the
black-box scenario. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed methods. This work opens up a new route for

the space of Yang-Mills theories. We present extensions of YMT theories as a
simple and unified approach to many different notions of deformations and
addition of correction terms previously discussed in the literature. A relation
between these extensions and emergence phenomena in the sense of
arXiv:2004.13144 is presented. We consider the space of all extensions of a

only ubiquitous in daily life and in industrial applications but they are also
crucial for the mechanical stability of cells or the transport of chemical and
biological agents in living organisms. Despite the importance of these systems,
their microscopic structure is understood only on a rudimentary level, thus in
stark contrast to the case of gases and crystals. Since scattering experiments
and analytical calculations usually give only structural information that is
spherically averaged, the three dimensional (3D) structure of disordered
systems is basically unknown. Here we introduce a simple method that allows to
probe the 3D structure of such systems. Using computer simulations we find that
hard-sphere-like liquids have on intermediate and large scales an intricate
structural order given by alternating layers with icosahedral and dodecahedral
symmetries, while open network liquids like silica have a structural order with
tetrahedral symmetry. These results show that liquids have a highly non-trivial
3D structure and that this structural information is encoded in non-standard
correlation functions.

to the demand for embedded devices and mobile applications. Research on
efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) aims at removing feature
redundancy by decomposing or optimizing the convolutional calculation. In this
work, feature redundancy is assumed to exist among channels in CNN
architectures, which provides some leeway to boost calculation efficiency.
Aiming at channel compression, a novel convolutional construction named compact
convolution is proposed to embrace the progress in spatial convolution, channel
grouping and pooling operation. Specifically, the depth-wise separable
convolution and the point-wise interchannel operation are utilized to
efficiently extract features. Different from the existing channel compression
method which usually introduces considerable learnable weights, the proposed
compact convolution can reduce feature redundancy with no extra parameters.
With the point-wise interchannel operation, compact convolutions implicitly
squeeze the channel dimension of feature maps. To explore the rules on reducing
channel redundancy in neural networks, the comparison is made among different
point-wise interchannel operations. Moreover, compact convolutions are extended
to tackle with multiple tasks, such as acoustic scene classification, sound
event detection and image classification. The extensive experiments demonstrate
that our compact convolution not only exhibits high effectiveness in several
multimedia tasks, but also can be efficiently implemented by benefiting from
parallel computation.

periodic in two dimensions. The image-forming current for multiple tips in STM
is derived in a more straightforward manner than prior approaches. The Fourier
spectrum of the current for p4mm Bloch surface wave functions and a pair of
delta function tips reveals the tip-separation dependence of various types of
image obscurations. In particular our analyses predict that quantum
interference should be visible on a macroscopic scale in the form of bands
quite distinct from the basket-weave patterns a purely classical model would
create at the same periodic double STM tip separations. A surface wave function
that models the essential character of highly (0001) oriented pyrolytic
graphite (technically known as HOPG) is introduced and used for a similar
tip-separation analysis. Using a bonding H_2 tip wave function with significant
spatial extent instead of this pair of infinitesimal Dirac delta function tips
does not affect these outcomes in any observable way. This is explained by
Pierre Curie's well known symmetry principle. Classical simulations of multiple
tip effects in STM images may be understood as modeling multiple tip effects in
images that were recorded with other types of SPMs). Our analysis clarifies why
CIP and crystallographic averaging work well in removing the effects of a blunt

direct and scattered H$\alpha$ radiation from HII regions and warm ionized
medium (WIM). The positions and radii of HII regions are quoted from the WISE
HII catalog, and the WIM is described by an axisymmetric model. The scattering
is off dust and free electrons that are realized by applying an exponential
fitting to the HI4PI HI map and an exponential disk model, respectively. The
simulated H$\alpha$ intensity, the Simfast21 software, and the latest SKA1-Low
layout configuration are employed to simulate the SKA ""observed"" images of
Galactic free-free emission and the EoR signal. By analyzing the
one-dimensional power spectra, we find that the Galactic free-free emission can
be about $10^{5.4}$-$10^{2.1}$, $10^{5.0}$-$10^{1.7}$, and
$10^{4.3}$-$10^{1.1}$ times more luminous than the EoR signal on scales of
$0.1~{\rm Mpc^{-1}} < k < 2~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ in the 116-124, 146-154, and
186-194 MHz frequency bands, respectively. We further calculate the
two-dimensional power spectra inside the EoR window and show that the power
leaked by Galactic free-free emission can still be significant, as the power
ratios can reach about $110\%$-$8000\%$, $30\%$-$2400\%$, and $10\%$-$250\%$ on
scales of $0.5~{\rm Mpc^{-1}} \lesssim k \lesssim 1~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ in three
frequency bands. Therefore, we indicate that the Galactic free-free emission
should be carefully treated in future EoR detections.

Gaussian wave packets obtained using the envelope method. It is shown that the

subluminal velocity and pure imaginary mass that fulfils the energy-momentum
relation typical of classical tachyons. The obtained results are used to prove
that the trembling motion of the particle position around the median, known as
Zitterbewegung, also takes place for the superluminal neutrino, even if the
oscillation velocity is always lower than the speed of light. Finally, the
pseudo-tachyon wave packet is used to calculate the probability of oscillation
between mass states, obtaining a formula analogous to the one obtained for the
ordinary neutrino. This suggest that in the experiments concerning neutrino
oscillation is not possible to distinguish tachyonic neutrinos from ordinary
ones.

reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms to achieve high, real-time performance
in network-level traffic signal control. In this approach, each intersection is
modeled as an agent that plays a Markovian Game against the other intersection
nodes in a traffic signal network modeled as an undirected graph, to approach
the optimal reduction in delay. Following Partially Observable Markov Decision
Processes (POMDPs), there are 3 levels of communication schemes between
adjacent learning agents: independent deep Q-leaning (IDQL), shared states
reinforcement learning (S2RL) and a shared states & rewards version of
S2RL--S2R2L. In these 3 variants of decentralized MARL schemes, individual
agent trains its local deep Q network (DQN) separately, enhanced by
convergence-guaranteed techniques like double DQN, prioritized experience
replay, multi-step bootstrapping, etc. To test the performance of the proposed
three MARL algorithms, a SUMO-based simulation platform is developed to mimic
the traffic evolution of the real world. Fed with random traffic demand between
permitted OD pairs, a 4x4 Manhattan-style grid network is set up as the
testbed, two different vehicle arrival rates are generated for model training
and testing. The experiment results show that S2R2L has a quicker convergence
rate and better convergent performance than IDQL and S2RL in the training
process. Moreover, three MARL schemes all reveal exceptional generalization
abilities. Their testing results surpass the benchmark Max Pressure (MP)
algorithm, under the criteria of average vehicle delay, network-level queue
length and fuel consumption rate. Notably, S2R2L has the best testing
performance of reducing 34.55% traffic delay and dissipating 10.91% queue

as well as grasp a potential outlook on the future development. A literature
review of the strategic framework, the banking sector in Germany and the

as to whether the banking sector is a ""Red Ocean"" and if the FinTech industry
is a ""Blue Ocean"" is carried out using case studies from both sectors. A
quantitative analysis of banking customers in Germany and their use of FinTech
companies is conducted by way of an online survey, with selected participants
being interviewed thereafter to gain additional insights. Data evaluation is
made using pivotal analysis and cross tabulation of survey results and
interview findings, along with extrapolating indicators to reflect the full

the flow. The regularity properties of the parabolic flow allow us to connect
an improved entropy - entropy production inequality during an initial time
layer to spectral properties of a suitable linearized problem which is relevant
for the asymptotic time layer. Altogether, the stability in the inequalities is
measured by a deficit which controls in strong norms (a Fisher information

distance to the manifold of optimal functions. The method is constructive and,
for the first time, quantitative estimates of the stability constant are

consists of five layers: an embedding layer based on GloVe, a BiGRU based
ensemble layer, a primary capsule layer, a flatten layer and fully connected
ReLU layer followed by a fully connected softmax layer. In order to evaluate

to reduce the large beam divergence inherent to Orbital Angular Momentum waves
(OAM waves-Vortex waves) that are generated by an Uniform Circular Patch
Antenna Array (UCA) at 10 GHz. The tailored lens and the tailored reflector are
designed by the shape function (5) and (9) around the antenna s center axis,
respectively. The tailored lens is compared to UCA without and with
conventional lens. The simulated and measured results show a significant
improvement when using the tailored lens. Following, a tailored reflector is
implemented and compared to UCA without and with conventional reflector.
Firstly, the two reflectors are simulated with an impressed field source to
neglect the influence of the UCA. The simulated results of the two reflectors
show that the tailored reflector has a better performance than the conventional
reflector when the height of the reflector $r_0$ is less than around 1.5
$\lambda$ and when the opening angle of the reflector theta is less than
38{\deg} (for UCA with $d$ of $\lambda/2$). In addition, the reflectors are
simulated with real UCA with different shapes of PCB, which can disturb the
reflected waves from the reflector. Two lenses and two reflectors are
manufactured and measured in an anechoic chamber and compared to the simulation
results. This paper shows that the vortex waves needs a special lens or a
special reflector to reduce effictively the beam divergence especially when the
radius of the UCA is very large.

COVID-19. In order to face this disease and minimize its socio-economic
impacts, in addition to surveillance and treatment, diagnosis is a crucial
procedure. However, the realization of this is hampered by the delay and the

triage. In this scenario, deep learning models are being proposed as a possible
option to assist the diagnostic process based on chest X-ray and computed
tomography images. Therefore, this research aims to automate the process of
detecting COVID-19 cases from chest images, using convolutional neural networks
(CNN) through deep learning techniques. The results can contribute to expand
access to other forms of detection of COVID-19 and to speed up the process of
identifying this disease. All databases used, the codes built, and the results
obtained from the models' training are available for open access. This action
facilitates the involvement of other researchers in enhancing these models
since this can contribute to the improvement of results and, consequently, the

countries, becoming classified as a pandemic. So far, there is no definitive
treatment or vaccine, so the best solution is to prevent transmission between
individuals through social distancing. However, it is difficult to measure the
effectiveness of these distance measures. Therefore, this study uses data from
Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports to try to understand the mobility
patterns of the Portuguese population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
study, the Rt value was modeled for Portugal. Also, the changepoint was
calculated for the population mobility patterns. Thus, the change in the
mobility pattern was used to understand the impact of social distance measures
on the dissemination of COVID-19. As a result, it can be stated that the
initial Rt value in Portugal was very close to 3, falling to values close to 1
after 25 days. Social isolation measures were adopted quickly. Furthermore, it
was observed that public transport was avoided during the pandemic. Finally,
until the emergence of a vaccine or an effective treatment, this is the new
normal, and it must be understood that new patterns of mobility, social
interaction, and hygiene must be adapted to this reality.

concept is presented for evaluating stochastic topological sensitivities of
complex systems. The proposed framework, designed for dealing with high
dimensional random inputs, dovetails a polynomial dimensional decomposition
(PDD) of multivariate stochastic response functions and deterministic topology
derivatives. On one hand, it provides analytical expressions to calculate
topology sensitivities of the first three stochastic moments which are often
required in robust topology optimization (RTO). On another hand, it offers
embedded Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and finite difference formulations to
estimate topology sensitivities of failure probability for reliability-based
topology optimization (RBTO). For both cases, the quantification of
uncertainties and their topology sensitivities are determined concurrently from
a single stochastic analysis. Moreover, an original example of two random
variables is developed for the first time to obtain analytical solutions for
topology sensitivity of moments and failure probability. Another 53-dimension
example is constructed for analytical solutions of topology sensitivity of
moments and semi-analytical solutions of topology sensitivity of failure
probabilities in order to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed
method for high-dimensional scenarios. Those examples are new and make it
possible for researchers to benchmark stochastic topology sensitivities of
existing or new algorithms. In addition, it is unveiled that under certain
conditions the proposed method achieves better accuracies for stochastic
topology sensitivities than for the stochastic quantities themselves.

real-time label-free detection. However, it is pivotal to optimize various
parameters of the sensor configuration for efficient and highly sensitive
sensing. To that effect, we focus on optimizing two different SPR structures --
the basic Kretschmann configuration and narrow groove grating. Our analysis
aims to detect two different types of lipids known as phospholipid and eggyolk,
which are used as analyte (sensing layer) and two different types of proteins
namely tryptophan and bovine serum albumin (BSA) are used as ligand (binding
site). For both the configurations, we investigate all possible lipid-protein
combinations to understand the effect of various parameters on sensitivity,
minimum reflectivity and full width half maximum (FWHM). Lipids are the
structural building block of cell membranes and mutation of these layers by
virus and bacteria is one the prime reasons of many diseases in our body.
Hence, improving the performance of a SPR sensor to detect very small change in
lipid holds immense significance. We use finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
technique to perform quantitative analysis to get an optimized structure. We
find that sensitivity increases when lipid concentration is increased and it is
the highest (21.95 degree/RIU) for phospholipid and tryptophan combination when
metal and lipid layer thickness are 45 nm and 30 nm respectively. However,
metal layer thickness does not cause any significant variation in sensitivity,
but as it increases to 50 nm, minimum reflectivity and full width half maximum
(FWHM) decreases to the lowest. In case of narrow groove grating structure,
broad range of wavelengths can generate SPR and the sensitivity is highest
(900nm/RIU) for a configuration of 10 nm groove width and 70 nm groove height
at a resonance wavelength of 1411 nm.

introspecting and auditing policies in different institutions. In this paper,
we propose learning explanations of expert decisions by modeling their reward
function in terms of preferences with respect to ""what if"" outcomes: Given the
current history of observations, what would happen if we took a particular
action? To learn these cost-benefit tradeoffs associated with the expert's
actions, we integrate counterfactual reasoning into batch inverse reinforcement
learning. This offers a principled way of defining reward functions and
explaining expert behavior, and also satisfies the constraints of real-world
decision-making -- where active experimentation is often impossible (e.g. in
healthcare). Additionally, by estimating the effects of different actions,
counterfactuals readily tackle the off-policy nature of policy evaluation in
the batch setting, and can naturally accommodate settings where the expert
policies depend on histories of observations rather than just current states.
Through illustrative experiments in both real and simulated medical
environments, we highlight the effectiveness of our batch, counterfactual
inverse reinforcement learning approach in recovering accurate and
interpretable descriptions of behavior.

appear in random brain locations, instead, its spatial pattern follows large
scale brain networks. In this context, a powerful network analysis approach
with a mathematical foundation is indispensable to understand the mechanism of
neuropathological events spreading throughout the brain. Indeed, the topology
of each brain network is governed by its native harmonic waves, which are a set
of orthogonal bases derived from the Eigen-system of the underlying Laplacian
matrix. To that end, we propose a novel connectome harmonic analysis framework
to provide enhanced mathematical insights by detecting frequency-based
alterations relevant to brain disorders. The backbone of our framework is a
novel manifold algebra appropriate for inference across harmonic waves that
overcomes the limitations of using classic Euclidean operations on irregular
data structures. The individual harmonic difference is measured by a set of
common harmonic waves learned from a population of individual Eigen systems,
where each native Eigen-system is regarded as a sample drawn from the Stiefel
manifold. Specifically, a manifold optimization scheme is tailored to find the
common harmonic waves which reside at the center of Stiefel manifold. To that
end, the common harmonic waves constitute the new neuro-biological bases to
understand disease progression. Each harmonic wave exhibits a unique
propagation pattern of neuro-pathological burdens spreading across brain
networks. The statistical power of our novel connectome harmonic analysis
approach is evaluated by identifying frequency-based alterations relevant to
Alzheimer's disease, where our learning-based manifold approach discovers more
significant and reproducible network dysfunction patterns compared to Euclidian
methods.

modeling mainly relies on qualitative methods from behavioral science and

on human demographic and business usage data, where behavior-oriented elements
are hidden in routinely collected transactional data. As a result, it is
ineffective or even impossible to deeply scrutinize native behavior intention,
lifecycle and impact on complex problems and business issues. We propose the
approach of Behavior Informatics (BI), in order to support explicit and
quantitative behavior involvement through a conversion from source data to
behavioral data, and further conduct genuine analysis of behavior patterns and

behavioral data construction, behavior impact analysis, behavior pattern
analysis, behavior simulation, and behavior presentation and behavior use. We
discuss the concepts of behavior and an abstract behavioral model, as well as
the research tasks, process and theoretical underpinnings of BI. Substantial
experiments have shown that BI has the potential to greatly complement the
existing empirical and specific means by finding deeper and more informative
patterns leading to greater in-depth behavior understanding. BI creates new
