health. Without further incentives, pharmaceutical companies have little
interest in developing antibiotics, since the success probability is low and
development costs are huge. The situation is exacerbated by the ""antibiotics
dilemma"": Developing narrow-spectrum antibiotics against resistant bacteria is
most beneficial for society, but least attractive for companies since their
usage is more limited than for broad-spectrum drugs and thus sales are low.
Starting from a general mathematical framework for the study of
antibiotic-resistance dynamics with an arbitrary number of antibiotics, we
identify efficient treatment protocols and introduce a market-based refunding
scheme that incentivizes pharmaceutical companies to develop narrow-spectrum
antibiotics: Successful companies can claim a refund from a newly established
antibiotics fund that partially covers their development costs. The proposed
refund involves a fixed and variable part. The latter (i) increases with the
use of the new antibiotic for currently resistant strains in comparison with
other newly developed antibiotics for this purpose---the resistance
premium---and (ii) decreases with the use of this antibiotic for non-resistant
bacteria. We outline how such a refunding scheme can solve the antibiotics
dilemma and cope with various sources of uncertainty inherent in antibiotic
R\&D. Finally, connecting our refunding approach to the recently established
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) action fund, we discuss how the antibiotics fund
can be financed.

We find consistent results. For the ILOT (ILRT: intermediate luminosity red

in the interaction of excitons with opposite spins. At sufficiently large
density a resonant exciton superfluid transforms into a superfluid of
biexcitons. The transition may be either of the first or the second kind. The
average relative momenta of excitons in the pairs being beyond the light cone,
the transition should be accompanied by reduction of the photoluminescence
intensity. Effective magnetic fields due to the long-range exchange splitting
of non-radiative exciton states induce broadening of the biexciton resonance.
The fields shift the position of the gap in the elementary excitation spectrum
to a circle of degenerate minima in the k-space. Closing the new gap defines a
second order phase transition into a mixture of counter-propagating plane-wave
excitonic condensates polarized linearly in the direction perpendicular to
their wavevectors. In the resonance energy vs density phase diagram the novel

correlated alignment of the effective magnetic fields and excitonic spins. We
outline important differences of the emergent mechanism from the phenomenon of
spin-orbit (SO) coupled Bose-Einstein condensation. We expect existence of

attainable by the satellite missions have long created the opinion that
electrons are most efficiently accelerated in a quasi-perpendicular shock
geometry. However, shocks that are deemed to be responsible for the production
of cosmic ray electrons and their radiation from sources such as supernova
remnants are much more powerful and larger than the Earth's bow-shock. Their
remote observations and in situ measurements at Saturn's bow shock, suggest
that electrons are accelerated very efficiently in the quasi-parallel shocks as
well. In this paper we investigate the possibility that protons that are
accelerated to high energies create sufficient wave turbulence, which is
necessary for the electron preheating and subsequent injection into the
diffusive shock acceleration in a quasi-parallel shock geometry. An additional
test-particle-electron population, which is meant to be a low-density addition
to the electron core-distribution on which the hybrid simulation operates, is
introduced. We investigate how these electrons are energized by the hybrid
electromagnetic field. The reduced spatial dimensionality allowed us to
dramatically increase the number of macro-ions per numerical cell and achieve
the converged results for the velocity distributions of test electrons. We
discuss the electron preheating mechanisms, which can make a significant part
of thermal electrons accessible to the ion-driven waves observed in hybrid
simulations. We find that the precursor wave field supplied by ions has a
considerable potential to preheat the electrons before they are shocked at the

to find points that are, with probability 1, fixed points of the random
functions [Hermer, Luke, Sturm, 2019]. When no such points exist, the
stochastic feasibility problem is called inconsistent, but still under certain

the random function iterations converge to an invariant measure for the
corresponding Markov operator. There are two major types of convergence: almost
sure convergence of the iterates to a fixed point in the case of stochastic
feasibility, and convergence in distribution more generally. We show how common
structures in deterministic fixed point theory can be exploited to establish
existence of invariant measures and convergence of the Markov chain. We show
that weaker assumptions than are usually encountered in the analysis of Markov
chains guarantee linear/geometric convergence. This framework specializes to
many applications of current interest including, for instance, stochastic
algorithms for large-scale distributed computation, and deterministic iterative

promising choices. Although several proposals have been reported to obtain
nonlinear architectures at visible frequencies, the area of incorporating
nonlinearity in form of passive-designing at microwave metasurfaces is open for
investigation. In this paper, a passive wideband nonlinear metasurface is
manifested, which is composed of embedded L-shape and {\Gamma}-shape meta-atoms
with PIN-diode elements. The proposed self-biased nonlinear metasurface has two
operational states: at low power intensities, it acts as Quarter Wave Plate
(QWP) in the frequency range from 13.24 GHz to 16.38 GHz with an Axial Ratio
(AR) of over 21.2%. In contrast, at high power intensities, by using the
polarization conversion property of the proposed PIN-diode based meta-atoms,
the metasurface can act as a digital metasurface. It means that by arranging
the meta-atoms with a certain coding pattern, the metasurface can manipulate
the scattered beams and synthesize well-known patterns such as Diffusion-like
pattern at an ultra-wide frequency range from 8.12 GHz to 19.27 GHz (BW=81.4%).
Full-wave and nonlinear simulations are carried out to justify the performance
of the wideband nonlinear metasurface. We expect the proposed self-biased
nonlinear metasurface at microwave frequencies reveals excellent opportunities
to design limiter metasurfaces and compact reconfigurable imaging systems.

structure and evolution. Also, knowledge about the internal properties of the
Sun is important for the understanding of solar atmospheric phenomena,
including the solar magnetic cycle. Here I provide a brief overview of the
theory of stellar structure and evolution, including the physical processes and
parameters that are involved. This is followed by a discussion of solar
evolution, extending from the birth to the latest stages. As a background for
the interpretation of observations related to the solar interior I provide a
rather extensive analysis of the sensitivity of solar models to the assumptions
underlying their calculation. I then discuss the detailed information about the
solar interior that has become available through helioseismic investigations
and the detection of solar neutrinos, with further constraints provided by the
observed abundances of the lightest elements. Revisions in the determination of
the solar surface abundances have led to increased discrepancies, discussed in
some detail, between the observational inferences and solar models. I finally
briefly address the relation of the Sun to other similar stars and the
prospects for asteroseismic investigations of stellar structure and evolution.

two-dimensional active matter system. Self-propulsion in our model is
incorporated via the Vicsek-like activity, i.e., particles have the tendency of
aligning their velocities with the average directions of motion of their
neighbors. In addition to this dynamic or active interaction, there exists
passive inter-particle interaction in the model for which we have chosen the
standard Lennard-Jones form. Following quenches of homogeneous configurations
to a point deep inside the region of coexistence between high and low density
phases, as the systems exhibit formation and evolution of particle-rich
clusters, we investigate properties related to the morphology, growth and
aging. A focus of our study is on the understanding of the effects of structure
on growth and aging. To quantify the latter we use the two-time order-parameter
autocorrelation function. This correlation, as well as the growth, is observed
to follow power-law time dependence, qualitatively similar to the scaling
behavior reported for passive systems. The values of the exponents have been
estimated and discussed by comparing with the previously obtained numbers for
other dimensions as well as with the new results for the passive limit of the
considered model. We have also presented results on the effects of temperature

study the analytic structure in the complex momentum plane and find a branch

hydrodynamic instability inside the background turbulent air flow. A numerical
initial value problem for two diametrically opposite types of drop population
distributions is then solved. Specifically, we consider a mono-disperse
population of droplets of 15 $\mu$m of radius and a poly-disperse distribution
with radii in the range 0.6 - 30 $\mu$m. For both distributions, it is observed
that the evaporation and condensation have a dramatically different weight
inside the homogeneous cloudy region and the interfacial anisotropic mixing
region. It is observed that the dynamics of drop collisions is highly effected
by the turbulence structure of the host region. The two populations show a
common aspect during their energy decay transient. That is the increased
probability of collisions in the interfacial layer hat houses intense
anisotropic velocity fluctuations. This layer, in fact, induces an enhanced
differentiation on droplets kinetic energy and sizes. Both polydisperse and
monodisperse initial particle distributions contain $10^7$ droplets, matching
an initial liquid water content of $0.8 g/m^3$. An estimate of the turbulent

effect of vortex states on the magnetization reversal of large-diameter
nanowires is of particular interest. Here, we compare analytical and
micromagnetic models with experimental results for three arrays of iron
nanowires with diameters of 33, 52 and 70 nm in order to find the balance
between the number of approximations and resources used for the calculations.
The influence of the vortex states and the effect of interwire interactions on
the remagnetization curves is discussed. It has been found that 7 nanowires
treated by a mean field model are able to reproduce well the reversal behaviour
of the whole array in the case of large diameter nanowires. Vortex states tend
to decrease the influence of the structural inhomogeneities on reversal process
and thus lead to the increased predictability of the system.

However, there is still a significant gap between the current methodologies and
the requirements for an effective deployment of lipreading in practical
scenarios. In this work, we propose a series of innovations that significantly
bridge that gap: first, we raise the state-of-the-art performance by a wide
margin on LRW and LRW-1000 to 88.5% and 46.6%, respectively using
self-distillation. Secondly, we propose a series of architectural changes,
including a novel Depthwise Separable Temporal Convolutional Network (DS-TCN)
head, that slashes the computational cost to a fraction of the (already quite
efficient) original model. Thirdly, we show that knowledge distillation is a
very effective tool for recovering performance of the lightweight models. This
results in a range of models with different accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.
However, our most promising lightweight models are on par with the current
state-of-the-art while showing a reduction of 8.2x and 3.9x in terms of
computational cost and number of parameters, respectively, which we hope will
enable the deployment of lipreading models in practical applications.

follow the trajectories of CDM particles with Lagrangian displacements fields

non-relativistic, their density fluctuations are modeled as being proportional
to the CDM density fluctuations, with a scale-dependent proportionality factor.
This yields a gravitational back-reaction that introduces additional scales to
the linear growth function, which is accounted for in the higher order LPT
kernels. Through non-linear mappings from Eulerian to Lagrangian frames, we
ensure that our theory has a well behaved large scale behavior free of unwanted
UV divergences, which are common when neutrino and CDM densities are not
treated on an equal footing, and in resummation schemes that manifestly break
Galilean invariance. We use our theory to construct correlation functions for
both the underlying matter field, as well as for biased tracers using
Convolution-LPT. Redshift-space distortions effects are modeled using the
Gaussian Streaming Model. When comparing our analytical results to simulated
data from the Quijote simulation suite, we find good accuracy down to $r=20

space monopole particle correlation functions with no free parameters. The same
accuracy is reached for the redshift space quadrupole if we additionally
consider an effective field theory parameter that shifts the pairwise velocity
dispersion. For modeling the correlation functions of tracers we adopt a simple
Lagrangian biasing scheme with only density and curvature operators, which we
find sufficient to reach down to $r=20 \,\text{Mpc} \, h^{-1}$ when comparing

(CDW) instabilities with similar or identical ordering vectors in bulk and in

is a remarkable exception as it shows no evidence of charge density wave
formation in bulk, but it displays a stable $2\times2$ reconstruction in
single-layer form. The mechanism for this 3D-2D crossover of the transition is
still unclear, although strain from the substrate and the exchange interaction
have been pointed out as possible formation mechanisms. Here, by performing
non-perturbative anharmonic calculations with gradient corrected and hybrid
functionals, we explain the thickness behaviour of the transition in
1T-TiTe$_2$. We demonstrate that the occurrence of the CDW in single-layer

deep learning to alleviate the need for a time-consuming and expert-driven
workflow of anatomy segmentation, shape registration, and the optimization of
population-level shape representations. DeepSSM is an end-to-end deep learning
approach that extracts statistical shape representation directly from
unsegmented images with little manual overhead. It performs comparably with
state-of-the-art shape modeling methods for estimating morphologies that are
viable for subsequent downstream tasks. Nonetheless, DeepSSM produces an
overconfident estimate of shape that cannot be blindly assumed to be accurate.
Hence, conveying what DeepSSM does not know, via quantifying granular estimates
of uncertainty, is critical for its direct clinical application as an on-demand
diagnostic tool to determine how trustworthy the model output is. Here, we
propose Uncertain-DeepSSM as a unified model that quantifies both,
data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty by adapting the network to predict
intrinsic input variance, and model-dependent epistemic uncertainty via a Monte
Carlo dropout sampling to approximate a variational distribution over the
network parameters. Experiments show an accuracy improvement over DeepSSM while
maintaining the same benefits of being end-to-end with little pre-processing.

  Theory and Methods: The proposed SIMilarity-Based Angiography (SIMBA) method
clusters the continuously acquired k-space data in order to find a
motion-consistent subset that can be reconstructed into a motion-suppressed
whole-heart MRA. Free-running 3D radial datasets from six ferumoxytol-enhanced
scans of pediatric cardiac patients and twelve non-contrast scans of healthy
volunteers were reconstructed with a non-motion-suppressed regridding of all
the acquired data (All Data), our proposed SIMBA method, and a previously
published free-running framework (FRF) that uses cardiac and respiratory
self-gating and compressed sensing. Images were compared for blood-myocardium
interface sharpness, contrast ratio, and visibility of coronary artery ostia.
  Results: Both the fast SIMBA reconstruction (~20s) and the FRF provided
significantly higher blood-myocardium sharpness than All Data (P<0.001). No
significant difference was observed among the former two. Significantly higher
blood-myocardium contrast ratio was obtained with SIMBA compared to All Data

FRF than with All Data (All Data: 4/36, SIMBA: 30/36, FRF: 33/36, both P<0.001)

supersonic wind depending on the pressure in the interstellar medium, is shown
to describe the solar wind to start in a stable way as it leaves the solar
surface from a state of: rest, co-rotation with the Sun, slow motion. The
isothermal gas flow assumption in Parker's solar wind model is then relaxed,
and more realistic barotropic fluid and diabatic models are used for the gas

setting of unimodular random networks. These are equalities relating scaling
exponents: $d_w = d_f + \tilde{\zeta}$ and $d_s = 2 d_f/d_w$, where $d_w$ is
the walk dimension, $d_f$ is the fractal dimension, $d_s$ is the spectral

this relates the mean displacement and return probability of a random walker to
the density and conductivity of the underlying medium. We show that if $d_f$

aforementioned equalities hold. Moreover, our primary new estimate is the
relation $d_w \geq d_f + \tilde{\zeta}$, which is established for all
$\tilde{\zeta} \in \mathbb{R}$.
  For the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT), this yields the
consequence $d_w=4$ using $d_f=4$ (Angel 2003) and $\tilde{\zeta}=0$
(established here as a consequence of the Liouville Quantum Gravity theory,
following Gwynne-Miller 2017 and Ding-Gwynne 2020). The conclusion $d_w=4$ had
been previously established by Gwynne and Hutchcroft (2018) using more
elaborate methods. A new consequence is that $d_w = d_f$ for the uniform
infinite Schnyder-wood decorated triangulation, implying that the simple random
walk is subdiffusive, since $d_f > 2$ (Ding and Gwynne 2020). For the random
walk on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ driven by conductances from an exponentiated Gaussian
free field with exponent $\gamma > 0$, one has $d_f = d_f(\gamma)$ and
$\tilde{\zeta}=0$ (Biskup, Ding, and Goswami 2020). This yields $d_s=2$ and
$d_w = d_f$, confirming two predictions of those authors.

equipped with a tree structure so that the preferences of each voter are
decreasing from their top candidate along all paths in the tree. This notion
was introduced by Demange (1982), and subsequently Trick (1989) described an
efficient algorithm for deciding if a given profile is single-peaked on a tree.
We study the complexity of multiwinner elections under several variants of the
Chamberlin-Courant rule for preferences single-peaked on trees. We show that
the egalitarian version of this problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm. For
the utilitarian version, we prove that winner determination remains NP-hard,
even for the Borda scoring function; however, a winning committee can be found
in polynomial time if either the number of leaves or the number of internal
vertices of the underlying tree is bounded by a constant. To benefit from these
positive results, we need a procedure that can determine whether a given
profile is single-peaked on a tree that has additional desirable properties
(such as, e.g., a small number of leaves). To address this challenge, we
develop a structural approach that enables us to compactly represent all trees
with respect to which a given profile is single-peaked. We show how to use this
representation to efficiently find the best tree for a given profile for use
with our winner determination algorithms: Given a profile, we can efficiently
find a tree with the minimum number of leaves, or a tree with the minimum
number of internal vertices among trees on which the profile is single-peaked.
We also consider several other optimization criteria for trees: for some we
obtain polynomial-time algorithms, while for others we show NP-hardness
results.

  Our first contribution is for certified robustness to perturbations measured
in $\ell_2$ norm. We exploit low rank data representations to provide improved
guarantees over state-of-the-art randomized smoothing-based approaches on
standard benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
  Our second contribution is for the more challenging setting of certified
robustness to perturbations measured in $\ell_\infty$ norm. We demonstrate
empirically that natural low rank representations have inherent robustness
properties, that can be leveraged to provide significantly better guarantees
for certified robustness to $\ell_\infty$ perturbations in those

natural quantity involving the $\infty \to 2$ matrix operator norm associated
with the representation, to translate robustness guarantees from $\ell_2$ to
$\ell_\infty$ perturbations.
  A key technical ingredient for our certification guarantees is a fast
algorithm with provable guarantees based on the multiplicative weights update
method to provide upper bounds on the above matrix norm. Our algorithmic
guarantees improve upon the state of the art for this problem, and may be of

post-Keplerian parameters in the DNS J1913$+$1102 constrain this system to have
a significantly non-unity mass ratio of 0.78$\pm$0.03. One may be tempted to
conclude that approximately one out of seven (14\%) DNS mergers detected by
gravitational wave observatories will have mass ratios significantly different
from unity. However J1913$+$1102 has a relatively long merger time of 470 Myr.
We show that when merger times and observational biases are taken into account,

hydrodynamic simulations of DNS mergers to our results on Galactic DNS masses,
finding that either $\simeq$0.004 ${M_{\odot}}$ or $\simeq$0.010 ${M_{\odot}}$
of material will be ejected at merger, depending on which formula is used.

carbon-to-oxygen ratio, and stellar type assuming cloud-free thermochemical
equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry. However, under these assumptions,
methane remains a persisting spectral feature in the transmission spectra of
exoplanets over a certain parameter space, the Methane Valley. In this work we
investigate the role of clouds on this domain and we find that clouds change
the spectral appearance of methane in two direct ways: 1) by heating-up the
photosphere of colder planets, and 2) by obscuring molecular features. The
presence of clouds also affects methane features indirectly: 1) cloud heating
results in more evaporation of condensates and hence releases additional
oxygen, causing water dominated spectra of colder carbon-poor exoplanets, and
2) HCN/CO production results in a suppression of depleted methane features by
these molecules. The presence of HCN/CO and a lack of methane could be an
indication of cloud formation on hot exoplanets. Cloud heating can also deplete
ammonia. Therefore, a simultaneous depletion of methane and ammonia is not
unique to photochemical processes. We propose that the best targets for methane
detection are likely to be massive but smaller planets with a temperature
around 1450 K orbiting colder stars. We also construct Spitzer synthetic
color-maps and find that clouds can explain some of the high contrast

constant. A crucial aspect of our approach is relying on the perception of
human observers, both to guide manipulations, and to measure algorithmic bias.
  Besides allowing the measurement of algorithmic bias, synthetic transects
have other advantages with respect to observational datasets: they sample
attributes more evenly allowing for more straightforward bias analysis on
minority and intersectional groups, they enable prediction of bias in new
scenarios, they greatly reduce ethical and legal challenges, and they are
economical and fast to obtain, helping make bias testing affordable and widely
available.
  We validate our method by comparing it to a study that employs the
traditional observational method for analyzing bias in gender classification
algorithms. The two methods reach different conclusions. While the
observational method reports gender and skin color biases, the experimental
method reveals biases due to gender, hair length, age, and facial hair.

Here is one more, to
  talk about an apparently new method, which I call ``Inverse Cubic Iteration''
(ICI) in analogy to the Inverse Quadratic Iteration in Richard Brent's zeroin
method. The possibly new method is based on a cubic blend of tangent-line
approximations for the inverse function. We rewrite this iteration for
numerical stability as an average of two Newton steps and a secant step: only
one new function evaluation and derivative evaluation is needed for each step.
The total cost of the method is therefore only trivially more than Newton's
method, and we will see that it has order $1+\sqrt{3} = 2.732...$, thus
ensuring that to achieve a given accuracy it usually takes fewer steps than
Newton's method while using essentially the same effort per step.

analysis for a subsample of 150 stars that are representative of the full SHINE

masses between 1 and 75 MJup and semimajor axes between 5 and 300 au. We adopt
detection limits as a function of angular separation from the survey data for
all stars converted into mass and projected orbital separation using the
BEX-COND-hot evolutionary tracks and known distance to each system. Based on
the results obtained for each star and on the 13 detections in the sample, we
use a MCMC tool to compare our observations to two different types of models.
The first is a parametric model based on observational constraints, and the
second type are numerical models that combine advanced core accretion and
gravitational instability planet population synthesis. Using the parametric
model, we show that the frequencies of systems with at least one substellar
companion are $23.0_{-9.7}^{+13.5}\%$, $5.8_{-2.8}^{+4.7}\%$, and
$12.6_{-7.1}^{+12.9}\%$ for BA, FGK, and M stars, respectively. We also
demonstrate that a planet-like formation pathway probably dominates the mass
range from 1-75 MJup for companions around BA stars, while for M dwarfs, brown
dwarf binaries dominate detections. In contrast, a combination of binary
star-like and planet-like formation is required to best fit the observations
for FGK stars. Using our population model and restricting our sample to FGK
stars, we derive a frequency of $5.7_{-2.8}^{+3.8}\%$, consistent with
predictions from the parametric model. More generally, the frequency values
that we derive are in excellent agreement with values obtained in previous
studies.

testing ground for this formalism we focus on the simplest case of ambitwistor
string coupled to two current algebras, which gives bi-adjoint scalar
correlators in AdS. In order to evaluate them directly, we make use of a series
of contour deformations on the moduli space of punctured Riemann spheres and
check that the result agrees with tree level Witten diagram computations to all

0.4--30 keV band cannot be self-consistently reproduced by relativistic
reflection models, which fail to account simultaneously for the soft and hard
X-ray emission. The smooth soft excess prefers extreme blurring parameters,
confirmed by the nearly featureless nature of the RGS spectrum, while the
moderately broad Fe K line and the modest hard excess above 10 keV appear to
arise in a milder gravity regime. By allowing a different origin of the soft
excess, the broadband X-ray spectrum and overall spectral energy distribution
(SED) are well explained by a combination of: (a) direct thermal emission from
the accretion disc, dominating from the optical to the far/extreme UV; (b)
Comptonization of seed disc photons by a warm ($kT_{\rm e}\sim0.3$ keV) and
optically thick ($\tau\sim10$) corona, mostly contributing to the soft X-rays;
(c) Comptonization by a standard hot ($kT_{\rm e} \gtrsim 100$ keV) and
optically thin ($\tau<0.5$) corona, responsible for the primary X-ray
continuum; and (d) reflection from the mid/outer part of the disc. The two
coronae are suggested to be rather compact, with $R_{\rm hot} \lesssim R_{\rm
warm} \lesssim 10$ R$_{\rm g}$. Our SED analysis implies that Ton S180 accretes
at super-Eddington rates. This is a key condition for the launch of a wind,
marginal (i.e., 3.1$\sigma$ significance) evidence of which is indeed found in

used to fit the broadband photometry of these systems. This is a clean test of
the spectral-energy-distribution-derived star formation rates (SFRs), as dust
is expected to be optically thin at this wavelength in nearly all galaxies;
thus, the internal conversion of SFR to predicted line luminosity does not
depend strongly on the adopted dust model and posterior dust parameters, as is
the case for shorter-wavelength lines such as H$\alpha$. We find that
Prospector predicts Br$\gamma$ luminosities and equivalent widths with small
offsets ($\sim$0.05 dex), and scatter ($\sim$0.2 dex), consistent with
measurement uncertainties, though we caution that the derived offset is
dependent on the choice of stellar isochrones. We demonstrate that even when
the Prospector-derived dust attenuation does not well describe, e.g., H$\alpha$
line properties or observed reddening between H$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$, the
underlying SFRs are accurate, as verified by the dust-free Br$\gamma$
comparison. Finally, we discuss in what ways Br$\gamma$ might be able to help
constrain model parameters when treated as an input to the model, and comment
on its potential as an accurate monochromatic SFR indicator in the era of JWST

imprinted at stellar birth. However, the finding $\sigma_z/\sigma_R > 1$
depends on a drop in the velocity dispersion in the innermost few tens of

fainter than the surface-brightness limits of past wide-area surveys -- form
the overwhelming majority of galaxies in the dwarf regime (M* < 10^9 MSun).
Using NewHorizon, a high-resolution cosmological simulation, we study the
origin of LSBGs and explain why LSBGs at similar stellar mass show the large
observed spread in surface brightness. New Horizon galaxies populate a
well-defined locus in the surface brightness -- stellar mass plane, with a
spread of ~3 mag arcsec^-2, in agreement with deep SDSS Stripe data. Galaxies
with fainter surface brightnesses today are born in regions of higher
dark-matter density. This results in faster gas accretion and more intense star
formation at early epochs. The stronger resultant supernova feedback flattens
gas profiles at a faster rate which, in turn, creates shallower stellar
profiles (i.e. more diffuse systems) more rapidly. As star formation declines
towards late epochs (z<1), the larger tidal perturbations and ram pressure
experienced by these systems (due to their denser local environments)
accelerate the divergence in surface brightness, by increasing their effective
radii and reducing star formation respectively. A small minority of dwarfs
depart from the main locus towards high surface brightnesses, making them
detectable in past wide surveys. These systems have anomalously high
star-formation rates, triggered by recent, fly-by or merger-driven starbursts.
We note that objects considered extreme/anomalous at the depth of current
datasets, e.g. `ultra-diffuse galaxies', actually dominate the predicted dwarf
population and will be routinely visible in future surveys like LSST.

the sign and magnitude of the bispectra significantly. It changes
(increases/decreases) the magnitude of the bispectra by $50-100\%$ without
changing its sign (mostly) during the entire period of the EoR for small and
intermediate $k_1$-triangles. For larger $k_1$-triangles, RSD affects the
magnitude by $100-200\%$ and also flips the sign from negative to positive. We
conclude that it is important to take into account the impact of RSD for a
correct interpretation of the EoR 21-cm bispectra.

many-body localized (MBL) phase under the presence of sufficiently strong
disorder, hence breaking ergodicity and failing to thermalize. In this work we
study the distribution of correlations throughout the ergodic-MBL phase
diagram. We find the typical correlations in the MBL phase decay as a stretched
exponential with range $r$ eventually crossing over to an exponential decay
deep in the MBL phase. At the transition, the stretched exponential goes as
$e^{-A\sqrt{r}}$, a decay that is reminiscent of the random singlet phase.
While the standard deviation of the $\log(QMI)$ has a range dependence, the
$\log(QMI)$ converges to a range-invariant distribution on all other moments
(i.e., the skewness and higher) at the transition. The universal nature of
these distributions provides distinct phenomenology of the transition different
from both the ergodic and MBL phenomenologies. In addition to the typical
correlations, we study the extreme correlations in the system, finding that the
probability of strong long-range correlations is maximal at the transition,
suggesting the proliferation of resonances there. Finally, we analyze the
probability that a single bit of information is shared across two halves of a
system, finding that this probability is non-zero deep in the MBL phase but
vanishes at moderate disorder well above the transition.

respectively. This is a ""two-fluid"" model in which reference fields act as
global clocks providing a physical time in an inflationary spacetime, and allow
bypassing various technical hurdles in conventional quantum cosmological
models. The reduced phase space is obtained in terms of the Dirac observables
of the gravitational as well as the inflaton degrees of freedom. The physical
Hamiltonians of the two dust models take the same form but turn out to be quite
different from that of the Klein-Gordon reference field which reflects an
aspect of the multiple choice problem of time. Loop quantization is implemented
using the so-called $\bar \mu$ scheme and the Schr\""{o}dinger equations
involving the physical Hamiltonian operators generating the evolution in the

turn out to be quantum difference equations with same non-singular structure as

quantization using the effective dynamics resulting from the reduced phase
space quantization including the resolution of the big bang singularity via a
quantum bounce, and effects of the different reference fields on e-foldings in
both the pre-inflationary and the slow-roll inflationary phases. We find that
different clocks, even when starting with a small but same energy density, can
leave tiny but different imprints on the inflationary dynamics. (abridged)

images. In order to identify such latent dimensions for image editing, previous
methods typically annotate a collection of synthesized samples and train linear
classifiers in the latent space. However, they require a clear definition of
the target attribute as well as the corresponding manual annotations, limiting
their applications in practice. In this work, we examine the internal
representation learned by GANs to reveal the underlying variation factors in an
unsupervised manner. In particular, we take a closer look into the generation
mechanism of GANs and further propose a closed-form factorization algorithm for
latent semantic discovery by directly decomposing the pre-trained weights. With
a lightning-fast implementation, our approach is capable of not only finding
semantically meaningful dimensions comparably to the state-of-the-art
supervised methods, but also resulting in far more versatile concepts across
multiple GAN models trained on a wide range of datasets.

with focus either upon inflation or upon the passage into dark energy era. In
this paper, we endeavor to capture the whole history of the universe into a
dynamical system by considering generic scalar tensor gravity with radiation
and dust matter fluids in flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime.
We construct the dynamical variables in such a way that the main stages of the
cosmic evolution, viz. inflation, radiation domination, matter domination, and
dark energy domination can be represented by the respective fixed points in the
phase space. As the evolution of solutions is ruled by the sequence of these
fixed points with appropriate properties, we can determine the conditions that
the scalar potential and nonminimal coupling must satisfy for the model to
deliver viable cosmic history in a generic manner. We illustrate the
construction by a scalar field with quartic potential, with and without
quadratic nonminimal coupling to curvature.

fundamental building block in many applications for learning over sensitive

privacy amplification by shuffling, permit adding lower noise in DP-SGD than
via na\""{\i}ve schemes. A key assumption in both these approaches is that the
elements in the data set can be uniformly sampled, or be uniformly permuted --
constraints that may become prohibitive when the data is processed in a
decentralized or distributed fashion. In this paper, we focus on conducting
iterative methods like DP-SGD in the setting of federated learning (FL) wherein
the data is distributed among many devices (clients). Our main contribution is
the \emph{random check-in} distributed protocol, which crucially relies only on
randomized participation decisions made locally and independently by each
client. It has privacy/accuracy trade-offs similar to privacy amplification by
subsampling/shuffling. However, our method does not require server-initiated
communication, or even knowledge of the population size. To our knowledge, this
is the first privacy amplification tailored for a distributed learning
framework, and it may have broader applicability beyond FL. Along the way, we
extend privacy amplification by shuffling to incorporate $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP
local randomizers, and exponentially improve its guarantees. In practical
regimes, this improvement allows for similar privacy and utility using data
from an order of magnitude fewer users.

challenging due to the numerous terms that arise in the filtered Navier-Stokes

discontinuous spectral element method (DSEM) to mimic the effects of
sub-filtered scales for compressible flows. The method is computationally
inexpensive since it is implemented in the DSEM code using a well-established
math library. It has been successfully applied to simulations of compressible
decaying isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flow. In this study,
channel flows with three different friction Reynolds numbers are simulated
using explicit modal filtering in DSEM to assess the performance of the new
method by comparing turbulent statistics and friction Reynolds numbers to those
from DNS. The model predicts the friction Reynolds number with a maximum of
2.16% error with respect to DNS. Although the model generates promising results
for the average velocity profile compared to DNS, it requires adjustment of
filter strength and frequency to predict rms statistics accurately.

definite (SPD) matrix equations that arise from discretizing linear elliptic
PDEs, the framework is purely algebraic such that it applies to matrices that
do not necessarily come from the continuum. Based on the so-called energy or
$A$ norm, which is the natural norm for many problems involving SPD matrices,
we provide a normwise forward error analysis, and introduce the notion of
progressive precision for multigrid solvers. Each level of the multigrid
hierarchy uses three different precisions that each increase with the fineness
of the level, but at different rates, thereby ensuring that the bulk of the
computation uses the lowest possible precision. The theoretical results
developed here in the energy norm differ notably from previous theory based on
the Euclidean norm in important ways. In particular, we show that simply
rounding an exact result to finite precision causes an error in the energy norm
that is proportional to the square root of $\kappa$, the associated matrix
condition number. (By contrast, this error is of order $1$ when measured in the
Euclidean norm.) Given this observation, we show that the limiting accuracy for
both V-cycles and full multigrid is optimal in the sense that it is also
proportional to $\kappa^{1/2}$ in energy. Additionally, we show that the loss
of convergence rate due to rounding grows in proportion to $\kappa^{1/2}$, but
argue that this loss is insignificant in practice. The theory presented here is
the first forward error analysis in the energy norm of iterative refinement and
the first rounding error analysis of multigrid in general.

better prediction accuracy. The purpose of this paper is two fold. First, we
provide a survey and a comparative analysis of results from literature applying
machine learning techniques to predict credit rating. Second, we apply
ourselves four machine learning techniques deemed useful from previous studies

conventional accuracy measure of classifiers, we introduce a measure of

the above classifiers in the specific context of credit rating. This measure
tells us how far the predictions are from the true ratings. We further compare
the performance of three major rating agencies, Standard $\&$ Poors, Moody's

a cavity can be identified by measuring experimentally accessible photon
observables such as the Fano factor and the cavity quadrature amplitudes.
Moreover, based on density matrix renormalization group numerical calculations,
endorsed by an analytical Gaussian approximation for the cavity state, we
propose a direct link between those observables and quantum entropy
singularities. We study two bipartite entanglement measures, the von Neumann
and R\'enyi entanglement entropies, between light and matter subsystems. Even
though both display singularities at the topological phase transition points,
remarkably only the R\'enyi entropy can be analytically connected to the
measurable Fano factor. Consequently, we show a method to recover the bipartite
entanglement of the system from a cavity observable. Thus, we put forward a
path to experimentally access the control and detection of a topological
quantum phase transition via the R\'enyi entropy, which can be measured by
standard low noise linear amplification techniques in superconducting circuits.
In this way, the main quantum information features of Majorana polaritons in
photon-fermion systems can be addressed in feasible experimental setups.

in order to address the growth in energy demand, reduce carbon emissions, and
enhance power quality and energy efficiency. This shift to the smart grid
concept involves, among others, the utilization of distributed energy resources
(DERs) such as rooftop solar panels and storage systems, contributing towards
grid decentralization while improving control over power generation. In order
to seamlessly integrate DERs into power systems, embedded devices are used to
support the communication and control functions of DERs. As a result,
vulnerabilities of such components can be ported to the industrial environment.
Insecure control networks and protocols further exacerbate the problem. Towards
reducing the attack surface, we present an authentication scheme for DERs,
DERauth, which leverages the inherent entropy of the DER battery energy storage
system (BESS) as a root-of-trust. The DER authentication is achieved using a
challenge-reply mechanism that relies on the corresponding DER's BESS
state-of-charge (SoC) and voltage measurements. A dynamically updating process
ensures that the BESS state is up-to-date. We evaluate our proof-of-concept in
a prototype development that uses lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries for the BESS.

Error Analysis for Mixed-Precision Multigrid Solvers] to obtain
discretization-error-accurate solutions for linear elliptic partial

assumed that the achievable accuracy is limited by discretization or algebraic
errors. On the contrary, we show that the quantization error incurred by simply
storing the matrix in any fixed precision quickly begins to dominate the total
error as the discretization is refined. We extend the existing theory to
account for these quantization errors and use the resulting bounds to guide the
choice of four different precision levels in order to balance quantization,
algebraic, and discretization errors in the progressive-precision scheme
proposed in the companion paper. A remarkable result is that while iterative
refinement is susceptible to quantization errors during the residual and update
computation, the V-cycle used to compute the correction in each iteration is
much more resilient, and continues to work if the system matrices in the
hierarchy become indefinite due to quantization. As a result, the V-cycle only
requires relatively few bits of precision per level. Based on our findings, we
outline a simple way to implement a progressive precision FMG solver with
minimal overhead, and demonstrate as an example that the one dimensional
biharmonic equation can be solved reliably to any desired accuracy using just a
few V-cycles when the underlying smoother works well. In the process we also
confirm many of the theoretical results numerically.

Each of the tensors in the set is modeled using Tensor Rings, though the
concept applies to other Tensor Networks. Owing its name to the T-shape of
nodes in diagram notation of Tensor Rings, T-Basis is simply a list of equally
shaped three-dimensional tensors, used to represent Tensor Ring nodes. Such
representation allows us to parameterize the tensor set with a small number of
parameters (coefficients of the T-Basis tensors), scaling logarithmically with
each tensor's size in the set and linearly with the dimensionality of T-Basis.

electron-phonon mechanism for superconductivity in the $Fm\bar{3}m$ phase
proposed for the LaH$_{10}$ superconductor. We show that the very high
transition temperature $T_c$ results from a highly optimized electron-phonon
interaction that favors coupling to high frequency hydrogen phonons. Various
superconducting properties are calculated, such as the energy gap, the isotope
effect, the specific heat jump at $T_c$, the thermodynamic critical field and
the temperature-dependent penetration depth. However, our main emphasis is on
the finite frequency optical properties, measurement of which may allow for an
independent determination of $T_c$ and also a confirmation of the mechanism for
superconductivity.

their magnetospheres. The geometry of the accretion flow strongly depends on
the magnetic obliquity, i.e., the angle between the rotational and magnetic
axes. We aim at deriving the distribution of magnetic obliquities in a sample
of 10 CTTSs. For this, we monitored the radial velocity variations of the
HeI$\lambda$5876 line in these stars' spectra along their rotational cycle. HeI
is produced in the accretion shock, close to the magnetic pole. When the
magnetic and rotational axes are not aligned, the radial velocity of this line
is modulated by stellar rotation. The amplitude of modulation is related to the
star's projected rotational velocity, $v\sin i$, and the latitude of the
hotspot. By deriving $v\sin i$ and HeI$\lambda$5876 radial velocity curves from
our spectra we thus obtain an estimate of the magnetic obliquities. We find an
average obliquity in our sample of 11.4$^{\circ}$ with an rms dispersion of
5.4$^{\circ}$. The magnetic axis thus seems nearly, but not exactly aligned
with the rotational axis in these accreting T Tauri stars, somewhat in
disagreement with studies of spectropolarimetry, which have found a significant
misalignment ($\gtrsim 20^{\circ}$) for several CTTSs. This could simply be an
effect of low number statistics, or it may be due to a selection bias of our
sample. We discuss possible biases that our sample may be subject to. We also
find tentative evidence that the magnetic obliquity may vary according to the
stellar interior and that there may be a significant difference between fully
convective and partly radiative stars.

activity occurs (i.e. background features) from activity-related features for
each video. To further improve the performance, we build our network using two
parallel branches which operate in an adversarial way: the first branch
localizes the most salient activities of a video and the second one finds other
supplementary activities from non-localized parts of the video. Extensive
experiments performed on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate that our
proposed method is effective. Specifically, the average mAP of IoU thresholds

empirical measurements were compared against simulated evacuation curves

corresponding to calibrations from laboratory experiments (involving
pedestrians in which the safety of the participants is of major concern) or
situations where the physical contact is negligible, produce simulations in
which the agents evacuate faster than in the empirical scenario. To conclude
the paper, we optimize two parameters of the model: the friction coefficient
$k_t$ and the body force coefficient $k_n$. The best fit we found could

deeper models equipped with different pooling layers. In particular, we review
three neural-kernel machines with average, maxout and convolutional pooling

to the insertion of $S_q$. Our focus is on the algorithmic analysis of the

structure. For the former, we use equilibrium disk chemistry models to track
accreted minerals onto planetary cores throughout formation. For the latter, we
track gas accretion during formation, and consider photoevaporation-driven
atmospheric mass loss to determine what portion of accreted gas escapes after
the disk phase. We find that atmospheric stripping of Neptunes and sub-Saturns
at small orbital radii ($\lesssim$0.1AU) plays a key role in the formation of
short-period super Earths. Core compositions are strongly influenced by the
trap in which they formed. We also find a separation between Earth-like planet
compositions at small orbital radii $\lesssim$0.5AU and ice-rich planets (up to
50\% by mass) at larger orbits $\sim$1AU. This corresponds well with the
Earth-like mean densities inferred from the observed position of the low-mass
planet radius valley at small orbital periods. Our model produces planet radii
comparable to observations at masses $\sim$1-3M$_\oplus$. At larger masses,
planets' accreted gas significantly increases their radii to be larger than
most of the observed data. While photoevaporation, affecting planets at small
orbital radii $\lesssim$0.1AU, reduces a subset of these planets' radii and
improves our comparison, most planets in our computed populations are
unaffected due to low FUV fluxes as they form at larger separations.

rectification has several side effects, including a reduced field of view
(FOV), resampling distortion, and sensitivity to calibration errors. The
effects are particularly pronounced in case of significant distortion (e.g.,
wide-angle fisheye cameras). In this paper, we propose a generic scale-aware
self-supervised pipeline for estimating depth, euclidean distance, and visual
odometry from unrectified monocular videos. We demonstrate a similar level of
precision on the unrectified KITTI dataset with barrel distortion comparable to
the rectified KITTI dataset. The intuition being that the rectification step

reduced field of view and avoids computational costs for rectification at
inference time. To further illustrate the general applicability of the proposed

the provision of a good syntactic template, or grammar. Provision of such a

such a grammar, state-of-the-art solvers will provide their own default
grammar, which is dependent on the signature of the target program to be
sythesized. In this work, we speculate this default grammar could be improved
upon substantially. We build sets of rules, or metagrammars, for constructing
grammars, and perform a gradient descent over these metagrammars aiming to find
a metagrammar which solves more benchmarks and on average faster. We show the
resulting metagrammar enables CVC4 to solve 26% more benchmarks than the
default grammar within a 300s time-out, and that metagrammars learnt from tens
of benchmarks generalize to performance on 100s of benchmarks.

multi-armed bandit problem, the goal is not to learn the ""best arm""; indeed,
each agent may perceive a different arm to be the best for her personally.
Instead, we seek to learn a fair distribution over the arms. Drawing on a long

algorithm for channel parameters estimation. In the first stage, coarse
estimation is accomplished by applying parameter estimation via interpolation
based on DFT grid (PREIDG) with a fixed look-up table (LUT), while the second
stage refines the estimates by means of the space-alternating generalized
expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm. The two-stage algorithm uses
discrete Fourier transform beamforming vectors which are efficiently
implemented by a Butler matrix in the analog domain. We found that this
methodology improves the estimates compared to the auxiliary beam pair (ABP)
method. The two-stage algorithm shows efficient performance in the low signal
to noise ratio regime for the channel parameters i.e. angles of departure,
complex path gains and delays of the multipaths. Finally, we derived the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to assess the performance of our two-stage
estimation algorithm.

the Ising model defined on two nodes, we fully characterize the dynamics of the

that in the regime where the objective function is convex, both the algorithms
are stable and exhibit convergence to the unique fixed point. Our analyses
reveal interesting {\em discordances} between these two versions of the
algorithm in the region when the objective function is non-convex. In fact, the
parallel version exhibits a periodic oscillatory behavior which is absent in
the sequential version. Drawing intuition from the Markov chain Monte Carlo
literature, we {\em empirically} show that a parameter expansion of the Ising

death due to secondary infection in hospital patients in the United States.
Detection of C. diff cells in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images is an
important task to quantify the efficacy of the under-development treatments.
However, detecting C. diff cells in SEM images is a challenging problem due to
the presence of inhomogeneous illumination and occlusion. An Illumination
normalization pre-processing step destroys the texture and adds noise to the
image. Furthermore, cells are often clustered together resulting in touching
cells and occlusion. In this paper, DETCID, a deep cell detection method using
adversarial training, specifically robust to inhomogeneous illumination and
occlusion, is proposed. An adversarial network is developed to provide region
proposals and pass the proposals to a feature extraction network. Furthermore,
a modified IoU metric is developed to allow the detection of touching cells in
various orientations. The results indicate that DETCID outperforms the
state-of-the-art in detection of touching cells in SEM images by at least 20
percent improvement of mean average precision.

stiffness of the cell as the only mechanical biomarker, and cannot disentangle
the rheological contribution of different structural components of the cell,
including the cell cortex, the interior cytoplasm and its immersed cytoskeletal
structures, and the nucleus. Recent advancements in high-speed fluorescent
imaging have enabled probing the deformations of the cell cortex, while also
tracking different intracellular components in rates applicable to microfluidic
platforms. We present a novel method to decouple the mechanics of the cell
cortex and the cytoplasm by analyzing the correlation between the cortical
deformations that are induced by external microfluidic flows, and the nucleus
displacements induced by those cortical deformations; i.e. we use the nucleus
as a high-throughput microrheological probe to study the rheology of the
cytoplasm, independent of the cell cortex mechanics. To demonstrate the
applicability of this method, we consider a proof of concept model consisting
of a rigid spherical nucleus centered in a spherical cell. We obtain analytical
expressions for time-dependent nucleus velocity as a function of the cell
deformations, when the interior cytoplasm is modeled as a viscous,
viscoelastic, porous and poroelastic materials, and demonstrate how the nucleus
velocity can be used to characterize the linear rheology of the cytoplasm over
a wide range of forces and time-scales/frequencies.

results in elliptical far-field polarization (spin) states and causes spatial
separation of polarization handedness in the far field. The ellipticity and

momentum measurements and particle identification. The ProtoDUNE-SP detector is
a prototype for the first far detector module of the Deep Underground Neutrino

module. This paper describes the beam line, the time projection chamber, the
photon detectors, the cosmic-ray tagger, the signal processing and particle
reconstruction. It presents the first results on ProtoDUNE-SP's performance,
including noise and gain measurements, $dE/dx$ calibration for muons, protons,
pions and electrons, drift electron lifetime measurements, and photon detector
noise, signal sensitivity and time resolution measurements. The measured values
meet or exceed the specifications for the DUNE far detector, in several cases
by large margins. ProtoDUNE-SP's successful operation starting in 2018 and its
production of large samples of high-quality data demonstrate the effectiveness
of the single-phase far detector design.

three-dimensional turbulence is the so-called Area Rule, according to which the
probability density function (PDF) of the circulation around closed loops
depends only on the minimal area of the loop, not its shape. We assess the
robustness of the Area Rule, for both planar and non-planar loops, using
high-resolution data from Direct Numerical Simulations. For planar loops, the
circulation moments for rectangular shapes match those for the square with only
small differences, these differences being larger when the aspect ratio is
further from unity, and when the moment-order increases. The differences do not
exceed about $5\%$ for any condition examined here. The aspect-ratio dependence
observed for the second-order moment are indistinguishable from results for the
Gaussian Random Field (GRF) with the same two-point correlation function (for
which the results are order-independent by construction). When normalized by
the SD of the PDF, the aspect ratio dependence is even smaller $(< 2\%)$ but
does not vanish unlike for the GRF. We obtain circulation statistics around
minimal area loops in three dimensions and compare them to those of a planar
loop circumscribing equivalent areas, and we find that circulation statistics
match in the two cases only when normalized by an internal variable such as the
SD. This work highlights the hitherto unknown connection between minimal
surfaces and turbulence.

(HBLs). We study its linear and nonlinear evolution, followed by its role in
transition and eventual breakdown of the HBL into a fully turbulent state.
Linear stability theory (LST) is utilized to identify the second-mode wave
through FS-synchronization, which is then recreated in linearly and nonlinearly
forced 2D direct numerical simulations (DNSs). The nonlinear DNS shows
saturation of the fundamental frequency, and the resulting superharmonics
induce tightly braided ``rope-like'' patterns near the generalized inflection
point (GIP). The instability exhibits a second region of growth constituted by
the fundamental frequency, downstream of the primary envelope, which is absent
in the linear scenario. Subsequent 3D DNS identifies this region to be crucial
in amplifying oblique instabilities riding on the 2D second-mode ``rollers''.
This results in lambda vortices below the GIP, which are detached from the
``rollers'' in the inner boundary layer. Streamwise vortex-stretching results
in a localized peak in length-scales inside the HBL, eventually forming haripin
vortices. Spectral analyses track the transformation of harmonic peaks into a
turbulent spectrum, and appearance of oblique modes at the fundamental
frequency, which suggests that fundamental resonance is the most dominant
mechanism of transition. Bispectrum reveals coupled nonlinear interactions
between the fundamental and its superharmonics leading to spectral broadening,
and traces of subharmonic resonance as well.

photophysics of organic crystals. Successful models describing charge- and
energy-transport in these systems routinely include these effects. Most models
for describing photophysics, on the other hand, only incorporate local
electron-phonon coupling to intramolecular vibrational modes, while nonlocal
electron-phonon coupling is neglected. One might expect nonlocal coupling to
have an important effect on the photophysics of organic crystals, because it
gives rise to large fluctuation in the charge-transfer couplings, and
charge-transfer couplings play an important role in the spectroscopy of many
organic crystals. Here, we study the effects of nonlocal coupling on the
absorption spectrum of crystalline pentacene and 7,8,15,16-tetraazaterrylene.
To this end, we develop a new mixed quantum-classical approach for including
nonlocal coupling into spectroscopic and transport models for organic crystals.
Importantly, our approach does not assume that the nonlocal coupling is linear,
in contrast to most modern charge-transport models. We find that the nonlocal
coupling broadens the absorption spectrum non-uniformly across the absorption
line shape. In pentacene, for example, our model predicts that the lower
Davydov component broadens considerably more than the upper Davydov component,
explaining the origin of this experimental observation for the first time. By
studying a simple dimer model, we are able to attribute this selective
broadening to correlations between the fluctuations of the charge-transfer
couplings. Overall, our method incorporates nonlocal electron-phonon coupling
into spectroscopic and transport models with computational efficiency,
generalizability to a wide range of organic crystals, and without any
assumption of linearity.

Though both regularization schemes converge to the optimal representation, we
show that this convergence is slow due to ill-conditioning that worsens with

imprints a nearly circular ""shadow"" on its image, corresponding to the
observer's line-of-sight into the black hole. The shadow boundary depends on
the black hole's mass and spin, providing an observable signature of both
properties via high resolution images. However, standard expressions for the
shadow boundary are most naturally parametrized by Boyer-Lindquist radii rather
than by image coordinates. We explore simple, approximate parameterizations for
the shadow boundary using ellipses and a family of curves known as limacons. We
demonstrate that these curves provide excellent and efficient approximations
for all black hole spins and inclinations. In particular, we show that the two
parameters of the limacon naturally account for the three primary shadow
deformations resulting from mass and spin: size, displacement, and asymmetry.
These curves are convenient for parametric model fitting directly to
interferometric data, they reveal the degeneracies expected when estimating
black hole properties from images with practical measurement limitations, and
they provide a natural framework for parametric tests of the Kerr metric using
black hole images.

functions. Activation in a protein differs from activation in a small molecule
in that it involves directed and systematic energy flows through preferred
channels encoded in the protein structure. Understanding the nature of these
energy flow channels and how energy flows through them during activation is
critical for understanding protein conformational changes. We recently
developed a rigorous statistical mechanical framework for understanding
potential energy flows. Here we complete this theoretical framework with a
rigorous theory for kinetic energy flows: potential and kinetic energy
inter-convert when impressed forces oppose inertial forces whereas kinetic
energy transfers directly from one coordinate to another when inertial forces
oppose each other. This theory is applied to analyzing a prototypic system for
biomolecular conformational dynamics: the isomerization of an alanine
dipeptide. Among the two essential energy flow channels for this process,
dihedral phi confronts the activation barrier, whereas dihedral theta receives
energy from potential energy flows. Intriguingly, theta helps phi to cross the
activation barrier by transferring to phi via direct kinetic energy flow all
the energy it received: increase in theta caused by potential energy flow
converts into increase in phi. As a compensation, theta receives kinetic energy
from bond angle alpha via direct mechanism and bond angle beta via indirect
mechanism.

important issue is to transfer the generic teacher's representation to a

any learning context where representation transfer is applicable. We experiment
here on two standard settings: inductive transfer learning, where the teacher's
representation is transferred to a student network of same architecture for a
new related task, and knowledge distillation, where the teacher's
representation is transferred to a student of simpler architecture for the same

and short-packet communications over the additive white Gaussian noise channel.
The new code is orthogonal sparse superposition (OSS) code. A codeword of OSS
codes is represented as a superposition of sparse sub-codewords whose support
sets are mutually non-overlapping. To construct such codewords in a
computationally efficient manner, a successive encoding method is presented.
Harnessing the orthogonal property among sub-codewords, a simple yet
near-optimal decoding method is proposed, which performs element-wise maximum a
posterior decoding with successive support set cancellation. This decoder is
super-fast by a linear decoding complexity in block lengths, far less than the
commercially used channel decoders for modern channel codes. The upper bounds
for the block error rates (BLERs) are analytically derived for few-layered OSS
codes as a function of block lengths and code rates. It turns out that a
single-layered OSS code achieves the ultimate Shannon limit in the
power-limited regime, even with the linear complexity decoder. Via simulations,
the proposed OSS codes are shown to perform better than commercially used coded
modulation techniques for low-rate and short-latency communication scenarios.

spin-layer locking (SLL). However, not only has its underlying fundamental
mechanism been unclear, but also there are only a few materials exhibiting weak
SLL. Here, through the first-principles density functional theory and model

competition between the sublayer-sublayer interaction and the spin-orbit

orbital angular momentum distribution is another crucial point to realize the
strong R-2 SLL. We propose that a novel 2D material Si$_2$Bi$_2$ possesses an

be 2.16 eV{\AA}, which is the greatest value ever observed in 2D R-2 materials
to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, we reveal that the interlayer
interaction in a bilayer structure ensures R-2 states spatially farther apart,
implying a potential application in spintronics.

crystals are used to erase the phase and spatial traces of down conversion
origins. Emission angle of photon pairs also leads to optical path difference
and resulting in phase distinguishability. A realistic scenario is numerically
modelled, where the photon pairs with nonzero emission angle gather a phase
difference. These pairs can still be collected and manipulated for practical
use but the collection optics adds upon the phase difference. Two commercially
available optics for collection; aspheric and achromatic lenses are compared.
The numerical simulation results are compared with the experimental results to

ambiguity sets exhibit attractive out-of-sample performance and admit
big-$M$-based mixed-integer programming (MIP) reformulations with conic
constraints. However, the resulting formulations often suffer from scalability
issues as sample size increases. To address this shortcoming, we derive
stronger formulations that scale well with respect to the sample size. Our
focus is on ambiguity sets under the so-called left-hand side (LHS)
uncertainty, where the uncertain parameters affect the coefficients of the
decision variables in the linear inequalities defining the safety sets. The
interaction between the uncertain parameters and the variable coefficients in
the safety set definition causes challenges in strengthening the original
big-$M$ formulations. By exploiting the connection between nominal
chance-constrained programs and DR-CCP, we obtain strong formulations with
significant enhancements. In particular, through this connection, we derive a
linear number of valid inequalities, which can be immediately added to the
formulations to obtain improved formulations in the original space of
variables. In addition, we suggest a quantile-based strengthening procedure
that allows us to reduce the big-$M$ coefficients drastically. Furthermore,
based on this procedure, we propose an exponential class of inequalities that
can be separated efficiently within a branch-and-cut framework. The
quantile-based strengthening procedure can be expensive. Therefore, for the
special case of covering and packing type problems, we identify an efficient
scheme to carry out this procedure. We demonstrate the computational efficacy

software-defined enclaves (SDEs) where the protections and slowdown are tied to
an application-defined threat model and tuned by a compiler for the
accelerator's specific domain. This vertically integrated approach requires new
hardware data-structures to partition, clear, and shape the utilization of

implement a shortcut to adiabaticity approach that is based on Lewis-Riesenfeld
invariant theory. This affords our scheme the advantages of adiabatic transfer,
where there can be an intrinsic insensitivity to the precise strength and
detuning characteristics of the applied field, with the advantages of rapid
transfer that is necessary for obtaining a short slowing distance. For typical
parameters of a thermal oven source that generates a particle beam with a

slowing the particles to near stationary in less than a millimeter. We compare
the slowing scheme to widely-implemented slowing techniques that rely on

optimization has expanded to touch almost every stage of the data analysis
pipeline, from signal and data acquisition to modeling and prediction. The
optimization problems encountered in practice are often nonconvex. While
challenges vary from problem to problem, one common source of nonconvexity is
nonlinearity in the data or measurement model. Nonlinear models often exhibit
symmetries, creating complicated, nonconvex objective landscapes, with multiple
equivalent solutions. Nevertheless, simple methods (e.g., gradient descent)
often perform surprisingly well in practice.
  The goal of this survey is to highlight a class of tractable nonconvex
problems, which can be understood through the lens of symmetries. These
problems exhibit a characteristic geometric structure: local minimizers are
symmetric copies of a single ""ground truth"" solution, while other critical
points occur at balanced superpositions of symmetric copies of the ground
truth, and exhibit negative curvature in directions that break the symmetry.
This structure enables efficient methods to obtain global minimizers. We
discuss examples of this phenomenon arising from a wide range of problems in
imaging, signal processing, and data analysis. We highlight the key role of
symmetry in shaping the objective landscape and discuss the different roles of
rotational and discrete symmetries. This area is rich with observed phenomena
and open problems; we close by highlighting directions for future research.

ordering. When agents have additive utilities, we present a polynomial-time
algorithm that computes a consensus halving with at most $n$ cuts, and show
that $n$ cuts are almost surely necessary when the agents' utilities are drawn
from probabilistic distributions. On the other hand, we show that for a simple
class of monotonic utilities, the problem already becomes PPAD-hard.
Furthermore, we compare and contrast consensus halving with the more general
problem of consensus $k$-splitting, where we wish to divide the resource into
$k$ parts in possibly unequal ratios, and provide some consequences of our
results on the problem of computing small agreeable sets.

joint-based face rig and a neural skinning network. Thanks to the joint-based
representation, our model enjoys some significant advantages over prior
blendshape-based models. First, it is very compact such that we are orders of
magnitude smaller while still keeping strong modeling capacity. Second, because
each joint has its semantic meaning, interactive facial geometry editing is
made easier and more intuitive. Third, through skinning, our model supports
adding mouth interior and eyes, as well as accessories (hair, eye glasses,
etc.) in a simpler, more accurate and principled way. We argue that because the
human face is highly structured and topologically consistent, it does not need
to be learned entirely from data. Instead we can leverage prior knowledge in
the form of a human-designed 3D face rig to reduce the data dependency, and
learn a compact yet strong face model from only a small dataset (less than one
hundred 3D scans). To further improve the modeling capacity, we train a
skinning weight generator through adversarial learning. Experiments on fitting
high-quality 3D scans (both neutral and expressive), noisy depth images, and
RGB images demonstrate that its modeling capacity is on-par with
state-of-the-art face models, such as FLAME and Facewarehouse, even though the
model is 10 to 20 times smaller. This suggests broad value in both graphics and
vision applications on mobile and edge devices.

Moreover, existing methods learn a single albedo per user which is not enough

research to draw causal conclusions when the treatment and outcome are
confounded by unmeasured confounding variables. One important feature of such
studies is that the instrumental variable is often applied at the cluster
level, e.g., hospitals' or physicians' preference for a certain treatment where
each hospital or physician naturally defines a cluster. This paper proposes to
embed such observational instrumental variable data into a cluster-randomized
encouragement experiment using statistical matching. Potential outcomes and
causal assumptions underpinning the design are formalized and examined. Testing
procedures for two commonly-used estimands, Fisher's sharp null hypothesis and
the pooled effect ratio, are extended to the current setting. We then introduce
a novel cluster-heterogeneous proportional treatment effect model and the
relevant estimand: the average cluster effect ratio. This new estimand is
advantageous over the structural parameter in a constant proportional treatment
effect model in that it allows treatment heterogeneity, and is advantageous
over the pooled effect ratio estimand in that it is immune to Simpson's
paradox. We develop an asymptotically valid randomization-based testing
procedure for this new estimand based on solving a mixed integer
quadratically-constrained optimization problem. The proposed design and
inferential methods are applied to a study of the effect of using
transesophageal echocardiography during CABG surgery on patients' 30-day

time-consuming. While prior research has explored many different ways of
reducing DNN training time, the impact of input data pipeline, i.e., fetching
raw data items from storage and performing data pre-processing in memory, has
been relatively unexplored. This paper makes the following contributions: (1)
We present the first comprehensive analysis of how the input data pipeline
affects the training time of widely-used computer vision and audio Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs), that typically involve complex data preprocessing. We analyze
nine different models across three tasks and four datasets while varying
factors such as the amount of memory, number of CPU threads, storage device,
GPU generation etc on servers that are a part of a large production cluster at
Microsoft. We find that in many cases, DNN training time is dominated by data
stall time: time spent waiting for data to be fetched and preprocessed. (2) We
build a tool, DS-Analyzer to precisely measure data stalls using a differential
technique, and perform predictive what-if analysis on data stalls. (3) Finally,
based on the insights from our analysis, we design and implement three simple
but effective techniques in a data-loading library, CoorDL, to mitigate data
stalls. Our experiments on a range of DNN tasks, models, datasets, and hardware
configs show that when PyTorch uses CoorDL instead of the state-of-the-art DALI
data loading library, DNN training time is reduced significantly (by as much as
5x on a single server).

important to reduce or eliminate the incidence of serious bugs. A growing body
of research has developed machine learning algorithms with formal guarantees
about performance, robustness, or fairness. Yet, the analysis of these

introduces room for error. Proof assistants can be used to formally verify
machine learning systems by constructing machine checked proofs of correctness
that rule out such bugs. However, reasoning about probabilistic claims inside
of a proof assistant remains challenging. We show how a probabilistic program
can be automatically represented in a theorem prover using the concept of
\emph{reparameterization}, and how some of the tedious proofs of measurability
can be generated automatically from the probabilistic program. To demonstrate
that this approach is broad enough to handle rather different types of machine
learning systems, we verify both a classic result from statistical learning
theory (PAC-learnability of decision stumps) and prove that the null model used
in a Bayesian hypothesis test satisfies a fairness criterion called demographic
parity.

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering provides a unique method to investigate the
spatial arrangement of colloidal particles. However, it is impossible to find
the exact location of the particles from S(q) because some information is
inherently lacking in the SAXS signal. The two standard ways to analyse an
experimental structure factor are then to compare it either to structure
factors computed from simulated systems, or to analytical structure factors
calculated from approximated systems. For liquids of monodisperse hard spheres,
the latter method provides analytical structure factors through the
Ornstein-Zernike equation used with the Percus-Yevick closure equation. The
structure factors obtained in this way were not adequate for the more common
dispersions of polydisperse particles. However, Vrij, Bloom and Stell were able
to demonstrate that the same mathematical framework could be extended to yield
accurate approximations for the experimental structure factor. Still, this
solution has remained underused because of its mathematical complexity. In the
present work, we derive and report the complete Percus-Yevick solution for
general polydisperse hard-spheres systems in a concise form that is
straightforward to use. The form of the solution is made simple enough to give
ready solutions of several important particle-radius distributions (Schulz,
truncated normal and inverse Gaussian). We also discuss in detail the case of
the power-law radius distribution, relevant in the case of systems made of an
Apollonian packing of spheres, as recently discovered experimentally in high
internal-phase-ratio emulsions.

It uses swept charge devices
(SCDs) to detect soft X-ray photons. The time response of LE is caused by the
structure of SCDs. With theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations we
discuss the influence of LE time response (LTR) on the timing analysis from
three aspects: the power spectral density, the pulse profile and the time lag.
After the LTR, the value of power spectral density monotonously decreases with
the increasing frequency. The power spectral density of a sinusoidal signal
reduces by a half at frequency 536 Hz. The corresponding frequency for QPO
signals is 458 Hz. The Root mean square (RMS) of QPOs holds the similar
behaviour. After the LTR, the centroid frequency and full width at half maxima
(FWHM) of QPOs signals do not change. The LTR reduces the RMS of pulse profiles
and shifts the pulse phase. In the time domain, the LTR only reduces the peak
value of the crosscorrelation function while it does not change the peak
position. Thus it will not affect the result of the time lag. When considering
the time lag obtained from two instruments and one among them is LE, a 1.18 ms
lag is expected caused by the LTR. The time lag calculated in the frequency
domain is the same as that in the time domain.

the data sparsity problem and affects the detection results. In this paper, we
proposed a dynamic region partition method to address the above issues.
Besides, we proposed an unsupervised REgional Anomaly Detection framework
(ReAD) to detect abnormal regions with arbitrary shapes by jointly considering
spatial and temporal properties. Specifically, the proposed framework first
generate regions via a dynamic region partition method. It keeps that
observations in the same region have adjacent locations and similar non-spatial
attribute readings, and could alleviate data sparsity and heterogeneity
compared with the grid-based approach. Then, an anomaly metric will be
calculated for each region by a regional divergence calculation method. The
abnormal regions could be finally detected by a weighted approach or a wavy
approach according to the different scenario. Experiments on both the simulated
dataset and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicability of the proposed framework.

million test-takers in just the last three years. This number is increasing
further due to COVID-19 and the associated automation of education and testing.
Despite such wide usage, the AI-based testing literature of these ""intelligent""
models is highly lacking. Most of the papers proposing new models rely only on
quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) based agreement with human raters for showing
model efficacy. However, this effectively ignores the highly multi-feature

grammar, relevance, sufficiency and, vocabulary. To date, there has been no
study testing Automated Essay Scoring: AES systems holistically on all these
features. With this motivation, we propose a model agnostic adversarial
evaluation scheme and associated metrics for AES systems to test their natural
language understanding capabilities and overall robustness. We evaluate the
current state-of-the-art AES models using the proposed scheme and report the
results on five recent models. These models range from
feature-engineering-based approaches to the latest deep learning algorithms. We
find that AES models are highly overstable. Even heavy modifications(as much as
25%) with content unrelated to the topic of the questions do not decrease the
score produced by the models. On the other hand, irrelevant content, on
average, increases the scores, thus showing that the model evaluation strategy
and rubrics should be reconsidered. We also ask 200 human raters to score both
an original and adversarial response to seeing if humans can detect differences
between the two and whether they agree with the scores assigned by auto scores.

visualize bond structures in molecules. It became a useful tool to describe
electron configurations in atoms, molecules and solids. In nuclear physics, a
nucleon localization function (NLF) has been used to characterize clusters in
light nuclei, fragment formation in fission and pasta phases in the inner crust
of neutron stars.
  Purpose: We use the NLF to study the nuclear response to fast rotation.
  Methods: We generalize the NLF to the case of nuclear rotation. The extended
expressions involve both time-even and time-odd local densities. Since current
density and density gradient contribute to the NLF primarily at the surface, we
propose a simpler spatial measure given by the kinetic-energy density.
Illustrative calculations for the superdeformed yrast band of $^{152}$Dy were
carried out by using the cranked Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method. We also employed
the cranked harmonic-oscillator model to gain insights into patterns revealed
by the NLF at high angular momentum.
  Results: In a deformed rotating nucleus, several NLFs can be introduced,
depending on the definition of the spin-quantization axis and self-consistent
symmetries of the system. The oscillating pattern of the NLF can be explained
by a constructive interference between the kinetic-energy and particle
densities. The nodal pattern seen in the NLF along the major axis of a rotating
nucleus comes from single-particle orbits with large aligned angular momentum.
The variation of the NLF along the minor axis is traced back to
deformation-aligned orbits.
  Conclusions: The NLF allows a simple interpretation of the shell structure
evolution in the rotating nucleus in terms of the angular-momentum alignment of
individual nucleons. We expect that the NLF will be useful for the
characterization of other collective modes and time-dependent processes.

potential is generated by acquiring its energy from radiation, the primordial
fluctuations of the axion field generated in the inflation era are correlated
with the CMB anisotropies. Consequently, the observations stringently constrain
a model of the axion and the early universe scenario. The following conditions
must be satisfied: (i) sufficient amplitudes of the CMB anisotropy (ii)
consistency with the axion isocurvature constraint and (iii) the
non-Gaussianity constraint. To satisfy these conditions, a large energy
fraction $\Omega_A^{}$ of the axion is necessary at the QCD scale when the
axion-potential is generated, but simultaneously, it must become tiny at the
present era due to the isocurvature constraint. Thus an additional scenario of
the early universe, such as low scale thermal inflation, is inevitable to
dilute the axions after the QCD scale. We investigate such a model and obtain
its allowed parameter region.

networks using piecewise linear activation functions such as ReLU, comparing
with those conventional ones using other activation functions. Previous studies
showed this property reflected the expressivity of a neural network family
([14]); as a result, it can be used to characterize how the structural
complexity of a neural network model affects the function it aims to compute.
Nonetheless, it is challenging to directly compute the number of linear
regions; therefore, many researchers focus on estimating the bounds (in
particular the upper bound) of the number of linear regions for deep neural
networks using ReLU. These methods, however, attempted to estimate the upper
bound in the entire input space. The theoretical methods are still lacking to
estimate the number of linear regions within a specific area of the input
space, e.g., a sphere centered at a training data point such as an adversarial
example or a backdoor trigger. In this paper, we present the first method to
estimate the upper bound of the number of linear regions in any sphere in the
input space of a given ReLU neural network. We implemented the method, and
computed the bounds in deep neural networks using the piece-wise linear active
function. Our experiments showed that, while training a neural network, the
boundaries of the linear regions tend to move away from the training data
points. In addition, we observe that the spheres centered at the training data
points tend to contain more linear regions than any arbitrary points in the
input space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of bounding
linear regions around a specific data point. We consider our work as a first
step toward the investigation of the structural complexity of deep neural

Quantum algorithms can be simulated in a pseudo quantum environment, but
implementation involves realization of quantum circuits through physical
synthesis of quantum gates. This requires decomposition of complex quantum
gates into a cascade of simple one qubit and two qubit gates. The
methodological framework for physical synthesis imposes a constraint regarding
placement of operands (qubits) and operators. If physical qubits can be placed
on a grid, where each node of the grid represents a qubit then quantum gates
can only be operated on adjacent qubits, otherwise SWAP gates must be inserted
to convert non-Linear Nearest Neighbor architecture to Linear Nearest Neighbor
architecture. Insertion of SWAP gates should be made optimal to reduce
cumulative cost of physical implementation. A schedule layout generation is
required for placement and routing apriori to actual implementation. In this
paper, two algorithms are proposed to optimize the number of SWAP gates in any
arbitrary quantum circuit. The first algorithm is intended to start with
generation of an interaction graph followed by finding the longest path

single stream network to directly use the depth map to guide early fusion and
middle fusion between RGB and depth, which saves the feature encoder of the
depth stream and achieves a lightweight and real-time model. We tactfully
utilize depth information from two perspectives: (1) Overcoming the
incompatibility problem caused by the great difference between modalities, we
build a single stream encoder to achieve the early fusion, which can take full
advantage of ImageNet pre-trained backbone model to extract rich and
discriminative features. (2) We design a novel depth-enhanced dual attention
module (DEDA) to efficiently provide the fore-/back-ground branches with the
spatially filtered features, which enables the decoder to optimally perform the
middle fusion. Besides, we put forward a pyramidally attended feature
extraction module (PAFE) to accurately localize the objects of different
scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model performs
favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation

achieves a localization error of 0.0625 m as compared to 0.1425 m with MFP when

magnetic stars, via the process of electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME).
This emission, observed in the form of highly circularly polarized pulses, have
interesting properties which contain information about the host star. One of
the important properties of ECME is the frequency dependence of the pulse
arrival time. This has been attributed to propagation effect by Trigilio et al.
(2011), and could explain the sequence observed for CU Vir qualitatively (Lo et
al. 2012). However no quantitative treatment exists for this phenomenon which
is a promising tool to estimate the density in the stellar magnetosphere.
Besides, the effect of propagation through the magnetosphere on ECME has been
thought to be limited to giving rise to a particular sequence of arrival of
pulses, and in some cases producing the upper cut-off frequency for ECME (Leto
et al. 2019). Here, we present a framework to deal with the propagation effect
by considering continuous refraction in the inner magnetosphere of the star.
This framework is capable of incorporating any type of density distribution,
and in principle any type of magnetic field, though we limit ourselves to a
dipolar magnetic field for this work. We show by simulation that for stars with
high obliquity, the propagation effect can influence not only the sequence of
arrival of pulses drastically, but also the pulse shapes, and the observability
of a pulse from a particular magnetosphere.

the dynamical conductivity of each layer. This is the conductivity when an
electromagnetic field is localized at a particular layer and differs from the
standard conductivity calculated assuming a uniform field throughout all
layers. By combining these conductivities with a transfer matrix method, we
took into account the spatial variation of the electromagnetic field caused by
internal reflections. The results obtained from the two conductivities show
that similar peak structures originating from the interlayer electronic
interaction appear in reflectance of an $N$-layer graphene at any $N$. The peak
is inherent to the AB stacking and is not seen for the AA stacking, and the
peak corresponding to a sufficiently large $N$ is considered to the one
observed for natural graphite. We also gave physical explanations of the
existing experimental results on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and natural
graphite under high pressure. Although a layered conductivity underestimates
the reflectance of graphite at photon energies below the peak, we will show
that the disagreement is attributed to a nonlocal conductivity caused by
interlayer interaction. The calculations with layered conductivity are useful
in knowing the local response to light and may be further validated by an
observation of a correction by interlayer electronic interaction to the
universal layer number that we have discovered recently.

PBR specification consists of (1) input features $x$, and (2) a reward function
$r$, modeled as a black-box component (which we can only run), that assigns a
reward for each execution. The goal of the synthesizer is to synthesize a
""decision function"" $f$ which transforms the features to a decision value for
the black-box component so as to maximize the expected reward $E[r \circ f

space of decision functions in a DSL of loop-free if-then-else programs, which
can branch on linear functions of the input features in a tree-structure and
compute a linear function of the inputs in the leaves of the tree. We find that
this DSL captures decision functions that are manually written in practice by
programmers. Our technical contribution is the use of continuous-optimization
techniques to perform synthesis of such decision functions as if-then-else

7.5 mM sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) are evaluated beyond 500 mM NaCl. As in the
case of hexadecane-in-water (h/w) emulsions, it is found that flocculation
rates apparently decrease with the ionic strength, departing appreciably from
theoretical predictions. Since many-particle simulations proved to be very time
consuming, an accurate knowledge of experimental parameters is necessary prior
to the realization of further evaluations. Here, the change in the viscosity of
the aqueous solution due to the surfactant phase behavior is considered as a
possible cause of referred phenomenon. The influence of the external viscosity
on the outcome of the simulations is appraised using a quotient between the
actual viscosity of the surfactant solution at a given salt concentration and
its value in the absence of salt. For that purpose, the viscosity of 0.5 and
7.5 mM SDS solutions was measured between 300 an 900 mM NaCl for temperatures
of 20 and 25 {\deg}C. It is concluded that the augment of the aqueous viscosity
due to the formation of surfactant crystals diminish significantly the
aggregation rate. Yet this decline seems insufficient to justify the observed
reduction of kFC at 25 C. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that a 5-degree change
in the temperature of the surfactant solution causes a remarkable decrease of
kFC . Additionally, a set of two-particle simulations is used here to
illustrate the limitations of this methodology for the appraisal of the
viscosity contribution. It is confirmed that such approach is only convenient
to study the effect of the interaction potential on the aggregation rate, as it
was formerly conceived by Fuchs [1936].

alleviate these issues by additional datasets, multi-relation attention
mechanisms and sub-modules. However, they require more cost. In this work, for
meta-learning, we find that the main challenges focus on related or irrelevant
semantic features between categories. Therefore, based on semantic features, we
propose a Top-C classification loss (i.e., TCL-C) for classification task and a
category-based grouping mechanism for category-based meta-features obtained by
the meta-model. The TCL-C exploits the true-label prediction and the most
likely C-1 false classification predictions to improve detection performance on
few-shot classes. According to similar appearance (i.e., visual appearance,
shape, and limbs etc.) and environment in which objects often appear, the
category-based grouping mechanism splits categories into disjoint groups to
make similar semantic features more compact between categories within a group
and obtain more significant difference between groups, alleviating the strong
bias problem and further improving detection APs. The whole training consists
of the base model and the fine-tuning phases. According to grouping mechanism,
we group the meta-features vectors obtained by meta-model, so that the
distribution difference between groups is obvious, and the one within each
group is less. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that
ours which combines the TCL-C with category-based grouping significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for few-shot detection. Compared

particles get trapped in the given environment when the system percolates at

we observe that particles trapping occurs prior to $\eta_c$. In particular, we
find a relation between $\eta$ and $f$ which provides an estimate of the
minimum $\eta$ up to a critical scaling parameter $f_c$ beyond which the
Fick-Jacobs description is invalid. Prominent transport features like
nonmonotonic behavior of the nonlinear mobility, anomalous diffusion, and
greatly enhanced effective diffusion coefficient are explained for various

masses of the constituents through a temperature-dependent running coupling
extracted from the lattice QCD thermodynamics. In Yang-Mills theory, the bulk
viscosity to entropy density ratio exhibits a non-monotonous structure around
the phase transition temperature. In QCD, this is totally dissolved because of
a substantial contribution from quark quasiparticles. The bulk to shear
viscosity ratio near the phase transition behaves consistently to the scaling
with the speed of sound derived in the AdS/CFT approach, whereas at high
temperature it obeys the same parametric dependence as in perturbation theory.
Thus, the employed quasiparticle model is adequate to capture the transport
properties in the weak and strong coupling regimes of the theory. This feature
is not altered by including dynamical quarks which, however, retards the system
from restoring conformal invariance. We also examine the individual flavor
contributions to the electrical conductivity and show that the obtained
behavior agrees qualitatively well with the recent results of lattice

represent high-dimensional time series data with its parameters. An experiment
with the Korean stock market data showed that the model was able to capture the
relative similarity between a large number of stock prices in its latent space.
Besides, the model was also able to predict the future stock trends from the
latent space. The proposed method can help to identify relationships among many

other users. In addition, our model does not assume that users' opinions are
rational in order to extract information from it, an assumption that
significantly limits current approaches. Instead, we define a weaker notion of
rationality that characterises coherent opinions, and we consider different
scenarios based on the coherence of individual opinions and the level of
consensus that users have on the debate structure. Considering these two
factors, we analyse the outcomes of different opinion aggregation functions
that compute a collective decision based on the individual opinions and the
debate structure. In particular, we demonstrate that aggregated opinions can be
coherent even if there is a lack of consensus and individual opinions are not
coherent. We conclude our analysis with a computational evaluation
demonstrating that collective opinions can be computed efficiently for
real-sized debates.

LSEMs are a popular and well-studied class of models for inferring causality in

to recover the model parameters from the observational data. Under various
conditions on LSEMs and the model parameters the prior work provides efficient
algorithms to recover the parameters. However, these results are often about
generic identifiability. In practice, generic identifiability is not sufficient
and we need robust identifiability: small changes in the observational data
should not affect the parameters by a huge amount. Robust identifiability has
received far less attention and remains poorly understood. Sankararaman et al.
(2019) recently provided a set of sufficient conditions on parameters under
which robust identifiability is feasible. However, a limitation of their work
is that their results only apply to a small sub-class of LSEMs, called
``bow-free paths.'' In this work, we significantly extend their work along
multiple dimensions. First, for a large and well-studied class of LSEMs, namely
``bow free'' models, we provide a sufficient condition on model parameters
under which robust identifiability holds, thereby removing the restriction of
paths required by prior work. We then show that this sufficient condition holds
with high probability which implies that for a large set of parameters robust
identifiability holds and that for such parameters, existing algorithms already

event KMT-2019-BLG-2073. Making use of the pronounced finite-source effects
generated by the clump-giant source, we measure the Einstein radius $\theta_\rm
E \simeq 4.8\,\rm \mu as$, and so infer a mass $M = 59\,M_\oplus
(\pi_\rm{rel}/16 \,\rm \mu as)^{-1}$, where $\pi_\rm{rel}$ is the lens-source
relative parallax. We find no significant evidence for a host of this planetary
mass object, though one could be present at sufficiently wide separation. If
so, it would be detectable after about 10 years. This is the fourth isolated
microlens with a measured Einstein radius $\theta_\rm{E}<10\,\rm \mu as$, which
we argue is a useful threshold for a ""likely free-floating planet (FFP)""
candidate. We outline a new approach to constructing a homogeneous sample of
giant-star finite-source/point-lens (FSPL) events, within which the subsample
of FFP candidates can be statistically analyzed. We illustrate this approach
using 2019 KMTNet data and show that there is a large $\theta_\rm{E}$ gap
between the two FFP candidates and the 11 other FSPL events. We argue that such
sharp features are more identifiable in a sample selected on $\theta_\rm{E}$
compared to the traditional approach of identifying candidates based on short
$t_\rm{E}$.

scattering length. We show that the evolution of the condensate is equivalent
to the motion of a particle in an effective potential. The particle begins its
motion far from the point of stable equilibrium and it then proceeds to
oscillate about that point. We prove that the resulting large oscillations in

historical documents content that follows the correct reading order. In this
framework, two branches named character branch and layout branch are added
behind the feature extraction network. The character branch localizes
individual characters in a document image and recognizes them simultaneously.
Then we adopt a post-processing method to group them into text lines. The
layout branch based on fully convolutional network outputs a binary mask. We
then use Hough transform for line detection on the binary mask and combine
character results with the layout information to restore document content.
These two branches can be trained in parallel and are easy to train.
Furthermore, we propose a re-score mechanism to minimize recognition error.
Experiment results on the extended Chinese historical document MTHv2 dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

resembles a crown made of origami. CrownConv can be applied to both fisheye
images and equirectangular images to extract features. Furthermore, we propose
icosahedron-based spherical sweeping for generating the cost volume on an
icosahedron from the extracted features. The cost volume is regularized using
the three-dimensional CrownConv, and the final depth is obtained by depth
regression from the cost volume. Our proposed method is robust to camera
alignments by using the extrinsic camera parameters; therefore, it can achieve
precise depth estimation even when the camera alignment differs from that in
the training dataset. We evaluate the proposed model on synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its effectiveness. As our proposed method is computationally
efficient, the depth is estimated from four fisheye images in less than a
second using a laptop with a GPU. Therefore, it is suitable for real-world
robotics applications. Our source code is available at

Compared to the traditional hybrid approach of MPI plus OpenMP, a new, but
promising hybrid approach of MPI plus MPI-3 shared-memory extensions (MPI+MPI)
is gaining attraction. We describe an algorithmic approach for collective
operations (with allgather and broadcast as concrete examples) in the context
of hybrid MPI+MPI, so as to minimize memory consumption and memory copies. With
this approach, only one memory copy is maintained and shared by on-node
processes. This allows the removal of unnecessary on-node copies of replicated
data that are required between MPI processes when the collectives are invoked
in the context of pure MPI. We compare our approach of collectives for hybrid
MPI+MPI and the traditional one for pure MPI, and also have a discussion on the
synchronization that is required to guarantee data integrity. The performance
of our approach has been validated on a Cray XC40 system (Cray MPI) and NEC
cluster (OpenMPI), showing that it achieves comparable or better performance
for allgather operations. We have further validated our approach with a
standard computational kernel, namely distributed matrix multiplication, and a

it into a time-reversal symmetry broken Chern insulator (CI). This transition
from an NI to CI happens under a high-frequency radiation corresponding to the
off-resonant regime of the Floquet theory of periodic perturbations, which here
is the impinging light beam. This photo-induced topological CI phase manifests
as a finite Berry curvature and forms the basis of anomalous transverse heat
flow in presence of a longitudinal temperature gradient. The anomalous variants
of the Ettinghausen (EE) and Righi-Leduc effects (RLE), via their respective
coefficients are quantitatively analyzed in this work. The strength of
anomalous EE and RLE coefficients is a direct outcome of the sum of Berry
curvatures over the occupied bands and is shown to drop as the Fermi level is
positioned high in the conduction states or deep in the valence region. The
drop is attributed to the flipped sign of the Berry curvature in the conduction
and valence bands. Additionally, when the Fermi level lies in the band gap, the
contribution of the conduction and valence bands may numerically outweigh one
another for a much larger value of the coefficients. Finally, we point out how
beyond the role of Berry curvature, several laboratory accessible methods can
be utilized to modulate the EE and RLE coefficients, including an application
of strain, variations in the dopant concentration, and frequency of incident
radiation.

approaches leverage network embedding technique to learn how to generate node
representations for normal training samples and detect anomalies deviated from
normal patterns. However, most existing network embedding approaches learn
deterministic node representations, which are sensitive to fluctuations of the
topology and attributes due to the high flexibility and stochasticity of
dynamic networks. In this paper, a stochastic neural network, named by
Hierarchical Variational Graph Recurrent Autoencoder (H-VGRAE), is proposed to
detect anomalies in dynamic networks by the learned robust node representations
in the form of random variables. H-VGRAE is a semi-supervised model to capture
normal patterns in training set by maximizing the likelihood of the adjacency
matrix and node attributes via variational inference. Comparing with existing
methods, H-VGRAE has three main advantages: 1) H-VGRAE learns robust node
representations through stochasticity modeling and the extraction of
multi-scale spatial-temporal features; 2) H-VGRAE can be extended to deep
structure with the increase of the dynamic network scale; 3) the anomalous edge
and node can be located and interpreted from the probabilistic perspective.
Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the
outperformance of H-VGRAE on anomaly detection in dynamic networks compared

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) formalism assumes, 1) that all the upstream material
passes downstream, together with the momentum and energy it carries, and 2)
that pressures are isotropic. In a collisionless shock, shock accelerated
particles going back and forth around the front can invalid the first
assumption. In addition, an external magnetic field can sustain stable pressure
anisotropies, invaliding the second assumption. It is therefore unclear whether
the density jump of a collisionless shock fulfils the MHD jump or not.
  Here we try to clarify this issue. A literature review is conducted on 68
articles dealing with Particle-In-Cell simulations of collisionless shocks. We
analyze the factors triggering departure from the MHD density jump and quantify
their influence on $\Delta_{RH}$, the relative departure from the
Rankine-Hugoniot jump. For small departures we propose $\Delta_{RH} = +
\mathcal{O}(10^{-1-3.7\kappa})t^\kappa - \sigma \mathcal{O}(1)$ where $t$ is
the timescale of the simulation, $\sigma$ the magnetization parameter and
$\kappa$ a constant of order unity. The first term stems from the energy
leakage into accelerated particle. The second term stems from the downstream
anisotropy triggered by the field (assuming an isotropic upstream). This
relation allows to assess to which extent a collisionless shock fulfils the RH
density jump.
  In the strong field limit and for parallel shocks, the departure caused by
the field saturates at a finite, negative, value. For perpendicular shocks, the
departure goes to zero at small and high $\sigma$'s so that we find here a
departure window. The results obtained have to be checked against full 3D
simulations.

specifically from different sensors are of utmost importance. In this paper, we
present SRDCNN: Strongly Regularized Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN)
based deep architecture to perform time series classification tasks. The
novelty of the proposed approach is that the network weights are regularized by
both L1 and L2 norm penalties. Both of the regularization approaches jointly
address the practical issues of smaller number of training instances,
requirement of quicker training process, avoiding overfitting problem by
incorporating sparsification of weight vectors as well as through controlling
of weight values. We compare the proposed method (SRDCNN) with relevant
state-of-the-art algorithms including different DNNs using publicly available
time series classification benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) time series datasets
and demonstrate that the proposed method provides superior performance. We feel
that SRDCNN warrants better generalization capability to the deep architecture
by profoundly controlling the network parameters to combat the training
instance insufficiency problem of real-life time series sensor signals.

triplet transfer from tetracene into Si. Magnetic field-dependent photocurrent
measurements confirm that triplet excitons contribute to the photocurrent. The
decay of tetracene delayed photoluminescence was used to determine a triplet

Fomalhaut from 2004-2014 (Fomalhaut b) is gradually fading and expanding,
supporting the case that it may be a dispersing dust cloud resulting from the
sudden disruption of a planetesimal. These types of disruptions may arise from
catastrophic collisions of planetesimals, which are perturbed from their
original orbits in the Fomalhaut dust ring by nearby giant planets. However,
disruptions can also occur when the planetesimals pass within the tidal
disruption field of the planet(s) that perturbed them in the first place,
similar to the Shoemaker-Levy event observed in the Solar System. Given that a
gravitationally focusing giant planet has a much larger interaction
cross-section than a planetesimal, tidal disruption events can match or
outnumber planetesimal collision events in realistic regions of parameter
space. Intriguingly, the Fomalhaut dust cloud offers an opportunity to directly
distinguish between these scenarios. A tidal disruption scenario leads to a
very specific prediction of ephemerides for the planet causing the event. At a
most probable mass of 66 Mearth, a semi-major axis of 117 AU, and a system age
of 400-500 Myr, this planet would be readily detectable with the James Webb
Space Telescope. The presence or absence of this planet at the specific,
predicted position is therefore a distinctive indicator of whether the
dispersing cloud originated from a collision of two planetesimals or from the
disruption of a planetesimal in the tidal field of a giant planet.

data type occurs naturally in string-manipulating programs, and is frequently
used to refer to lengths of, or positions in, strings. Analysis and testing of
string-manipulating programs can be formulated as the path feasibility problem:
given a symbolic execution path, does there exist an assignment to the inputs
that yields a concrete execution that realizes this path? Such a problem can
naturally be reformulated as a string constraint solving problem. Although
state-of-the-art string constraint solvers usually provide support for both
string and integer data types, they mainly resort to heuristics without
completeness guarantees. In this paper, we propose a decision procedure for a
class of string-manipulating programs which includes not only a wide range of
string operations such as concatenation, replaceAll, reverse, and finite
transducers, but also those involving the integer data-type such as length,
indexof, and substring. To the best of our knowledge, this represents one of
the most expressive string constraint languages that is currently known to be
decidable. Our decision procedure is based on a variant of cost register
automata. We implement the decision procedure, giving rise to a new solver
OSTRICH+. We evaluate the performance of OSTRICH+ on a wide range of existing
and new benchmarks. The experimental results show that OSTRICH+ is the first
string decision procedure capable of tackling finite transducers and integer
constraints, whilst its overall performance is comparable with the

lattice dynamical properties of crystals. It involves displacing atoms by a

widely in use, to our knowledge, there is no systematic discussion of optimal
displacement directions from the crystal's symmetry point of view nor a
rigorous error analysis of such methods. Based on the group theory and point
group symmetry of a crystal, we propose displacement directions, with an
equivalent concept of the group of $k$, deduced directly in the Cartesian
coordinates rather than the usual fractional coordinates, that maintain the
theoretical maximum for the triple product $V$ spanned by the three
displacements to avoid possible severe roundoff errors. The proposed
displacement directions are generated from a minimal set of irreducible atomic
displacements that keep the required independent force calculations to a
minimum. We find the error in the calculated force constant explicitly depends
on the inverse of $V$ and inaccuracy of the forces. Test systems such as Si,
graphene, and orthorhombic Sb2S3 are used to illustrate the method. Our
displacement method is shown to be very robust in treating low-symmetry cells
with a large `aspect ratio' due to huge differences in lattice parameters, use
of a large vacuum height, or a very oblique unit cell due to unconventional
choice of primitive lattice vectors. It is expected that our displacement
strategy can be used to address higher-order interatomic interactions to

challenging to obtain uniform TMDCs with clean surfaces, because of the
difficulties in controlling the way the reactants are supplied to the reaction

a new growth approach called dissolution-precipitation (DP) growth, where the
metal sources are sealed inside glass substrates to control their feeding to
the reaction. Noteworthy, the diffusion of metal source inside glass to its
surface provides a uniform metal source on the glass surface, and restricts the
TMDC growth to only a surface reaction while eliminates unwanted gas-phase
reaction. This feature gives rise to highly-uniform monolayer TMDCs with a
clean surface on centimeter-scale substrates. The DP growth works well for a
large variety of TMDCs and their alloys, providing a solid foundation for the
controlled growth of clean TMDCs by the fine control of the metal source.

the segment $pq$ is fully contained in $P$. The art gallery problem seeks a
minimum size set $G\subset P$ of guards that sees $P$ completely. The only
currently correct algorithm to solve the art gallery problem exactly uses
algebraic methods and is attributed to Sharir. As the art gallery problem is
ER-complete, it seems unlikely to avoid algebraic methods, without additional
assumptions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of vision stability. In
order to describe vision stability consider an enhanced guard that can see
""around the corner"" by an angle of $\delta$ or a diminished guard whose vision
is by an angle of $\delta$ ""blocked"" by reflex vertices. A polygon $P$ has
vision stability $\delta$ if the optimal number of enhanced guards to guard $P$
is the same as the optimal number of diminished guards to guard $P$. We will
argue that most relevant polygons are vision stable. We describe a one-shot
vision stable algorithm that computes an optimal guard set for visionstable
polygons using polynomial time and solving one integer program. It guarantees
to find the optimal solution for every vision stable polygon. We implemented an
iterative visionstable algorithm and show its practical performance is slower,
but comparable with other state of the art algorithms. Our iterative algorithm
is inspired and follows closely the one-shot algorithm. It delays several steps
and only computes them when deemed necessary. Given a chord $c$ of a polygon,
we denote by $n(c)$ the number of vertices visible from $c$. The chord-width of
a polygon is the maximum $n(c)$ over all possible chords $c$. The set of vision
stable polygons admits an FPT algorithm when parametrized by the chord-width.
Furthermore, the one-shot algorithm runs in FPT time, when parameterized by the
number of reflex vertices.

targets from convolution space to a graph-based semantic space, a message
passing process propagating semantics among all nodes and an update function
transforming the reasoned nodes back to convolution space. Furthermore, we
construct a new framework to assemble in-Graph models for detecting HOIs,
namely in-GraphNet. Beyond inferring HOIs using instance features respectively,
the framework dynamically parses pairwise interactive semantics among visual
targets by integrating two-level in-Graphs, i.e., scene-wide and instance-wide
in-Graphs. Our framework is end-to-end trainable and free from costly
annotations like human pose. Extensive experiments show that our proposed
framework outperforms existing HOI detection methods on both V-COCO and
HICO-DET benchmarks and improves the baseline about 9.4% and 15% relatively,
validating its efficacy in detecting HOIs.

hole filling. While existing methods recover structures and textures
step-by-step in the hole regions, they typically use two encoder-decoders for
separate recovery. The CNN features of each encoder are learned to capture
either missing structures or textures without considering them as a whole. The
insufficient utilization of these encoder features limit the performance of
recovering both structures and textures. In this paper, we propose a mutual
encoder-decoder CNN for joint recovery of both. We use CNN features from the
deep and shallow layers of the encoder to represent structures and textures of
an input image, respectively. The deep layer features are sent to a structure
branch and the shallow layer features are sent to a texture branch. In each
branch, we fill holes in multiple scales of the CNN features. The filled CNN
features from both branches are concatenated and then equalized. During feature
equalization, we reweigh channel attentions first and propose a bilateral
propagation activation function to enable spatial equalization. To this end,
the filled CNN features of structure and texture mutually benefit each other to
represent image content at all feature levels. We use the equalized feature to
supplement decoder features for output image generation through skip
connections. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show the proposed method is
effective to recover structures and textures and performs favorably against

increased computational cost of the multi-antenna processing. The second is the
variations of user energy distribution over the antenna elements and therefore
spatial non-stationarities in these energy distributions. Such
non-stationarities limit the performance of the system. In this paper, we
propose a distributed receiver for such an XL-MIMO system that can address both
challenges. Based on variational message passing (VMP), We propose a set of
receiver options providing a range of complexity-performance characteristics to
adapt to different requirements. Furthermore, we distribute the processing into
local processing units (LPU), that can perform most of the complex processing
in parallel, before sharing their outcome with a central processing unit (CPU).
Our designs are specifically tailored to exploit the spatial non-stationarities
and require lower computations than linear receivers such as zero-forcing. Our

Ising and Potts models on the integer lattice ${\mathbb Z}^d$. This dynamics is
a widely used Markov chain that has largely resisted sharp analysis because it
is non-local, i.e., it changes the entire configuration in one step. We prove
that, whenever Strong Spatial Mixing (SSM) holds, the mixing time on any
$n$-vertex cube in ${\mathbb Z}^d$ is $O(\log n)$, and we prove this is tight
by establishing a matching lower bound on the mixing time. The previous best
known bound was $O(n)$. SSM is a standard condition corresponding to
exponential decay of correlations with distance between spins on the lattice
and is known to hold in $d=2$ dimensions throughout the high-temperature

Inequality, which expresses the fact that the dynamics contracts relative
entropy at a constant rate at each step. The proof of this fact utilizes a new
factorization of the entropy in the joint probability space over spins and

bipartite graphs of bounded degree. This factorization leads to several
additional results, including mixing time bounds for a number of natural local

Although early statistical approaches to system combination have been proven
effective in analyzing the consensus between hypotheses, they suffer from the
error propagation problem due to the use of pipelines. While this problem has
been alleviated by end-to-end training of multi-source sequence-to-sequence
models recently, these neural models do not explicitly analyze the relations
between hypotheses and fail to capture their agreement because the attention to
a word in a hypothesis is calculated independently, ignoring the fact that the
word might occur in multiple hypotheses. In this work, we propose an approach
to modeling voting for system combination in machine translation. The basic
idea is to enable words in hypotheses from different systems to vote on words
that are representative and should get involved in the generation process. This
can be done by quantifying the influence of each voter and its preference for
each candidate. Our approach combines the advantages of statistical and neural
methods since it can not only analyze the relations between hypotheses but also
allow for end-to-end training. Experiments show that our approach is capable of
better taking advantage of the consensus between hypotheses and achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on Chinese-English and

corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. The data were
collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC during Run 2 between 2015 and 2018
at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The measurements are performed in a
fiducial volume defined at parton level. Events with exactly one photon, one
electron and one muon of opposite sign, and at least two jets, of which at
least one is $b$-tagged, are selected. The fiducial cross-section is measured
to be $39.6\,^{+2.7}_{-2.3}\,\textrm{fb}$. Differential cross-sections as
functions of several observables are compared with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo
simulations and next-to-leading-order theoretical calculations. These include
cross-sections as functions of photon kinematic variables, angular variables
related to the photon and the leptons, and angular separations between the two
leptons in the event. All measurements are in agreement with the predictions
from the Standard Model.

in the $X$-$Y$ plane for a large volume of the Galactic disk (6 $< R < 16$ kpc;
$-20 <\phi< 50^{\circ}$; $|Z| < 1$ kpc). A clear signature where
$\overline{V_{z}}$ increases with $R$ is detected for the chemically thin disk.
The signature for the thick disk is however not significant, in line with the
hot nature of this disk component. For the thin disk, the warp signature shows
significant variations in both radial and azimuthal directions, in excellent
agreement with the previous results of star counts. Fitting the two-dimensional
distribution of $\overline{V_{z}}$ with a simple long-lived static warp model
yields a line-of-node angle for this kinematic warp of about $12.5^{\circ}$,
again consistent with the previous results.

Galerkin (DG) methods is stable. The proof exploits that the DG approximation
is constructed from polynomial basis functions and that integrals are
approximated with high-order accurate Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto quadrature. The
theoretical discussion serves to re-contextualize stable filtering results for
finite difference methods into the DG setting. It is shown that the stability
of the filtering is equivalent to a particular contractivity condition borrowed
from the analysis of so-called transmission problems. As such, the temporal
stability proof relies on the fact that the underlying spatial discretization
of the problem possesses a semi-discrete bound on the solution. Numerical tests
are provided to verify and validate the underlying theoretical results.

  Morphologically Rich Online ASR","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"eess.AS cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently Deep Transformer models have proven to be particularly powerful in
language modeling tasks for ASR. Their high complexity, however, makes them
very difficult to apply in the first (single) pass of an online system. Recent
studies showed that a considerable part of the knowledge of neural network
Language Models (LM) can be transferred to traditional n-grams by using neural
text generation based data augmentation. In our paper, we pre-train a GPT-2
Transformer LM on a general text corpus and fine-tune it on our Hungarian
conversational call center ASR task. We show that although data augmentation
with Transformer-generated text works well for isolating languages, it causes a
vocabulary explosion in a morphologically rich language. Therefore, we propose
a new method called subword-based neural text augmentation, where we retokenize
the generated text into statistically derived subwords. We compare Morfessor
and BPE statistical subword tokenizers and show that both methods can
significantly improve the WER while greatly reducing vocabulary size and memory
requirements. Finally, we also demonstrate that subword-based neural text

structural phase diagram, with the stability and properties of the various
structural phases strongly affected both by temperature and by electron doping.
The existence of superconductivity is of particular interest, with the
underlying mechanism as of now not well understood. In addition, reports of
enhanced superconductivity at structural domain walls are particularly
intriguing. Focusing specifically on the orthorhombic $\beta$ phase, we
calculate the structure and properties of the domain walls both with and
without electron doping. We use two theoretical approaches: Landau-Ginzburg
theory, with free energies constructed from symmetry considerations and
parameters extracted from our first-principles density functional calculations,
and direct calculation using large-scale, GPU-enabled density functional
theory. We find that the structure of the $\beta$-phase domain walls resembles
that of the bulk tetragonal $\alpha_1$ phase, and that the electronic charge
tends to accumulate at the walls. Motivated by this finding, we perform ab
initio computations of electron-phonon coupling in the bulk $\alpha_1$
structure and extract the superconducting critical temperatures , $T_c$, within
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Our results provide insight into the
experimentally observed unusual trend of decreasing Tc with increasing
electronic charge carrier concentration.

This framework gathers a wide variety of possible non-conforming methods, and
an error estimate is provided for this simple model. We then turn to the
application of the functional framework to the case of a steady degenerate
elliptic equation, for which a mass-lumping technique is required; here, this
technique simply consists in using a different --piecewise constant-- function
reconstruction from the chosen degrees of freedom. A convergence result is
stated for this degenerate model. Then, we introduce a novel specific
non-conforming method, dubbed Locally Enriched Polytopal Non-Conforming
(LEPNC). These basis functions comprise functions dedicated to each face of the
mesh (and associated with average values on these faces), together with
functions spanning the local $\mathbb{P}^1$ space in each polytopal element.
The analysis of the interpolation properties of these basis functions is
provided, and mass-lumping techniques are presented. Numerical tests are
presented to assess the efficiency and the accuracy of this method on various

Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or
monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of
pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to
leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and
compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions

""Are there repeated offenders?"", and ""How are new crowd management measures

transferring knowledge from the teacher to the student. The progressive
learning of knowledge distillation is a two-step approach that continuously
improves the performance of the student GAN and achieves better performance

crucial for a proper operation of these detectors, both in terms of energy

of the working configuration of the NTD thermistors. The presented procedures
were developed for CUORE, an array of 988 cryogenic macro-calorimeters
instrumented with NTD thermistors that has been taking data since 2017. These
procedures made it possible to characterize a large number of detectors in a
reliable way. They are suitable enough to be used also in other large arrays of
cryogenic detectors, such as CUPID.

fundamental challenges in stochastic computation. The recent surge of transport
maps offers a mathematical foundation and new insights for tackling this
challenge by coupling intractable random variables with tractable reference
random variables. This paper generalises the functional tensor-train
approximation of the inverse Rosenblatt transport recently developed by Dolgov
et al. (Stat Comput 30:603--625, 2020) to a wide class of high-dimensional
non-negative functions, such as unnormalised probability density functions.
First, we extend the inverse Rosenblatt transform to enable the transport to
general reference measures other than the uniform measure. We develop an
efficient procedure to compute this transport from a squared tensor-train
decomposition which preserves the monotonicity. More crucially, we integrate
the proposed order-preserving functional tensor-train transport into a nested
variable transformation framework inspired by the layered structure of deep
neural networks. The resulting deep inverse Rosenblatt transport significantly
expands the capability of tensor approximations and transport maps to random
variables with complicated nonlinear interactions and concentrated density
functions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach on a range of
applications in statistical learning and uncertainty quantification, including
parameter estimation for dynamical systems and inverse problems constrained by
partial differential equations.

material of the capillary, its walls behave like a plasma under the influence
of a high-intensity laser pulse. Therefore, the waveguide modes in the
capillaries have a universal structure, which depends only on the shape of the
cross-section. Due to the large ratio of the capillary radius to the laser
wavelength, the modes in circular capillaries differ from the classical TE and
TM modes. The attenuation length for such modes is two orders of magnitude
longer than that obtained from the classical formula, and the incident pulse of
the proper radius can transfer up to 98% of its initial energy to the
fundamental mode. However, finding eigenmodes in capillaries of arbitrary
cross-section is a complex mathematical problem that remains to be solved.

random forest, shallow learning and a flexible ANN model predict SARS-CoV-2

used to perform relative performance analysis among a group of comparable
decision making units (DMUs). Efficiency is assessed by comparing input and
output data for each DMU via linear programming. Traditionally in DEA, the data
are considered to be exact. However, in many real-world applications, it is
likely that the values for the input and output data used in the analysis are
imprecise. To account for this, we develop the uncertain DEA problem for the
case of box uncertainty. We introduce the notion of DEA distance to determine
the minimum amount of uncertainty required for a DMU to be deemed efficient.
For small problems, the minimum amount of uncertainty can be found exactly, for
larger problems this becomes computationally intensive. Therefore, we propose
an iterative method, where the amount of uncertainty is gradually increased.
This results in a robust DEA problem that can be solved efficiently. This study
of uncertainty is motivated by the inherently uncertain nature of the
radiotherapy treatment planning process in oncology. We apply the method to
evaluate the quality of a set of prostate cancer radiotherapy treatment plans
relative to each other.

investigated the correlations between the SNR and MCs at different velocities,
and found two velocity components, i.e. $\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$50 km
s$^{-1}$ velocity components, showing spatial correlations with the remnant.
However, no dynamical evidence of disturbance was found for the $\sim$5 km
s$^{-1}$ velocity component. At the distance of the $\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$
velocity component, either near or far distance, the derived physical
parameters are unreasonable too. We conclude that the SNR is not associated
with the $\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$ velocity component, and their spatial correlation
is just a chance correlation. For the $\sim$50 km s$^{-1}$ velocity component,
dynamical evidence of disturbances, as well as the spatial correlation,
indicate that it is associated with the SNR. We found that all the CO spectra
extracted from the molecular clumps distributed along the border of the remnant

functions. By further analysis, we suggest that the SNR is at a near kinematic

  perspective","25 pages, 9 figures, 1 Table",,,,"q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The contact structure of a population plays an important role in transmission
of infection. Many ``structured models'' capture aspects of the contact
structure through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important
observation in such models, is that once a fraction $1-1/\mathcal{R}_0$ has
been infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an
epidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold
can be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the
disease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunizing higher-risk
individuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited
``first wave'' may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a
second wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we systematically
analyse a number of mean-field models for networks and other structured
populations to address issues relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular,
we consider herd-immunity under several scenarios. We confirm that, in networks
with high degree heterogeneity, the first wave confers herd-immunity with
significantly fewer infections than equivalent models with lower degree
heterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the
contact network, then this effect might become more subtle. Indeed, modifying
the structure can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during
the first wave and make the second wave more substantial. We confirm this
finding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real
data and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of
the mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. We find that results
regarding herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the
duration of lockdown and how lockdown is implemented.

inverse cascades that develop when turbulence is randomly driven at sub-ion
scales. In the directions perpendicular to the ambient field, the dynamics of
the cascade turns out to be nonlocal and the ratio $\chi_f$ of the wave period
to the characteristic nonlinear time at the driving scale affect some of its
properties. For example, at small values of $\chi_f$, parametric decay
instability of the modes driven by the forcing can develop, enhancing for a
while inverse transfers. The balanced state, obtained at early time when the
two counter-propagating waves are equally driven, also becomes unstable at
small $\chi_f$, leading to an inverse cascade. For $\beta_e$ smaller than a few
units, the cascade slows down when reaching the low-dispersion spectral range.
For higher $\beta_e$, the ratio of the KAW to the Alfv\'en frequencies displays
a local minimum. At the corresponding transverse wavenumber, a condensate is
formed, and the cascade towards larger scales is then inhibited. Depending on
the parameters, a parallel inverse cascade can develop, enhancing the
elongation of the ion-scale magnetic vortices that generically form.

$x$ is odd. In an effort to understand its dynamics, and since Generalised
Collatz Maps are known to simulate Turing Machines [Conway, 1972], it seems
natural to ask what kinds of algorithmic behaviours it embeds. We define a
quasi-cellular automaton that exactly simulates the Collatz process on the
square grid: on input $x\in\mathbb{N}$, written horizontally in base 2,
successive rows give the Collatz sequence of $x$ in base 2. We show that
vertical columns simultaneously iterate the map in base 3. This leads to our
main result: the Collatz process embeds an algorithm that converts any natural
number from base 3 to base 2. We also find that the evolution of our automaton
computes the parity of the number of 1s in any ternary input. It follows that
predicting about half of the bits of the iterates $T^i(x)$, for $i = O(\log
x)$, is in the complexity class NC$^1$ but outside AC$^0$. Finally, we show
that in the extension of the Collatz process to numbers with infinite binary
expansions ($2$-adic integers) [Lagarias, 1985], our automaton encodes the
cyclic Collatz conjecture as a natural reachability problem. These results show
that the Collatz process is capable of some simple, but non-trivial,

  to insider threat detection at fine-grained level",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previous works on the CERT insider threat detection case have neglected graph
and text features despite their relevance to describe user behavior.
Additionally, existing systems heavily rely on feature engineering and audit
data aggregation to detect malicious activities. This is time consuming,
requires expert knowledge and prevents tracing back alerts to precise user
actions. To address these issues we introduce ADSAGE to detect anomalies in
audit log events modeled as graph edges. Our general method is the first to
perform anomaly detection at edge level while supporting both edge sequences
and attributes, which can be numeric, categorical or even text. We describe how
ADSAGE can be used for fine-grained, event level insider threat detection in
different audit logs from the CERT use case. Remarking that there is no
standard benchmark for the CERT problem, we use a previously proposed
evaluation setting based on realistic recall-based metrics. We evaluate ADSAGE
on authentication, email traffic and web browsing logs from the CERT insider
threat datasets, as well as on real-world authentication events. ADSAGE is
effective to detect anomalies in authentications, modeled as user to computer
interactions, and in email communications. Simple baselines give surprisingly
strong results as well. We also report performance split by malicious scenarios
present in the CERT datasets: interestingly, several detectors are
complementary and could be combined to improve detection. Overall, our results
show that graph features are informative to characterize malicious insider
activities, and that detection at fine-grained level is possible.

indicates its potential to generate useful patches. We implement our evaluation

of a sub-population of intrinsically multi-planet systems possessing large
mutual inclinations. However, the origin of these mutual inclinations remains
unknown. Recent work has demonstrated that mutual inclinations can be excited
soon after protoplanetary disk-dispersal due to the oblateness of the
rapidly-rotating host star, provided the star is tilted. Alternatively, distant
giant planets, which are common in systems of close-in Kepler planets, could
drive up mutual inclinations. The relative importance of each of these
mechanisms has not been investigated. Here, we show that the influence of the
stellar oblateness typically exceeds that of an exterior giant soon after
planet formation. However, the magnitude of the resulting mutual inclinations
depends critically upon the timescale over which the natal disk disperses.
Specifically, we find that if the disk vanishes over a timescale shorter than
10^(3-4) years, comparable to the viscous timescale of the inner ~0.2AU, the
inner planets impulsively acquire misalignments that scale with the stellar
obliquity. In contrast, if the disk disperses slowly, the inner planets remain
coplanar. They first align with the stellar equator but subsequently realign
with the distant giant's plane as the star spins down. Our findings are
consistent with recent observations that giants tend to be aligned with
close-in multis but misaligned with singles. Stellar obliquity measurements
offer a promising test of our proposed framework.

well-known that the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for an elliptic

associated elliptic measure belongs to the Muckenhoupt class $A_\infty$. In
turn, any of these conditions occurs if and only if the gradient of every
bounded null solution satisfies a Carleson measure estimate. This has been
recently extended to much rougher settings such as those of 1-sided chord-arc
domains, that is, sets which are quantitatively open and connected with a
boundary which is Ahlfors-David regular.
  In this paper, we work in the same environment and consider a qualitative
analog of the latter equivalence showing that one can characterize the absolute
continuity of the surface measure with respect to the elliptic measure in terms
of the finiteness almost everywhere of the truncated conical square function
for any bounded null solution. As a consequence of our main result
particularized to the Laplace operator and some previous results, we show that
the boundary of the domain is rectifiable if and only if the truncated conical
square function is finite almost everywhere for any bounded harmonic function.
Also, we obtain that for two given elliptic operators $L_1$ and $L_2$, the
absolute continuity of the surface measure with respect to the elliptic measure
of $L_1$ is equivalent to the same property for $L_2$ provided the disagreement
of the coefficients satisfy some quadratic estimate in truncated cones for
almost everywhere vertex. Finally for the case on which $L_2$ is either the
transpose of $L_1$ or its symmetric part we show the equivalence of the
corresponding absolute continuity upon assuming that the antisymmetric part of
the coefficients has some controlled oscillation in truncated cones for almost
every vertex.

large-scale face recognition, where one must contend with such overlaps, the

method based on extreme value theory. It is formulated as an
out-of-distribution detection algorithm, and greatly reduces the problems
caused by overlapping-identity label noise. Considering cluster assignments as
pseudo-labels, we must also overcome the labeling noise from clustering errors.

this paper proposes a novel approach that combines deep learning and robust

aim is to mitigate the computational burden of exact solvers, the proposed

enforced in two steps. First, during training, a Lagrangian dual method
penalizes violations of physical and operations constraints, which are

CCGA restores feasibility by finding the closest feasible solution to the

1915+105 obtained during a novel, highly obscured state. As the source entered
this state, a dense, massive accretion disk wind was detected through strong
absorption lines. Photionization modeling indicates that it must originate
close to the central engine, orders of magnitude from the outer accretion disk.
Strong, nearly sinusoidal flux variability in this phase yielded a key insight:
the wind is blue-shifted when its column density is relatively low, but
red-shifted as it approaches the Compton-thick threshold. At no point does the
wind appear to achieve the local escape velocity; in this sense, it is a
""failed wind."" Later observations suggest that the disk ultimately fails to
keep even the central engine clear of gas, leading to heavily obscured and
Compton-thick states characterized by very strong Fe K emission lines. Indeed,
these later spectra are successfully described using models developed for
obscured AGN. We discuss our results in terms the remarkable similarity of GRS
1915+105 deep in its ""obscured state"" to Seyfert-2 and Compton-thick AGN, and

suspensions of finite-size neutrally-buoyant spherical particles for solid
volume fractions up to 35% and bulk Reynolds numbers from 500 to 5600. An
Immersed Boundary-Volume of Fluid method is used to solve the energy equation
in the fluid and solid phase. We relate the heat transfer to the regimes of
particle motion previously identified, i.e. a viscous regime at low volume
fractions and low Reynolds number, particle-laden turbulence at high Reynolds
and moderate volume fraction and particulate regime at high volume fractions.
We show that in the viscous dominated regime, the heat transfer is mainly due
to thermal diffusion with enhancement due to the particle-induced fluctuations.
In the turbulent-like regime, we observe the largest enhancement of the global
heat transfer, dominated by the turbulent heat flux. In the particulate
shear-thickening regime, however, the heat transfer enhancement decreases as
mixing is quenched by the particle migration towards the channel core. As a
result, a compact loosely-packed core region forms and the contribution of
thermal diffusion to the total heat transfer becomes significant once again.
The global heat transfer becomes, in these flows at volume fractions larger
than 25%, lower than in single-phase turbulence.

given graph consisting of a set $F$ of facilities (each with a certain opening
cost), a set $C$ of potential clients, and weighted connections between them.
The online part of the input is a sequence of clients from $C$, and in response
to any requested client, an online algorithm may open an additional subset of
facilities and must connect the given client to an open facility.
  We give an online, polynomial-time deterministic algorithm for this problem,
with a competitive ratio of $O(\log |F| \cdot (\log |C| + \log \log |F|))$. The
result is optimal up to loglog factors. Our algorithm improves over the
$O((\log |C| + \log |F|) \cdot (\log |C| + \log \log |F|))$-competitive
construction that first reduces the facility location instance to a set cover
one and then later solves such instance using the deterministic algorithm by
Alon et al. [TALG 2006]. This is an asymptotic improvement in a typical
scenario where $|F| \ll |C|$.
  We achieve this by a more direct approach: we design an algorithm for a
fractional relaxation of the non-metric facility location problem with

nontrivial topological class due to the non-Hermiticity of its Hamiltonian.
While for Hermitian systems nontrivial topological quantum numbers are
reflected by the existence of edge states, a nonzero non-Hermitian winding
number impacts a system's bulk response. To establish this relation, we
introduce the bulk Green function, which describes the response of a gapped
system to an external perturbation on timescales where the induced excitations
have not propagated to the boundary yet, and show that it will grow in space if
the non-Hermitian winding number is nonzero. Such spatial growth explains why
the response of non-Hermitian systems on longer timescales, where excitations
have been reflected at the boundary repeatedly, may be highly sensitive to
boundary conditions. This exponential sensitivity to boundary conditions
explains the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian
systems: topological invariants computed for periodic boundary conditions no
longer predict the presence or absence of boundary states for open boundary
conditions.

well-behaved classes of formulas. We also provide a simple example where
speed-ups can be obtained in an algorithm-independent fashion, under certain

initiation and cause lack-of-fusion porosity to be the main source of crack
initiation. Most significantly, the scan strategies significantly affect grain
arrangements and grain dimensions, leading to noticeable effects on fatigue
crack propagation; in particular, the highest resistance crack propagation was
seen in the meander scan strategy with 0{\deg} rotation thanks to the most

of red giant stars (Brown et al. 1989, Kumar et al. 2011, Deepak et al. 2019,

evolution, which directly follows the red giant branch phase. Surprisingly we
find that all red clump stars have high levels of lithium for their
evolutionary stage. On average the lithium content increases by a factor of 40
after the end of the red giant branch stage. This suggests that all low-mass
stars undergo a lithium production phase between the tip of the red giant
branch and the red clump. We demonstrate that our finding is not predicted by
stellar theory, revealing a stark tension between observations and models. We
also show that the heavily studied (Brown et al. 1989, Reddy et al. 2005, Kumar

information from a compromised system when the access control policy of the
system does not allow doing so. Previous work has shown that CPU frequency
scaling can be used as a covert channel to transmit information between
otherwise isolated processes. Modern systems either try to save power or try to
operate near their power limits in order to maximize performance, so they
implement mechanisms to vary the frequency based on load. Existing covert
channels based on this approach are either easily thwarted by software
countermeasures or only work on completely idle systems. In this paper, we show
how the automatic frequency scaling provided by Intel Turbo Boost can be used
to construct a covert channel that is both hard to prevent without significant
performance impact and can tolerate significant background system load. As
Intel Turbo Boost selects the maximum CPU frequency based on the number of
active cores, our covert channel modulates information onto the maximum CPU
frequency by placing load on multiple additional CPU cores. Our prototype of
the covert channel achieves a throughput of up to 61 bit/s on an idle system
and up to 43 bit/s on a system with 25% utilization.

large fraction of old and/or dusty galaxy populations, while the southern one
is mainly composed of normal star-forming galaxies which are spatially
correlated with the LAEs. This agrees with our previous study arguing the
spatial offset of different galaxy overdensities may be due to halo assembly
bias. Given the large end-to-end sizes of the two overdensities, one
possibility is that they will form into a supercluster by the present day. We
also find strong evidence that the star-formation activities of the galaxies in

as a spatial discontinuity. The metasurface is described in terms of Lorentzian
electric and magnetic surface susceptibilities, $\chi_\text{e}$ and
$\chi_\text{m}$, respectively, with parameters (e.g. resonant frequency) that
are periodically modulated in both space and time. The unknown scattered fields
are expressed in terms of Floquet harmonics, for which the amplitudes can be
found by numerically solving a set of linear equations, leading to the total
scattered fields. Using existing computational techniques, the method is
validated using several examples of pure-space and pure-time modulation with
different modulation strengths and pumping frequencies. Finally, two cases of
spacetime modulation (standing wave perturbation and a traveling wave
perturbation) are presented to demonstrate the breaking of Lorentz reciprocity.
The proposed method is simple and versatile and able to determine the

end-to-end trainable. The differential discriminator guides to learn geometric
transformation from background images so that the composed 3D models can be

but limited range of values. This implies that there are nonlinear mechanisms
that prevent runaway solutions. The purpose of this paper is to propose
observable nonlinear mechanisms in the framework of the Babcock-Leighton-type
dynamo. Sunspot emergences show systematic properties that strong cycles tend
to have higher mean latitudes and lower tilt angle coefficients. We use the
surface flux transport model to investigate the effect of these systematic
properties on the expected final total dipolar moment, i.e. cancellation plus
generation of dipole moment by a whole solar cycle. We demonstrate that the
systematic change in latitude has similar nonlinear feedback on the solar cycle
(latitudinal quenching) as tilt does (tilt quenching). Both forms of quenching
lead to the expected final total dipolar moment being enhanced for weak cycles
and being saturated to a nearly constant value for normal and strong cycles.
This explains observed long-term solar cycle variability, e.g., the
Gnevyshev-Ohl rule, which, in turn, justifies the nonlinear mechanisms inherent
in the Babcock-Leighton-type dynamo.

of the simulator's outputs with respect to uncertain inputs and computational
parameters. These parameters are divided into two groups: based on the
variation of the first group, a computer experiment is designed, the data of
which may become uncertain due to the parameters of the second group. To
construct a surrogate model based on uncertain data, Gaussian process
regression (GPR) with observation-dependent (heteroscedastic) noise structure
is used. To estimate the propagated uncertainties in the simulator's outputs
from first and also the combination of first and second groups of parameters,
standard and probabilistic polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) are employed,
respectively. Global sensitivity analysis based on Sobol decomposition is
performed in connection with the computer experiment to rank the parameters
based on their influence on the simulator's output. To illustrate its
capabilities, the framework is applied to the scale-resolving simulations of
turbulent channel flow using the open-source CFD solver Nek5000. Due to the
high-order nature of Nek5000 a thorough assessment of the results' accuracy and
reliability is crucial, as the code is aimed at high-fidelity simulations. The

the domain of document image analysis. In this paper, we present a novel
approach towards document image binarization by introducing three-player
min-max adversarial game. We train the network in an unsupervised setup by
assuming that we do not have any paired-training data. In our approach, an
Adversarial Texture Augmentation Network (ATANet) first superimposes the
texture of a degraded reference image over a clean image. Later, the clean
image along with its generated degraded version constitute the pseudo
paired-data which is used to train the Unsupervised Document Binarization
Network (UDBNet). Following this approach, we have enlarged the document
binarization datasets as it generates multiple images having same content
feature but different textual feature. These generated noisy images are then
fed into the UDBNet to get back the clean version. The joint discriminator
which is the third-player of our three-player min-max adversarial game tries to
couple both the ATANet and UDBNet. The three-player min-max adversarial game
stops, when the distributions modelled by the ATANet and the UDBNet align to
the same joint distribution over time. Thus, the joint discriminator enforces
the UDBNet to perform better on real degraded image. The experimental results
indicate the superior performance of the proposed model over existing
state-of-the-art algorithm on widely used DIBCO datasets. The source code of
the proposed system is publicly available at

excitation spectrum, weakening the effects of exciton interactions. Here, we
demonstrate that two-photon excitation of Rydberg excitons under conditions of
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) can be used to control this
background. Based on a microscopic theory that describes the known
single-photon absorption spectrum, we analyze the conditions under which
two-photon EIT permits separating the optical Rydberg excitation from the

  Distillation","Accepted for WACV2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) seeks to alleviate the problem of domain
shift between the distribution of unlabeled data from the target domain w.r.t.
labeled data from the source domain. While the single-target UDA scenario is
well studied in the literature, Multi-Target Domain Adaptation (MTDA) remains
largely unexplored despite its practical importance, e.g., in multi-camera
video-surveillance applications. The MTDA problem can be addressed by adapting
one specialized model per target domain, although this solution is too costly
in many real-world applications. Blending multiple targets for MTDA has been
proposed, yet this solution may lead to a reduction in model specificity and
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised MTDA approach to train
a CNN that can generalize well across multiple target domains. Our
Multi-Teacher MTDA (MT-MTDA) method relies on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation (KD) to iteratively distill target domain knowledge from multiple
teachers to a common student. The KD process is performed in a progressive
manner, where the student is trained by each teacher on how to perform UDA for
a specific target, instead of directly learning domain adapted features.
Finally, instead of combining the knowledge from each teacher, MT-MTDA
alternates between teachers that distill knowledge, thereby preserving the
specificity of each target (teacher) when learning to adapt to the student.
MT-MTDA is compared against state-of-the-art methods on several challenging UDA
benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed model can provide a
considerably higher level of accuracy across multiple target domains. Our code

Gaussian and binary disorders as well as surface irregularities are
investigated thoroughly in a wide range of impurity concentrations and disorder
strengths. For dilute and weak point-like impurities the regimes of separated
and overlapped phonon levels are obtained and the behavior of the linewidth
predicted theoretically is confirmed, the crossover scale falls into the actual
range of several nanometers. These notions survive for strong dilute
impurities, as well. Regimes and crossovers predicted by theory are checked and
identified, and minor discrepancies are discussed. To mention a few of them:
slower than in theory increasing of the linewidth with the phonon quantum
number for weak disorder and only qualitative agreement between theory and
numerics for resonant broadening in strong dilute disorder. The novel phenomena
discovered numerically are: ""mesoscopic smearing"" of distribution function in
the ensemble of identical disordered particles, inflection of the linewidth
dependence on the impurity concentration for light ""dense"" binary impurities,
and position-dependent capability of strong impurity to catch the phonon. It is
shown that surface irregularities contribute to the phonon linewidth less than
the volume disorder, and their rate reveals faster decay with increasing of the
particle size. It is argued that the results of present research are applicable
also for quantum dots and short quantum wires.

transition to brittle fracture observed in hydrogen-rich environments. Large
crack tip stresses are predicted, which in turn raise the hydrogen
concentration and reduce the fracture energy. The computation of the steady

cleavage fracture can be predicted in otherwise ductile metals using sensible
values for the material parameters and the hydrogen concentration. In addition,
we compute crack growth resistance curves in a wide variety of scenarios and
demonstrate that the model can appropriately capture the sensitivity to: the
plastic length scales, the fracture length scale, the loading rate and the
hydrogen concentration. Model predictions are also compared with fracture
experiments on a modern ultra-high strength steel, AerMet100. A promising
agreement is observed with experimental measurements of threshold stress

enhancing the image quality. To this end, we initiate the very first attempt to
study this problem from the perspective of adversarial attack and propose the
adversarial denoise attack. More specifically, our main contributions are
three-fold: First, we identify a new task that stealthily embeds attacks inside
the image denoising module widely deployed in multimedia devices as an image
post-processing operation to simultaneously enhance the visual image quality
and fool DNNs. Second, we formulate this new task as a kernel prediction
problem for image filtering and propose the adversarial-denoising kernel
prediction that can produce adversarial-noiseless kernels for effective

adaptive perceptual region localization to identify semantic-related
vulnerability regions with which the attack can be more effective while not
doing too much harm to the denoising. We name the proposed method as Pasadena

State-of-the-art methods typically focus on the feature extraction step with
traditional or deep-learning-based techniques. In retrieval problems,
re-ranking is a commonly used technique to improve the results. Re-ranking
refines an initial ranking result by using the knowledge contained in the
ranked result, e. g., by exploiting nearest neighbor relations. To the best of
our knowledge, re-ranking has not been used for writer
identification/retrieval. A possible reason might be that publicly available
benchmark datasets contain only few samples per writer which makes a re-ranking
less promising. We show that a re-ranking step based on k-reciprocal nearest
neighbor relationships is advantageous for writer identification, even if only
a few samples per writer are available. We use these reciprocal relationships
in two ways: encode them into new vectors, as originally proposed, or integrate
them in terms of query-expansion. We show that both techniques outperform the
baseline results in terms of mAP on three writer identification datasets.

blocks are acoustic transducers, embedded in a slab waveguide. The transducers
generate a desired dispersion profile in closed-loop by processing real-time
pressure field measurements through preprogrammed controllers. In particular,
the metamaterial can be programmed to exhibit analogies of quantum topological
wave phenomena, which enables unconventional and exceptionally robust sound
beam guiding. As an example, we realize the quantum valley Hall effect by
creating, using a collocated pressure feedback, an alternating acoustic
impedance pattern across the waveguide. The pattern is traversed by artificial
trajectories of different shapes, which are reconfigurable in real-time. Due to
topological protection, the sound waves between the plates remain localized on
the trajectories, and do not back-scatter by the sharp corners or imperfections
in the design. The feedback-based design can be used to realize arbitrary
physical interactions in the metamaterial, including non-local, nonlinear,
time-dependent, or non-reciprocal couplings, paving the way to new
unconventional acoustic wave guiding on the same reprogrammable platform. We
then present a non-collocated control algorithm, which mimics another quantum
effect, rendering the sound beams uni-directional.

imaging, to visualize and quantify the water content in porous Al oxides as a
function of anodizing conditions. Water in these porous films is either
incorporated directly in the oxide structure (structural) and/or fills the
pores (morphological). This preliminary study demonstrates that the differences
in water content of porous anodic Al oxide layers are strongly related to the
oxide growth parameters but interestingly cannot be directly correlated to a
specific change in the amorphous oxide structure or in the pore morphology. Due
to the high sensitivity of high-resolution neutron imaging to small changes in
the water content, we furthermore show that the morphological water content in
Al oxides formed in sulfuric acid as well as in phosphoric acid is partially
reversible upon heat treatment and immersion. High-resolution neutron imaging
is also found to be highly sensitive to structural disorder and
crystallographic orientations, allowing to identify different crystalline Al
oxide samples based on their structural and morphological defect content. This
offers new perspectives to study the effect of the hydrogen and/or water
incorporation as well as oxide-related structural modifications on Al
oxihydroxides in relation to growth parameters, stability, functionalization as

compounds are energetically favored, dynamically and mechanically stable. It is
proposed that self-doping of these 3d transition metals occurs in MN4 due to
the reduction in electronegativity of N2 dimers. This model can well explain
the calculated integer magnetic moments, large spin gaps of MN4 and
semiconducting behavior for NiN4 as well. Our results highlight the difference
in electronegativity between transition metal ions and non-metal entities in

FEEL coordinates global model training at an edge server and local model
training at edge devices that are connected by wireless links. This work
contributes to the energy-efficient implementation of FEEL in wireless networks
by designing joint computation-and-communication resource management
($\text{C}^2$RM). The design targets the state-of-the-art heterogeneous mobile
architecture where parallel computing using both a CPU and a GPU, called
heterogeneous computing, can significantly improve both the performance and
energy efficiency. To minimize the sum energy consumption of devices, we
propose a novel $\text{C}^2$RM framework featuring multi-dimensional control
including bandwidth allocation, CPU-GPU workload partitioning and speed scaling
at each device, and $\text{C}^2$ time division for each link. The key component
of the framework is a set of equilibriums in energy rates with respect to
different control variables that are proved to exist among devices or between
processing units at each device. The results are applied to designing efficient
algorithms for computing the optimal $\text{C}^2$RM policies faster than the
standard optimization tools. Based on the equilibriums, we further design
energy-efficient schemes for device scheduling and greedy spectrum sharing that
scavenges ""spectrum holes"" resulting from heterogeneous $\text{C}^2$ time

demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{C}^2$RM on improving the energy

propagation loss in this portion of the spectrum calls for the deployment of
large antenna arrays to compensate for the loss through high directional gain,
thus introducing a spatial dimension in the channel model to accurately
represent the performance of a mmWave network. In this perspective, ray-tracing
can characterize the channel in terms of Multi Path Components (MPCs) to
provide a highly accurate model, at the price of extreme computational
complexity (e.g., for processing detailed environment information about the
propagation), which limits the scalability of the simulations. In this paper,
we present possible simplifications to improve the trade-off between accuracy
and complexity in ray-tracing simulations at mmWaves by reducing the total
number of MPCs. The effect of such simplifications is evaluated from a
full-stack perspective through end-to-end simulations, testing different
configuration parameters, propagation scenarios, and higher-layer protocol
implementations. We then provide guidelines on the optimal degree of
simplification, for which it is possible to reduce the complexity of
simulations with a minimal reduction in accuracy for different deployment

image segmentation tasks. However, convolutional neural networks, operating as
black-box systems, generally do not provide a reliable measure about the
confidence of their decisions. This leads to various problems in industrial
settings, amongst others, inadequate levels of trust from users in the model's
outputs as well as a non-compliance with current policy guidelines (e.g., EU AI
Strategy). To address these issues, we use uncertainty measures based on
Monte-Carlo dropout in the context of a human-in-the-loop system to increase
the system's transparency and performance. In particular, we demonstrate the
benefits described above on a real-world multi-class image segmentation task of
wear analysis in the machining industry. Following previous work, we show that
the quality of a prediction correlates with the model's uncertainty.
Additionally, we demonstrate that a multiple linear regression using the
model's uncertainties as independent variables significantly explains the
quality of a prediction (\(R^2=0.718\)). Within the uncertainty-based
human-in-the-loop system, the multiple regression aims at identifying failed
predictions on an image-level. The system utilizes a human expert to label
these failed predictions manually. A simulation study demonstrates that the
uncertainty-based human-in-the-loop system increases performance for different
levels of human involvement in comparison to a random-based human-in-the-loop
system. To ensure generalizability, we show that the presented approach

and performance platform achieving exceptional popularization and empowering
domains such as regular algebra, machine learning, image detection and
self-driving cars. However, irregular applications struggle to fully realize
GPGPU performance as a result of control flow divergence and memory divergence
due to irregular memory access patterns.
  To ameliorate these issues, programmers are obligated to carefully consider
architecture features and devote significant efforts to modify the algorithms
with complex optimization techniques, which shift programmers priorities yet
struggle to quell the shortcomings. We show that in graph-based GPGPU irregular
applications these inefficiencies prevail, yet we find that it is possible to
relax the strict relationship between thread and data processed to empower new
optimizations.
  Based on this key idea, we propose the Irregular accesses Reorder Unit (IRU),
a novel hardware extension tightly integrated in the GPGPU pipeline. The IRU
reorders data processed by the threads on irregular accesses which
significantly improves memory coalescing, and allows increased performance and
energy efficiency. Additionally, the IRU is capable of filtering and merging
duplicated irregular access which further improves graph-based irregular
applications. Programmers can easily utilize the IRU with a simple API, or
compiler optimized generated code with the extended ISA instructions provided.
  We evaluate our proposal for state-of-the-art graph-based algorithms and a
wide selection of applications. Results show that the IRU achieves a memory
coalescing improvement of 1.32x and a 46% reduction in the overall traffic in

infinite horizon. By penalising violation probabilities close to the initial
time and assigning violation probabilities in the far future with vanishingly
small weights, this form of constraints allows for an MPC law with guarantees
of recursive feasibility without a boundedness assumption on the disturbance. A
computationally convenient MPC optimisation problem is formulated using
Chebyshev's inequality and we introduce an online constraint-tightening

to satisfy the chance constraint and a quadratic stability condition. With
dynamic feedback gain selection, the closed loop cost is reduced and
conservativeness of Chebyshev's inequality is mitigated. Also, a larger

diagrams that describe how the system should behave. According to researchers,
it is not clear what a state actually represents regarding the system to be
modeled. Standards do not provide adequate definitions of or sufficient
guidance on the use of states. Studies show these inconsistencies can lead to
poor or incomplete specifications, which in turn could result in project delays
or increase the cost of the system design. This paper aims to establish a
precise definition of the notion of states and state machines, a goal motivated
by system modelers (e.g., requirement engineers) need to understand key
concepts and vocabulary such as states and state machine, which are major
behavioral modeling tools (e.g., in UML). State is the main notion of a state
machine in which events drive state changes. This raises questions about the
nature of these state-related notations. The semantics of these concepts is
based on a new modeling methodology called the thinging machine applied to a
number of examples of existing models. The thinging machine semantics is
founded on five elementary actions that divide the static model into
changes/states upon which events are defined.

dimensional representations that capture intrinsic geometry in data, especially
for faithfully visualizing data in two or three dimensions. Common approaches
to this task use kernel methods for manifold learning. However, these methods
typically only provide an embedding of fixed input data and cannot extend to
new data points. Autoencoders have also recently become popular for
representation learning. But while they naturally compute feature extractors
that are both extendable to new data and invertible (i.e., reconstructing
original features from latent representation), they have limited capabilities
to follow global intrinsic geometry compared to kernel-based manifold learning.
We present a new method for integrating both approaches by incorporating a
geometric regularization term in the bottleneck of the autoencoder. Our
regularization, based on the diffusion potential distances from the
recently-proposed PHATE visualization method, encourages the learned latent
representation to follow intrinsic data geometry, similar to manifold learning
algorithms, while still enabling faithful extension to new data and
reconstruction of data in the original feature space from latent coordinates.
We compare our approach with leading kernel methods and autoencoder models for
manifold learning to provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of our
advantages in preserving intrinsic structure, out of sample extension, and
reconstruction. Our method is easily implemented for big-data applications,
whereas other methods are limited in this regard.

drive velocity-space instabilties, turbulence and wave-particle interactions,
and, possibly, collisions. Here we address the respective role played by the
solar wind expansion and the electron firehose instability, developing in the
presence of multiple electron populations, in regulating the heat flux. We
carry out fully kinetic, Expanding Box Model simulations and separately analyze
the enthalpy, bulk and velocity distribution function skewness contributions
for each of the electron species. We observe that the key factor determining
electron energy flux evolution is the reduction of the drift velocity of the
electron populations in the rest frame of the solar wind. In our simulations,
redistribution of the electron thermal energy from the parallel to the
perpendicular direction after the onset of the electron firehose instability is
observed. However, this process seems to impact energy flux evolution only
minimally. Hence, reduction of the electron species drift velocity in the solar

the precision of prediction of source terms on mesh interface. The capability

the performance that is achievable with some given amount of resources? More
specifically, if each node in the network has information about only its
$1$-hop neighborhood, then what are the limits to performance? This problem is
considered for wireless networks where each communication link has a minimum
bandwidth quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Links in the same vicinity
contend for the shared wireless medium. The conflict graph captures which pairs
of links interfere with each other and depends on the MAC protocol. In IEEE
802.11 MAC protocol-based networks, when communication between nodes $i$ and
$j$ takes place, the neighbors of both $i$ and $j$ remain silent. This model of
interference is called the $2$-hop interference model because the distance in
the network graph between any two links that can be simultaneously active is at
least $2$. In the admission control problem, the objective is to determine,
using only localized information, whether a given set of flow rates is
feasible.
  In the present work, a distributed algorithm is proposed for this problem,
where each node has information only about its $1$-hop neighborhood. The
worst-case performance of the distributed algorithm, i.e. the largest factor by
which the performance of this distributed algorithm is away from that of an
optimal, centralized algorithm, is analyzed. Lower and upper bounds on the
suboptimality of the distributed algorithm are obtained, and both bounds are
shown to be tight. The exact worst-case performance is obtained for some ring
topologies. While distance-$d$ distributed algorithms have been analyzed for
the $1$-hop interference model, an open problem in the literature is to extend
these results to the $K$-hop interference model, and the present work initiates
the generalization to the $K$-hop interference model.

efficiency and feed digestibility during the on-growing of gilthead sea bream
fed high or low fishmeal and fish oil dietary level were observed. Pepsin
activity showed an apparent decrease in fish receiving more than one meal a day
which was not compensated by an increased production of alkaline proteases
particularly in fish fed on low FM. Although there were no effects on growth
and feed utilisation at increasing feeding frequency, trypsin decreased
significantly with an increasing number of meals only under low FMFO diet.
Thus, it seemed that consecutive meals could have amplified the potential
trypsin inhibitor effect of the vegetable meal-based diet adopted. Results of
the plasma parameters related to nutritional and physiological conditions were
not affected by feeding frequency. The higher level of plasma creatinine
detected in fish fed a single daily meal with high FMFO level seems to be
within physiological values in relation to the higher protein efficiency
observed with this diet. According to the results, gilthead sea bream seems
able to maximise feed utilisation regardless of the number of meals, and this

should be both temporally and content-wise aligned with visual signals. This
task is extremely challenging because some sounds generated \emph{outside} a
camera can not be inferred from video content. The model may be forced to learn
an incorrect mapping between visual content and these irrelevant sounds. To
address this challenge, we propose a framework named REGNET. In this framework,
we first extract appearance and motion features from video frames to better
distinguish the object that emits sound from complex background information. We
then introduce an innovative audio forwarding regularizer that directly
considers the real sound as input and outputs bottlenecked sound features.
Using both visual and bottlenecked sound features for sound prediction during
training provides stronger supervision for the sound prediction. The audio
forwarding regularizer can control the irrelevant sound component and thus
prevent the model from learning an incorrect mapping between video frames and
sound emitted by the object that is out of the screen. During testing, the
audio forwarding regularizer is removed to ensure that REGNET can produce
purely aligned sound only from visual features. Extensive evaluations based on
Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrate that our method significantly improves both
temporal and content-wise alignment. Remarkably, our generated sound can fool
the human with a 68.12% success rate. Code and pre-trained models are publicly

identically zero but includes small values for the density, radial pressure and
tangential pressure. Higher precision experiments should be able to determine
the validity of these models. These results add further confirmation that the
theory developed by Pandres is the fundamental theory of physics.

  Optimization","42 pages, 18 figures",,,"Report-no: 2013/01","cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We propose the cone epsilon-dominance approach to improve convergence and
diversity in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). A cone-eps-MOEA is
presented and compared with MOEAs based on the standard Pareto relation
(NSGA-II, NSGA-II*, SPEA2, and a clustered NSGA-II) and on the
epsilon-dominance (eps-MOEA). The comparison is performed both in terms of
computational complexity and on four performance indicators selected to
quantify the quality of the final results obtained by each algorithm: the
convergence, diversity, hypervolume, and coverage of many sets metrics. Sixteen
well-known benchmark problems are considered in the experimental section,
including the ZDT and the DTLZ families. To evaluate the possible differences
amongst the algorithms, a carefully designed experiment is performed for the
four performance metrics. The results obtained suggest that the cone-eps-MOEA
is capable of presenting an efficient and balanced performance over all the
performance metrics considered. These results strongly support the conclusion
that the cone-eps-MOEA is a competitive approach for obtaining an efficient
balance between convergence and diversity to the Pareto front, and as such
represents a useful tool for the solution of multiobjective optimization
problems.

scientists are trying to solve this problem. In this regard, in a recent work
[8], a difference equation has been proposed that calculates the nth

estimation by calculating Lyapunov numbers for this non-linear map in order to
seek the best value for the bifurcation parameter. Analytical results are
presented.

materials in many implementations. Therefore the choice of optimization method
is of considerable significance to easily solve the problems. In this work, the
ground state geometries for bisphenol A and phosgene that manufacture
polycarbonate have been optimized using the Hartree-Fock method with different
basis sets. The optimization results for bisphenol A and phosgene are compared
with theoretical and experimental data. The obtained optimizations results have
been shown that our data are in agreement with the literature and experimental
data.
