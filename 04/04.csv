axion-like particles (ALPs) in a strong magnetic field. We show that by
modulating the polarization of the light passing through a Fabry-Perot cavity
so that it effectively precesses at the modulation frequency, a signal is
produced that is proportional to the square as opposed to the fourth power of
the ALP-photon coupling constant. Assuming shot noise to be the dominant source
of noise, we estimate that this approach is sensitive ALP masses less than
$10^{-4} eV$ and couplings on the order to $g_{a\gamma}\sim 1.6\times 10^{-11}
\text{GeV}^{-1}$ with a 10m, 10 T magnet, and $g_{a\gamma}\sim 1.6\times
10^{-12} \text{GeV}^{-1}$ with a 100 m magnet as envisaged by ALPs-IIc. ALPs
with these properties have been invoked to explain the apparent transparency of
the extragalactic background light (EBL) to ultra high-energy gamma rays
emitted by BLAZARs.

global and local augmentation techniques, where global augmentation techniques
are applied to the entire point cloud of a scene and local augmentation
techniques are only applied to points belonging to individual objects in the
scene. Our findings show that both types of data augmentation can lead to
performance increases, but it also turns out, that some augmentation
techniques, such as individual object translation, for example, can be
counterproductive and can hurt the overall performance. We show that these
findings transfer and generalize well to other state of the art 3D Object

factors in next-basket generation process: 1) users' general preferences, 2)
items' global popularities and 3) transition patterns among items. Unlike
existing recurrent neural network-based approaches, M2 does not use the
complicated networks to model the transitions among items, or generate
embeddings for users. Instead, it has a simple encoder-decoder based approach
(ed-Trans) to better model the transition patterns among items. We compared M2
with different combinations of the factors with 5 state-of-the-art next-basket
recommendation methods on 4 public benchmark datasets in recommending the
first, second and third next basket. Our experimental results demonstrate that
M2 significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all the datasets
in all the tasks, with an improvement of up to 22.1%. In addition, our ablation
study demonstrates that the ed-Trans is more effective than recurrent neural
networks in terms of the recommendation performance. We also have a thorough

various downstream tasks and in cognitive modeling, we need to analyze the

learned by a sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder model in six typologically
diverse languages. We first show that these AWEs preserve some information
about words' absolute duration and speaker. At the same time, the
representation space of these AWEs is organized such that the distance between
words' embeddings increases with those words' phonetic dissimilarity. Finally,
the AWEs exhibit a word onset bias, similar to patterns reported in various

promising result and encourage further evaluation of AWEs as a potentially
useful tool in cognitive science, which could provide a link between speech

Intuitively speaking, although formal details are different, CPL can express

artificial intelligence community. We also consider a way of making precise the
notion of lifted Bayesian network, where this notion is a type of (lifted)
probabilistic graphical model used in machine learning, data mining and
artificial intelligence. A lifted Bayesian network (in the sense defined here)
determines, in a natural way, a probability distribution on the set of all
structures (in the sense of first-order logic) with a common finite domain $D$.
Our main result is that for every ""noncritical"" CPL-formula $\varphi(\bar{x})$
there is a quantifier-free formula $\varphi^*(\bar{x})$ which is ""almost
surely"" equivalent to $\varphi(\bar{x})$ as the cardinality of $D$ tends
towards infinity. This is relevant for the problem of making probabilistic
inferences on large domains $D$, because (a) the problem of evaluating, by
""brute force"", the probability of $\varphi(\bar{x})$ being true for some
sequence $\bar{d}$ of elements from $D$ has, in general, (highly) exponential
time complexity in the cardinality of $D$, and (b) the corresponding
probability for the quantifier-free $\varphi^*(\bar{x})$ depends only on the
lifted Bayesian network and not on $D$. The main result has two corollaries,
one of which is a convergence law (and zero-one law) for noncritial

re-scaling of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha \to \alpha/(D-4)$ in
the limit $D\to 4$. This theory also has been reformulated to a specific class
of the Horndeski theory with an additional scalar degree of freedom and to a
spatial covariant version with a Lagrangian multiplier that can eliminate the
scalar mode. Here we study the physical properties of the electromagnetic
radiation emitted from a thin accretion disk around the static spherically
symmetric black hole in the 4EGB gravity. For this purpose, we assume the disk
is in a steady-state and in hydrodynamic and thermodynamic equilibrium so that
the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a black body spectrum. We study in
detail the effects of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ in 4EGB
gravity on the energy flux, temperature distribution, and electromagnetic
spectrum of the disk. It is shown that with the increases of the parameter
$\alpha$, the energy flux, temperature distribution, and electromagnetic
spectrum of the accretion disk all increase. Besides, we also show that the
accretion efficiency increases as the growth of the parameter $\alpha$. Our
results indicate that the thin accretion disk around the static spherically
symmetric black hole in the 4EGB gravity is hotter, more luminosity, and more
efficient than that around a Schwarzschild black hole with the same mass for a
positive $\alpha$, while it is cooler, less luminosity, and less efficient for
a negative $\alpha$.

precise asymptotics in the full forward causal cone imply in particular that
$\phi(t,x)=c t^{-3}+\mathcal O(t^{-4+})$ for bounded $|x|$, where $c\in\mathbb

Kerr spacetimes and thus renders a result by Luk-Sbierski on the linear scalar
instability of the Cauchy horizon unconditional. We moreover prove inverse
quadratic decay of the radiation field, with explicit leading order term. We
establish analogous results for scattering by stationary potentials with
inverse cubic spatial decay. On the Schwarzschild spacetime, we prove pointwise
$t^{-2 l-3}$ decay for waves with angular frequency at least $l$, and $t^{-2

settles Price's law for linear scalar waves in full generality.

that must be relaxed for upcoming experiments are the reduced shear

this involves the calculation of the convergence bispectrum; typically subject
to the Limber approximation. In this work, we compute the post-Limber

from the difference between the post-Limber and Limber approximated forms of
the corrections. These further demonstrate that the reduced shear and

compute a sketch (data structure) of size poly$(\log(n), 1/\varepsilon)$. Given
the sketch and a query item $y \in \mathcal{U}$, one should be able to
approximate its rank in the stream, i.e., the number of stream elements smaller

  Most works to date focused on additive $\varepsilon n$ error approximation,
culminating in the KLL sketch that achieved optimal asymptotic behavior. This
paper investigates multiplicative $(1\pm\varepsilon)$-error approximations to

storing $O(\log^{1.5}(\varepsilon n)/\varepsilon)$ items, which is within an

field by parametric resonance in the presence of a cold axion background, for
modes with a frequency close to half the axion mass. In this paper, we study
the role of the axion momentum dispersion as well as the effects of a
background gravitational potential, which can detune the resonance due to
gravitational redshift. We show, by analytical as well as numerical
calculations, that the resonance leads to an exponential growth of the photon
field only if (a) the axion momentum spread is smaller than the inverse
resonance length, and (b) the gravitational detuning distance is longer than
the resonance length. For realistic parameter values, both effects strongly
suppress the resonance and prevent the exponential growth of the photon field.
In particular, the redshift due to the gravitational potential of our galaxy
prevents the resonance from developing for photons in the observable frequency
range, even assuming that all the dark matter consists of a perfectly cold
axion condensate. For axion clumps with masses below $\sim 10^{-13}\, M_\odot$,
the momentum spread condition is more restrictive, whereas, for more massive
clumps, the redshift condition dominates.

models in various ways. However, the more complex the model is, the harder it
is to interpret. In the paper, we describe the algorithm for the mathematical
equations discovery from the given observations data. The algorithm combines
genetic programming with the sparse regression.
  This algorithm allows obtaining different forms of the resulting models. As
an example, it could be used for governing analytical equation discovery as
well as for partial differential equations (PDE) discovery.
  The main idea is to collect a bag of the building blocks (it may be simple
functions or their derivatives of arbitrary order) and consequently take them
from the bag to create combinations, which will represent terms of the final
equation. The selected terms pass to the evolutionary algorithm, which is used
to evolve the selection. The evolutionary steps are combined with the sparse
regression to pick only the significant terms. As a result, we obtain a short
and interpretable expression that describes the physical process that lies
beyond the data.
  In the paper, two examples of the algorithm application are described: the
PDE discovery for the metocean processes and the function discovery for the
acoustics.

We show that such a functor sends split monomorphisms to isomorphisms, in
particular we show that it is not necessarily an equivalence of categories. On
the other hand, we show that the fundamental category of the realisation of the
simplicial circle is equivalent to the monoid of the natural numbers. To
conclude, we define left covers of locally stratified spaces and we show that,

Lubensky (2014, Nat. Phys. 10, 39-45) challenged the standard effective medium
theories used in the modeling of many truss-based materials and metamaterials.
As a matter of fact, these exhibit Parity (P) asymmetric distributions of zero
modes that induce a P-asymmetric elastic behavior, both of which cannot be
reproduced within Cauchy elasticity. Here, we propose a new effective medium
theory baptized ""microtwist elasticity"" capable of rendering polarization
effects on a macroscopic scale. The theory is valid for trusses on the brink of
a polarized-unpolarized phase transition in which case they necessarily exhibit
more periodic zero modes than they have dimensions. By mapping each periodic
zero mode to a macroscopic degree of freedom, the microtwist theory ends up
being a kinematically enriched theory. Microtwist elasticity is constructed
thanks to leading order two-scale asymptotics and its constitutive and balance
equations are derived for a fairly generic isostatic truss: the Kagome lattice.
Various numerical and analytical calculations, of the shape and distribution of
zero modes, of dispersion diagrams and of polarization effects, systematically
show the quality of the proposed effective medium theory. Most notably, the
theory is capable of producing a continuum version of Kane and Lubensky's
topological polarization vector.

constant. To improve the accuracy, one should measure the phase of an atomic
interferometer at extreme values of atomic vertical velocities and coordinates.
Owing to symmetry, the horizontal components of atomic velocities and
coordinates are also extreme. We propose using a source mass consisting of 3 or
more parts, since only in this case one can find such an arrangement of parts
that all atomic variables become extreme. Nonlinear dependences of the phase on
the uncertainties of atomic positions and velocities near those extreme values
required us to modify the expression for the phase relative standard deviation
(RSD). Moreover, taking into account nonlinear terms in the phase dependence on
the atomic coordinates and velocities leads to a phase shift. In the last
experiment to measure the Newtonian gravitational constant by atomic
interferometry, this shift was not included. We took the shift into account,
got a value of 199ppm for it, and this leads to a decrease in the value of the
Newton constant by 0.02%. In addition, we showed that at equal sizes of the
atomic cloud in the vertical and horizontal directions, as well as at equal
atomic vertical and transverse temperatures, systematic errors due to the
finite size and temperature of the cloud disappear. The calculation also showed
that when using the 13-ton source mass proposed recently, the measurement
accuracy can reach 17ppm for a source mass consisting of 4 quarters. We assumed
that the source mass consisting of a set of cylinders is used for measurements.
We have obtained a new analytical expression for the gravitational field of a
homogeneous cylinder.

$\mathrm{SU}(N)$ with $N>2$ is promising for finding nontrivial quantum spin
liquids, but the realization of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ spin systems in real materials
is still challenging. Although there is a proposal in cold atomic systems, in
magnetic materials with a spin-orbital degree of freedom it is difficult to
achieve the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ symmetry by fine tuning. Here we propose a new
mechanism by which the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ symmetry emerges in the strong
spin-orbit coupling limit. In $d^1$ transition metal compounds with
edge-sharing anion octahedra, the spin-orbit coupling gives rise to strongly
bond-dependent and apparently $\mathrm{SU}(4)$-breaking hopping between the
$J_\textrm{eff}=3/2$ quartets. However, in the honeycomb structure, a gauge
transformation maps the system to an $\mathrm{SU}(4)$-symmetric Hubbard model,
which means that the system has a hidden symmetry in spite of its large
spin-orbit coupling. In the strong repulsion limit at quarter filling, as
expected in $\alpha$-ZrCl$_3,$ the low-energy effective model is the
$\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, which cannot have a
trivial gapped ground state and is expected to host a gapless spin-orbital
liquid. In such quantum spin-orbital liquids, both the spin and orbital degrees
of freedom become fractionalized and correlated together at low temperature due
to the strong frustrated interactions between them. Similarly to spinons in
pure quantum spin liquids, quantum spin-orbital liquids can host not only
spinon excitations, but also fermionic ""orbitalon"" excitations at low
temperature, which we have named here in distinction from orbitons in the
symmetry-broken Jahn-Teller phases.

For our analysis we combine CO(2-1) data from the 7m antennae of the Atacama
Compact Array (ACA), and the ACA total power array (TP). We demonstrate, using
the 7m array data, that we can recover the total flux inferred from IRAM 30m
single dish observations, which corresponds to a total molecular mass of about
4x10^7 Msun. Most of the recovered flux is blueshifted with respect to the
galaxy rest frame and is extended on kpc-scales, suggesting low filling factor
dispersed clouds. We find 8 concentrations of molecular gas out to a radius of
10 arcsec (1.5 kpc), which we identify with giant molecular clouds. The total
molecular gas mass is more centrally concentrated than the X-ray emitting gas,
but extended in the north-east/south-west direction beyond the IRAM 30m beam.
We also compare the spatial extent of the molecular gas to the Halpha emission:
The CO emission coincides with the very bright Halpha region in the center. We
do not detect CO emission in the fainter Halpha regions. Furthermore, we find
two CO absorption features spatially located at the center of the galaxy,
within 5 pc projected distance of the AGN, infalling at 255 and 265 km/s
relative to the AGN. This indicates that the two giant molecular clouds seen in
absorption are most likely within the sphere of influence of the supermassive
black hole.

X-ray-selected cluster samples. We use the offsets to classify the dynamical
state of the clusters, selecting the 43 most disturbed clusters, with half of
those at $z \gtrsim 0.5$, a region seldom explored previously. We find that
Schechter function fits to the galaxy population in disturbed clusters and
relaxed clusters differ at $z>0.55$ but not at lower redshifts. Disturbed
clusters at $z>0.55$ have steeper faint-end slopes and brighter characteristic
magnitudes. Within the same redshift range, we find that the BCGs in relaxed
clusters tend to be brighter than the BCGs in disturbed samples, while in
agreement in the lower redshift bin. Possible explanations includes a higher
merger rate, and a more efficient dynamical friction at high redshift. The

partition function of AdS3 gravity, both in the metric and Chern-Simons
formulations. The one-loop partition function around Euclidean AdS3 turns out
to be given by the vacuum character of Virasoro group. This stems from the work
of Brown and Henneaux (BH) who showed that, in AdS3 gravity with sensible
asymptotic boundary conditions, an infinite group of (improper) diffeomorphisms
arises which acts canonically on phase space as two independent Virasoro
symmetries. The gauge group turns out to be composed of so-called ``proper''
diffeomorphisms which approach the identity at infinity fast enough. However,
it is sometimes far from evident to identify where BH boundary conditions enter
in the path integral, and much more difficult to see how the improper
diffeomorphisms are left out of the gauge group. In particular, in the metric
formulation, Giombi, Maloney and Yin obtained the one-loop partition function
around thermal AdS3 resorting to the heat kernel method to compute the
determinants coming from the path integral. Here we identify how BH boundary
conditions follow naturally from the usual requirement of square-integrability
of the metric perturbations. Also, and equally relevant, we clarify how the
quotient by only proper diffeomorphisms is implemented, promoting the improper
diffeomorphisms to symmetries in the path integral. Our strategy is general
enough to apply to other approaches where square integrability is assumed.
Finally, we show that square integrability implies that the asymptotic
symmetries in higher dimensional AdS gravity are just isometries.

count per cluster by up to an order of magnitude. This will further refine our
view of clusters, leading to a more accurate and precise mapping of the total
and dark matter distribution in clusters, and enabling a better understanding
of background galaxy population and their luminosity functions. However, to
effectively use that many images as input to lens inversion will require a
re-evaluation of, and possibly upgrades to the existing methods. In this paper
we scrutinize the performance of the free-form lens inversion method Grale in
the regime of $150-1000$ input images, using synthetic massive galaxy clusters.
Our results show that with an increasing number of input images, Grale produces
improved reconstructed mass distributions, with the fraction of the lens plane
recovered at better than $10\%$ accuracy increasing from $40-50\%$ for
$\sim\!\!150$ images to $65\%$ for $\sim\!1000$ images. The reconstructed time
delays imply a more precise measurement of $H_0$, with $\lesssim 1\%$ bias.
While the fidelity of the reconstruction improves with the increasing number of
multiple images used as model constraints, $\sim 150$ to $\sim 1000$, the lens
plane rms deteriorates from $\sim 0.11''$ to $\sim 0.28''$. Since lens plane
rms is not necessarily the best indicator of the quality of the mass

quantitative agreement with angle-resolved photoemission. Below $p^*$ -- within
the pseudogap phase -- the ADMR is qualitatively different, revealing a clear
transformation of the Fermi surface. Changes in the quasiparticle lifetime
across $p^*$ are ruled out as the cause of this transformation. Instead we find
that our data are most consistent with a reconstruction of the Fermi surface by

when one of the hypotheses is composite, there is an inherent difficulty in
defining an optimality criterion that is both informative and well-justified.
For testing in the simple normal location problem (that is, testing for the
mean of multivariate Gaussians), we overcome the difficulty as follows. In this
problem there exists a natural hardness order between parameters as for
different parameters the error-probailities curves (when the parameter is
known) are either identical, or one dominates the other. We can thus define
minimax performance as the worst-case among parameters which are below some
hardness level. Fortunately, there exists a universal minimax test, in the
sense that it is minimax for all hardness levels simultaneously. Under this
criterion we also find the optimal test for composite hypothesis testing with
training data. This criterion extends to the wide class of local asymptotic
normal models, in an asymptotic sense where the approximation of the error
probabilities is additive. Since we have the asymptotically optimal tests for
composite hypothesis testing with and without training data, we quantify the
loss of universality and gain of training data for these models.

consistent with previous observations, the magnitude of the coefficient

between accretion states. We find that at 20 $\mu$as resolution, $|\beta_2|$ is
greater than 0.2 only for models of disks with horizon-scale magnetic pressures

two-stage power law in the mass function (MF) slope is observed in the cluster
NGC 381, however, we observe only a single MF slope in the clusters NGC 2360

slopes separately in the inner and the outer regions of these clusters and
notice a steeper slope in outer region. The dynamic study of these clusters
reveals deficiency of low-mass stars in their inner regions suggesting the mass

context of confirmatory clinical trials is to control the familywise error rate
(FWER), which bounds the probability of making at least one false rejection. In
many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical
structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different
clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al. (2009) is a
flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting
complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER
can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and
may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates
controlling generalised error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses
tested is no longer small. We consider the generalised familywise error rate
(k-FWER), which is the probability of making k or more false rejections, as
well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is
the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some
threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate
(FDR), which is the expectation of the FDP. In this paper, we show how to
control these generalised error rates when using the graphical approach and its
extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on
three clinical trial case studies.

different multicast groups are interested along with their private multicast

disseminate multicast content to the users experiencing high path loss and/or

SC and CC, respectively, to transmit the common and private multicast messages.
In order to maximize max-min fair (MMF) rates, we design a novel low-complexity

also propose rate-splitting (RS) alternatives of SC and CC schemes together

with a correlation length comparable to the linear size of high-density phase
domain (i.e., cluster of the particles). The strongly correlated multi-cellular

We show that even if the initial seller is an informational monopolist, she

0 as soon as a single buyer has bought information. By contrast, if the seller

spectral solar irradiance through a series of small-scale dynamo simulations
with zero vertical flux imbalance ($\langle B_z\rangle=0$) and varying levels
of small-scale magnetic field strength, and one weak network case with an
additional flux imbalance corresponding to a flux density of $\langle
B_z\rangle=100$ G. From these setups we compute the dependence of the outgoing
radiative energy flux on the mean vertical magnetic field strength in the
photosphere at continuum optical depth $\tau=1$ ($\langle \vert

field strength of $\langle \vert B_z\vert\rangle_{\tau=1}=69$ G is about
$0.6~\%$ brighter than a non-magnetic reference case. We find a linear
dependence of the outgoing radiative energy flux on the mean field strength
$\langle \vert B_z\vert\rangle_{\tau=1}$ with a relative slope of $1.4\cdot

strong indirect constraints on possible quiet Sun variations during a regular

control: a stochastic control framework for Markovian models. The motivation is
distributed control of large networks. As in prior work, the objective function
is composed of a state cost in the form of Kullback-Leibler divergence plus a
quadratic control cost. With this choice of objective function, the optimal
probability distribution of a population of agents over a finite time horizon
is shown to be an exponential tilting of the nominal probability distribution.
The same is true for the controlled transition matrices that induce the optimal
probability distribution. However, one limitation of the previous work is that
randomness can only be introduced via the control policy; all uncontrolled
(natural) processes must be modeled as deterministic to render them immutable
under an exponential tilting. In this work, only the controlled dynamics are
subject to tilting, allowing for more general probabilistic models.
  Another advancement is a reduction in complexity based on lossy compression
using transform techniques. This is motivated by the need to consider time
horizons that are much longer than the inter-sampling times required for
reliable control. Numerical experiments are performed in a power network
setting. The results show that the KLQ method enables the aggregate power
consumption of a collection of flexible loads to track a time-varying reference
signal, while simultaneously ensuring each individual load satisfies its own
quality of service constraints.

For large-scale point cloud segmentation, the \textit{de facto} method is to

discover that the feature distribution of LiDAR images changes drastically at

protected by TRR, RowHammer is no longer an issue in practice. However, in
reality, very little is known about TRR. In this paper, we demystify the inner
workings of TRR and debunk its security guarantees. We show that what is
advertised as a single mitigation mechanism is actually a series of different
solutions coalesced under the umbrella term TRR. We inspect and disclose, via a
deep analysis, different existing TRR solutions and demonstrate that modern
implementations operate entirely inside DRAM chips. Despite the difficulties of
analyzing in-DRAM mitigations, we describe novel techniques for gaining
insights into the operation of these mitigation mechanisms. These insights
allow us to build TRRespass, a scalable black-box RowHammer fuzzer. TRRespass
shows that even the latest generation DDR4 chips with in-DRAM TRR, immune to
all known RowHammer attacks, are often still vulnerable to new TRR-aware
variants of RowHammer that we develop. In particular, TRRespass finds that, on
modern DDR4 modules, RowHammer is still possible when many aggressor rows are
used (as many as 19 in some cases), with a method we generally refer to as
Many-sided RowHammer. Overall, our analysis shows that 13 out of the 42 modules
from all three major DRAM vendors are vulnerable to our TRR-aware RowHammer
access patterns, and thus one can still mount existing state-of-the-art
RowHammer attacks. In addition to DDR4, we also experiment with LPDDR4 chips
and show that they are susceptible to RowHammer bit flips too. Our results
provide concrete evidence that the pursuit of better RowHammer mitigations must
continue.

exhaustive and computationally expensive, as it can span up to a few minutes.
Thus, it is of great importance to sample only the salient parts of the video.
We propose TimeGate, along with a novel conditional gating module, for sampling
the most representative segments from the long-range activity. TimeGate has two
novelties that address the shortcomings of previous sampling methods, as
SCSampler. First, it enables a differentiable sampling of segments. Thus,
TimeGate can be fitted with modern CNNs and trained end-to-end as a single and
unified model.Second, the sampling is conditioned on both the segments and
their context. Consequently, TimeGate is better suited for long-range
activities, where the importance of a segment heavily depends on the video
context.TimeGate reduces the computation of existing CNNs on three benchmarks
for long-range activities: Charades, Breakfast and MultiThumos. In particular,
TimeGate reduces the computation of I3D by 50% while maintaining the
classification accuracy.

atomic-level structure and bonding of two-to-three-atom-thick crystalline
films. The bond character evolved from covalent to metallic over a few atomic
layers, changing the out-of-plane metal-metal bond distances by approximately
ten percent (0.2 $\unicode{x212B}$), resulting in symmetry breaking and an
axial electrostatic dipole that mediated the large nonlinear response. Two
different orientations of the crystalline metal atoms, corresponding to lateral
displacements < 2 $\unicode{x212B}$, persisted in separate micron-scale

modeled the continuum and the broad emission lines using a power-law plus a

We re-estimate the ratio between the FeII complex centered at 4570Ang and the
broad component of H-Beta, R_FeII, obtaining a value of 2.58, nearly half of
that previously reported (R_FeII=6.2), but still placing PHL1092 among extreme
FeII emitters. The FWHM found for low ionization lines are very similar
(FWHM~1200km/s), but significantly narrower than those of the Hydrogen lines
(FWHM(H-Beta)~1900km/s). Our results suggest that the FeII emission in PHL1092
follows the same trend as in normal FeII emitters, with FeII being formed in
the outer portion of the BLR and co-spatial with CaII, and OI, while H-Beta is
formed closer to the central source. The flux ratio between the UV lines
suggest high densities, log(n_H)~13.0 cm^{-3}, and a low ionization parameter,
log(U)~-3.5. The flux excess found in the FeII bump at 9200Ang after the
subtraction of the NIR FeII template and its comparison with optical FeII

the ly-Alpha fluorescence process, which was found to be the main excitation

on declarative graph query languages or on frameworks for graph analytics,

many real-world tasks conceptually involve combinations of these approaches: a
graph query can be used to select the appropriate data, which is then enriched
with analytics, and then possibly filtered or combined again with other data by
means of a query language. In this paper we propose a declarative language that
is well suited to perform graph querying and analytical tasks. We do this by
proposing a minimalistic extension of SPARQL to allow for expressing analytical
tasks; in particular, we propose to extend SPARQL with recursive features, and
provide a formal syntax and semantics for our language. We show that this
language can express key analytical tasks on graphs (in fact, it is Turing
complete), offering a more declarative alternative to existing frameworks and
languages. We show how procedures in our language can be implemented over an
off-the-shelf SPARQL engine with a specialised client that allows
parallelisation and batch-based processing when memory is limited. Results show
that with such an implementation, procedures for popular analytics currently

because objects in such images have small inter-class visual differences but
with large variations in pose, lighting, and viewpoints, etc. Most existing
work focuses on highly customized feature extraction via deep network
architectures which have been shown to deliver state of the art performance.
Given that images from distinct classes in fine-grained classification share
significant features of interest, we present a new deep network architecture
that explicitly models shared features and removes their effect to achieve
enhanced classification results. Our modeling of shared features is based on a
new group based learning wherein existing classes are divided into groups and
multiple shared feature patterns are discovered (learned). We call this
framework Group based deep Shared Feature Learning (GSFL) and the resulting
learned network as GSFL-Net. Specifically, the proposed GSFL-Net develops a
specially designed autoencoder which is constrained by a newly proposed Feature
Expression Loss to decompose a set of features into their constituent shared
and discriminative components. During inference, only the discriminative
feature component is used to accomplish the classification task. A key benefit
of our specialized autoencoder is that it is versatile and can be combined with
state-of-the-art fine-grained feature extraction models and trained together
with them to improve their performance directly. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that GSFL-Net can enhance classification accuracy over the state
of the art with a more interpretable architecture.

implement quantum algorithms in hardware. Quantum circuits based on Clifford+T
gates are used as they can be made tolerant to noise. The tradeoff of gaining
fault tolerance from using Clifford+T gates and error correcting codes is the
high implementation overhead of the T gate. As a result, the T-count
performance measure has become important in quantum circuit design. Due to
noise, the risk for errors in a quantum circuit computation increases as the
number of gate layers (or depth) in the circuit increases. As a result, low
depth circuits such as quantum carry lookahead adders (QCLA)s have caught the
attention of researchers. This work presents two QCLA designs each optimized
with emphasis on T-count or qubit cost respectively. In-place and out-of-place
versions of each design are shown. The proposed QCLAs are compared against the
existing works in terms of T-count. The proposed QCLAs for out-of-place
addition achieve average T gate savings of $54.34 \%$ and $37.21 \%$,
respectively. The proposed QCLAs for in-place addition achieve average T gate
savings of $72.11 \%$ and $35.87 \%$

maximize the profits of charging stations (CSs) and improve the social welfare
of the network. Specifically, we first introduce CS-based and CS
clustering-based decentralized federated energy learning (DFEL) approaches
which enable the CSs to train their own energy transactions locally to predict
energy demands. In this way, each CS can exchange its learned model with other
CSs to improve prediction accuracy without revealing actual datasets and reduce
communication overhead among the CSs. Based on the energy demand prediction, we
then design a multi-principal one-agent (MPOA) contract-based method. In
particular, we formulate the CSs' utility maximization as a non-collaborative
energy contract problem in which each CS maximizes its utility under common
constraints from the smart grid provider (SGP) and other CSs' contracts. Then,
we prove the existence of an equilibrium contract solution for all the CSs and
develop an iterative algorithm at the SGP to find the equilibrium. Through
simulation results using the dataset of CSs' transactions in Dundee city, the
United Kingdom between 2017 and 2018, we demonstrate that our proposed method
can achieve the energy demand prediction accuracy improvement up to 24.63% and
lessen communication overhead by 96.3% compared with other machine learning
algorithms. Furthermore, our proposed method can outperform non-contract-based
economic models by 35% and 36% in terms of the CSs' utilities and social
welfare of the network, respectively.

achieve strong Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering and Bell nonlocality of
two macroscopic mechanical oscillators in cavity optomechanics. Our system
consists of two optomechanical cavities in which two cavity fields are coupled
to each other via a nondegenerate parametric downconversion. The two cavity
output fields are subject to continuous Bell-like homodyne detection and the
detection currents are fed back to drive the cavity fields. It is found that
when the feedback is absent, the two mechanical oscillators can only be
prepared in steady weakly entangled states which however do not display EPR
steering and Bell nonlocality, due to the so-called 3 dB limit. But when the
feedback is present, it is found that the mechanical entanglement is
considerably enhanced such that strong mechanical steering and Bell nonlocality
can be obtained in the steady-state regime. We analytically reveal that this is
because the feedback drives the mechanical oscillators into a steady
approximate two-mode squeezed vacuum state, with arbitrary squeezing in
principle. It is shown that the feedback can also obviously improve the purity
of the nonclassical mechanical states. The dependences of the mechanical
quantum nonlocality on the feedback strength and thermal fluctuations are
studied, and it is found that Bell nonlocality is much more vulnerable to
thermal noise than EPR steerable nonlocality.

takes as input a (context, classifier) pair satisfying an arbitrary fairness
definition, and accepts or rejects the pair according to whether the classifier
satisfies the underlying fairness truth. Our principal conceptual result is an
extraction procedure that learns the underlying truth; moreover, the procedure
can learn an approximation to this truth given access to a weak form of the

those receiving the same decision are at distance zero from one another and
those receiving different decisions are at distance one, this extraction
process provides the basis for ensuring a rough form of metric fairness, also

reflection amplitude and/or phase of each passive reflecting element on it, the
IRS can reshape the electromagnetic environment in favour of signal
transmission. This letter advances the existing research by proposing and
analyzing a double-IRS aided wireless communication system. Under the
reasonable assumption that the reflection channel from IRS 1 to IRS 2 is of
rank 1 (e.g., line-of-sight channel), we propose a joint passive beamforming
design for the two IRSs. Based on this, we show that deploying two cooperative
IRSs with in total K elements can yield a power gain of order O(K^4), which
greatly outperforms the case of deploying one traditional IRS with a power gain
of order O(K^2). Our simulation results validate that the performance of
deploying two cooperative IRSs is significantly better than that of deploying
one IRS given a sufficient total number of IRS elements. We also extend our
line-of-sight channel model to show how different channel models affect the
performance of the double-IRS aided wireless communication system.

the chemical potential across the Dirac point, both inside and outside the

decision support for business process management. In particular, it helps
process executors to check on-the-fly whether a running process instance
satisfies business constraints of interest, providing an immediate feedback
when deviations occur. We study runtime monitoring of properties expressed in
LTL on finite traces (LTLf), and in its extension LDLf. LDLf is a powerful
logic that captures all monadic second order logic on finite traces, and that
is obtained by combining regular expressions with LTLf, adopting the syntax of
propositional dynamic logic (PDL). Interestingly, in spite of its greater
expressivity, \LDLf has exactly the same computational complexity of LTLf.
  We show that LDLf is able to declaratively express, in the logic itself, not
only the constraints to be monitored, but also the de-facto standard RV-LTL
monitors. On the one hand, this enables us to directly employ the standard
characterization of LDLf based on finite-state automata to monitor constraints
in a fine-grained way. On the other hand, it provides the basis for
declaratively expressing sophisticated metaconstraints that predicate on the
monitoring state of other constraints, and to check them by relying on standard
logical services instead of ad-hoc algorithms.
  In addition, we devise a direct translation of LDLf formulae into
nondeterministic finite-state automata, avoiding to detour to Buchi automata or
alternating automata. We then report on how this approach has been effectively
implemented using Java to manipulate LDLf formulae and their corresponding
monitors, and the well-known ProM process mining suite as underlying
operational decision support infrastructure.

validate its functionality and performance using an experimentally calibrated
FeFET model. Circuit level simulation results demonstrate that FeCAM can either
store continuous matching ranges or encode 3-bit data in a single CAM cell.
When compared with the existing digital CMOS based CAM approaches, FeCAM is
found to improve both memory density by 22.4X and energy saving by 8.6/3.2X for
analog/digital modes, respectively. In the CAM-related application, our
evaluations show that FeCAM can achieve 60.5X/23.1X saving in area/search

super-stochastic matrix are applied to analyze the bipartite tracking issues of
multi-agent systems (MASs) over signed networks, in which the edges with
positive weight and negative weight are used to describe the cooperation and
competition among the agents, respectively. For the sake of integrity of the
study, the overall content is divided into two parts. In the first part, we
examine the dynamics of bipartite tracking for first-order MASs, second-order
MASs and general linear MASs in the presence of asynchronous interactions,
respectively. Asynchronous interactions mean that each agent only interacts
with its neighbors at the instants when it wants to update the state rather
than keeping compulsory consistent with other agents. In the second part, we
investigate the problems of bipartite tracing in different practical scenarios,
such as time delays, switching topologies, random networks, lossy links, matrix
disturbance, external noise disturbance, and a leader of unmeasurable velocity
and acceleration. The bipartite tracking problems of MASs under these different
scenario settings can be equivalently converted into the product convergence
problems of infinite sub-stochastic matrices (ISubSM) or infinite
super-stochastic matrices (ISupSM). With the help of nonnegative matrix theory
together with some key results related to the compositions of directed edge
sets, we establish systematic algebraic-graphical methods of dealing with the
product convergence of ISubSM and ISupSM. Finally, the efficiency of the
proposed methods is verified by computer simulations.

cosmological constant (CC) is discussed. I begin with a notice on the
miraculous fact of the CC problem that the vacuum energies totally vanish at
each step of hierarchical and successive spontaneous symmetry breakings. I then
argue that the classical scale invariance is a necessary condition for the
calculability of the vacuum energy.
  Next, I discuss how sufficient the scale invariance is for solving the CC
problem. First in the framework of classical field theory, the scale invariance
is shown to give a natural mechanism for realizing the miracle of vanishing
vacuum energies at every step of spontaneous symmetry breakings. Then adopting
Englert-Truffin-Gastmans' prescription to maintain the scale invariance in
quantum field theory, I point out that the quantum scale invariance alone is
not yet sufficient to avoid the superfine tuning of coupling constants for
realizing vanishingly small cosmological constant, whereas the hierarchy
problem may be solved. Another symmetry or a mechanism is still necessary which
protects the flat direction of the potential against the radiative corrections.

However, we find that the two tasks tend to compete with each other which need

on $\ell^2(S)$ and $\ell^\infty(S)$, with the uniform Roe algebra over the
metric space, namely $C^*_u(\Lambda_S)$. This yields a chacterization of when
$\mathcal{R}_S = C^*_u(\Lambda_S)$, which generalizes finite generation of $S$.
We have termed this by finite labeability (FL), since it holds when the
$\Lambda_S$ can be labeled in a finitary manner.
  The graph $\Lambda_S$, and the FL condition above, also allow to analyze
large scale properties of $\Lambda_S$ and relate them with C*-properties of the
uniform Roe algebra. In particular, we show that domain measurability of $S$ (a
notion generalizing Day's definition of amenability of a semigroup, cf., [5])
is a quasi-isometric invariant of $\Lambda_S$. Moreover, we characterize
property A of $\Lambda_S$ (or of its components) in terms of the nuclearity and
exactness of the corresponding C*-algebras. We also treat the special classes
of F-inverse and E-unitary inverse semigroups from this large scale point of
view.

achieve strong security (i.e., 128-bit) or random masking technique to achieve
high efficiency for low security. In this paper, lattice structures have been
exploited to develop an efficient privacy-preserving system. The proposed
scheme is not only efficient in computation as compared to the state-of-the-art
but also provides high degree of security against quantum attacks. Rigorous
security and privacy analyses of the proposed scheme have been provided along
with a concrete set of parameters to achieve 128-bit and 256-bit security.
Performance analysis shows that the scheme is at least five orders faster than
the Paillier schemes and at least twice as faster than the existing

results in tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, but
the inference capabilities of multimodal representations are largely untested.
In the case of textual representations, inference tasks such as Textual
Entailment and Semantic Textual Similarity have been often used to benchmark
the quality of textual representations. The long term goal of our research is
to devise multimodal representation techniques that improve current inference
capabilities. We thus present a novel task, Visual Semantic Textual Similarity
(vSTS), where such inference ability can be tested directly. Given two items
comprised each by an image and its accompanying caption, vSTS systems need to
assess the degree to which the captions in context are semantically equivalent
to each other. Our experiments using simple multimodal representations show
that the addition of image representations produces better inference, compared
to text-only representations. The improvement is observed both when directly
computing the similarity between the representations of the two items, and when
learning a siamese network based on vSTS training data. Our work shows, for the
first time, the successful contribution of visual information to textual
inference, with ample room for benchmarking more complex multimodal
representation options.

conformal matter in the flat and $3+1$ dimension to analyze better these

velocity of sound hydro modes at the large wave number limit and stability
conditions are imposed by looking to the imaginary parts of hydro modes as well

In
this model, a particle diffusing in a potential $U(x) = U_0\log|x|$ is reset,
i.e., taken back to its initial position, with a constant rate $r$. We show
that this analytically tractable model system exhibits a series of phase
transitions as a function of a single parameter, $\beta U_0$, the ratio of the
strength of the potential to the thermal energy. For $\beta U_0<-1$ the
potential is strongly repulsive, preventing the particle from reaching the
origin. Resetting then generates a non-equilibrium steady state which is
characterized exactly and thoroughly analyzed. In contrast, for $\beta U_0>-1$
the potential is either weakly repulsive or attractive and the diffusing
particle eventually reaches the origin. In this case, we provide a closed form
expression for the subsequent first-passage time distribution and show that a
resetting transition occurs at $\beta U_0=5$. Namely, we find that resetting
can expedite arrival to the origin when $-1<\beta U_0<5$, but not when $\beta
U_0>5$. The results presented herein generalize results for simple diffusion
with resetting -- a widely applicable model that is obtained from ours by
setting $U_0=0$. Extending to general potential strengths, our work opens the
door to theoretical and experimental investigation of a plethora of problems

unsupervised manner. We then alternate the training of synthetic and real data
iteratively. We use real data without ground-truths, since to have
ground-truths in such conditions is intractable, and also to avoid the
overfitting problem of synthetic data training, where the knowledge learned on

states on AdS$_5\times$S$_5$ which appear after the KK-compactification on
five-dimensional sphere. The latter aspect is usually ignored in
phenomenological AdS/QCD models. The emerging massive 5D fields on AdS$_5$ are
dual to higher-dimensional operators in 4D gauge theory, with masses being

Motivated by this observation, we propose to calculate the spectrum of radially

relevant physical motivation is suggested. The radial states with growing
masses are then enumerated by growing dimensions of interpolating QCD
operators. We tested the proposal in the Soft Wall and Hard Wall holographic

to be unchanged in the new description. But in the Hard Wall model, our
approach is shown to lead to a much better phenomenological spectrum of vector

in that language, which get optimized through a series of rewritings (possibly
changing the IR flavor multiple times) until the program is finally expressed
in an IR of platform-specific operators. While reducing the overall
implementation effort, this also improves the interoperability of both analyses
and hardware platforms. We have used CVM successfully to build specialized
backends for platforms as diverse as multi-core CPUs, RDMA clusters, and
serverless computing infrastructure in the cloud and expect similar results for
many more frontends and hardware platforms in the near future.

the world follows an iid--process throughout the game. At each period, the
sender observes the current state, and sends a message to the receiver,
suggesting either to stop or to continue. The receiver, only seeing the message
but not the state, decides either to stop the game, or to continue which takes
the game to the next period. The payoff to each player is a function of the
state when the receiver quits, with higher states leading to better payoffs.
The horizon of the game can be finite or infinite.
  We prove existence and uniqueness of responsive (i.e. non-babbling) Perfect
Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE) under mild conditions on the game primitives in the
case where the players are sufficiently patient. The responsive PBE has a
remarkably simple structure, which builds on the identification of an
easy-to-implement and compute class of threshold strategies for the sender.
With the help of these threshold strategies, we derive simple expressions
describing this PBE. It turns out that in this PBE the receiver obediently
follows the recommendations of the sender. Hence, surprisingly, the sender
alone plays the decisive role, and regardless of the payoff function of the
receiver the sender always obtains the best possible payoff for himself.

where other formulations are desirable, for example for modeling
superconducting turns in electrical machines or situations where the
superconductor is better described by the critical state than by a power-law
resistivity. In order to accurately and efficiently handle those situations,
here we consider two published approaches based on the magnetic vector
potential: the $T$-$A$ formulation of Maxwell's equations (with power-law
resistivity) and Campbell's implementation of the critical state model. In this
contribution, we extend the $T$-$A$ formulation to thick conductors so that
large coils with different coupling scenarios between the turns can be
considered. We also revise Campbell's model and discuss it in terms of its
ability to calculate AC losses: in particular, we investigate the dependence of
the calculated AC losses on the frequency of the AC excitation and the
possibility of using quick one-step (instead of full cycle) simulations to
calculate the AC losses.

simulations of galaxies residing in haloes of Milky Way mass, simulated with
the EAGLE galaxy formation code with re-calibrated stellar feedback. In this
study, we analyse the structure of stellar haloes, specifically the mass
density, surface brightness, metallicity, colour and age radial profiles,
finding generally very good agreement with recent observations of local
galaxies. The stellar density profiles are well fitted by broken power laws,
with inner slopes of ~ -3, outer slopes of ~ -4 and break radii that are
typically ~ 20-40 kpc. The break radii generally mark the transition between in
situ formation and accretion-driven formation of the halo. The metallicity,
colour and age profiles show mild large-scale gradients, particularly when
spherically-averaged or viewed along the major axes. Along the minor axes,
however, the profiles are nearly flat, in agreement with observations. Overall,
the structural properties can be understood by two factors: that in situ stars
dominate the inner regions and that they reside in a spatially-flattened
distribution that is aligned with the disc. Observations targeting both the
major and minor axes of galaxies are thus required to obtain a complete picture
of stellar haloes.

one-third of its market value evaporated. Given its associations with fear and
the fine resolution with respect to frequency, the illiquidity of stocks may
offer a promising perspective for understanding and even signaling a market
crash. In this study, by connecting stocks with illiquidity comovements, an
illiquidity network is established to model the market. Compared to noncrash
days, on crash days, the market is more densely connected due to heavier but
more homogeneous illiquidity dependencies that facilitate abrupt collapses.
Critical stocks in the illiquidity network, particularly those in the finance
sector, are targeted for inspection because of their crucial roles in
accumulating and passing on illiquidity losses. The cascading failures of
stocks in market crashes are profiled as disseminating from small degrees to
high degrees that are usually located in the core of the illiquidity network
and then back to the periphery. By counting the days with random failures in
the previous five days, an early signal is implemented to successfully predict
more than half of the crash days, especially consecutive days in the early
phase. Additional evidence from both the Granger causality network and the
random network further testifies to the robustness of the signal. Our results
could help market practitioners such as regulators detect and prevent the risk
of crashes in advance.

best performance outperforming the baselines by a large margin. However, these
findings do not generalise on the ASVspoof 2019 PA dataset. This suggests that
the datasets available for training these models do not reflect real world

Mahalanobis distance from the mean, which is based on the mean and the
covariance matrix of the data. A multivariate depth function is a function
which, given a point and a distribution in d-space, measures centrality by a
number between 0 and 1, while satisfying certain postulates regarding
invariance, monotonicity, convexity and continuity. Accordingly, numerous
notions of multivariate depth have been proposed in the literature, some of
which are also robust against extremely outlying data. The departure from
classical Mahalanobis distance does not come without cost. There is a trade-off
between invariance, robustness and computational feasibility. In the last few
years, efficient exact algorithms as well as approximate ones have been
constructed and made available in R-packages. Consequently, in practical
applications the choice of a depth statistic is no more restricted to one or
two notions due to computational limits; rather often more notions are
feasible, among which the researcher has to decide. The article debates
theoretical and practical aspects of this choice, including invariance and
uniqueness, robustness and computational feasibility. Complexity and speed of
exact algorithms are compared. The accuracy of approximate approaches like the

homoatomic, heteroatomic solute-solute, and solute-solute-vacancy binding
energies of relevant alloying elements in aluminum. We particularly focus on
the systems with major alloying elements in aluminum, i.e., Cu, Mg, and Si. We
consider physical factors such as solute size and formation energies of
intermetallic compounds to correlate with binding energies. Systematic studies
of the homoatomic solute-solute-vacancy and heteroatomic (Cu, Mg, or
Si)-solute-vacancy complexes reveal the overarching effect of the vacancy in
stabilizing solute-solute pairs. The computed binding energies of the
solute-solute-vacancy triplet successfully explain several experimental
observations that remained unexplained by the reported pair binding energies in
literature. The binding energy database presented here elucidates the
interaction between solute cluster and vacancy in aluminum, and it is expected
to provide insight into the design of advanced Al alloys with tailored
properties.

Approach, uses various EBL models for estimating the opacity as a function of
the redshift and energy of the TeV photons. The second method,
Model-Independent Approach, relies on using the simultaneous observations of
blazars in the MeV-GeV energy range from the Fermi-LAT and in the TeV band from
the ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. We make the underline assumption that
the extrapolation of the LAT spectrum of blazars to TeV energies is either a
good estimate or an upper limit for the intrinsic TeV spectrum of a source. We
apply this method on the simultaneous observations of a few blazars at
different redshifts to demonstrate a comparative study of six prominent EBL
models. Opacities of the TeV photons predicted by the model-independent
approach are systematically larger than the ones estimated from the
model-dependent method. Therefore, the gamma-ray observations of blazars can be
used to set a strict upper limit on the opacity of the Universe to the TeV
photons at a given redshift.

width larger than the working wavelength. The proposed solution can tackle a
group of modes at the same time with very simple processes, avoiding

conventional schemes, it is scalable to larger mode channels without increasing
the complexity and whole footprint. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a set

Low losses of multimode waveguide crossing and bend are achieved, as well as
ultra-low power consumption of the multimode switch is realized since it

participants and support economic activity of billions of dollars, which has
led to new lines of work in binary Byzantine Agreement (BBA) and consensus. The
new work aims to achieve communication-efficiency---given such a large $n$, not
everyone can speak during the protocol. Several protocols have achieved
consensus with communication-efficiency, even under an adaptive adversary, but
they require additional strong assumptions---proof-of-work, memory-erasure,
etc. All of these protocols use multicast: every honest replica multicasts
messages to all other replicas. Under this model, we provide a new
communication-efficient consensus protocol using Verifiable Delay Functions
(VDFs) that is secure against adaptive adversaries and does not require the
same strong assumptions present in other protocols.
  A natural question is whether we can extend the synchronous protocols to the
partially synchronous setting---in this work, we show that using multicast, we
cannot. Furthermore, we cannot achieve always safe communication-efficient
protocols (that maintain safety with probability 1) even in the synchronous
setting against a static adversary when honest replicas only choose to
multicast its messages. Considering these impossibility results, we describe a
new communication-efficient BBA protocol in a modified partially synchronous
network model which is secure against adaptive adversaries with high
probability.

occupation probabilities come from the numerical solution of the Liouville-von

explain the origin of surprising lateral interactions between electronegative

calculations of four electronegative atoms (N, O, F, Cl) on 70 surfaces of 44
pristine metals. Four different scenarios for lateral interactions are
identified, some of them being unexpected: (i) they are repulsive, which is the
typical case and occurs on almost all transition metals. (ii,iii) They are
atypical, being either attractive or negligible, which occurs on p-block metals

configuration, preventing atypical lateral interactions. The last case occurs
predominantly on s-block metals.

consequence of gravitational leakage into extra dimensions on cosmological
scales rather than the result of a non-zero cosmological constant, and consider
the ability of future gravitational-wave siren observations to probe this
phenomenon and constrain the parameters of phenomenological models of this
gravitational leakage. In theories that include additional non-compact
spacetime dimensions, the gravitational leakage intro extra dimensions leads to
a reduction in the amplitude of observed gravitational waves and thereby a
systematic discrepancy between the distance inferred to such sources from GW
and EM observations. We investigate the capability of a gravitational space
interferometer such as LISA to probe this modified gravity on large scales. We
find that the extent to which LISA will be able to place limits on the number
of spacetime dimensions and other cosmological parameters characterising
modified gravity will strongly depend on the actual number and redshift
distribution of sources, together with the uncertainty on the GW measurements.
A relatively small number of sources ($\sim 1$) and high measurement
uncertainties would strongly restrict the ability of LISA to place meaningful
constraints on the parameters in cosmological scenarios where gravity is only
five-dimensional and modified at scales larger than about $\sim 4$ times the
Hubble radius. Conversely, if the number of sources observed amounts to a
four-year average of $\sim 27$, then in the most favourable cosmological
scenarios LISA has the potential to place meaningful constraints on the
cosmological parameters with a precision of $\sim 1\%$ on the number of
dimensions and $\sim 7.5\%$ on the scale beyond which gravity is modified,
thereby probing the late expansion of the universe up to a redshift of $\sim
8$.

sequence modeling, generation, and prediction. Despite success in applications
such as machine translation and voice recognition, these stateful models have
several critical shortcomings. Specifically, RNNs generalize poorly over very
long sequences, which limits their applicability to many important temporal
processing and time series forecasting problems. For example, RNNs struggle in
recognizing complex context free languages (CFLs), never reaching 100% accuracy
on training. One way to address these shortcomings is to couple an RNN with an
external, differentiable memory structure, such as a stack. However,
differentiable memories in prior work have neither been extensively studied on
CFLs nor tested on sequences longer than those seen in training. The few
efforts that have studied them have shown that continuous differentiable memory
structures yield poor generalization for complex CFLs, making the RNN less
interpretable. In this paper, we improve the memory-augmented RNN with
important architectural and state updating mechanisms that ensure that the
model learns to properly balance the use of its latent states with external
memory. Our improved RNN models exhibit better generalization performance and
are able to classify long strings generated by complex hierarchical context
free grammars (CFGs). We evaluate our models on CGGs, including the Dyck
languages, as well as on the Penn Treebank language modelling task, and achieve
stable, robust performance across these benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that
only our memory-augmented networks are capable of retaining memory for a longer
duration up to strings of length 160.

multistability. For a subset of disorders of consciousness and motor control,
we hypothesize that some symptoms originate from the inability to spontaneously
transition from one attractor to another. Using external perturbations, such as
electrical pulses delivered by deep brain stimulation devices, it may be
possible to induce such transition out of the pathological attractors. However,
the induction of transition may be non-trivial, rendering the current open-loop
stimulation strategies insufficient. In order to develop next-generation neural
stimulators that can intelligently learn to induce attractor transitions, we
require a platform to test the efficacy of such systems. To this end, we
designed an analog circuit as a model for the multistable brain dynamics. The
circuit spontaneously oscillates stably on two periods as an instantiation of a
3-dimensional continuous-time gated recurrent neural network. To discourage
simple perturbation strategies such as constant or random stimulation patterns
from easily inducing transition between the stable limit cycles, we designed a
state-dependent nonlinear circuit interface for external perturbation. We
demonstrate the existence of nontrivial solutions to the transition problem in
our circuit implementation.

  Usbeck","Template-based Question Answering using Recursive Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CL cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a neural network-based approach to automatically learn and
classify natural language questions into its corresponding template using
recursive neural networks. An obvious advantage of using neural networks is the
elimination of the need for laborious feature engineering that can be
cumbersome and error-prone. The input question is encoded into a vector
representation. The model is trained and evaluated on the LC-QuAD dataset
(Large-scale Complex Question Answering Dataset). The LC-QuAD queries are
annotated based on 38 unique templates that the model attempts to classify. The
resulting model is evaluated against both the LC-QuAD dataset and the 7th
Question Answering Over Linked Data (QALD-7) dataset. The recursive neural
network achieves template classification accuracy of 0.828 on the LC-QuAD
dataset and an accuracy of 0.618 on the QALD-7 dataset. When the top-2 most
likely templates were considered the model achieves an accuracy of 0.945 on the
LC-QuAD dataset and 0.786 on the QALD-7 dataset. After slot filling, the
overall system achieves a macro F-score 0.419 on the LC-QuAD dataset and a
macro F-score of 0.417 on the QALD-7 dataset.

important to detect and identify causes of failure in real time for proper
recovery from a potential crash-like scenario or post incident forensics
analysis. The cause of crash could be either a fault in the sensor/actuator
system, a physical damage/attack, or a cyber attack on the drone's software. In
this paper, we propose novel architectures based on deep Convolutional and Long
Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (CNNs and LSTMs) to detect (via Autoencoder)
and classify drone mis-operations based on sensor data. The proposed
architectures are able to learn high-level features automatically from the raw
sensor data and learn the spatial and temporal dynamics in the sensor data. We
validate the proposed deep-learning architectures via simulations and
experiments on a real drone. Empirical results show that our solution is able
to detect with over 90% accuracy and classify various types of drone
mis-operations (with about 99% accuracy (simulation data) and upto 88% accuracy
(experimental data)).
