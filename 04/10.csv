challenging to use low-cost IoT devices for robust unsupervised localization
(i.e., localization without training data that have known location labels).
Thus, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based
unsupervised wireless-localization method. The main contributions are as
follows. (1) This paper proposes an approach to model a continuous
wireless-localization process as a Markov decision process (MDP) and process it
within a DRL framework. (2) To alleviate the challenge of obtaining rewards
when using unlabeled data (e.g., daily-life crowdsourced data), this paper
presents a reward-setting mechanism, which extracts robust landmark data from
unlabeled wireless received signal strengths (RSS). (3) To ease requirements
for model re-training when using DRL for localization, this paper uses RSS
measurements together with agent location to construct DRL inputs. The proposed
method was tested by using field testing data from multiple Bluetooth 5 smart
ear tags in a pasture. Meanwhile, the experimental verification process
reflected the advantages and challenges for using DRL in wireless localization.

evolutions is matter of current research. Here, we study the behavior of the
stochastic entropy production in open quantum systems undergoing unital
non-Markovian dynamics. In particular, for the family of Pauli channels we show
that in some specific time intervals both the average entropy production and
the variance can decrease, provided that the quantum dynamics fails to be
P-divisible. Although the dynamics of the system is overall irreversible, our
result may be interpreted as a transient tendency towards reversibility,
described as a delta peaked distribution of entropy production around zero.
Finally, we also provide analytical bounds on the parameters in the generator
giving rise to the quantum system dynamics, so as to ensure irreversibility
mitigation of the corresponding non-Markovian evolution.

minimum radius measured in the experiments is compared with that obtained from
a numerical solution of the full Navier-Stokes equations for different values

small but measurable effect of the surface viscous stresses on the system
dynamics for sufficiently small spatiotemporal distances from the breakup
point, and allows to establish upper bounds for the values of the shear and
dilatational viscosities. We study numerically the distribution of Marangoni
and viscous stresses over the free surface as a function of the time to the
pinching, and describe how surface viscous stresses grow in the pinching region
as the free surface approaches its breakup. When Marangoni and surface
viscosity stresses are taken into account, the surfactant is not swept away
from the thread neck in the time interval analyzed. Surface viscous stresses
eventually balance the driving capillary pressure in that region for small
enough values of the time to pinching. Based on this result, we propose a
scaling law to account for the effect of the surface viscosities on the last
stage of the temporal evolution of the neck radius.

specifically, we find that more than 60% of web sites are co-located with at
least ten other web sites---a group comprising less popular web sites. In
contrast, 17.5% of mostly popular web sites are served from their own servers.
  Although a high degree of web co-location could make co-hosted sites
vulnerable to DoS attacks, our findings show that it is an increasing trend to
co-host many web sites and serve them from well-provisioned content delivery

benefits. Regardless of the high degree of web co-location, our analyses of
popular block lists indicate that IP-based blocking does not cause severe

a challenge for such detectors since a neutron capture on a hydrogen atom

The use of gadolinium in the form of soluble salts has been explored
extensively to remedy this issue, as gadolinium exhibits both a very large
neutron capture cross section and a subsequent high-energy gamma cascade.
However, in order for large gadolinium-loaded detectors to operate stably over
long time periods, water optical transparency must be maintained by in situ
purification. New methods have been developed involving band-pass molecular
filtering. While these methods are very successful, they are expensive and
consume considerable power and space as they seek to minimize loss of
gadolinium while removing other impurities. For smaller detectors where some
gadolinium loss can be tolerated, a less expensive way to do this is very
desirable. In this paper, we describe the design, development and testing of a

simplify the inference, we applied data augmentation methods that allowed the
use of conjugate priors and the construction of an efficient Gibbs sampler.
This approach turned out to be numerically efficient and permitted fitting
interindividual differences in saccade statistics. Thus, the main contribution
of our modeling approach is two--fold; first, we propose a new model for
saccade generation in scene viewing. Second, we demonstrate the use of novel
methods from Bayesian inference in the field of scan path modeling.

Although the complexity is polynomial when the query size is fixed, the naive

of counting queries involving join operations by tracking and summarizing tuple
sensitivities -- the maximum change a tuple can cause in the query result when

way towards novel types of sources and nanoantennae with exceptional

enhanced light harvesting structures, etc. Recently, the anapoles states
arising from the destructive interference of basic multipoles and their
toroidal counterparts have been widely exploited to cancel radiation from an
individual scattering channel of isolated nanoresonators, while displaying
nontrivial near fields. As such, anapole states have been claimed to correspond
to non-radiating sources. Nevertheless, these states are commonly found
together with high order multipole moments featuring non-zero overall
far-field. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a
fully non-scattering state governed by a novel 4-fold hybrid anapole with all
the dominant multipoles suppressed by their corresponding toroidal (retarded)
terms, i.e. a dark analogue of the superscattering effect. This invisibility
state, however, allows for non-trivial near-field maps enabled by the unique
interplay of the resonant Mie-like and Fabry-Perot modes as demonstrated by the
quasi-normal modal expansion. Moreover, the hybrid anapole state is shown to be
protected; the spectral position of the non-scattering point remains
unperturbed in the presence of a substrate with significantly high refractive
index. We experimentally verify our novel effect by means of dark field
measurements of the scattering response of individual nanocylinders. The
results are of high demand for efficient sensing and Raman scattering setups

increases with the magnetic field. At higher temperature and/or baryon chemical

coins with unknown biases, find the most biased coin using a minimal number of
coin tosses. This is a common abstraction of various exploration problems in
theoretical computer science and machine learning and has been studied
extensively over the years. In particular, algorithms with optimal sample
complexity (number of coin tosses) have been known for this problem for quite
some time.
  Motivated by applications to processing massive datasets, we study the space
complexity of solving this problem with optimal number of coin tosses in the
streaming model. In this model, the coins are arriving one by one and the
algorithm is only allowed to store a limited number of coins at any point --
any coin not present in the memory is lost and can no longer be tossed or
compared to arriving coins. Prior algorithms for the coin tossing problem with
optimal sample complexity are based on iterative elimination of coins which
inherently require storing all the coins, leading to memory-inefficient
streaming algorithms.
  We remedy this state-of-affairs by presenting a series of improved streaming
algorithms for this problem: we start with a simple algorithm which require
storing only $O(\log{n})$ coins and then iteratively refine it further and
further, leading to algorithms with $O(\log\log{(n)})$ memory, $O(\log^*{(n)})$
memory, and finally a one that only stores a single extra coin in memory -- the
same exact space needed to just store the best coin throughout the stream.
  Furthermore, we extend our algorithms to the problem of finding the $k$ most
biased coins as well as other exploration problems such as finding top-$k$
elements using noisy comparisons or finding an $\epsilon$-best arm in
stochastic multi-armed bandits, and obtain efficient streaming algorithms for
these problems.

Remarkable performance degradation of CNNs in this scenario is well documented

concatenation of two sub-networks: a relatively shallow image normalization
CNN, followed by a deep CNN that segments the normalized image. We train both
these sub-networks using a training dataset, consisting of annotated images
from a particular scanner and protocol setting. Now, at test time, we adapt the
image normalization sub-network for \emph{each test image}, guided by an
implicit prior on the predicted segmentation labels. We employ an independently

plausible anatomical segmentation labels. We validate the proposed idea on
multi-center Magnetic Resonance imaging datasets of three anatomies: brain,
heart and prostate. The proposed test-time adaptation consistently provides

a proper stopping condition for (MC)^2 is currently lacking. In this work, we
introduce a consistency check via a predictor-corrector algorithm to penalize
solutions that do not satisfy a necessary condition for equivalence of chemical
potentials and steer the system towards finding equilibrium. The most general
acceptance criteria for (MC)^2 is derived starting from the isothermic-isobaric
Gibbs Ensemble for mixtures. Using this ensemble, translational MC moves are
added to include vibrational excitations as well as volume MC moves to ensure
the condition of constant pressure and temperature entirely with a MC approach,
without relying on any other method for relaxation of these degrees of freedom.

can test Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, at
high temperatures. One of the exciting possibilities is the existence of
thermodynamically distinct states of QCD, particularly a phase of de-confined
quarks and gluons. An important step in establishing this new state of QCD is
to demonstrate that the system has attained thermal equilibrium. We present a
test of thermal equilibrium by checking that the mean hadron yields produced in
the small impact parameter collisions as well as grand canonical fluctuations
of conserved quantities give consistent temperature and baryon chemical
potential for the last scattering surface. This consistency for moments up to
third order of the net-baryon number, charge, and strangeness is a key step in
the proof that the QCD matter produced in heavy-ion collision attains thermal
equilibrium. It is a clear indication for the first time, using fluctuation
observables, that a femto-scale system attains thermalization. The study also
indicates that the relaxation time scales for the system are comparable to or
smaller than the life time of the fireball.

choices by post-secondary students in Toronto. It uses a dataset collected
through a large-scale travel survey conducted on post-secondary students of
four major universities in Toronto and it employs multiple alternative
econometric modelling techniques for the empirical investigation. Results
contribute on two fronts. Firstly, it presents empirical investigations of
factors affecting telecommuting frequency choices of post-secondary students
that are rare in literature. Secondly, it identifies better a performing
econometric modelling technique for modelling telecommuting frequency choices.
Empirical investigation clearly reveals that telecommuting for school related
activities is prevalent among post-secondary students in Toronto. Around 80
percent of 0.18 million of the post-secondary students of the region, who make
roughly 36,000 trips per day, also telecommute at least once a week.
Considering that large numbers of students need to spend a long time travelling
from home to campus with around 33 percent spending more than two hours a day
on travelling, telecommuting has potential to enhance their quality of life.
Empirical investigations reveal that car ownership and living farther from the
campus have similar positive effects on the choice of higher frequency of
telecommuting. Students who use a bicycle for regular travel are least likely
to telecommute, compared to those using transit or a private car.

performance, we introduce a new risk constraint, which explicitly restricts the

evaluated explicitly and in closed form. In fact, it is affine relative to the
state, and is always internally stable regardless of parameter tuning. Our new
risk-aware controller: i) pushes the state away from directions where the noise
exhibits heavy tails, by exploiting the third-order moment (skewness) of the

noise covariance and the state penalty are simultaneously large. The properties
of the proposed risk-aware LQR framework are also illustrated via indicative

integrating inertial, wireless, and magnetic sensors. Both wireless and
magnetic fingerprinting accuracy are predicted in real time through the
introduction of fingerprinting accuracy indicators (FAI) from three levels

FAI factors and their performances on predicting location errors and outliers
are investigated. Furthermore, the FAI-enhanced extended Kalman filter (EKF) is
proposed, which improved the dead-reckoning (DR)/WiFi, DR/Magnetic, and

orthogonal over-parameterized training (OPT) framework that can provably
minimize the hyperspherical energy which characterizes the diversity of neurons
on a hypersphere. By maintaining the minimum hyperspherical energy during
training, OPT can greatly improve the empirical generalization. Specifically,
OPT fixes the randomly initialized weights of the neurons and learns an
orthogonal transformation that applies to these neurons. We consider multiple
ways to learn such an orthogonal transformation, including unrolling
orthogonalization algorithms, applying orthogonal parameterization, and
designing orthogonality-preserving gradient descent. For better scalability, we
propose the stochastic OPT which performs orthogonal transformation
stochastically for partial dimensions of neurons. Interestingly, OPT reveals
that learning a proper coordinate system for neurons is crucial to
generalization. We provide some insights on why OPT yields better
generalization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of OPT over the
standard training.

Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. TI qubits have fundamental
advantages over other technologies such as superconducting qubits, including
high qubit quality, coherence and connectivity. However, current TI systems are
small in size, with 5-20 qubits and typically use a single trap architecture
which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress towards the next
major milestone of 50-100 qubits, a modular architecture termed the Quantum
Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device,
small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware
components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit
system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap
sizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match
diverse application resource requirements.
  Towards realizing QCCD systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive
architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing,
communication topology and operation implementation methods. We built a design
toolflow which takes a QCCD architecture's parameters as input, along with a
set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow
maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to
compute metrics such as application run time, reliability and device noise
rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that
trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application
reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate
implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude.
From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices
to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions.

The geometrical characteristics of those trajectories makes them good
candidates as science orbits for the extended observation of the surface of
Enceladus: they are highly inclined, they approach the moon and they are
maneuver-free. However, the low heights above the surface and the strong
perturbing effect of Saturn require a study of the influence of the polar
flattening of the primaries. Therefore, those solutions are here reconsidered
with a dynamical model that includes the effect of the oblateness of Saturn and
Enceladus, separately and in combination. The dynamical equivalents of the halo
orbits around the equilibrium points L1 and L2 and their stable and unstable
hyperbolic invariant manifolds are obtained in the perturbed models, and
maneuver-free heteroclinic connections are identified. A comparison with the
corresponding solutions of the unperturbed problem shows that qualitative and
quantitative features are not significantly altered in the perturbed model. The
results confirm the scientific value of the solutions obtained in the classical

amount of data. In such an environment, the controlling systems need to be
intelligent enough to deal with a vast amount of data to detect defects in a
real-time process. Driven by such a need, artificial intelligence models such
as deep learning have to be deployed into IIoT systems. However, learning and
using deep learning models are computationally expensive, so an IoT device with
limited computational power could not run such models. To tackle this issue,
edge intelligence had emerged as a new paradigm towards running Artificial
Intelligence models on edge devices. Although a considerable amount of studies
have been proposed in this area, the research is still in the early stages. In
this paper, we propose a novel edge-based multi-phase pruning pipelines to
ensemble learning on IIoT devices. In the first phase, we generate a diverse
ensemble of pruned models, then we apply integer quantisation, next we prune
the generated ensemble using a clustering-based technique. Finally, we choose
the best representative from each generated cluster to be deployed to a
distributed IoT environment. On CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10, our proposed approach
was able to outperform the predictability levels of a baseline model (up to
7%), more importantly, the generated learners have small sizes (up to 90%
reduction in the model size) that minimise the required computational
capabilities to make an inference on the resource-constraint devices.

controlled by variation of gate potentials in DGG. We also study the dependence

linear polarization) and on the radiation helicity (for circular polarization).
Notably, in the latter case, switching from right- to left-circularly polarized

stochastic processes varying over a continuum, we propose novel testing
procedures to detect relevant differences between the second order dynamics of
two functional time series. In order to take the between-function dynamics into
account that characterize this type of functional data, a frequency domain
approach is taken. Test statistics are developed to compare differences in the
spectral density operators and in the primary modes of variation as encoded in
the associated eigenelements. Under mild moment conditions, we show convergence
of the underlying statistics to Brownian motions and construct pivotal test
statistics. The latter is essential because the nuisance parameters can be
unwieldy and their robust estimation infeasible, especially if the two
functional time series are dependent. In addition to these novel features, the
properties of the tests are robust to any choice of frequency band enabling
also to compare energy contents at a single frequency. The finite sample
performance of the tests are verified through a simulation study and are
illustrated with an application to fMRI data.

learning systems. One of the main sources of time and energy drains is the well
known backpropagation (backprop) algorithm, which roughly accounts for 2/3 of
the computational complexity of training. In this work we propose a method for
reducing the computational cost of backprop, which we named dithered backprop.
It consists in applying a stochastic quantization scheme to intermediate
results of the method. The particular quantisation scheme, called
non-subtractive dither (NSD), induces sparsity which can be exploited by
computing efficient sparse matrix multiplications. Experiments on popular image
classification tasks show that it induces 92% sparsity on average across a wide
set of models at no or negligible accuracy drop in comparison to
state-of-the-art approaches, thus significantly reducing the computational
complexity of the backward pass. Moreover, we show that our method is fully
compatible to state-of-the-art training methods that reduce the bit-precision
of training down to 8-bits, as such being able to further reduce the
computational requirements. Finally we discuss and show potential benefits of
applying dithered backprop in a distributed training setting, where both
communication as well as compute efficiency may increase simultaneously with
the number of participant nodes.

mammograms and interval cancers is a vital resource for AI development. Data
from OMI-DB has been shared with over 30 research groups and companies, since

determine the fidelity of this sequence of operations in a number of

find that thermodynamic properties in the outskirts of high redshift clusters
are remarkably similar to the low redshift clusters, and their evolution
follows the prediction of the self-similar model. Their intrinsic scatter is
larger, indicating that the physical properties that lead to the formation and
virialization of cluster outskirts show evolving variance. On the other hand,
thermodynamic properties in the cluster cores deviates significantly from
self-similarity indicating that the processes that regulate the core are
already in place in these very high redshift clusters. This result is supported
by the unevolving physical scatter of all thermodynamic quantities in cluster

face-on outflow, which are traced by ionized emission lines and neutral NaID
\emph{emission} and absorption lines. We find remarkable similarities between
the kinematics, spatial extents, and line luminosities of the ionized and
neutral gas phases, and propose a model in which they are part of the same
outflowing clouds, which are exposed to both stellar and AGN radiation. Our
photoionization model provides consistent ionized line ratios, NaID absorption
optical depths and EWs, and dust reddening. Using the model, we estimate, for
the first time, the neutral-to-ionized gas mass ratio (about 20), the sodium
neutral fraction, and the size of the outflowing clouds. This is one of the
best ever observed direct connections between the neutral and ionized outflow
phases in AGN.

onto those of a light scalar coupled to neutrinos with its coupling fixed by
the observed neutrino masses and mixing. This leads to amplitudes with external

builds on an operator identity which we discover for the first time. The
identity leads to the representation of traces of operator products, and thus
Renyi entropies of a subsystem, in terms of fermionic-displacement operators.
This allows for a very transparent path-integral formulation, both in and
out-of-equilibrium, having a simple boundary condition on the fermionic fields.
The method is validated by reproducing well known expressions for entanglement
entropy in terms of the correlation matrix for non-interacting fermions. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by explicitly formulating the field
theory for Renyi entropy in a few zero and higher-dimensional large-$N$
interacting models based on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and for the
Hubbard model within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approximation. We use
the formulation to compute Renyi entanglement entropy of interacting Fermi
liquid (FL) and non-Fermi liquid (NFL) states in the large-$N$ models and
compare successfully with the results obtained via exact diagonalization for
finite $N$. We elucidate the connection between entanglement entropy and
residual entropy of the NFL ground state in the SYK model and extract sharp
signatures of quantum phase transition in the entanglement entropy across an
NFL to FL transition. Furthermore, we employ the method to obtain nontrivial
system-size scaling of entanglement in an interacting diffusive metal described
by a chain of SYK dots.

kpc long ionized gas tail and pointing away from the cluster center. The HI
mass seen in emission is (1.32 $ \pm 0.13) \times 10^{9} \rm M_{\odot}$, mostly
located in the tail. The northern part of the galaxy disk has retained some HI
gas, while the southern part has already been completely stripped and displaced
into an extended unilateral tail. Comparing the distribution and kinematics of

Moreover, we observe associated HI absorption against the 11 mJy central radio
continuum source with an estimated HI absorption column density of 3.2 $\times

wing towards higher velocities. We modelled the HI absorption by assuming that
the HI and ionized gas disks have the same kinematics in front of the central

observed asymmetric absorption profile can therefore be explained by a clumpy,
rotating HI gas disk seen partially in front of the central continuum source,

that the HI-halo mass relation is not a simple monotonic function, as assumed

total HI gas mass shows strong dependence on the halo richness, with larger HI
masses in groups with more members at fixed halo masses. Moreover, halos with
at least three member galaxies in the group catalog have a sharp decrease of
the HI mass, potentially caused by the virial halo shock-heating and the AGN
feedback. The dominant contribution of the HI gas comes from the central
galaxies for halos of $M<10^{12.5}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, while the satellite
galaxies dominate over more massive halos. Our measurements are consistent with
a three-phase formation scenario of the HI-rich galaxies. The smooth cold gas
accretion is driving the HI mass growth in halos of
$M<10^{11.8}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, with late-forming halos having more HI accreted.

oscillators, it is infeasible to numerically calculate or experimentally
measure the average lifetime, so the chimera states are practically permanent.
We find that small perturbations in the third dimension, which make system
""slightly"" three-dimensional, will reduce dramatically the transient lifetime.
In particular, under such a perturbation, the practically infinite average
transient lifetime will become extremely short, because it scales with the
magnitude of the perturbation only logarithmically. Physically, this means that
a reduction in the perturbation strength over many orders of magnitude, insofar
as it is not zero, would result in only an incremental increase in the
lifetime. The uncovered type of fragility of chimera states raises concerns
about their observability in physical systems.

analytical gradient formulas for the GBS distribution, which can be used to
train devices using standard methods based on gradient descent. We introduce a
parametrization of the distribution that allows the gradient to be estimated by
sampling from the same device that is being optimized. In the case of training
using a Kullback-Leibler divergence or log-likelihood cost function, we show
that gradients can be computed classically, leading to fast training. We

from the accretion disk - of ~ 900 extreme variability quasars (EVQs, with
maximum flux variations more than 1 mag) over an observed-frame baseline of ~
16 years using public data from the SDSS Stripe 82, PanSTARRS-1 and the Dark
Energy Survey. We classify the multi-year long-term light curves of EVQs into
three categories roughly in the order of decreasing smoothness: monotonic
decreasing or increasing (3.7%), single broad peak and dip (56.8%), and more
complex patterns (39.5%). The rareness of monotonic cases suggests that the
major mechanisms driving the extreme optical variability do not operate over
timescales much longer than a few years. Simulated light curves with a damped
random walk model generally under-predict the first two categories with
smoother long-term trends. Despite the different long-term behaviors of these
EVQs, there is little dependence of the long-term trend on the physical
properties of quasars, such as their luminosity, BH mass, and Eddington ratio.
The large dynamic range of optical flux variability over multi-year timescales
of these EVQs allows us to explore the ensemble correlation between the
short-term (< 6 months) variability and the seasonal-average flux across the
decade-long baseline (the rms-mean flux relation). We find that unlike the
results for X-ray variability studies, the linear short-term flux variations do
not scale with the seasonal-average flux, indicating different mechanisms that
drive the short-term flickering and long-term extreme variability of accretion
disk emission. Finally, we present a sample of 16 EVQs, where the approximately
bell-shaped large amplitude variation in the light curve can be reasonably well
fit by a simple microlensing model.

the root finding method of Weierstrass, a root finder that tries to approximate
all roots of a given polynomial in parallel (in the Jacobi version, i.e., with
parallel updates). This method has a good reputation for finding all roots in
practice except in obvious cases of symmetry, but very little is known about
its global dynamics and convergence properties. We show that the Weierstrass
method, like the well known Newton method, is not generally convergent: there
are open sets of polynomials $p$ of every degree $d \ge 3$ such that the
dynamics of the Weierstrass method applied to $p$ exhibits attracting periodic
orbits. Specifically, all polynomials sufficiently close to $Z^3 + Z + 180$
have attracting cycles of period $4$. Here, period $4$ is minimal: we show that
for cubic polynomials, there are no periodic orbits of length $2$ or $3$ that
attract open sets of starting points. We also establish another convergence
problem for the Weierstrass method: for almost every polynomial of degree $d\ge
3$ there are orbits that are defined for all iterates but converge to $\infty$;
this is a problem that does not occur for Newton's method. Our results are
obtained by first interpreting the original problem coming from numerical
mathematics in terms of higher-dimensional complex dynamics, then phrasing the

challenging issue. However, some domains such as traffic optimization are
inherently non-stationary. Causes for and effects of this are manifold. In
particular, when dealing with traffic signal controls, addressing
non-stationarity is key since traffic conditions change over time and as a
function of traffic control decisions taken in other parts of a network. In
this paper we analyze the effects that different sources of non-stationarity
have in a network of traffic signals, in which each signal is modeled as a
learning agent. More precisely, we study both the effects of changing the
\textit{context} in which an agent learns (e.g., a change in flow rates
experienced by it), as well as the effects of reducing agent observability of
the true environment state. Partial observability may cause distinct states (in
which distinct actions are optimal) to be seen as the same by the traffic
signal agents. This, in turn, may lead to sub-optimal performance. We show that
the lack of suitable sensors to provide a representative observation of the
real state seems to affect the performance more drastically than the changes to
the underlying traffic patterns.

applications like road extraction, hydrological modeling, flood mapping, and
surface analysis. A number of studies in flooding suggest the usage of
high-resolution DEMs as inputs in the applications improve the overall
reliability and accuracy. Despite the importance of high-resolution DEM, many
areas in the United States and the world do not have access to high-resolution
DEM due to technological limitations or the cost of the data collection. With
recent development in Graphical Processing Units (GPU) and novel algorithms,
deep learning techniques have become attractive to researchers for their
performance in learning features from high-resolution datasets. Numerous new
methods have been proposed such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
create intelligent models that correct and augment large-scale datasets. In
this paper, a GAN based model is developed and evaluated, inspired by single
image super-resolution methods, to increase the spatial resolution of a given
DEM dataset up to 4 times without additional information related to data.

These virtual mosaics are our present objects of study. In this paper, we
provide a set of moves that can be performed on virtual mosaics that preserve

now that attempt to squeeze more computation out of these machines. In this
spirit, we design a method to boost the computational power of near-term
quantum computers by adapting protocols used in quantum error correction to
implement ""Approximate Quantum Error Correction (AQEC)."" By approximating
fully-fledged error correction mechanisms, we can increase the compute volume
(qubits $\times$ gates, or ""Simple Quantum Volume (SQV)"") of near-term
machines. The crux of our design is a fast hardware decoder that can
approximately decode detected error syndromes rapidly. Specifically, we
demonstrate a proof-of-concept that approximate error decoding can be
accomplished online in near-term quantum systems by designing and implementing
a novel algorithm in Single-Flux Quantum (SFQ) superconducting logic
technology. This avoids a critical decoding backlog, hidden in all offline
decoding schemes, that leads to idle time exponential in the number of T gates
in a program.
  Our design utilizes one SFQ processing module per physical qubit. Employing
state-of-the-art SFQ synthesis tools, we show that the circuit area, power, and
latency are within the constraints of contemporary quantum system designs.
Under pure dephasing error models, the proposed accelerator and AQEC solution
is able to expand SQV by factors between 3,402 and 11,163 on expected near-term

of $\sim$ $5\%, 4.75\%, 4.5\%,$ and $3.5\%$ physical error-rates for code

the evaluation of a game-based fitness function to be used within the COEGAN

By
splitting a blockchain into several parallel-run committees (shards), it helps
increase transaction throughput, reduce computational resources required, and
increase reward expectation for participants. Recently, several flexible
sharding methods that can tolerate up to $n/2$ Byzantine nodes ($n/2$ security
level) have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from three main
drawbacks. First, in a non-sharding blockchain, nodes can have different weight
(power or stake) to create a consensus, and as such an adversary needs to
control half of the overall weight in order to manipulate the system ($p/2$
security level). In blockchain sharding, all nodes carry the same weight. Thus,
it is only under the assumption that honest participants create as many nodes
as they should that a $n/2$ security level blockchain sharding reaches the
$p/2$ security level. Second, when some nodes leave the system, other nodes
need to be reassigned, frequently, from shard to shard in order to maintain the
security level. This has an adverse effect on system performance. Third, while
some $n/2$ approaches can maintain data integrity with up to $n/2$ Byzantine
nodes, their systems can halt with a smaller number of Byzantine nodes. In this
paper, we present a $p/2$ security level blockchain sharding approach that does
not require honest participants to create multiple nodes, requires less node
reassignment when some nodes leave the system, and can prevent the system from
halting. Our experiments show that our new approach outperforms existing
blockchain sharding approaches in terms of security, transaction throughput and
flexibility.

two different models of dark matter: cold dark matter (CDM) and thermal warm
dark matter (WDM), and study how they impact the epoch of reionization (EoR)
and its 21-cm observables. Using a suite of simulations, we find that in the
WDM scenarios, the structure formation on small scales gets suppressed
resulting in a smaller number of low mass dark matter halos compared to the CDM
scenario. Assuming that the efficiency of sources in producing ionizing photons
remain the same, this leads to a lower number of total ionizing photons
produced at any given cosmic time and thus in a delay in the reionization
process. We also find visual differences in the neutral hydrogen (HI) topology
and in 21-cm maps in case of the WDM compared to the CDM. However, differences
in the 21-cm power spectra, at the same neutral fraction, are found to be
small. Thus, we focus on the non-Gaussianity in the EoR 21-cm signal,
quantified through its bispectrum. We find that the 21-cm bispectra (driven by
the HI topology) are significantly different in WDM models when compared with
CDM, even for same mass averaged neutral fractions. This establishes that the
21-cm bispectrum is a unique and promising way to differentiate between
different dark matter models, and can be used to constrain the nature of the

find that the exogenous events influence conversation volume and virality less,
while having high influence on user responsiveness. Interestingly, we observe a
shift in the influence that exogenous events have on fans immediately following
the only goal scored in the game. The emotional resilience of fans of the
advantaged team increased following this exogenous shock. In contrast, the

that user engagement and emotional resilience of an online population holding

fluids or solutions of high molecular water-soluble polymer chains. A sheet is
produced by the impact of a drop on a quartz plate covered with a thin layer of
liquid nitrogen that suppresses shear viscous dissipation thanks to an inverse
Leidenfrost effect. The sheet expands radially until reaching a maximum
diameter and subsequently recedes. Experiments indicate the presence of two
expansion regimes: the capillary regime, where the maximum expansion is
controlled by surface tension forces and does not depend on the viscosity, and
the viscous regime, where the expansion is reduced with increasing viscosity.
In the viscous regime, the sheet expansion for polymeric samples is strongly
enhanced as compared to that of Newtonian samples with comparable zero-shear
viscosity. We show that data for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids collapse on
a unique master curve where the maximum expansion factor is plotted against the
relevant effective biaxial extensional Ohnesorge number that depends on fluid
density, surface tension and the biaxial extensional viscosity. For Newtonian
fluids, this biaxial extensional viscosity is six times the shear viscosity. By
contrast, for the non- Newtonian fluids, a characteristic Weissenberg
number-dependent biaxial extensional viscosity is identified, which is in
quantitative agreement with experimental and theoretical results reported in
the literature for biaxial extensional flows of polymeric liquids.

condensate confined in a ""racetrack"" potential by stirring with a wide

We present the results of a large set of simulations where racetrack
condensates stirred with a barrier under varying conditions of barrier height,
stir speed, racetrack geometry, and temperature. We found that stirring was
readily able to produce circulation in ring and non-ring geometries but that
the exact amount of flow produced was complicated. We therefore also studied
the mechanism by which flow was produced in the stirring process. We found that
circulation was induced by the swap of a vortex/anti-vortex pair that was
initially created by backflow of the condensate in the region of depressed
density by the barrier. When the barrier strength reached a critical value a
number of these vortex-swap events occurred in rapid succession so that flow
speed of the circulation produced was enough to exceed the stir speed of the
barrier. Flow that was initially localized in the vortices involved in the
vortex swap was converted into macroscopic flow around the racetrack by pairs
of disturbances each generated during the vortex swap. Each pair consisted of a
vortex/anti-vortex pair moving in the anti-stir direction and a compression
wave moving in the stir direction. This picture of the mechanism for making
flow will enable the design of stirring schedules that create a desired amount
of flow.

phase diagrams corresponding to multidimensional parameter spaces of
Hamiltonians was performed using a combination of basic physical principles,
analytical approximations, and extensive numerical modeling. However,
exploration of complex multidimensional parameter spaces is subject to the
classic dimensionality problem, and the behaviors of interest concentrated on

combination of exploration and exploration-exploitation with Gaussian process
modeling and Bayesian optimization allows effective exploration of the
parameter space for lattice Hamiltonians, and effectively maps the regions at
which specific macroscopic functionalities or local structures are maximized.
We argue that this approach is general and can be further extended well beyond

on social networks based solely on their network connectivity with other users.
Removing such accounts is a core task for maintaining the integrity of social
networks, and early detection helps to reduce the harm that such accounts
inflict. However, new fake accounts are notoriously difficult to detect via
graph-based algorithms, as their small number of connections are unlikely to
reflect a significant structural difference from those of new real accounts. We
present the SybilEdge algorithm, which determines whether a new user is a fake
account (`sybil') by aggregating over (I) her choices of friend request targets
and (II) these targets' respective responses. SybilEdge performs this
aggregation giving more weight to a user's choices of targets to the extent
that these targets are preferred by other fakes versus real users, and also to
the extent that these targets respond differently to fakes versus real users.
We show that SybilEdge rapidly detects new fake users at scale on the Facebook
network and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We also show that
SybilEdge is robust to label noise in the training data, to different
prevalences of fake accounts in the network, and to several different ways
fakes can select targets for their friend requests. To our knowledge, this is
the first time a graph-based algorithm has been shown to achieve high
performance (AUC>0.9) on new users who have only sent a small number of friend
requests.

must be balanced against pressing public health needs. When the goal is
screening for infectious disease, one approach is group testing in which
samples are initially tested in pools and individual samples are retested only
if the initial pooled test was positive. Intuitively, if the prevalence of
infection is small, this could result in a large reduction of the total number
of tests required. Despite this, the use of group testing in medical studies
has been limited, largely due to skepticism about the impact of pooling on the
accuracy of a given assay. While there is a large body of research addressing
the issue of testing errors in group testing studies, it is customary to assume
that the misclassification parameters are known from an external population
and/or that the values do not change with the group size. Both of these
assumptions are highly questionable for many medical practitioners considering
group testing in their study design. In this article, we explore how the
failure of these assumptions might impact the efficacy of a group testing
design and, consequently, whether group testing is currently feasible for
medical screening. Specifically, we look at how incorrect assumptions about the
sensitivity function at the design stage can lead to poor estimation of a
procedure's overall sensitivity and expected number of tests. Furthermore, if a
validation study is used to estimate the pooled misclassification parameters of
a given assay, we show that the sample sizes required are so large as to be

Likewise, coherent microwave-to-optical conversion of single photons would
enable the exchange of quantum states between remotely connected
superconducting quantum processors, a promising quantum computing hardware
platform. Despite the prospects of quantum networking, maintaining the fragile
quantum state in such a conversion process with superconducting qubits has
remained elusive. Here we demonstrate the conversion of a microwave-frequency
excitation of a superconducting transmon qubit into an optical photon. We
achieve this using an intermediary nanomechanical resonator which converts the
electrical excitation of the qubit into a single phonon by means of a
piezoelectric interaction, and subsequently converts the phonon to an optical
photon via radiation pressure. We demonstrate optical photon generation from
the qubit with a signal-to-noise greater than unity by recording quantum Rabi
oscillations of the qubit through single-photon detection of the emitted light
over an optical fiber. With proposed improvements in the device and external
measurement set-up, such quantum transducers may lead to practical devices
capable of realizing new hybrid quantum networks, and ultimately, distributed
quantum computers.

is reminiscent of previous dust continuum results that the solid disk mass
scales with $M_\star$. The weaker [Fe/H] dependence shows that sub-Neptune
planets, unlike giant planets, form readily in lower-metallicity environment.
The innermost region ($a<$ 0.1AU) of a MMEN maintains a smooth profile despite
a steep decline of planet occurrence rate: a result that favors the truncation
of disks by co-rotating magnetospheres with a range of rotation periods, rather
than the sublimation of dusts. The $\Sigma$ of {\it Kepler} multi-transiting
systems shows a much stronger correlation with $M_\star$ and [Fe/H] than
singles. This suggests that the dynamically hot evolution that produced single
systems also partially removed the memory of formation in disks.
Radial-velocity planets yielded a MMEN very similar to CKS planets;
transit-timing-variation planets' postulated convergent migration history is
supported by their poorly constrained MMEN. We found that lower-mass stars have
a higher efficiency of forming/retaining planets: for sun-like stars about 20\%
of the solid mass within $\sim$1AU are converted/preserved as sub-Neptunes,
compared to 70\% for late-K-early-M stars. This may be due to the lower binary
fraction, lower giant-planet occurrence or the longer disk lifetime of
lower-mass stars.

probabilities of crossing terrace edges. First, we consider a symmetric case in
which the interactions of adatoms of the same species are the same for the two
components. For low and intermediate temperatures, we show the formation of
narrow domains, whose widths are $3$-$30$ lattice constants, which meander in
the layers parallel to the substrate, and are connected through very long
distances. The domain width depends on the diffusivity-flux ratio of the same
species, but it is weakly affected by interactions of different species, so
rough estimates of that width can be obtained by using tabulated properties of
films with a single component. At high temperatures, the separation of domains
is enhanced, but their long distance connectivity is lost, which shows that the
formation of the long meandering domains is restricted to a certain range of
temperature and flux. Similar morphological features are obtained when the
intra-species interactions are different and the adatom diffusion coefficients
on terraces of the same species differ up to two orders of magnitude. An
approximate scaling relation for the domain width is obtained, but the species

  We show that, in our setting, the number of patterns of interest is
upper-bounded by $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. We
introduce a baseline algorithm, running in $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time, which
identifies all patterns of interest satisfying certain minimality conditions,
for all colors in the string. For the case where one is interested in patterns
related to one color only, we also provide a second algorithm which runs in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2\log n)$ time in the worst case but is faster than the baseline
algorithm in practice. Both solutions use suffix trees, and the second
algorithm also uses an appropriately defined priority queue, which allows us to
reduce the number of computations. We performed an experimental evaluation of
the proposed approaches over both synthetic and real-world datasets, and found
that the second algorithm outperforms the first algorithm on all simulated
data, while on the real-world data, the performance varies between a slight
slowdown (on half of the datasets) and a speedup by a factor of up to 11.

of each atom or molecule is chosen according to a set of stochastic rules
before the incidence of another atom or molecule. Here we investigate the
possibility of a LM model to reproduce features of a more realistic approach
that represents the interplay of collective adatom diffusion and the external
flux. In the LM model introduced here, each adatom may execute $G$ hops to
neighboring columns of the deposit, but a hop attempt from a site with $n$
lateral neighbors has probability $P^n$, with $P<1$. These rules resemble those
of the Clarke-Vvedensky (CV) model without energy barriers at step edges, whose
main parameters are the diffusion-to-deposition ratio $R$ on terraces and the
detachment probability $\epsilon$ per lateral neighbor. At short times, the
roughness of the LM model can be written in terms of a scaling function of $G$
and $P$ and the growth exponent is consistent with the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma
universality class. The evolution of the surface roughness and of the
autocorrelation function of the CV model is reproduced with reasonable accuracy
by the LM model with suitable choices of parameters. The increase of the
parameters $G$ and $R$ of those models produces smoother film surfaces, while
the increase of $P$ and $\epsilon$ smoothen the terrace boundaries at short
lengthscales. However, the detachment probabilities of the two models have very
different effects on the surface roughness: in the LM model, for fixed $G$, the
surface roughness increases as $P$ increases; in the CV model, the surface
smoothens as $\epsilon$ increases, for fixed $R$. This result is related to the
non-Markovian nature of the LM model, since the diffusivity of an adatom
depends on its history at the film surface and may be severely reduced after a
detachment from a terrace step.

superimposition of two distinct frequencies and referred to as DTMF (dual tone
multi-frequency). Further, the mechanical arm is handled via the DTMF tone.
Also, the acquired tone at the receiver is taken into a micro-controller

module unwinds the DTMF signal into its corresponding two bit representation
and then the matched number is transmitted to the micro-controller. The

estimate the value of disease avoidance using an epidemiological model that
projects the spread of COVID-19 across rich and poor countries. Social
distancing measures that ""flatten the curve"" of the disease to bring demand
within the capacity of healthcare systems are predicted to save many lives in
high-income countries, such that practically any economic cost is worth
bearing. These social distancing policies are estimated to be less effective in
poor countries with younger populations less susceptible to COVID-19, and more
limited healthcare systems, which were overwhelmed before the pandemic.
Moreover, social distancing lowers disease risk by limiting people's economic
opportunities. Poorer people are less willing to make those economic
sacrifices. They place relatively greater value on their livelihood concerns
compared to contracting COVID-19. Not only are the epidemiological and economic
benefits of social distancing much smaller in poorer countries, such policies
may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the
informal sector lack the resources and social protections to isolate themselves
and sacrifice economic opportunities until the virus passes. By limiting their
ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger,
deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity. Rather than a blanket
adoption of social distancing measures, we advocate for the exploration of
alternative harm-reduction strategies, including universal mask adoption and
increased hygiene measures.

whether the interactions of monovalent ions Na^+ and Cl^- ,with the neutral
heads of phospholipids are impactful enough to change the membrane rigidity is
still a mystery. To provide a resolution to this long simmering debate, we
investigated the dynamics of DOPC vesicles in the fluid phase with increasing
external salt concentration. At higher salt concentrations, we observe an
increase in bending rigidity from neutron spin echo spectroscopy (NSE) and an
increase in bilayer thickness from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We
compared different models to distinguish membrane undulations, lipid tail
motions and the translational diffusion of the vesicles. All the models
indicate an increase in bending rigidity by a factor of 1.3 to 3.6. We
demonstrate that even for t > 10 ns, and for Q > 0.07 1/{\AA} the observed NSE
relaxation spectra is clearly influenced by the translational diffusion of the
vesicles. For t < 5 ns, the lipid tail motions dominate the intermediate
dynamic structure factor. As the salt concentration increases this contribution
diminishes. We introduced a new time-dependent analysis for the bending
rigidity that highlights only a limited Zilman-Granek time window where the
rigidity is physically meaningful.

a gapped surface state. Analytical formulation suggests that the hybridization
gap scales exponentially with decrease in number of layers while the system
oscillates between topologically trivial and non-trivial insulators. This work
explores the transport properties of a 3D TI in the inter-surface hybridization
regime. By experimentally probing the hybridization gap as a function of
BiSbTeSe2 thickness using three different methods, we map the crossover from
the 3D to 2D state. In the 2D topological state, we observe a finite
longitudinal conductance at ~2e2/h when the Fermi level is aligned within the
surface gap, indicating a quantum spin Hall (QSH) state. Additionally, we study
the response of trivial and non-trivial hybridization gapped states modulated
by external out-of-plane magnetic and electric fields. Our revelations of
surface gap-closing and/or reopening features are strongly indicative of
topological phase transitions (TPTs) in the hybridization gap regime, realizing

'time-diffraction' is observed whereupon the temporal profile of the field
envelope at a fixed axial plane corresponds to a segment of the spatial
propagation profile of a monochromatic field sharing the initial spatial
profile and observed at the same axial plane. Time-averaging, which is
intrinsic to observing the intensity, altogether veils this effect.

and partially heterogeneous systems. First, heterogeneous systems composed of
different subsystems that are interconnected over a directed graph are
considered. Techniques from robust and gain-scheduled controller synthesis are
employed, in particular the full-block S-procedure, to deal with the
decentralized system part in a nominal condition and with the interconnection
part in a multiplier condition. Under some structural assumptions, we can
decompose the synthesis conditions into conditions that are the size of the
individual subsystems. To solve these decomposed synthesis conditions that are
coupled only over neighboring subsystems, we propose a distributed method based
on the alternating direction method of multipliers. It only requires
nearest-neighbor communication and no central coordination is needed. Then, a
new classification of systems is introduced that consists of groups of
homogeneous subsystems with different interconnection types. This
classification includes heterogeneous systems as the most general and
homogeneous systems as the most specific case. Based on this classification, we
show how the interconnected system model and the decomposed synthesis
conditions can be formulated in a more compact way. The computational
scalability of the presented methods with respect to a growing number of
subsystems and interconnections is analyzed, and the results are demonstrated
in numerical examples.

with complex interfaces in the computational domain. This paper will firstly
investigate the performance of using DeepDDM for elliptic problems, including a

DeepDDM exhibits behaviors consistent with conventional DDM: the number of

velocity gradient along filament S242 has been detected; the relative velocity
between the two end-clumps is $\sim$ 3 km s$^{-1}$, indicating an approaching
motion between them. These signatures are consistent with the filament S242
being formed through the collapse of a single elongated entity, where an effect
known as ""gravitational focusing"" drives the ends of the filament to collapse
(edge collapse). Based on this picture, we estimate a collapse timescale of
$\sim$ 4.2 Myr, which is the time needed for a finite and elongated entity
evolving to the observed filament S242. For the whole filament, we find that
increases in surface densities lead to increases in velocity dispersion, which
can be consistently explained as the result of self-gravity. We also calculated
the contribution of longitudinal collapse to the observed velocity dispersion
and found it to be the dominant effect in driving the gas motion near the
end-clumps. We propose that our filament S242 is formed through a two-stage
collapse model, where the edge collapse of a truncated filament is followed by
a stage of longitudinal accretion toward the dense end-clumps.

combination of cross entropy loss, center loss and autoencoder loss, as well as
adopting a suitable distance metric space such that semantic features have
greater minimal inter-class distance than maximal intra-class distance. The
proposed SR2CNN can discriminate signals even if no training data is available

of signal detection, because of constantly refined class center vectors in
semantic feature space. These merits are all verified by extensive experiments.

a flow is facilitated by the cone jet that is powered by H+ and flows out of

established later and forced to take the outer route. This spontaneous
arrangement of two-way flow is revealed by using fluorescein and carbon powder

found to carry non-equal flux that results in a net transport of water to the

of these co-axial flows as a function of time and applied voltage. Note that
the water on the outer layer functions as a millimeter tube that confines and

disturbances. They are closely associated with various eruptions, and can used
for the global coronal seismology and the acceleration of solar energetic
particles. Hence, the study of EUV waves plays an important role in solar
eruptions and Space Weather. Here we present an EUV wave associated with a
filament activation that did not evolve into any eruption. Due to the
continuous magnetic flux emergence and cancellation around its one end, the
filament rose with untwisting motion, and the filament mass flowed towards
another end along the rising fields. Intriguingly, following the filament
activation, an EUV wave formed with a fast constant speed ($\sim$500 km
s$^{-1}$) ahead of the mass flow, and the overlying coronal loops expanded both
in lateral and radial directions. Excluding the possibility of a remote flare
and an absent coronal mass ejection, we suggest that the EUV wave was only
closely associated with the filament activation. Furthermore, their intimate
spacial and temporal relationship indicates that the EUV wave was likely
directly triggered by the lateral expansion of overlying loops. We propose that
the EUV wave can be interpreted as linear fast-mode wave, and the most vital
key for the successful generation of the EUV wave is the impulsive early-phase
lateral expansion of overlying loops that was driven by the activated filament
mass flow without any eruption.

learning transferable representations from a well-labeled source domain to a
different but related unlabeled target domain. Most existing works assume
source and target data share the identical label space, which is often
difficult to be satisfied in many real-world applications. With the emergence
of big data, there is a more practical scenario called partial domain
adaptation, where we are always accessible to a more large-scale source domain
while working on a relative small-scale target domain. In this case, the
conventional domain adaptation assumption should be relaxed, and the target
label space tends to be a subset of the source label space. Intuitively,
reinforcing the positive effects of the most relevant source subclasses and
reducing the negative impacts of irrelevant source subclasses are of vital
importance to address partial domain adaptation challenge. This paper proposes
an efficiently-implemented Deep Residual Correction Network (DRCN) by plugging
one residual block into the source network along with the task-specific feature
layer, which effectively enhances the adaptation from source to target and
explicitly weakens the influence from the irrelevant source classes.
Specifically, the plugged residual block, which consists of several
fully-connected layers, could deepen basic network and boost its feature
representation capability correspondingly. Moreover, we design a weighted
class-wise domain alignment loss to couple two domains by matching the feature
distributions of shared classes between source and target. Comprehensive
experiments on partial, traditional and fine-grained cross-domain visual
recognition demonstrate that DRCN is superior to the competitive deep domain
adaptation approaches.

a Milstein scheme to solve the equations numerically and we obtain the strong
rates of convergence for both schemes in $L^{p}$ norm for any $p\geq 1$. For
the $\theta$-Euler-Maruyama scheme the rate is
$\min\{1-\alpha,\frac{1}{2}-\beta\}~ % (0<\alpha<1, 0< \beta<\frac{1}{2})$ and
for the Milstein scheme the rate is $\min\{1-\alpha,1-2\beta\}$ when
$\alpha\neq \frac 12$, where $(0<\alpha<1, 0< \beta<\frac{1}{2})$. These
results on the rates of convergence are significantly different from that of
the similar schemes for the stochastic Volterra integral equations with regular

techniques in this area have focused on image-only or text-only approaches,
limiting detection performance and impacting the quality of information

introduce a cross-attention module that can filter uninformative and misleading

employ a multimodal graph-based approach to stochastically transition between
embeddings of different multimodal pairs during training to better regularize
the learning process as well as dealing with limited training data by
constructing new matched pairs from different samples. We show that our method
outperforms the unimodal approaches and strong multimodal baselines by a large

the associated reduced scheme $X=Y_{red}$ is smooth, irreducible, and that $Y$
can be locally embedded in a smooth variety of dimension $\dim(X)+1$. If $n$ is
the multiplicity of $Y$, there is a canonical filtration $X=X_1\subset
X_2\subset\cdots\subset X_n=Y$, such that $X_i$ is a primitive multiple scheme
of multiplicity $i$. The simplest example is the trivial primitive multiple
scheme of multiplicity $n$ associated to a line bundle $L$ on $X$: it is the
$n$-th infinitesimal neighborhood of $X$, embedded if the line bundle $L^*$ by
the zero section.
  Let ${\bf Z}_n={spec}(C[t]/(t^n))$. The primitive multiple schemes of
multiplicity $n$ are obtained by taking an open cover $(U_i)$ of a smooth
variety $X$ and by gluing the schemes $U_i\times{\bf Z}_n$ using automorphisms
of $U_{ij}\times {\bf Z}_n$ that leave $U_{ij}$ invariant. This leads to the
study of the sheaf of nonabelian groups $G_n$ of automorphisms of $X\times {\bf
Z}_n$ that leave the $X$ invariant, and to the study of its first cohomology
set. If $n\geq 2$ there is an obstruction to the extension of $X_n$ to a
primitive multiple scheme of multiplicity $n+1$, which lies in the second
cohomology group $H^2(X,E)$ of a suitable vector bundle $E$ on $X$.
  In this paper we study these obstructions and the parametrization of
primitive multiple schemes. As an example we show that if $X=P_m$ with $m>=3$
all the primitive multiple schemes are trivial. If $X=P_2$, there are only two
non trivial primitive multiple schemes, of multiplicities $2$ and $4$, which
are not quasi-projective. On the other hand, if $X$ is a projective bundle over
a curve, we show that there are infinite sequences $X=X_1\subset
X_2\subset\cdots\subset X_n\subset X_{n+1}\subset\cdots$ of non trivial
primitive multiple schemes.

compressively driven (but subsonic) collisionless turbulence is investigated by
means of nonlinear hybrid gyrokinetic simulations. We derive a prescription for
the ion-to-electron heating ratio $Q_\rmi/Q_\rme$ as a function of the
compressive-to-Alfv\'enic driving power ratio $P_\compr/P_\AW$, of the ratio of
ion thermal pressure to magnetic pressure $\beta_\rmi$, and of the ratio of
ion-to-electron background temperatures $T_\rmi/T_\rme$. It is shown that
$Q_\rmi/Q_\rme$ is an increasing function of $P_\compr/P_\AW$. When the
compressive driving is sufficiently large, $Q_\rmi/Q_\rme$ approaches $\simeq
P_\compr/P_\AW$. This indicates that, in turbulence with large compressive
fluctuations, the partition of heating is decided at the injection scales,
rather than at kinetic scales. Analysis of phase-space spectra shows that the
energy transfer from inertial-range compressive fluctuations to
sub-Larmor-scale kinetic Alfv\'en waves is absent for both low and high
$\beta_\rmi$, meaning that the compressive driving is directly connected to the
ion entropy fluctuations, which are converted into ion thermal energy. This
result suggests that preferential electron heating is a very special case
requiring low $\beta_\rmi$ and no, or weak, compressive driving. Our heating
prescription has wide-ranging applications, including to the solar wind and to
hot accretion disks such as M87 and Sgr A*.

  The novel Coronavirus also called COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China in
December 2019 and has now spread across the world. It has so far infected
around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114,698 lives overall. As
the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing
shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits
and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep
Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19
cases using chest X-rays.
  Methods
  In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model
to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The
proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet
dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and
other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available
databases.
  Results and Conclusion
  CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the
experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy
of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases
are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia
viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal),
the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary
results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more
training data becomes available. Overall, the proposed model substantially
advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic,
it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid
them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.

representation learning; on the other hand, the feature mismatch problem caused
by low-level visual variations greatly reduces retrieval performance. An
intuitive solution to this problem is to utilize low-level image restoration
methods to improve the image quality. However, existing restoration methods
cannot directly serve to real-world Re-ID due to various limitations, e.g., the
requirements of reference samples, domain gap between synthesis and reality,
and incompatibility between low-level and high-level methods. In this paper, to
solve the above problem, we propose a degradation invariance learning framework
for real-world person Re-ID. By introducing a self-supervised disentangled
representation learning strategy, our method is able to simultaneously extract
identity-related robust features and remove real-world degradations without
extra supervision. We use low-resolution images as the main demonstration, and
experiments show that our approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several Re-ID benchmarks. In addition, our framework can be
easily extended to other real-world degradation factors, such as weak
illumination, with only a few modifications.

However, there still exists two main challenges: 1) many methods suffer from
false positives in their text representations; 2) the large scale variance of
scene texts makes it hard for network to learn samples. In this paper, we
propose the ContourNet, which effectively handles these two problems taking a
further step toward accurate arbitrary-shaped text detection. At first, a
scale-insensitive Adaptive Region Proposal Network (Adaptive-RPN) is proposed
to generate text proposals by only focusing on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) values between predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes. Then a novel
Local Orthogonal Texture-aware Module (LOTM) models the local texture
information of proposal features in two orthogonal directions and represents
text region with a set of contour points. Considering that the strong
unidirectional or weakly orthogonal activation is usually caused by the
monotonous texture characteristic of false-positive patterns (e.g. streaks.),
our method effectively suppresses these false positives by only outputting
predictions with high response value in both orthogonal directions. This gives
more accurate description of text regions. Extensive experiments on three
challenging datasets (Total-Text, CTW1500 and ICDAR2015) verify that our method
achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

addition, these p-wave pairings shed light on resolving the contradiction

formation of massive solid planets, such as the cores of giant planets and
super-Earths. So, far, this process has been studied under the assumption that
dust coagulates and drifts throughout the full protoplanetary disk. However,
observations show that many disks are structured in rings that may be due to
pressure maxima, preventing the global radial drift of the dust.
  Aims: We study how the pebble-accretion paradigm changes if the dust is
confined in a ring.
  Results: Planet Type-I migration is stopped in a ring, but not necessarily at
its center. If the entropy-driven corotation torque is desaturated, the planet
is located in a region with a low density of dust, which severely limits its
accretion rate. If instead the planet is near the ring's center, its accretion
rate can be similar to the one it would have in a classic (ring-less) disk of
equivalent dust density. However, the growth rate of the planet is limited by
the diffusion of dust in the ring and the final planet's mass is bounded by the
total ring's mass. The DSHARP rings are too far from the star to allow the
formation of massive planets within the disk's lifetime. However, a similar
ring rescaled to 5 AU could lead to the formation of a planet incorporating the
full ring's mass in less than 1/2 My.
  Conclusions: The existence of rings may not be an obstacle to planet
formation by pebble-accretion. However, for accretion to be effective the
resting position of the planet has to be relatively near the ring's center and
the ring needs to be not too far from the central star. The formation of
planets in rings can explain the existence of giant planets with core masses
smaller than the so-called pebble isolation mass.

most informative unlabeled samples. The SRAAL consists of a representation
generator and a state discriminator. The generator uses the complementary
annotation information with traditional reconstruction information to generate
the unified representation of samples, which embeds the semantic into the whole

discriminator, which endues unlabeled samples with different importance. As a
result, we can select the most informative samples based on the discriminator's

Electron Multiplier (GEM) is a MPGD that exploits an intense electric field in
a reduced amplification region in order to prevent discharges. Several
amplification stages, like in a triple-GEM, allow to increase the detector gain
and to reduce the discharge probability. Reconstruction techniques such as

Increasing the Cu content augments the secondary phase amounts. Low quantity of

straggling workers. Straggling workers can be tolerated by assigning redundant
computations and coding across data and computations, but in most existing
schemes, each non-straggling worker transmits one message per iteration to the
parameter server (PS) after completing all its computations. Imposing such a
limitation results in two main drawbacks; over-computation due to inaccurate
prediction of the straggling behaviour, and under-utilization due to treating
workers as straggler/non-straggler and discarding partial computations carried
out by stragglers. In this paper, to overcome these drawbacks, we consider
multi-message communication (MMC) by allowing multiple computations to be

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already
created emergency situations in almost every country of the world. The disease
spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first
identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreaks
starts on $2^{nd}$ March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing
exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific
medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission
mechanism of the disease also make it difficult to fight against the disease
properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease
dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in
reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to
describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. We
consider the initial phase of the outbreak situation in India and our proposed
model is fitted to the daily cumulative new reported cases during the period
$2^{nd}$ March, 2020 to $24^{th}$ March, 2020. We estimate the basic
reproduction number $(R_0)$, effective reproduction number (R(t)) and epidemic
doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We
further assess the effect of preventive measures such as spread of awareness,
lock-down, proper hand sanitization, etc. in reducing the new cases. Two
intervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the
intervention strength over the period of implementation. Our study suggests
that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak
within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
the strength of the intervention should be strengthened over the time to
eradicate the disease effectively.

resource to control the energy levels of quantum emitters embedded inside a
solid-state environment. Some rare-earth ion dopants provide an optical
transition which simultaneously has a narrow linewidth and is highly sensitive
to strain. In such systems, the technique of spectral hole burning, in which a
transparent window is burnt within the large inhomogeneous profile, allows to
benefit from the narrow features, which are also sensitive to strain, while
working with large ensembles of ions. However, working with ensembles may give
rise to inhomogeneous responses among different ions. We investigate
experimentally how the shape of a narrow spectral hole is modified due to
external mechanical strain, in particular, the hole broadening as a function of
the geometry of the crystal sites and the crystalline axis along which the
stress is applied. Studying these effects are essential in order to optimize
the existing applications of rare-earth doped crystals in fields which already
profit from the more well-established coherence properties of these dopants
such as frequency metrology and quantum information processing, or even suggest
novel applications of these materials, for example as robust devices for
force-sensing or highly sensitive accelerometers.

the models we develop which only allows us to place limits on disc inclination

foreground human regions. It is quite challenging and usually requires user
interactive trimaps and plenty of high quality annotated data. Annotating such
kind of data is labor intensive and requires great skills beyond normal users,
especially considering the very detailed hair part of humans. In contrast,
coarse annotated human dataset is much easier to acquire and collect from the
public dataset. In this paper, we propose to use coarse annotated data coupled
with fine annotated data to boost end-to-end semantic human matting without
trimaps as extra input. Specifically, we train a mask prediction network to
estimate the coarse semantic mask using the hybrid data, and then propose a
quality unification network to unify the quality of the previous coarse mask
outputs. A matting refinement network takes in the unified mask and the input
image to predict the final alpha matte. The collected coarse annotated dataset
enriches our dataset significantly, allows generating high quality alpha matte
for real images. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs
comparably against state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed method can
be used for refining coarse annotated public dataset, as well as semantic
segmentation methods, which reduces the cost of annotating high quality human

algebra of para-Grassmann numbers of order 2 equipped with the star product and
with the algebra of creation and annihilation operators $a_{n}^{\pm}$ obeying
the para-Fermi statistics of the same order is established. Two independent
approaches to the calculation of the Moyal product $*$ are considered. It is
shown that in calculating the matrix elements in the basis of parafermion

constantly that we work in the so-called Ohnuki and Kamefuchi's generalized
state-vector space $\mathfrak{U}_{\;G}$, whose state vectors include
para-Grassmann numbers $\xi_{k}$ in their definition, instead of the standard
state-vector space $\mathfrak{U}$ (the Fock space). Otherwise, the wide array

quadratic Casimir operators $\hat{C}_{2}$ and $\hat{C}_{2}^{\prime}$ of the

of the Casimir operators on the state vectors, an explicit form of their matrix

Ion-therapy. We already showed how BLOB (""Boltzmann-Langevin One Body""), a
model developed to simulate heavy ion interactions up to few hundreds of MeV/u,
could simulate also $^{12}$C reactions in the same energy domain. However, its
computation time is too long for any medical application. For this reason we
present the possibility of emulating it with a Deep Learning algorithm.
Methods: The BLOB final state is a Probability Density Function (PDF) of
finding a nucleon in a position of the phase space. We discretised this PDF and
trained a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to reproduce such a discrete PDF. As a
proof of concept, we developed and trained a VAE to emulate BLOB in simulating
the interactions of $^{12}$C with $^{12}$C at 62 MeV/u. To have more control on
the generation, we forced the VAE latent space to be organised with respect to
the impact parameter ($b$) training a classifier of $b$ jointly with the VAE.
Results: The distributions obtained from the VAE are similar to the input ones
and the computation time needed to use the VAE as a generator is negligible.
Conclusions: We show that it is possible to use a Deep Learning approach to
emulate a model developed to simulate nuclear reactions in the energy range of
interest for Ion-therapy. We foresee the implementation of the generation part
in C++ and to interface it with the most used Monte Carlo toolkit: Geant4.

IoU alignment operation. To obtain a perspective-invariant prediction head, we
propose an Attentive Corner Aggregation (ACA) module by aggregating a local
point cloud feature from each perspective of eight corners and adaptively
weighting the contribution of each perspective with different attentions. We
propose a Corner Geometry Encoding (CGE) module for geometry information
embedding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time geometric
embedding information has been introduced in proposal feature learning. These
two feature parts are then adaptively fused by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)

to resolve the mismatching between the bounding box regression head and IoU
prediction, thereby further enhancing the accuracy of IoU prediction. The

covering of $\text{PU}(1,1)$, given a standard Borel probability $\Gamma$-space

measurable cocycle $\sigma:\Gamma \times \Omega \rightarrow G$.
  The Toledo remains unchanged along $G$-cohomology classes and its absolute
value is bounded by the rank of $G$. This allows to define maximal measurable
cocycles. We show that the algebraic hull $\mathbf{H}$ of a maximal cocycle
$\sigma$ is reductive and the centralizer of $H=\mathbf{H}(\mathbb{R})^\circ$
is compact. If additionally $\sigma$ admits a boundary map, then $H$ is of tube
type and $\sigma$ is cohomologous to a cocycle stabilizing a unique maximal
tube-type subdomain. This result is analogous to the one obtained for

3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs)? In order to positively answer this
open question in video recognition, we have conducted an exploration study
using a couple of large-scale video datasets and 3D CNNs. In the early era of
deep neural networks, 2D CNNs have been better than 3D CNNs in the context of
video recognition. Recent studies revealed that 3D CNNs can outperform 2D CNNs
trained on a large-scale video dataset. However, we heavily rely on
architecture exploration instead of dataset consideration. Therefore, in the
present paper, we conduct exploration study in order to improve spatiotemporal
3D CNNs as follows: (i) Recently proposed large-scale video datasets help
improve spatiotemporal 3D CNNs in terms of video classification accuracy. We
reveal that a carefully annotated dataset (e.g., Kinetics-700) effectively
pre-trains a video representation for a video classification task. (ii) We
confirm the relationships between #category/#instance and video classification
accuracy. The results show that #category should initially be fixed, and then
#instance is increased on a video dataset in case of dataset construction.
(iii) In order to practically extend a video dataset, we simply concatenate
publicly available datasets, such as Kinetics-700 and Moments in Time (MiT)
datasets. Compared with Kinetics-700 pre-training, we further enhance
spatiotemporal 3D CNNs with the merged dataset, e.g., +0.9, +3.4, and +1.1 on
UCF-101, HMDB-51, and ActivityNet datasets, respectively, in terms of
fine-tuning. (iv) In terms of recognition architecture, the Kinetics-700 and
merged dataset pre-trained models increase the recognition performance to 200
layers with the Residual Network (ResNet), while the Kinetics-400 pre-trained
model cannot successfully optimize the 200-layer architecture.

antialigned $\pm \hat{z}$ polarized ferromagnetic (FM) contacts transmits no
current due to a $\pi$ phase difference of the matrix elements coupling the
spin degenerate states to the two FM contacts. The ratio of the two matrix
elements coupling the two spin degenerate $\hat{x}$ AFM states to a $\hat{z}$
FM contact is determined by the exchange energy and the eigenstate energy.
Inserting a normal metal layer or tunnel barrier layer between one FM contact
and the AFM alters this phase difference, and, due to the unequal weighting of
the two spins at the interface, it also breaks the spin degeneracy of the two
AFM states. The broken symmetry of the matrix elements combined with the broken
degeneracy of the AFM states, result in a Fano resonance in the transmission
and a turn-on of the $T_{\uparrow,\downarrow}$ transmission channel. Such a
magnetic tunnel junction geometry with two antialigned $\pm \hat{z}$ FM

analogue of the oblique polarizer in the triple polarizer experiment.

material properties, thereby affecting the overall device performance. Here, we
use two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy to reveal impulsively excited
vibrational modes of methylammonium (MA) lead iodide perovskite, which drive
the structural distortion after photoexcitation. The vibrational analysis of
the measured data allows us to directly monitor the time evolution of the
librational motion of the MA cation along with the vibrational coherences of
inorganic sublattice. Wavelet analysis of the observed vibrational coherences
uncovers the interplay between these two types of phonons. It reveals the
coherent generation of the librational motion of the MA cation within ~300 fs,
which is complemented by the coherent evolution of the skeletal motion of the
inorganic sublattice. We have employed time-dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT) to study the atomic motion of the MA cation and the inorganic
sublattice during the process of photoexcitation. The TDDFT calculations
support our experimental observations of the coherent generation of librational
motions in the MA cation and highlight the importance of the anharmonic
interaction between the MA cation and the inorganic sublattice. Our
calculations predict the transfer of the photoinduced vibrational coherence
from the MA cation to the inorganic sublattice, which drives the skeleton
motion to form a polaronic state leading to long lifetimes of the charge
carriers. This work may lead to novel design principles for next generation of

However, when encountering unknown prior information or the complicated

establishes the mapping relationship between data. In other words, the proposed
filter does not require the prior information about target dynamics and clutter

network (CNN) architecture, widely adopted and used in various tasks. In this
work we propose an improved version of ResNets. Our proposed improvements
address all three main components of a ResNet: the flow of information through
the network layers, the residual building block, and the projection shortcut.
We are able to show consistent improvements in accuracy and learning
convergence over the baseline. For instance, on ImageNet dataset, using the
ResNet with 50 layers, for top-1 accuracy we can report a 1.19% improvement
over the baseline in one setting and around 2% boost in another. Importantly,
these improvements are obtained without increasing the model complexity. Our
proposed approach allows us to train extremely deep networks, while the
baseline shows severe optimization issues. We report results on three tasks
over six datasets: image classification (ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100),
object detection (COCO) and video action recognition (Kinetics-400 and
Something-Something-v2). In the deep learning era, we establish a new milestone
for the depth of a CNN. We successfully train a 404-layer deep CNN on the
ImageNet dataset and a 3002-layer network on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, while the

successful social support requires users to engage with each other and failures
may have serious consequences for users in need. Our understanding of
engagement patterns on mental health platforms is limited but critical to
inform the role, limitations, and design of these platforms. Here, we present a
large-scale analysis of engagement patterns of 35 million posts on two popular
online mental health platforms, TalkLife and Reddit. Leveraging communication
models in human-computer interaction and communication theory, we
operationalize a set of four engagement indicators based on attention and
interaction. We then propose a generative model to jointly model these
indicators of engagement, the output of which is synthesized into a novel set
of eleven distinct, interpretable patterns. We demonstrate that this framework
of engagement patterns enables informative evaluations and analysis of online

processes of gas accretion, the capture of stars, mergers as well as
electromagnetic torque. In case of gas accretion in the presence of cooling
sources, the flow is momentum-driven, after which the black hole reaches a
saturated mass; subsequently, it grows only by stellar capture and mergers. We
model the evolution of the mass and spin with the initial seed mass and spin in
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For stellar capture, we have assumed a power-law
density profile for the stellar cusp in a framework of relativistic loss cone
theory that include the effects of black hole spin, Carter's constant, loss
cone angular momentum, and capture radius. Based on this, the predicted capture
rates of $10^{-5}$--$10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$ are closer to the observed range. We
have considered the merger activity to be effective for $z \lesssim 4$, and we
self-consistently include the Blandford-Znajek torque. We calculate these
effects on the black hole growth individually and in combination, for deriving
the evolution. Before saturation, accretion dominates the black hole growth
($\sim 95\%$ of the final mass), and subsequently, stellar capture and mergers
take over with roughly equal contribution. The simulations of the evolution of
the $M_{\bullet} - \sigma$ relation using these effects are consistent with
available observations. We run our model backward in time and retrodict the
parameters at formation. Our model will provide useful inputs for building
demographics of the black holes and in formation scenarios involving stellar

their total reward, usually provided by the environment. In many environments,
however, the reward is provided after a series of actions rather than each
single action, leading the agent to experience ambiguity in terms of whether
those actions are effective, an issue known as the credit assignment problem.
In this paper, we propose two strategies inspired by behavioural psychology to
enable the agent to intrinsically estimate more informative reward values for
actions with no reward. The first strategy, called self-punishment (SP),
discourages the agent from making mistakes that lead to undesirable terminal
states. The second strategy, called the rewards backfill (RB), backpropagates
the rewards between two rewarded actions. We prove that, under certain
assumptions and regardless of the reinforcement learning algorithm used, these
two strategies maintain the order of policies in the space of all possible
policies in terms of their total reward, and, by extension, maintain the
optimal policy. Hence, our proposed strategies integrate with any reinforcement
learning algorithm that learns a value or action-value function through
experience. We incorporated these two strategies into three popular deep
reinforcement learning approaches and evaluated the results on thirty Atari

strategies improve the tested methods in over 65 percent of tested games by up

equation with Neumann boundary conditions. A classical theorem of Casten,
Holland [19] and Matano [49] states that stable patterns do not exist in convex
domains. In this article, we show that the assumptions of convexity of the
domain and stability of the pattern in this theorem can be relaxed in several
directions. In particular, we propose a general criterion for the non-existence
of patterns, dealing with possibly non-convex domains and unstable patterns.
Our results unfold the interplay between the geometry of the domain, the
magnitude of the nonlinearity, and the stability of patterns. We propose
several applications, for example, we prove that (under a geometric assumption)
there exist no patterns if the domain is shrunk or if the nonlinearity has a
small magnitude. We also refine the result of Casten Holland and Matano and
show that it is robust under smooth perturbations of the domain and the
nonlinearity. In addition, we establish several gradient estimates for the
patterns of (1). We prove a general nonlinear Cacciopoli inequality (or an
inverse Poincar{\'e} inequality), stating that the L2-norm of the gradient of a
solution is controlled by the L2-norm of f(u), with a constant that only
depends on the domain. This inequality holds for non-homogeneous equations. We
also give several flatness estimates. Our approach relies on the introduction
of what we call the Robin-curvature Laplacian. This operator is intrinsic to
the domain and contains much information on how the geometry of the domain
affects the shape of the solutions. Finally, we extend our results to unbounded
domains. It allows us to improve the results of our previous paper [53] and to

unidirectional encoders lack future information. This leads to an inevitable
latency during inference. To alleviate this issue and reduce latency, we
propose several strategies during training by leveraging external hard
alignments extracted from the hybrid model. We investigate to utilize the
alignments in both the encoder and the decoder. On the encoder side, (1)
multi-task learning and (2) pre-training with the framewise classification task
are studied. On the decoder side, we (3) remove inappropriate alignment paths
beyond an acceptable latency during the alignment marginalization, and (4)
directly minimize the differentiable expected latency loss. Experiments on the
Cortana voice search task demonstrate that our proposed methods can
significantly reduce the latency, and even improve the recognition accuracy in

mutual information between morphology and environment persists up to several
tens of Mpc, which awaits an explanation. Galaxies in different environments
acquire their stellar mass through accretion and merger and the stellar mass
function of galaxies is known to depend on both environment and morphology.
Naturally, stellar mass can be an important link between morphology and
environment which may explain the non-zero mutual information between the two.
Measuring the mutual information between morphology and environment by
conditioning the stellar mass would allow us to test this possibility. We
employ here a volume and stellar mass limited sample from the $16^{th}$ data
release (DR16) of the SDSS and find a non-zero conditional mutual information
throughout the entire length scales probed. We compare the results with three
different semi-analytic models implemented on the Millennium simulation and
find their predictions to be in fairly good agreement with SDSS on smaller
length scales ( $\lesssim 30 h^{-1}$ Mpc ), with a clear discrepancy observed
at larger length scales ( $\gtrsim 30 h^{-1}$ Mpc ) where the models predict
significantly lower conditional mutual information than the SDSS. Our analysis
therefore suggests that only environmental and morphology dependence of stellar
mass are inadequate in explaining the observed mutual information between
morphology and environment and that physical processes which alters morphology
may not necessarily have an impact on the stellar mass of galaxies and vice
versa.

This enables us to initiate a systematic study into bounding mim-width from the

Such process is associated with the thermal coupling between the core and the
crust of neutron stars. The thermal relaxation, which takes place at around 10
-- 100 years, is manifested as a sudden drop of the star's surface temperature.
Such drop is smooth for slow cooling objects and very sharp for those with fast
cooling. In our study we focus particularly on the cooling of neutron stars
whose mass is slightly greater than the value above which the direct Urca (DU)
process sets in. Considering different mechanisms for neutrino production in
each region of the star, and working with equations of state with different
properties, we solve the thermal evolution equation and calculate the thermal
relaxation time for ample range of neutron star masses. By performing a
comprehensive study of neutron stars just above the onset of the direct Urca
process we show that stars under these conditions exhibit a peculiar thermal
relaxation behavior. We demonstrate that such stars exhibit an abnormally late
relaxation time, characterized by a second drop of its surface temperature
taking place a later ages. We qualify such behavior by showing that it is
associated with limited spatial distribution of the DU process is such stars.
We show that as the star's mass increase, the DU region also grows and the
start exhibits the expected behavior of fast cooling stars. Finally we show
that one can expect high relaxation times for stars in which the DU process
takes place in a radius not larger than 3 km.

deterioration of the MgO barrier and MgO/FeCoB interfaces. We demonstrate that
the layers surrounding the FL play a decisive role in determining the trend of

occur, while not losing the TMR or the magnetic configuration of the MTJ.

linear fractional representation framework. In a linear fractional

two separate blocks that are interconnected with one another. This results in a
structured, yet flexible model structure. Estimating such a model directly from
input-output data is not a trivial task as the involved optimization is
nonlinear in nature. This paper proposes an initialization scheme for the model
parameters based on the best linear approximation of the system and shows that
this approach results in high quality models on a set of benchmark data sets.

away from the source the soft hair behaves as a coordinate transformation that
forms an Abelian group, thus unable to store any information. To maintain the
spirit of the soft hair but circumvent these obstacles, we consider Hawking
radiation as a probe sensitive to the entire history of the black hole
evaporation, where the soft hairs on the horizon are induced by the absorption
of a null anisotropic flow, generalizing the shockwave considered by Hawking et
al. To do so we introduce two different time-dependent extensions of the
diffeomorphism associated with the soft hair, where one is the backreaction of
the anisotropic null flow, and the other is a coordinate transformation that
produces the Unruh effect and a Doppler shift to the Hawking spectrum.
Together, they form an exact BMS charge generator on the entire manifold that
allows the nonperturbative analysis of the black hole horizon, whose surface
gravity, i.e. the Hawking temperature, is found to be modified. The
modification depends on an exponential average of the anisotropy of the null
flow with a decay rate of 4M, suggesting the emergence of a new 2-D degree of
freedom on the horizon, which could be a way out of the information loss
paradox.

track physical resources. Blockchain technology provides primitives to
represent these resources as digital assets on a secure distributed ledger. Due
to the proliferation of blockchain-based assets, there is an increasing need
for a generic mechanism to trade assets between isolated platforms. To date,
there is no such mechanism without reliance on a trusted third party.
  In this work, we address this shortcoming and present XChange. Unlike
existing approaches for decentralized asset trading, we decouple trade
management and the actual exchange of assets. XChange mediates trade of any
digital asset between isolated blockchain platforms while limiting the fraud
conducted by adversarial parties. We first describe a generic, five-phase
trading protocol that establishes and executes trade between individuals. This
protocol accounts full trade specifications on a separate blockchain. We then
devise a lightweight system architecture, composed of all required components
for a generic asset marketplace.
  We implement XChange and conduct real-world experimentation. We leverage an
existing, lightweight blockchain, TrustChain, to account all orders and full
trade specifications. By deploying XChange on multiple low-resource devices, we
show that a full trade completes within half a second. To quantify the
scalability of our mechanism, we conduct further experiments on our compute
cluster. We conclude that the throughput of XChange, in terms of trades per
second, scales linearly with the system load. Furthermore, we find that XChange
exhibits superior throughput and order fulfil latency compared to related
decentralized exchanges, BitShares and Waves.

$G_N$ between the early and the late Universe. This changes the Hubble rate
before recombination, similarly to adding $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ extra
relativistic degrees of freedom. We implement a varying $G_N$ in a
scalar-tensor theory of gravity, with a non-minimal coupling $(M^2+\beta
\phi^2)R$. If the scalar $\phi$ starts in the radiation era at an initial value
$\phi_I \sim 0.5~M_p$ and with $\beta<0$, a dynamical transition occurs
naturally around the epoch of matter-radiation equality and the field evolves
towards zero at late times. As a consequence, the $H_0$ tension between
SH$_{0}$ES (2019) and Planck 2018+BAO slightly decreases, as in $\Delta N_{\rm
eff}$ models, to the 3.8$\sigma$ level. We then perform a fit to a combined
Planck, BAO and supernovae (SH$_0$ES and Pantheon) dataset. When including
local constraints on Post-Newtonian (PN) parameters, we find
$H_0=69.08_{-0.71}^{+0.6}~\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and a marginal improvement of
$\Delta\chi^2\simeq-3.2$ compared to $\Lambda$CDM, at the cost of 2 extra
parameters. In order to take into account scenarios where local constraints
could be evaded, we also perform a fit without PN constraints and find
$H_0=69.65_{-0.78}^{+0.8}~\text{km/s/Mpc}$ and a more significant improvement
$\Delta\chi^2=-5.4$ with 2 extra parameters. For comparison, we find that the
$\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ model gives $H_0=70.08_{-0.95}^{+0.91}~\text{km/s/Mpc}$
and $\Delta\chi^2=-3.4$ at the cost of one extra parameter, which disfavors the
$\Lambda$CDM limit just above 2$\sigma$, since $\Delta N_{\rm
eff}=0.34_{-0.16}^{+0.15}$. Overall, our varying $G_N$ model performs similarly
to the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ model in respect to the $H_0$ tension, if a
physical mechanism to remove PN constraints can be implemented.

microbubbles) relies on the attenuation theory that assumes the UCAs oscillate
linearly at sufficiently low excitation pressures. Effective shell parameters
of the UCAs can be estimated by fitting a theoretical attenuation curve to
experimentally measured attenuation data. Depending on the excitation frequency
and properties of the shell, however, an UCA may oscillate nonlinearly even at
sufficiently low excitation pressures violating the assumption in the linear
attenuation theory. Notably, the concern on the estimation of the attenuation
coefficient of a microbubble at resonance using linearized approximation has
long been addressed. In this article, we investigated the attenuation
phenomenon through analyzing the energy dissipation of a single UCA and
propagating waves in an UCA suspension, both of which employed a nonlinear
Rayleigh-Plesset equation. Analytical formulae capable of estimating the
attenuation coefficient due to the weakly nonlinear oscillations of the UCA
were obtained with a relatively rigorous mathematical analysis. The computed
results that were verified by numerical simulations showed the attenuation
coefficient of the UCA at resonance was pressure-dependent and could be
significantly smaller than that predicted by the linear attenuation theory.
Polydispersity of the UCA population enlarged the difference in the estimation
of attenuation between the linear and present second-order nonlinear theories.

  Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given

study of the impact of misalignment of the scintillator tile with respect to
the photon sensor on the response uniformity and on the absolute light yield
for square, hexagonal and rhomboidal scintillator tiles of different sizes. A
misalignment results in the formation of a dipole asymmetry of the spatial
distribution of the light yield, with a magnitude that scales linearly with the
size of the displacement, while the average light yield over the full active
area of the tile is not affected. These results provide guidance for the
definition of tolerances for the production and assembly of large calorimeter
systems, showing that an alignment precision of approximately 500 $\mu$m or
better allows to limit the impact to acceptable levels.

research attention has increasingly focused on what aspects of language they

strings generated according to a template then tests the model's ability to
distinguish such strings from superficially similar ones with different syntax.
We illustrate a fundamental problem with this approach by reproducing positive

arguably the most frequently used type of MOEA. These methods however stagnate
when the majority of the population becomes non-dominated, preventing
convergence to the Pareto set. Hypervolume-based MO optimization has shown
promising results to overcome this. Direct use of the hypervolume however
results in no selection pressure for dominated solutions. The recently
introduced Sofomore framework overcomes this by solving multiple interleaved
single-objective dynamic problems that iteratively improve a single
approximation set, based on the uncrowded hypervolume improvement (UHVI). It
thereby however loses many advantages of population-based MO optimization, such
as handling multimodality. Here, we reformulate the UHVI as a quality measure
for approximation sets, called the uncrowded hypervolume (UHV), which can be
used to directly solve MO optimization problems with a single-objective
optimizer. We use the state-of-the-art gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary
algorithm (GOMEA) that is capable of efficiently exploiting the intrinsically
available grey-box properties of this problem. The resulting algorithm,
UHV-GOMEA, is compared to Sofomore equipped with GOMEA, and the
domination-based MO-GOMEA. In doing so, we investigate in which scenarios
either domination-based or hypervolume-based methods are preferred. Finally, we
construct a simple hybrid approach that combines MO-GOMEA with UHV-GOMEA and
outperforms both.

fault-tolerant, strongly-consistent distributed systems. Though many
distributed consensus algorithms have been proposed, just two dominate
production systems: Paxos, the traditional, famously subtle, algorithm; and
Raft, a more recent algorithm positioned as a more understandable alternative
to Paxos.
  In this paper, we consider the question of which algorithm, Paxos or Raft, is
the better solution to distributed consensus? We analyse both to determine
exactly how they differ by describing a simplified Paxos algorithm using Raft's
terminology and pragmatic abstractions.
  We find that both Paxos and Raft take a very similar approach to distributed
consensus, differing only in their approach to leader election. Most notably,
Raft only allows servers with up-to-date logs to become leaders, whereas Paxos
allows any server to be leader provided it then updates its log to ensure it is
up-to-date. Raft's approach is surprisingly efficient given its simplicity as,
unlike Paxos, it does not require log entries to be exchanged during leader
election. We surmise that much of the understandability of Raft comes from the
paper's clear presentation rather than being fundamental to the underlying
algorithm being presented.

previous analyses of this flare to multiple chromospheric lines of Fe I, Fe II,
Mg II, C I, and Si II, observed with IRIS, combined with
radiative-hydrodynamical (RHD) modeling. For multiple flaring kernels, the
lines all show a rapidly evolving double-component structure: an enhanced,
emission component at rest, and a broad, highly red-shifted component of
comparable intensity. The red-shifted components migrate from 25-50 km s$^{-1}$
towards the rest wavelength within $\sim$30 seconds.
  Using Fermi hard X-ray observations, we derive the parameters of an
accelerated electron beam impacting the dense chromosphere, using them to drive
a RHD simulation with the RADYN code. As in Kowalski et al. 2017a, our
simulations show that the most energetic electrons penetrate into the deep
chromosphere, heating it to T$\sim$10,000 K, while the bulk of the electrons
dissipate their energy higher, driving an explosive evaporation, and its
counterpart condensation -- a very dense (n$_e \sim 2 \times 10^{14}$
cm$^{-3}$), thin layer (30--40 km thickness), heated to 8--12,000 K, moving
towards the stationary chromosphere at up to 50 km s$^{-1}$.
  The synthetic Fe II 2814.45A profiles closely resemble the observational
data, including a continuum enhancement, and both a stationary and a highly
red-shifted component, rapidly moving towards the rest wavelength. Importantly,
the absolute continuum intensity, ratio of component intensities, relative time
of appearance, and red-shift amplitude, are sensitive to the model input
parameters, showing great potential as diagnostics.

Crank--Nicolson scheme for the Cahn--Hilliard gradient flow. In this scheme,
the nonlinear bulk force is treated explicitly with two second-order
stabilization terms. This treatment leads to linear elliptic system with
constant coefficients and provable discrete energy dissipation. Rigorous error
analysis is carried out for the fully discrete scheme. When the time step-size
and the space step-size are small enough, second order accuracy in time is
obtained with a prefactor controlled by some lower degree polynomial of
$1/\varepsilon$. {Here $\varepsilon$ is the thickness of the interface}.
Numerical results together with an adaptive time stepping are presented to
verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.

universal quantum computation is usually described in terms of realising
Clifford+T operations, which is to say a circuit of CNOT, Hadamard, and
$\pi/2$-phase rotations, together with T operations ($\pi/4$-phase rotations).
For many error correcting codes, fault-tolerant realisations of Clifford
operations are significantly less resource-intensive than those of T gates,
which motivates finding ways to realise the same transformation involving
T-count (the number of T gates involved) which is as low as possible.
Investigations into this problem [arXiv:1206.0758, 1303.2042, 1308.4134,

Reed-Muller codes [arXiv:1601.07363]. This problem then presents itself as one
for which must be content in practise with approximate optimisation, in which
one develops an array of tactics to be deployed through some pragmatic
strategy. In this vein, we describe techniques to reduce the T-count, based on
the effective application of ""spider nest identities"": easily recognised
products of parity-phase operations which are equivalent to the identity
operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such techniques by obtaining
improvements in the T-counts of a number of circuits, in run-times which are
typically less than the time required to make a fresh cup of coffee.

thesis, we explore how niche domains can benefit vastly if we look at neurons
as a unique boolean function of the form $f:B^{I} \rightarrow B^{O}$, where $B
= \{0,1\}$. We focus on how to design topologies that complement such a view of
neurons, how to automate such a strategy of neural network design, and
inference of such networks on Xilinx FPGAs. Major hardware borne constraints
arise when designing topologies that view neurons as unique boolean functions.
Fundamentally, realizing such topologies on hardware asserts a strict limit on
the 'fan-in' bits of a neuron due to the doubling of permutations possible with
every increment in input bit-length. We address this limit by exploring
different methods of implementing sparsity and explore activation quantization.
Further, we develop a library that supports training a neural network with
custom sparsity and quantization. This library also supports conversion of
trained Sparse Quantized networks from PyTorch to VERILOG code which is then
synthesized using Vivado, all of which is part of the LogicNet tool-flow. To
aid faster prototyping, we also support calculation of the worst-case hardware
cost of any given topology. We hope that our insights into the behavior of
extremely sparse quantized neural networks are of use to the research community

considers the balance between accuracy and robustness, we come to a more
meaningful and critical issue, i.e., the balance among accuracy, efficiency and
robustness (AER). Recently, some related works focused on this issue, but with
different observations, and the relations among AER remain unclear. This paper
first investigates the robustness of pruned models with different compression
ratios under the gradual pruning process and concludes that the robustness of
the pruned model drastically varies with different pruning processes,
especially in response to attacks with large strength. Second, we test the
performance of mixing the clean data and adversarial examples (generated with a
prescribed uniform budget) into the gradual pruning process, called adversarial
pruning, and find the following: the pruned model's robustness exhibits high
sensitivity to the budget. Furthermore, to better balance the AER, we propose
an approach called blind adversarial pruning (BAP), which introduces the idea
of blind adversarial training into the gradual pruning process. The main idea
is to use a cutoff-scale strategy to adaptively estimate a nonuniform budget to
modify the AEs used during pruning, thus ensuring that the strengths of AEs are
dynamically located within a reasonable range at each pruning step and
ultimately improving the overall AER of the pruned model. The experimental
results obtained using BAP for pruning classification models based on several
benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of this method: the
robustness of the model pruned by BAP is more stable among varying pruning
processes, and BAP exhibits better overall AER than adversarial pruning.

models by mixing clean data and adversarial examples (AEs). Most existing AT
approaches can be grouped into restricted and unrestricted approaches.
Restricted AT requires a prescribed uniform budget to constrain the magnitude
of the AE perturbations during training, with the obtained results showing high
sensitivity to the budget. On the other hand, unrestricted AT uses
unconstrained AEs, resulting in the use of AEs located beyond the decision
boundary; these overestimated AEs significantly lower the accuracy on clean
data. These limitations mean that the existing AT approaches have difficulty in
obtaining a comprehensively robust model with high accuracy and robustness when
confronting attacks with varying strengths. Considering this problem, this
paper proposes a novel AT approach named blind adversarial training (BAT) to
better balance the accuracy and robustness. The main idea of this approach is

constructing $(\Delta, \gamma)$\mbox{-}Clique(s) with maximum duration. In the
second phase, these initial cliques are expanded by vertex addition to form the

  Features",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Patients with sleep disorders can better manage their lifestyle if they know
about their special situations. Detection of such sleep disorders is usually
possible by analyzing a number of vital signals that have been collected from
the patients. To simplify this task, a number of Automatic Sleep Stage
Recognition (ASSR) methods have been proposed. Most of these methods use
temporal-frequency features that have been extracted from the vital signals.
However, due to the non-stationary nature of sleep signals, such schemes are
not leading an acceptable accuracy. Recently, some ASSR methods have been
proposed which use deep neural networks for unsupervised feature extraction. In
this paper, we proposed to combine the two ideas and use both
temporal-frequency and unsupervised features at the same time. To augment the
time resolution, each standard epoch is segmented into 5 sub-epochs.
Additionally, to enhance the accuracy, we employ three classifiers with
different properties and then use an ensemble method as the ultimate
classifier. The simulation results show that the proposed method enhances the
accuracy of conventional ASSR methods.

This comparison can uncover hidden effects, because the halves have the same
values of many parameters (style, genre {\it etc}). We found that the first
half has more different words and more rare words than the second half. Also,
words in the first half are distributed less homogeneously over the text in the
sense of of the difference between the frequency and the inverse spatial
period. These differences hold for the significant majority of several hundred
relatively short texts we studied. The statistical significance is confirmed
via the Wilcoxon test. Differences disappear after random permutation of words
that destroys the linear structure of the text. The differences reveal a
temporal asymmetry in meaningful texts, which is confirmed by showing that
texts are much better compressible in their natural way (i.e. along the

connect the semantic organization of a text (defined by the flow of its

a high degree of synchronization between participating institutions. For this

(PATE), where all local models can be trained independently without
inter-institutional communication. The purpose of this paper is thus to explore
how PATE -- originally designed for classification -- can best be adapted for
semantic segmentation. To this end, we build low-dimensional representations of
segmentation masks which the student can obtain through low-sensitivity queries
to the private aggregator. On the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS 2019)

imaging modalities (e.g., CT and MRI) have to be reformulated and solved in 2D,
losing rich 3D anatomical information, thereby inevitably compromising its
performance. To overcome this limitation, we have built a set of models, called
Generic Autodidactic Models, nicknamed Models Genesis, because they are created
ex nihilo (with no manual labeling), self-taught (learnt by self-supervision),
and generic (served as source models for generating application-specific target
models). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our Models Genesis
significantly outperform learning from scratch and existing pre-trained 3D
models in all five target 3D applications covering both segmentation and
classification. More importantly, learning a model from scratch simply in 3D
may not necessarily yield performance better than transfer learning from
ImageNet in 2D, but our Models Genesis consistently top any 2D/2.5D approaches
including fine-tuning the models pre-trained from ImageNet as well as
fine-tuning the 2D versions of our Models Genesis, confirming the importance of
3D anatomical information and significance of Models Genesis for 3D medical
imaging. This performance is attributed to our unified self-supervised learning
framework, built on a simple yet powerful observation: the sophisticated and
recurrent anatomy in medical images can serve as strong yet free supervision
signals for deep models to learn common anatomical representation automatically
via self-supervision. As open science, all codes and pre-trained Models Genesis

assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some
profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic

solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive

generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed

the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective
allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for

regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly
affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven

observation that a finite set of hidden finite valued variables can never
account for indeterminism in an ideally isolated repeatable experiment. We see
that, when the language of possible outcomes of the experiment is regular, as
is the case with the Peres-Mermin square, the amount of binary-valued hidden
variables needed to de-randomize the model for all sequences of experiments up
to length n grows as bad as it could be: linearly in n. We introduce a very
abstract model of machine that simulates nature in a particular sense. A
lower-bound on the number of memory states of such machines is proved if they
were to simulate the experiment that corresponds to the Peres-Mermin square.
Moreover, the proof of this lower bound is seen to scale to a certain
generalization of the Peres- Mermin square. For this scaled experiment it is
seen that the Holevo bound is violated and that the degree of violation
increases uniformly.

policy management is facing with such as dynamic and update policies in run

domains. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies focusing
on solving authorization problems in the dynamic policy environments. In this
article, we focus on analyzing and classifying when an update policy occurs,
and provide a pragmatic solution for such dynamic policies. The contribution of
this work is twofold: a novel solution for managing the policy changes even
when the access request has been granted, and an XACML-based implementation to
empirically evaluate the proposed solution. The experimental results show the
comparison between the newly introduced XACs-DyPol framework with Balana (an
