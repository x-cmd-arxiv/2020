solitary-nodule approaches on multiple nodular patients, which ignores the

learning (MIL) approach and empirically prove the benefit to learn the

same patient as a whole, critical relational information between
solitary-nodule voxels is extracted. To our knowledge, it is the first study to
learn the relations between multiple pulmonary nodules. Inspired by recent
advances in natural language processing (NLP) domain, we introduce a
self-attention transformer equipped with 3D CNN, named {NoduleSAT}, to replace
typical pooling-based aggregation in multiple instance learning. Extensive
experiments on lung nodule false positive reduction on LUNA16 database, and
malignancy classification on LIDC-IDRI database, validate the effectiveness of

  Retention on Later Life Outcomes in Chile",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Regression discontinuity designs are extensively used for causal inference in
observational studies. However, they are usually confined to settings with
simple treatment rules, determined by a single running variable, with a single
cutoff. Motivated by the problem of estimating the impact of grade retention on
educational and juvenile crime outcomes in Chile, we propose a framework and
methods for complex discontinuity designs that encompasses multiple treatment
rules. In this framework, the observed covariates play a central role for
identification, estimation, and generalization of causal effects.
Identification is non-parametric and relies on a local strong ignorability
assumption. Estimation proceeds as in any observational study under strong
ignorability, yet in a neighborhood of the cutoffs of the running variables. We
discuss estimation approaches based on matching and weighting, including
complementary regression modeling adjustments. We present assumptions for
generalization; that is, for identification and estimation of average treatment
effects for target populations. We also describe two approaches to select the
neighborhood for analysis. We find that grade retention in Chile has a negative
impact on future grade retention, but is not associated with dropping out of
school or committing a juvenile crime.

used extensively in the industry due to its remarkable mechanical and thermal
properties. Our aim is to find the difference in material behavior when we
change the grading function (linear, elliptical and parabolic), temperature and
crystallographic direction. We also observe distinct type of failure mechanism
for different grading function at different temperature. Close observation
reveals that elliptically graded Ni-Al alloy has high tensile strength at low
temperature whereas at high temperature, the highest tensile strength is found
for parabolic grading. Besides, at any temperature, the parabolically graded
Ni-Al alloy shows superior elasticity than its elliptical and linear
counterpart. Moreover, it is also observed that [111] crystallographic
direction for this alloy demonstrates more resistivity towards failure than any
other crystallographic direction. It is found that lattice disorder plays a

problems involving task satisfaction constraints for systems with partially
known dynamics. The control problems are defined by a cost to be minimized and
a task to be satisfied, given in the language of signal temporal logic (STL).
The complex nature of possible tasks generally makes them difficult to satisfy
through random exploration, which limits the practical feasibility of the
learning algorithm. Recent work has shown, however, that using a controller to
guide the learning process by leveraging available knowledge of system dynamics
to aid task satisfaction is greatly beneficial for improving the sample
efficiency of the method. Motivated by these findings, this work introduces a
controller derivation framework which naturally leads to computationally
efficient controllers capable of offering such guidance during the learning
process. The derived controllers aim to satisfy a set of so-called robustness
specifications or funnels that are imposed on the temporal evolutions of the
atomic propositions composing the STL task. Ideally, these specifications are
prescribed in a way such that their satisfaction would lead to satisfaction of
the STL task. In practice, however, such ideal funnels are not necessarily
known a priori, and the guidance the controller offers depends on their
estimates. This issue is hereby addressed by introducing an adaptation scheme
for automatically updating the funnels during the learning procedure, thus
diminishing the role of their initial, user-specified values. The effectiveness
of the resulting learning algorithm is demonstrated by two simulation case
studies.

bound states that includes scalar particles with the same quantum numbers as
the vacuum. The challenge naturally arises of how to characterise them. In
particular, how can a dilaton---the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated
with approximate scale invariance---be distinguished from other generic light
scalars with the same quantum numbers? We address this problem within the
context of gauge-gravity dualities, by analysing the fluctuations of the
higher-dimensional gravitational theory. The diagnostic test that we propose
consists of comparing the results of the complete calculation, performed by
using gauge-invariant fluctuations in the bulk, with the results obtained in
the probe approximation. While the former captures the mixing between scalar
and metric degrees of freedom, the latter removes by hand the fluctuations that
source the dilatation operator of the boundary field-theory. Hence, the probe
approximation cannot capture a possible light dilaton, while it should fare
well for other scalar particles. We test this idea on a number of holographic
models, among which are some of the best known, complete gravity backgrounds
constructed within the top-down approach to gauge-gravity dualities. We compute
the spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations, that are interpreted as bound
states (glueballs) of the dual field theory, and we highlight those cases in
which the probe approximation yields results close to the correct physical
ones, as well as those cases where significant discrepancies emerge. We
interpret the latter occurrence as an indication that identifying one of the
lightest scalar states with the dilaton is legitimate, at least as a
leading-order approximation.

hadrons can be decomposed into a long- and a short-range piece. The long-range
piece corresponds to the one-pion-exchange potential and is relatively
well-known. The short-range piece is given by a series of contact-range
interactions with unknown couplings, which substitute the less well-known
short-range dynamics. While the general structure of the short-range potential
between heavy hadrons is heavily constrained from heavy-quark symmetry, the
couplings are still free parameters. Here we argue that the relative strength
and the sign of these couplings can be estimated from the hypothesis that they
are saturated by the exchange of light mesons, in particular the vector mesons
$\rho$ and $\omega$, i.e. from resonance saturation. However, we propose a
novel saturation procedure that effectively removes form-factor artifacts. From
this we can determine in which spin and isospin configurations the low-energy
constants are most attractive for specific two-heavy-hadron systems. In general
the molecular states with lower isospins and higher spins will be more
attractive and thus more probable candidates to form heavy-hadron molecules.
This pattern is compatible with the interpretation of the $X(3872)$ and

nearly homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT) generated by a towed grid in
He II. We measure the velocity field using particle tracking velocimetry with
solidified deuterium particles as the tracers. By correlating the velocities
measured simultaneously on different particle trajectories or at different
times along the same particle trajectory, we are able to conduct both Eulerian
and Lagrangian flow analyses. Spatial velocity structure functions obtained
through the Eulerian analysis show scaling behaviors in the inertial subrange
similar to that for classical HIT but with enhanced intermittency. The
Lagrangian analysis allows us to examine the flow statistics down to below the
dissipation length scale. Interestingly, strong deviations from the classical
scaling behaviors are observed in this regime. We discuss how these deviations
may relate to the motion of quantized vortices in the superfluid component in
He II.

approaches for visual search, recommendation, and identification. Retrieval of

have been widely explored for this problem, such as locality sensitive hashing,
product quantization, and PCA. In this work, in contrast to learning compact

representations that have similar representational capacity as dense embeddings
while being more efficient due to sparse matrix multiplication operations which
can be much faster than dense multiplication. Following the key insight that
the number of operations decreases quadratically with the sparsity of
embeddings provided the non-zero entries are distributed uniformly across
dimensions, we propose a novel approach to learn such distributed sparse
embeddings via the use of a carefully constructed regularization function that
directly minimizes a continuous relaxation of the number of floating-point
operations (FLOPs) incurred during retrieval. Our experiments show that our
approach is competitive to the other baselines and yields a similar or better
speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff on practical datasets.

said to be closed if all possible places in a shell are full. Atomic nuclei
with closed shells are very stable and valence nucleons that are more than

with both topological and logical properties. It then provides an example of
how this interplay of properties can be of use -- using topological properties
of the dependency structure to equip internal logics of associated locales with

However, many pairwise comparison protocols require a large number of

comparison is time-consuming (e.g. videos) or expensive (e.g. medical imaging).
This motivates the use of an active sampling algorithm that chooses only the
most informative pairs for comparison. In this paper we propose ASAP, an active
sampling algorithm based on approximate message passing and expected
information gain maximization. Unlike most existing methods, which rely on
partial updates of the posterior distribution, we are able to perform full
updates and therefore much improve the accuracy of the inferred scores. The
algorithm relies on three techniques for reducing computational cost: inference
based on approximate message passing, selective evaluations of the information
gain, and selecting pairs in a batch that forms a minimum spanning tree of the
inverse of information gain. We demonstrate, with real and synthetic data, that
ASAP offers the highest accuracy of inferred scores compared to the existing
methods. We also provide an open-source GPU implementation of ASAP for

builds upon the isomorphism between hyperspherical chords and L2-normalised
data Euclidean distances, which is implied by the fact that, in Euclidean
spaces, L2-normalised data can be geometrically defined as points on a
hypersphere. The imposed connection between the distance distribution of
uniformly selected points and the hyperspherical chord length distribution is

of hypersphere chord length distribution is revisited extended, before
examining a few qualitative and quantitative characteristics of this

generate intra categories. Our proposed SFE-GACN can accurately generate

fulfilling Quality of Service (QoS) obligations is critical for maintaining a
viably profitable business. This goal is often hard to attain given the
irregular nature of cloud computing jobs. These jobs expect high QoS on an
on-demand fashion, that is on random arrival. To optimize the response to such
client demands, cloud service providers organize the cloud computing
environment as a multi-tier architecture. Each tier executes its designated
tasks and passes the job to the next tier; in a fashion similar, but not
identical, to the traditional job-shop environments. An optimization process
must take place to schedule the appropriate tasks of the job on the resources
of the tier, so as to meet the QoS expectations of the job. Existing approaches
employ scheduling strategies that consider the performance optimization at the
individual resource level and produce optimal single-tier driven schedules. Due
to the sequential nature of the multi-tier environment, the impact of such
schedules on the performance of other resources and tiers tend to be ignored,
resulting in a less than optimal performance when measured at the multi-tier
level. In this paper, we propose a multi-tier-oriented job scheduling and
allocation technique. The scheduling and allocation process is formulated as a
problem of assigning jobs to the resource queues of the cloud computing
environment, where each resource of the environment employs a queue to hold the
jobs assigned to it. The scheduling problem is NP-hard, as such a biologically
inspired genetic algorithm is proposed. The computing resources across all
tiers of the environment are virtualized in one resource by means of a single
queue virtualization. A chromosome that mimics the sequencing and allocation of
the tasks in the proposed virtual queue is proposed.

computational workloads that vary in resource requirements and demand high
Quality of Service (QoS) obligations. It is typical that a
Service-Level-Agreement (SLA) is employed to govern the QoS obligations of the
cloud computing service provider to the client. A typical challenge
service-providers face every day is maintaining a balance between the limited
resources available for computing and the high QoS requirements of varying
random demands. Any imbalance in managing these conflicting objectives may
result in either dissatisfied clients and potentially significant commercial
penalties, or an over-resourced cloud computing environment that can be
significantly costly to acquire and operate. Thus, scheduling the clients'
workloads as they arrive at the environment to ensure their timely execution
has been a central issue in cloud computing. Various approaches have been
reported in the literature to address this problem: Shortest-Queue,
Join-Idle-Queue, Round Robin, MinMin, MaxMin, and Least Connection, to name a
few. However, optimization strategies of such approaches fail to capture QoS
obligations and their associated commercial penalties. This paper presents an
approach for service-level driven load scheduling and balancing in multi-tier
environments. Joint scheduling and balancing operations are employed to
distribute and schedule jobs among the resources, such that the total waiting
time of client jobs is minimized, and thus the potential of a penalty to be
incurred by the service provider is mitigated. A penalty model is used to
quantify the penalty the service provider incurs as a function of the jobs'
total waiting time. A Virtual-Queue abstraction is proposed to facilitate
optimal job scheduling at the tier level. This problem is NP-complete, a
genetic algorithm is proposed for computing job schedules.

explore a range of possible determinations of the MF from a single dataset. We
employ the analytic modified lognormal power-law (MLP) distribution, a hybrid
function that has a peaked lognormal-like body and a power-law tail at
intermediate and high masses. A fit with the MLP has the advantage that the
resulting best-fit function can be either a hybrid function, a pure lognormal,
or a pure power law, in different limits of the function. The completeness
limit for the observations means that the data contains masses above $\sim
0.90\,M_{\odot}$. In this case, the MLP fits yield essentially a pure power-law
MF. We demonstrate that the nonlinear regression/least-squares approach is not
justified since the underlying assumptions are not satisfied. By using maximum
likelihood estimation, which is independent of binning, we find a best-fit
functional form $dN/d\ln m \propto m^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha = 1.72 \pm 0.05$

the lognormal Chabrier IMF for masses below $0.90\, M_{\odot}$, the best fit
MLP is a hybrid function but with a steeper asymptotic slope i.e., $\alpha =

these PfSPZ are not optimally efficient for large-scale vaccine production. We
propose an improved dissection procedure and a mechanical fixture that
increases the rate of mosquito dissection and helps to deskill this stage of
the production process. We further demonstrate the automation of a key step in
this production process, the picking and placing of mosquitoes from a staging
apparatus into a dissection assembly. This unit test of a robotic mosquito
pick-and-place system is performed using a custom-designed micro-gripper
attached to a four degree of freedom (4-DOF) robot under the guidance of a
computer vision system. Mosquitoes are autonomously grasped and pulled to a
pair of notched dissection blades to remove the head of the mosquito, allowing
access to the salivary glands. Placement into these blades is adapted based on
output from computer vision to accommodate for the unique anatomy and
orientation of each grasped mosquito. In this pilot test of the system on 50
mosquitoes, we demonstrate a 100% grasping accuracy and a 90% accuracy in
placing the mosquito with its neck within the blade notches such that the head
can be removed. This is a promising result for this difficult and non-standard
pick-and-place task.

differ greatly from frameworks. Engine projects have shorter histories with

standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription

the pandemic. Thus, researchers have been looking for alternative screening
methods and deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing
promising results. Despite their success, the computational cost of these
methods remains high, which imposes difficulties to their accessibility and
availability. Thus, the main goal of this work is to propose an accurate yet
efficient method in terms of memory and processing time for the problem of
COVID-19 screening in chest X-rays. Methods: To achieve the defined objective
we exploit and extend the EfficientNet family of deep artificial neural
networks which are known for their high accuracy and low footprints in other
applications. We also exploit the underlying taxonomy of the problem with a
hierarchical classifier. A dataset of 13,569 X-ray images divided into healthy,
non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients is used to train the proposed
approaches and other 5 competing architectures. Finally, 231 images of the

positive prediction of 100%, while having from 5 to 30 times fewer parameters

round-trip spanners in weighted directed graphs. For a source vertex set
$S\subseteq V$ in a graph $G(V,E)$, an $S$-sourcewise round-trip spanner of $G$
of stretch $k$ is a subgraph $H$ of $G$ such that for every pair of vertices
$u,v\in S\times V$, their round-trip distance in $H$ is at most $k$ times of
their round-trip distance in $G$. We show that for a graph $G(V,E)$ with $n$
vertices and $m$ edges, an $s$-sized source vertex set $S\subseteq V$ and an
integer $k>1$, there exists an algorithm that in time $O(ms^{1/k}\log^5n)$
constructs an $S$-sourcewise round-trip spanner of stretch $O(k\log n)$ and
$O(ns^{1/k}\log^2n)$ edges with high probability. Compared to the fast
algorithms for constructing all-pairs round-trip spanners \cite{PRS+18,CLR+20},
our algorithm improve the running time and the number of edges in the spanner
when $k$ is super-constant. Compared with the existing algorithm for
constructing source-wise round-trip spanners \cite{ZL17}, our algorithm
significantly improves their construction time $\Omega(\min\{ms,n^\omega\})$
(where $\omega \in [2,2.373)$ and 2.373 is the matrix multiplication exponent)
to nearly linear $O(ms^{1/k}\log^5n)$, at the expense of paying an extra
$O(\log n)$ in the stretch. As an important building block of the algorithm, we
develop a graph partitioning algorithm to partition $G$ into clusters of
bounded radius and prove that for every $u,v\in S\times V$ at small round-trip
distance, the probability of separating them in different clusters is small.
The algorithm takes the size of $S$ as input and does not need the knowledge of
$S$. With the algorithm and a reachability vertex size estimation algorithm, we
show that the recursive algorithm for constructing standard round-trip spanners
\cite{PRS+18} can be adapted to the source-wise setting.

Debugging Query 2.0 is very challenging since an unexpected query result may be
caused by the bugs in training data (e.g., wrong labels, corrupted features).
In response, we propose Rain, a complaint-driven training data debugging
system. Rain allows users to specify complaints over the query's intermediate
or final output, and aims to return a minimum set of training examples so that
if they were removed, the complaints would be resolved. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to study this problem. A naive solution requires
retraining an exponential number of ML models. We propose two novel heuristic
approaches based on influence functions which both require linear retraining
steps. We provide an in-depth analytical and empirical analysis of the two
approaches and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate their effectiveness
using four real-world datasets. Results show that Rain achieves the highest
recall@k among all the baselines while still returns results interactively.

facilities increase their scales over the last decades, finding the root cause
of a failure can be very complex or at times nearly impossible. Different
scientific computing customers have varying availability demands as well as a
diverse willingness to pay for availability. In contrast to existing solutions
that try to provide higher and higher availability in scientific grids, we
propose a model called Task Replication for User-defined Availability (Trua).
Trua provides flexible, user-defined, availability in scientific grids,
allowing customers to express their desire for availability to computational
providers. Trua differs from existing task replication approaches in two folds.
First, it relies on the historic failure information collected from the virtual
layer of the scientific grids. The reliability model for the failures can be
represented with a bimodal Johnson distribution which is different from any
existing distributions. Second, it adopts an anomaly detector to filter out
anomalous failures; it additionally adopts novel selection algorithms to
mitigate the effects of temporary and spatial correlations of the failures
without knowing the root cause of the failures. We apply the Trua on real-world
traces collected from the Open Science Grid (OSG). Our results show that the
Trua can successfully meet user-defined availability demands.

vaccinations. Current vaccination strategies, however, rely on the highly
specific individual contact information that is difficult and costly to obtain,
in order to identify influential spreading individuals. Current approaches also
focus only on direct contacts between individuals for spreading, and disregard
indirect transmission where a pathogen can spread between one infected
individual and one susceptible individual that visit the same location within a
short time-frame without meeting. This paper presents a novel vaccination
strategy that relies on coarse-grained contact information, both direct and
indirect, that can be easily and efficiently collected. Rather than tracking
exact contact degrees of individuals, our strategy uses the types of places
people visit to estimate a range of contact degrees for individuals,
considering both direct and indirect contacts. We conduct extensive simulations
to evaluate the performance of our strategy in comparison to the state of the

population decline that is closer to linear rather than exponential, which has
proven to be unexpectedly challenging to describe with a single simple
mathematical model. Here we show that a sub-exponential model of population
extinction can approximate very well the experimental curves of RBC extinction,
and that one possible mechanism underlying sub-exponential decay is population
heterogeneity with respect to death rates of individuals. We further show that
a sub-exponential model of population decline can be derived within the
frameworks of frequency-dependent model of population extinction if there
exists heterogeneity with respect to mortality rates such that their initial
distribution is the Gamma distribution. Notably, specific biological mechanisms
that may result in linear pattern of population decay may be different
depending on the specific biological system; however, in the end they must
converge to individual death rates being different within the population, since
uniform death rates would result in exponential population decline. As such,
the proposed model is not intended to describe the complex dynamics of RBC
biology but instead can provide a way to phenomenologically describe linear
decay of population size. We briefly discuss the potential utility of this
model for describing effects of drugs that may cause RBC depletion and conclude
with a suggestion that this tool can provide a lens for discovering linear
extinction patterns in other populations, which may have previously been
overlooked.

low-complexity MPC formulation that matches the behavior obtained with
high-fidelity models. This is done by designing a suitable terminal penalty

including health and fitness tracking, environmental monitoring and
transportation. However, sensor nodes in IoT suffer from the limited lifetime
of batteries resulting from their finite energy availability. A promising
solution is to harvest energy from environmental sources, such as solar,
kinetic, thermal and radio frequency, for perpetual and continuous operation of
IoT sensor nodes. In addition to energy generation, recently energy harvesters
have been used for context detection, eliminating the need for additional
activity sensors (e.g. accelerometers), saving space, cost, and energy
consumption. Using energy harvesters for simultaneous sensing and energy
harvesting enables energy positive sensing -- an important and emerging class
of sensors, which harvest higher energy than required for signal acquisition
and the additional energy can be used to power other components of the system.
Although simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting is an important step
forward towards autonomous self-powered sensor nodes, the energy and
information availability can be still intermittent, unpredictable and
temporally misaligned with various computational tasks on the sensor node. This
paper provides a comprehensive survey on task scheduling algorithms for the
emerging class of energy harvesting-based sensors (i.e., energy positive
sensors) to achieve the sustainable operation of IoT. We discuss inherent
differences between conventional sensing and energy positive sensing and
provide an extensive critical analysis for devising new task scheduling
algorithms incorporating this new class of sensors. Finally, we outline future
research directions towards the implementation of autonomous and self-powered

estimate the lifetime of intermediate data. We propose an algorithm to
proactively relocate data redundancy from vulnerable machines to reliable ones
to improve data availability with some extra network overhead. Furthermore, we

paradox, where $G_n$ corresponds to a friendship network and $T_3(G_n)$ counts
the number of triples of friends with matching birthdays. In this paper we
prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for $T_3(G_n)$ with explicit error rates.
The proof involves constructing a martingale difference sequence by carefully
ordering the vertices of $G_n$, based on a certain combinatorial score
function, and using a quantitive version of the martingale CLT. We then relate
this error term to the well-known fourth moment phenomenon, which,
interestingly, holds only when the number of colors $c \geq 5$. We also show
that the convergence of the fourth moment is necessary to obtain a Gaussian
limit for any $c \geq 2$, which, together with the above result, implies that
the fourth-moment condition characterizes the limiting normal distribution of
$T_3(G_n)$, whenever $c \geq 5$. Finally, to illustrate the promise of our

Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Quantum algorithms for numerical
integration utilize Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) (Brassard et al., 2002)
in conjunction with Grovers algorithm. However, QAE is daunting to implement on
NISQ devices since it typically relies on Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which
requires many ancilla qubits and controlled operations. To mitigate these
challenges, a recently published QAE algorithm (Suzuki et al., 2020), which
does not rely on QPE, requires a much smaller number of controlled operations
and does not require ancilla qubits. We implement this new algorithm for
numerical integration on IBM quantum devices using Qiskit and optimize the
circuit on each target device. We discuss the application of this algorithm on
two qubits and its scalability to more than two qubits on NISQ devices.

variety of predictive analytics services such as computer vision, natural

can degrade over time due to changes in the input data distribution, thereby
requiring periodic model updates. Although cloud data-centers can meet the
computational requirements of the resource-intensive and time-consuming model
update task, transferring data from the edge devices to the cloud incurs a
significant cost in terms of network bandwidth and are prone to data privacy
issues. With the advent of GPU-enabled edge devices, the DL model update can be
performed at the edge in a distributed manner using multiple connected edge
devices. However, efficiently utilizing the edge resources for the model update
is a hard problem due to the heterogeneity among the edge devices and the
resource interference caused by the co-location of the DL model update task
with latency-critical tasks running in the background. To overcome these
challenges, we present Deep-Edge, a load- and interference-aware,
fault-tolerant resource management framework for performing model update at the
edge that uses distributed training. This paper makes the following
contributions. First, it provides a unified framework for monitoring,
profiling, and deploying the DL model update tasks on heterogeneous edge
devices. Second, it presents a scheduler that reduces the total re-training
time by appropriately selecting the edge devices and distributing data among
them such that no latency-critical applications experience deadline violations.
Finally, we present empirical results to validate the efficacy of the framework
using a real-world DL model update case-study based on the Caltech dataset and
an edge AI cluster testbed.

This paper uses unique traits of tensors to devise a model-free situational

formulates the state of the network at multiple time instants as a three-way
tensor; hence, recovering full state information of the network is tantamount
to estimating all the values of the tensor. Given measurements received from
$\mu$phasor measurement units and/or smart meters, the recovery of unobserved
quantities is carried out using the low-rank canonical polyadic decomposition
of the state tensor---that is, the state estimation task is posed as a tensor
imputation problem utilizing observed patterns in measured quantities. Two
structured sampling schemes are considered: slab sampling and fiber sampling.
For both schemes, we present sufficient conditions on the number of sampled
slabs and fibers that guarantee identifiability of the factors of the state
tensor. Numerical results demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to
achieve high estimation accuracy in multiple sampling scenarios.

a novel deep siamese domain adaptation convolutional neural network (DSDANet)

octopuses are often regarded as iconic examples of this interplay. Here, the
dynamics of the Cosserat rod, modeling a single octopus arm, are treated as a
Hamiltonian system and the internal muscle actuators are modeled as distributed
forces and couples. The proposed energy shaping control design procedure
involves two steps: (1) a potential energy is designed such that its minimizer
is the desired equilibrium configuration; (2) an energy shaping control law is
implemented to reach the desired equilibrium. By interpreting the controlled
Hamiltonian as a Lyapunov function, asymptotic stability of the equilibrium

only the deformations of the equilibrium configuration. A forward-backward

exhibited a rigid chemical shift toward higher binding energy after depositing

which are very expensive, time-consuming, or may need special skills to

developed. Unlike most existing self-supervised methods to learn only 2D image
features or only 3D point cloud features, this paper presents a novel and
effective self-supervised learning approach to jointly learn both 2D image
features and 3D point cloud features by exploiting cross-modality and
cross-view correspondences without using any human annotated labels.
Specifically, 2D image features of rendered images from different views are
extracted by a 2D convolutional neural network, and 3D point cloud features are
extracted by a graph convolution neural network. Two types of features are fed
into a two-layer fully connected neural network to estimate the cross-modality
correspondence. The three networks are jointly trained (i.e. cross-modality) by
verifying whether two sampled data of different modalities belong to the same
object, meanwhile, the 2D convolutional neural network is additionally
optimized through minimizing intra-object distance while maximizing
inter-object distance of rendered images in different views (i.e. cross-view).
The effectiveness of the learned 2D and 3D features is evaluated by
transferring them on five different tasks including multi-view 2D shape
recognition, 3D shape recognition, multi-view 2D shape retrieval, 3D shape
retrieval, and 3D part-segmentation. Extensive evaluations on all the five
different tasks across different datasets demonstrate strong generalization and

relies on large amounts of training data. However, acquiring high-quality
translation pairs requires expert knowledge and is costly. Therefore, how to
best utilize a given dataset of samples with diverse quality and
characteristics becomes an important yet understudied question in NMT.
Curriculum learning methods have been introduced to NMT to optimize a model's
performance by prescribing the data input order, based on heuristics such as
the assessment of noise and difficulty levels. However, existing methods
require training from scratch, while in practice most NMT models are
pre-trained on big data already. Moreover, as heuristics, they do not
generalize well. In this paper, we aim to learn a curriculum for improving a
pre-trained NMT model by re-selecting influential data samples from the
original training set and formulate this task as a reinforcement learning
problem. Specifically, we propose a data selection framework based on
Deterministic Actor-Critic, in which a critic network predicts the expected
change of model performance due to a certain sample, while an actor network
learns to select the best sample out of a random batch of samples presented to
it. Experiments on several translation datasets show that our method can
further improve the performance of NMT when original batch training reaches its
ceiling, without using additional new training data, and significantly

analyze chest X-ray (CXR) image for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage is
becoming important. Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID-19
pandemic, a systematic collection of the CXR data set for deep neural network

convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of

our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR
radiographs. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency
maps, which are useful for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage.

outbreak that has significantly harmed and threatened the health and lives of
millions or even billions of people. COVID-19 has also negatively impacted the
social and economic activities of many countries significantly. With no
approved vaccine available at this moment, extensive testing of COVID-19
viruses in people are essential for disease diagnosis, virus spread
confinement, contact tracing, and determining right conditions for people to
return to normal economic activities. Identifying people who have antibodies
for COVID-19 can also help select persons who are suitable for undertaking
certain essential activities or returning to workforce. However, the
throughputs of current testing technologies for COVID-19 viruses and antibodies
are often quite limited, which are not sufficient for dealing with COVID-19
viruses' anticipated fast oscillating waves of spread affecting a significant
portion of the earth's population.
  In this paper, we propose to use compressed sensing (group testing can be
seen as a special case of compressed sensing when it is applied to COVID-19
detection) to achieve high-throughput rapid testing of COVID-19 viruses and
antibodies, which can potentially provide tens or even more folds of speedup
compared with current testing technologies. The proposed compressed sensing
system for high-throughput testing can utilize expander graph based compressed
sensing matrices developed by us \cite{Weiyuexpander2007}.

paper, we employ a hierarchical contract-based resilience framework to
guarantee the stability of CPS. In this framework, we use Assume Guarantee
(A-G) contracts to monitor the non-functional properties of individual
components (e.g., power and latency), and hierarchically compose such contracts
to deduce information about faults at the system level. The hierarchical
contracts enable rapid fault detection in large-scale CPS. However, due to the
vast number of components in CPS, manually designing numerous contracts and the
hierarchy becomes challenging. To address this issue, we propose a technique to
automatically decompose a root contract into multiple lower-level contracts
depending on I/O dependencies between components. We then formulate a
multi-objective optimization problem to search the optimal parameters of each
lower-level contract. This enables automatic contract refinement taking into
consideration the communication overhead between components. Finally, we use a
case study from the manufacturing domain to experimentally demonstrate the
benefits of the proposed framework.

Granular Computing (GrC). As a useful unsupervised learning technique, Fuzzy
C-Means (FCM) is one of the most frequently used methods to construct
information granules. The FCM-based granulation-degranulation mechanism plays a
pivotal role in GrC. In this paper, to enhance the quality of the degranulation
(reconstruction) process, we augment the FCM-based degranulation mechanism by
introducing a vector of fuzzification factors (fuzzification factor vector) and
setting up an adjustment mechanism to modify the prototypes and the partition
matrix. The design is regarded as an optimization problem, which is guided by a
reconstruction criterion. In the proposed scheme, the initial partition matrix
and prototypes are generated by the FCM. Then a fuzzification factor vector is
introduced to form an appropriate fuzzification factor for each cluster to
build up an adjustment scheme of modifying the prototypes and the partition
matrix. With the supervised learning mode of the granulation-degranulation
process, we construct a composite objective function of the fuzzification
factor vector, the prototypes and the partition matrix. Subsequently, the
particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to optimize the fuzzification
factor vector to refine the prototypes and develop the optimal partition
matrix. Finally, the reconstruction performance of the FCM algorithm is
enhanced. We offer a thorough analysis of the developed scheme. In particular,
we show that the classical FCM algorithm forms a special case of the proposed
scheme. Experiments completed for both synthetic and publicly available

reconstruction approach.

smartphones, human activity recognition (HAR) based on sensors has become as a
key research area in human computer interaction and ubiquitous computing. The
emergence of deep learning leads to a recent shift in the research of HAR,
which requires massive strictly labeled data. In comparison with video data,
activity data recorded from accelerometer or gyroscope is often more difficult
to interpret and segment. Recently, several attention mechanisms are proposed
to handle the weakly labeled human activity data, which do not require accurate
data annotation. However, these attention-based models can only handle the
weakly labeled dataset whose sample includes one target activity, as a result
it limits efficiency and practicality. In the paper, we propose a recurrent
attention networks (RAN) to handle sequential weakly labeled multi-activity
recognition and location tasks. The model can repeatedly perform steps of
attention on multiple activities of one sample and each step is corresponding
to the current focused activity. The effectiveness of the RAN model is
validated on a collected sequential weakly labeled multi-activity dataset and
the other two public datasets. The experiment results show that our RAN model
can simultaneously infer multi-activity types from the coarse-grained
sequential weak labels and determine specific locations of every target
activity with only knowledge of which types of activities contained in the long
sequence. It will greatly reduce the burden of manual labeling. The code of our

Contrary to other imaging methods, sensitivity improvement has not been

surface roughness of a substrate which anyway restricts the measurable minimum
OPD. However, emerging QPI techniques which utilize, for example, differential
image analysis of consecutive temporal frames, such as mid-infrared
photothermal QPI, mitigate the minimum OPD limit by decoupling the static OPD
contribution and allow to measure much smaller OPD. Here, we propose and
demonstrate super-sensitive QPI with expanded dynamic range. It is enabled by
adaptive dynamic range shift with combination of wavefront shaping and
dark-field QPI techniques. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we show dynamic
range expansion (sensitivity improvement) of QPI by a factor of 6.6 and its
utility for improving sensitivity of mid-infrared photothermal QPI. This
technique can also be applied for wide-field scattering imaging of dynamically

these dockless systems comes at the cost of management and operation
complexity. Indeed, the imbalanced and dynamic use of bikes leads to mandatory
rebalancing operations, which impose a critical need for effective bike traffic
flow prediction. While efforts have been made in developing traffic flow
prediction models, existing approaches lack interpretability, and thus have
limited value in practical deployment. To this end, we propose an Interpretable
Bike Flow Prediction (IBFP) framework, which can provide effective bike flow
prediction with interpretable traffic patterns. Specifically, by dividing the
urban area into regions according to flow density, we first model the
spatio-temporal bike flows between regions with graph regularized sparse
representation, where graph Laplacian is used as a smooth operator to preserve
the commonalities of the periodic data structure. Then, we extract traffic
patterns from bike flows using subspace clustering with sparse representation
to construct interpretable base matrices. Moreover, the bike flows can be
predicted with the interpretable base matrices and learned parameters. Finally,
experimental results on real-world data show the advantages of the IBFP method
for flow prediction in dockless bike sharing systems. In addition, the
interpretability of our flow pattern exploitation is further illustrated
through a case study where IBFP provides valuable insights into bike flow
analysis.

polar and cubed-sphere coordinates that are adopted in high-order
nonhydrostatic MCV dynamical core. By switching the geometrics such as the
metric tensors (covariant and contravariant), Jacobian of the transformation,
the Christoffel symbol of the second kind between the spherical polar and
cubed-sphere coordinates, the resulting flux-form governing equations in the

In
this letter, we point out a novel mechanism for condensation of Dirac fermions
due to Weyl anomaly. The condensation has its physical origin in the nontrivial
response of the fermion vacuum to changes in the background spacetime (either
boundary location or the background metric), and can be felt when a background
scalar field is turned on. The scalar field can be, for example, the Higgs
field in a fundamental theory or the phonon in condensed matter system. For a
spacetime with boundaries, the induced Fermi condensate is inversely
proportional to the proper distance from the boundary. For a conformally flat
spacetime without boundaries, Fermi condensation depends on the conformal
factor and its derivatives. We also generalize the Banks-Casher relation which
relates the Fermi condensate to the zero mode density of the Dirac operator to
a local form. Due to its universal nature, this anomaly induced Fermi
condensate can be expected to have a wide range of applications in physics.

In this paper, two kinds of moments, i.e. point values (PV moment) at cell
boundaries and volume integrated average (VIA) value, are defined within a
single cell. The PV moment is updated by a conventional semi-Lagrangian method,
while the VIA moment is cast by the flux form formulation that assures the
exact numerical conservation. Different from the spatial approximation used in
CSL2 (conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme with second order polynomial
function) scheme, a monotonic rational function which can effectively remove
non-physical oscillations and preserve the shape, is reconstructed in a single
cell by the PV moment and VIA moment. The resulting scheme is inherently
conservative and can allow a CFL number larger than one. Moreover, the scheme
uses only one cell for spatial reconstruction, which is very easy for practical
implementation. The proposed model is evaluated by several widely used
benchmark tests on cubed-sphere geometry. Numerical results show that the
proposed transport model can effectively remove unphysical oscillations
compared with the CSL2 scheme and preserve the numerical non-negativity, and it

long and hard thermonuclear bursts in past X-ray observations. Its
thermonuclear bursts are so energetic that they can even last for tens of
minutes in the hard X-ray observations of Swift/BAT (E > 15 keV). For exploring
the natures of SAX J1712.6-3739 and its thermonuclear bursts, we analyzed its
four bursts which were all captured by Swift/BAT. The peak flux and fluence for
these bursts are derived by applying the archive observation data of Swift/BAT
and Swift/XRT. Based on the peak fluxes observed by Swift, the distance of SAX
J1712.6-3739 is estimated as 4.6 kpc, which is much closer than the estimate by
the BeppoSAX observations. The corresponding absolute magnitude and average
accretion rate agree its ultra-compact X-ray binary nature. By the measurements
of effective duration, we determined that the 2010 burst corresponds to a
normal X-ray burst, the 2011 burst is consistent with an intermediate-duration
burst while the 2014 and the 2018 bursts are more energetic than common
intermediate-duration bursts but less energetic than superbursts. Since the
average mass accretion rate of SAX J1712.6-3739 was only 0.6% Eddington
accretion rate, and current theory predict no carbon production in the bursters
under very low accretion rate. Therefore, the 2014 and the 2018 bursts are very
likely to be deep helium bursts. In the Swift observations, SAX J1712.6-3739
has shown at least three different levels of duration in thermonuclear bursts.
They were possibly induced by variable accretion rates, because their ignition
column depths roughly follow the prediction of ignition models for pure helium
bursts at corresponding accretion rates.

idea of a Lax pair of matrices $(L,A)$, first for mechanical systems such as
the linear harmonic oscillator, Toda chain, Eulerian rigid body and the
Rajeev-Ranken model. This is then extended to Lax operators for one-dimensional
field theories such as the linear wave and KdV equations and reformulated as a
zero curvature representation via a $(U,V)$ pair which is illustrated using the
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. The key idea is that of realizing a
(possibly) nonlinear evolution equation as a compatibility condition between a
pair of linear equations. The latter could be an eigenvalue problem for the Lax
operator $L$ and a linear evolution equation generated by $A$, for the
corresponding eigenfunction. Alternatively, they could be the first order
linear system stating the covariant constancy of an arbitrary vector with
respect to the 1+1 dimensional gauge potential $(V,U)$. The compatibility
conditions are then either the Lax equation $\dot L = [L, A]$ or the flatness
condition $U_t - V_x + [U, V] = 0$ for the corresponding gauge potential. The
conserved quantities then follow from the isospectrality of the Lax and

consider the problem of constellation/signal set design for media-based

theoretical and practical benefits. Constellation design for MBM is
fundamentally different from those for multidimensional coded modulation and
conventional MIMO systems mainly because of the inherent sparse structure of

cross-correlation analysis, as well as by obtaining the slopes in xt-plots. We
obtain original as well as de-trended light curves at different heights of the
time-distance maps and characterize them by performing Fouri\'er and Wavelet
analysis, respectively. The time-distance maps reveal clear propagation of
intensity oscillations in all the coronal EUV channels except AIA 94 and
335~{\AA}. We determine the nature of the intensity disturbances as slow
magnetoacoustic waves by measuring their phase speeds. The time-distance maps,
as well as the de-trended light curves, show an increase and decrease in the
amplitude of propagating 3-min oscillations over time. The amplitude variations
appear most prominent in AIA 171~{\AA}, though other EUV channels also show
such signatures. Fouri\'er power spectrum yield the presence of significant
powers with several nearby frequencies between 2--3 minutes (5--8 mHz), along
with many other smaller peaks between 2--4 minutes. Wavelet analysis shows an
increase and decrease of oscillating power around 3-min simultaneous to the
amplitude variations. We obtain the modulation period to be in the range of
20--30 minutes. Our results provide the viability of occurrence of phenomenon
like `Beat' among the nearby frequencies giving rise to the observed amplitude
modulation. However, we cannot, at this stage, rule out the possibility that
the modulation may be driven by variability of an underlying unknown source.

enforcing Richardson-Obukhov law either by considering a special initial

examples are available, which has been extensively explored in recent years.
However, most of the current works heavily rely on a large-scale labeled
auxiliary set to train their models in an episodic-training paradigm. Such a
kind of supervised setting basically limits the widespread use of few-shot
learning algorithms. Instead, in this paper, we develop a novel framework
called Unsupervised Few-shot Learning via Distribution Shift-based Data
Augmentation (ULDA), which pays attention to the distribution diversity inside
each constructed pretext few-shot task when using data augmentation.
Importantly, we highlight the value and importance of the distribution
diversity in the augmentation-based pretext few-shot tasks, which can
effectively alleviate the overfitting problem and make the few-shot model learn
more robust feature representations. In ULDA, we systemically investigate the
effects of different augmentation techniques and propose to strengthen the
distribution diversity (or difference) between the query set and support set in
each few-shot task, by augmenting these two sets diversely (i.e., distribution
shifting). In this way, even incorporated with simple augmentation techniques
(e.g., random crop, color jittering, or rotation), our ULDA can produce a
significant improvement. In the experiments, few-shot models learned by ULDA
can achieve superior generalization performance and obtain state-of-the-art
results in a variety of established few-shot learning tasks on Omniglot and
miniImageNet. The source code is available in

box-like effective potentials, where the radial equation tends to go to
infinity when the radial coordinate approaches infinity. These QNMs can be
realized as a different set of solutions from those obtained by the
barrier-like effective potentials. However, in some cases the existence of
barrier-like effective potentials in AdS black hole spacetimes can be found. In

based on whether the ensemble members agree on the probability of a regional
distribution change. In our method, estimations over regional distribution
changes are used as instance weights. Constructing different region sets
through different schemes will lead to different drift estimation results,
thereby creating diversity. The classifiers that disagree the most are selected
to maximize diversity. Accordingly, an instance-based ensemble learning
algorithm, called the diverse instance weighting ensemble (DiwE), is developed
to address concept drift for data stream classification problems. Evaluations
of various synthetic and real-world data stream benchmarks show the

optimizing the garment shape and reconstructing the dynamic cloth to fit the
input video sequence, based on a cloth simulation model which is effectively
solved with gradient descent. For texture rendering, we decompose each input
image frame into a shading layer and an albedo layer, and propose a method for
fusing a fixed albedo map and solving for detailed garment geometry using the

results demonstrate that MulayCap produces realistic rendering of dynamically

technological evolution and the increasing deployment of it in our society,
scenarios based on the Internet of Things (IoT) can be considered a reality
nowadays. However, and before some predictions become true (around 75 billion
devices are expected to be interconnected in the next few years), many efforts
must be carried out in terms of scalability and security.
  In this study we propose and evaluate a new approach based on the
incorporation of Blockchain into current IoT scenarios. The main contributions
of this study are as follows: i) an in-depth analysis of the different
possibilities for the integration of Blockchain into IoT scenarios, focusing on
the limited processing capabilities and storage space of most IoT devices, and
the economic cost and performance of current Blockchain technologies; ii) a new
method based on a novel module named BIoT Gateway that allows both
unidirectional and bidirectional communications with IoT devices on real
scenarios, allowing to exchange any kind of data; and iii) the proposed method
has been fully implemented and validated on two different real-life IoT
scenarios, extracting very interesting findings in terms of economic cost and
execution time. The source code of our implementation is publicly available in
the Ethereum testnet.

windows in the near-to-mid-infrared at high ($\sim3$ km s$^{-1}$) spectral
resolution using VLT+CRIRES, SOFIA+EXES, and Gemini North+TEXES. There is an
abundance of H$_2$O absorption lines from the $\nu_1$ and $\nu_3$ vibrational
bands at 2.7 $\mu$m, from the $\nu_2$ vibrational band at 6.1 $\mu$m, and from
pure rotational transitions near 10-13 $\mu$m. Analysis of state-specific
column densities derived from the resolved absorption features reveals that an
isothermal absorbing slab model is incapable of explaining the relative depths
of different absorption features. In particular, the strongest absorption
features are much weaker than expected, indicating optical depth effects
resulting from the absorbing gas being well-mixed with the warm dust that
serves as the ""background"" continuum source at all observed wavelengths. The
velocity at which the strongest H$_2$O absorption occurs coincides with the
velocity centroid along the minor axis of the compact disk in Keplerian
rotation recently observed in H$_2$O emission with ALMA. We postulate that the
warm regions of this dust disk dominate the continuum emission at near-to-mid
infrared wavelengths, and that H$_2$O and several other molecules observed in
absorption are probing this disk. Absorption line profiles are not symmetric,
possibly indicating that the warm dust in the disk that produces the infrared
continuum has a non-uniform distribution similar to the substructure observed
in 1.3 mm continuum emission.

metropolises, criminal activity is much higher and violent than in either small
cities or rural areas. Thus, understanding what factors influence urban crime
in big cities is a pressing need. Mainstream studies analyse crime records
through historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with
ecological factor and exploratory mapping. More recently, machine learning
methods have provided informed crime prediction over time. However, previous
studies have focused on a single city at a time, considering only a limited
number of factors (such as socio-economical characteristics) and often at large
spatial units. Hence, our understanding of the factors influencing crime across
cultures and cities is very limited. Here we propose a Bayesian model to
explore how crime is related not only to socio-economic factors but also to the
built environmental (e.g. land use) and mobility characteristics of
neighbourhoods. To that end, we integrate multiple open data sources with
mobile phone traces and compare how the different factors correlate with crime
in diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogot\'a, Los Angeles and Chicago. We find
that the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information and
physical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence
of crime, and improve the performance of the traditional approaches. However,
we show that the socio-ecological factors of neighbourhoods relate to crime
very differently from one city to another. Thus there is clearly no ""one fits

spin-photon coupling effect is derived based on the energy level splitting.
However, the AFM magnon-polariton is absent in the frequency domain

stochastic Volterra integral equations (FBSVIEs, for short) and a system of
(non-local in time) path dependent partial differential equations (PPDEs, for
short). Due to the nature of Volterra type equations, the usual flow property
(or semigroup property) does not hold. Inspired by Viens-Zhang
\cite{Viens-Zhang-2019} and Wang-Yong \cite{Wang-Yong-2019}, auxiliary
processes are introduced so that the flow property of adapted solutions to the
FBSVIEs is recovered in a suitable sense, and thus the functional It\^o's
formula is applicable. Having achieved this stage, a natural PPDE is found so
that the adapted solution of the backward SVIEs admits a representation in
terms of the solution to the forward SVIE via the solution to a PPDE. On the
other hand, the solution of the PPDE admits a representation in terms of
adapted solution to the (path dependent) FBSVIE, which is referred to as a
Feynman-Kac formula. This leads to the existence and uniqueness of a classical
solution to the PPDE, under smoothness conditions on the coefficients of the
FBSVIEs. Further, when the smoothness conditions are relaxed with the backward
component of FBSVIE being one-dimensional, a new (and suitable) notion of
viscosity solution is introduced for the PPDE, for which a comparison principle
of the viscosity solutions is established, leading to the uniqueness of the
viscosity solution. Finally, some results have been extended to coupled FBSVIEs
and type-II BSVIEs, and a representation formula for the path derivatives of
PPDE solution is obtained by a closer investigation of linear FBSVIEs.

proposed a classification schema considering the multi-class and hierarchical

natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling
algorithms in order to re-balance the classes distribution. Our classification
schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also
using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion
techniques in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors
and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database,
named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different
pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution
follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than
others. The proposed approach achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a

improve the converters' ENOB. We model and analyze the ENOB limitations arising
from optical sources in optically enabled, spectrally sliced ADCs, after
discussing the system architecture and implementation details. The phase noise
of the optical carrier, serving for electro-optic signal transduction, is shown
not to propagate to the reconstructed digitized signal and therefore not to
represent a fundamental limit. The optical phase noise of the MLL used to
generate reference tones for individual slices also does not fundamentally
impact the converted signal, so long as it remains correlated among all the
comb lines. On the other hand, the timing jitter of the MLL, as also reflected
in its RF linewidth, is fundamentally limiting the ADC performance, since it is
directly mapped as jitter to the converted signal. The hybrid nature of a
photonically enabled, spectrally sliced ADC implies the utilization of a number
of reduced bandwidth electrical ADCs to convert parallel slices, resulting in
the propagation of jitter from the electrical oscillator supplying their clock.
Due to the reduced sampling rate of the electrical ADCs, as compared to the
overall system, the overall noise performance of the presented architecture is
substantially improved with respect to a fully electrical ADC.

investigate different biasing effects, we intentionally introduced errors to
the augmentation. Furthermore, we developed a novel loss function which
incorporates the experts' annotation consensus in the training of a deep
learning classifier. In total, the pathology experts annotated 26,015 cells on
1,200 images in this novel annotation study. Backed by this extensive data set,
we found that the consensus of multiple experts and the deep learning
classifier accuracy, was significantly increased in the computer-aided setting,
versus the unaided annotation. However, a significant percentage of the
deliberately introduced false labels was not identified by the experts.
Additionally, we showed that our loss function profited from multiple experts

errors did not lead to a deterioration of the trained classifier accuracy.
Furthermore, a classifier trained with annotations from a single expert with

with the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) linear response

core-valence separation (CVS) approximation, which is predominantly used by
many other electronic structure methods for simulating X-ray spectra. The
second ansatz uses the harmonic Davidson algorithm (DA) for finding interior
eigenvalues that lie close to a target excitation energy shift and virtually
solves a shifted-and-inverted (S&I) generalized eigenvalue problem. Our
implementations of these Davidson-type algorithms for core spectroscopies
converge as rapidly as the standard DA for valence excitations. It is shown in
a proof-of-principle application to the Manganese atom that the additional
errors for excitations energies introduced by the CVS approximation compared to
the exact S&I approach are negligible for K-edges, but become larger than the
methodological error of the CASSCF LR method when computing M-edges. We could
also demonstrate that, in case of large active-space K-edge calculations, the
computational savings of the CVS approximation are huge as the configuration
part of the response vectors is completely neglected. When simulating the
oxygen K-edge XA spectrum of the permanganate ion, CASSCF LR showed a better
agreement with the experimental spectrum than the CAS-CI and NEVPT2 methods,
however, the order of the two close-together pre-edge peaks seems to be
inverted.

trends. Even for the same request type, latency may vary from one request to
another. These variations can occur due to several reasons on different levels
of the software stack: operating system, network, software libraries,
application code or others. Furthermore, a request may involve several Remote
Procedure Calls (RPC), where each call can be subject to performance variation.
Performance analysts inspect distributed traces and seek for recurrent patterns
in trace attributes, such as RPCs execution time, in order to cluster traces in
which variations may be induced by the same cause. Clustering ""similar"" traces
is a prerequisite for effective performance debugging. Given the scale of the
problem, such activity can be tedious and expensive. In this paper, we present
an automated approach that detects relevant RPCs execution time patterns
associated to request latency degradation, i.e. latency degradation patterns.
The presented approach is based on a genetic search algorithm driven by an
information retrieval relevance metric and an optimized fitness evaluation.
Each latency degradation pattern identifies a cluster of requests subject to
latency degradation with similar patterns in RPCs execution time. We show on a
microservice-based application case study that the proposed approach can
effectively detect clusters identified by artificially injected latency
degradation patterns. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms
in terms of F-score a state-of-art approach for latency profile analysis and
widely popular machine learning clustering algorithms. We also show how our
approach can be easily extended to trace attributes other than RPC execution

complete due the incompleteness of specifications. An implementation meeting an
incomplete specification may still have a lot of bugs. In testing, this issue
is addressed by replacing functional completeness with $\mathit{structural}$
one. The latter is achieved by generating a set of tests probing every piece of
a design implementation. We show that a similar approach can be used in formal
verification. The idea here is to generate a property of the implementation at
hand that is not implied by the specification. Finding such a property means
that the specification is not complete. If this is an $\mathit{unwanted}$
property, the implementation is buggy. Otherwise, a new specification property
needs to be added. Generation of implementation properties related to different
parts of the design followed by adding new specification properties produces a
$\mathit{structurally}$-$\mathit{complete\:specification}$. Implementation
properties are built by $\mathit{partial\: quantifier\:elimination}$, a
technique where only a part of the formula is taken out of the scope of
quantifiers. An implementation property is generated by applying partial
quantifier elimination to a formula defining the ""truth table"" of the
implementation. We show how our approach works on specifications of

definite properties independent of past or future measurements and is
traditionally tested for systems described at each time by a single dichotomic
variable $Q$. A number of necessary and sufficient conditions for macrorealism
have been derived for a dichtomic variable using sets of Leggett-Garg (LG)
inequalities, or the stronger no-signaling in time (NSIT) conditions, or a
combination thereof. Here, we extend this framework by establishing necessary
and sufficient conditions for macrorealism for measurements made at two and
three times for systems described by variables taking three or more values at
each time. Our results include a generalization of Fine's theorem to
many-valued variables for measurements at three pairs of times and we derive
the corresponding complete set of LG inequalities. We find that LG inequalities
and NSIT conditions for many-valued variables do not enjoy the simple
hierarchical relationship exhibited by the dichotomic case. This sheds light on
some recent experiments on three-level systems which exhibit a LG inequality
violation even though certain NSIT conditions are satisfied. Under measurements
of dichotomic variables using the Luders projection rule the three-time LG
inequalities cannot be violated beyond the Luders bound (which coincides
numerically with the Tsirelson bound obeyed by correlators in Bell
experiments), but this bound can be violated in LG tests using
degeneracy-breaking (von Neumann) measurements. We identify precisely which MR
conditions are violated under these circumstances.

examples, meta-learning has been widely used in numerous problems such as
few-shot classification, reinforcement learning, and domain generalization.
However, meta-learning models are prone to overfitting when there are no
sufficient training tasks for the meta-learners to generalize. Although
existing approaches such as Dropout are widely used to address the overfitting
problem, these methods are typically designed for regularizing models of a
single task in supervised training. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet
effective method to alleviate the risk of overfitting for gradient-based
meta-learning. Specifically, during the gradient-based adaptation stage, we
randomly drop the gradient in the inner-loop optimization of each parameter in
deep neural networks, such that the augmented gradients improve generalization
to new tasks. We present a general form of the proposed gradient dropout
regularization and show that this term can be sampled from either the Bernoulli
or Gaussian distribution. To validate the proposed method, we conduct extensive
experiments and analysis on numerous computer vision tasks, demonstrating that
the gradient dropout regularization mitigates the overfitting problem and
improves the performance upon various gradient-based meta-learning frameworks.

simultaneous off-diagonal long-range order and nontrivial topological

Majorana zero modes and chiral Majorana edge states with topologically

Candidate TSCs are very rare in nature. Here, we propose a novel route toward
emergent quasi-one-dimensional (1D) TSCs in naturally embedded quantum
structures such as atomic line defects in unconventional spin-singlet $s$-wave
and $d$-wave superconductors. We show that inversion symmetry breaking and
charge transfer due to the missing atoms lead to the occupation of incipient
impurity bands and mixed parity spin singlet and triplet Cooper pairing of
neighboring electrons traversing the line defect. Nontrivial topological
invariants arise and occupy a large part of the parameter space, including the
time reversal symmetry breaking Zeeman coupling due to applied magnetic field
or defect-induced magnetism, creating TSCs in different topological classes
with robust Majorana zero modes at both ends of the line defect. Beyond
providing a novel mechanism for the recent discovery of zero-energy bound
states at both ends of an atomic line defect in monolayer Fe(Te,Se)
superconductors, the findings pave the way for new material realizations of the

groups. Although some previous studies attempted to identify and analyze such
opinion spam groups, little has been explored to spot those groups who target a
brand as a whole, instead of just products.
  In this paper, we collected reviews from the Amazon product review site and
manually labelled a set of 923 candidate reviewer groups. The groups are
extracted using frequent itemset mining over brand similarities such that users
are clustered together if they have mutually reviewed (products of) a lot of
brands. We hypothesize that the nature of the reviewer groups is dependent on 8
features specific to a (group, brand) pair. We develop a feature-based
supervised model to classify candidate groups as extremist entities. We run
multiple classifiers for the task of classifying a group based on the reviews
written by the users of that group, to determine if the group shows signs of
extremity. A 3-layer Perceptron based classifier turns out to be the best
classifier. We further study the behaviours of such groups in detail to
understand the dynamics of brand-level opinion fraud better. These behaviours
include consistency in ratings, review sentiment, verified purchase, review
dates and helpful votes received on reviews. Surprisingly, we observe that
there are a lot of verified reviewers showing extreme sentiment, which on
further investigation leads to ways to circumvent existing mechanisms in place
to prevent unofficial incentives on Amazon.

dynamical isometry and speeding up training. The increase in learning speed
that results from orthogonal initialization in linear networks has been
well-proven. However, while the same is believed to also hold for nonlinear
networks when the dynamical isometry condition is satisfied, the training
dynamics behind this contention have not been thoroughly explored. In this
work, we study the dynamics of ultra-wide networks across a range of
architectures, including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) with orthogonal initialization via neural tangent kernel
(NTK). Through a series of propositions and lemmas, we prove that two NTKs, one
corresponding to Gaussian weights and one to orthogonal weights, are equal when
the network width is infinite. Further, during training, the NTK of an
orthogonally-initialized infinite-width network should theoretically remain
constant. This suggests that the orthogonal initialization cannot speed up
training in the NTK (lazy training) regime, contrary to the prevailing
thoughts. In order to explore under what circumstances can orthogonality
accelerate training, we conduct a thorough empirical investigation outside the
NTK regime. We find that when the hyper-parameters are set to achieve a linear
regime in nonlinear activation, orthogonal initialization can improve the
learning speed with a large learning rate or large depth.

integer time labels that indicate at which discrete time step the edge is

motivated by numerous applications of temporal graphs in network epidemiology,
which aim to minimise the spread of infection, and scheduling problems in
supply networks in manufacturing with the opposite objectives of maximising
coverage and productivity. We introduce control mechanisms for reachability
sets that are based on two natural operations of delaying. The first operation,
termed merging, is global and batches together consecutive time labels into a
single time label in the whole network simultaneously. This corresponds to
postponing all events until a particular time. The second, imposes independent
delays on the time labels of every edge of the graph. We provide a thorough
investigation of the computational complexity of different objectives related
to reachability sets when these operations are used. For the merging operation,
i.e. global lockdown effect, we prove NP-hardness results for several
minimization and maximization reachability objectives, even for very simple

of lepton scattering off nuclei is proposed within the relativistic Hamiltonian
dynamics in the light-front form. Indeed a high level of accuracy is needed for
a comparison with the increasingly precise present and future experimental data
at high momentum transfer. Therefore, to distinguish genuine QCD effects or
effects of medium modified nucleon structure functions from conventional
nuclear structure effects, the commutation rules between the Poincar\'e
generators should be satisfied. For the first time in this paper a proper
hadronic tensor for inclusive deep inelastic scattering of electrons off nuclei
is derived in the impulse approximation in terms of the single nucleon hadronic
tensor. Our approach is based : i) on a light-front spectral function for
nuclei, obtained taking advantage of the successful non-relativistic knowledge
of nuclear interaction, and ii) on the free current operator that, if defined
in the Breit reference frame with the momentum transfer, $\bf q$, parallel to
the $z$ axis, fulfills Poincar\'e covariance and current conservation.
  Our results can be generalized : i) to exclusive processes or to
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes; ii) to the case where the
final state interaction is considered through a Glauber approximation; iii) to
finite momentum transfer kinematics.
  As a first test, the hadronic tensor is applied to obtain the nuclear
structure function F$_2^A$ and to evaluate the EMC effect for $^3He$ in the
Bjorken limit.
  Encouraging results including only the two-body part of the light-front
spectral function are presented.

characterized by two wave equations (for two chiralities) with effective

Therefore, the stability of a Dirac field in the Schwarzschild background is
straightforward. This is not so for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case, because
potentials for both chiralities have negative gaps and the fact that the
stability is not automatically guaranteed in the asymptotically de Sitter case
was apparently omitted in the literature. Performing the time-domain
integration of the wave equations and, thereby, taking into consideration all
the quasinormal modes of the spectrum, we demonstrate stability of the Dirac

extended also to the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter solution.

training is the most promising one, which flattens the input loss landscape
(loss change with respect to input) via training on adversarially perturbed
examples. However, how the widely used weight loss landscape (loss change with
respect to weight) performs in adversarial training is rarely explored. In this
paper, we investigate the weight loss landscape from a new perspective, and
identify a clear correlation between the flatness of weight loss landscape and
robust generalization gap. Several well-recognized adversarial training
improvements, such as early stopping, designing new objective functions, or
leveraging unlabeled data, all implicitly flatten the weight loss landscape.
Based on these observations, we propose a simple yet effective Adversarial
Weight Perturbation (AWP) to explicitly regularize the flatness of weight loss
landscape, forming a double-perturbation mechanism in the adversarial training
framework that adversarially perturbs both inputs and weights. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWP indeed brings flatter weight loss landscape
and can be easily incorporated into various existing adversarial training
methods to further boost their adversarial robustness.

distributions of color, absolute magnitude, and stellar mass of the galaxies
around such target objects. The properties of clusters detected using
surrounding galaxies selected based on a photometric redshift were examined and
compared for different samples. The target AGNs were drawn from the Million

image plays a vital role in facial analysis systems. One big challenge for
data-driven AU intensity estimation is the lack of sufficient AU label data.
Due to the fact that AU annotation requires strong domain expertise, it is
expensive to construct an extensive database to learn deep models. The limited
number of labeled AUs as well as identity differences and pose variations
further increases the estimation difficulties. Considering all these
difficulties, we propose an unsupervised framework GE-Net for facial AU
intensity estimation from a single image, without requiring any annotated AU
data. Our framework performs differentiable optimization, which iteratively
updates the facial parameters (i.e., head pose, AU parameters and identity
parameters) to match the input image. GE-Net consists of two modules: a
generator and a feature extractor. The generator learns to ""render"" a face
image from a set of facial parameters in a differentiable way, and the feature
extractor extracts deep features for measuring the similarity of the rendered
image and input real image. After the two modules are trained and fixed, the
framework searches optimal facial parameters by minimizing the differences of
the extracted features between the rendered image and the input image.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art
results compared with existing methods.

quantum mechanical instability beyond mean field theory, we here pursue an
approximate analytical description of the snake instability within

describing buckling modes of the low-density plane. We extend the analytical
results of Kuznetsov and Turitsyn [Sov. Phys. JETP \textbf{67}, 1583 (1988)] to
shorter wavelengths of the `snake' modulation and show to what extent the snake
mode can be described accurately as a parametric instability, in which the
position and grayness parameter of the initial soliton simply become dependent

accurate up to second order in the snaking wave number, if the snaking soliton

question arises how to allocate trials to the different subregions. We consider
a solution to this problem assuming a linear mixed model. We propose an
analytical approach for computation of optimal designs for best linear unbiased

hypothesized to arise from events with inner engines such as off-axis GRBs or
choked jets. Here we present observations of the nearby ($d = 120$ Mpc) SN

observations reveal an early decline (up to two days after explosion) while
optical spectra classify it as a SN Ic-BL with very high expansion velocities
($\approx$ 70,000 km/s), similar to that found for the jet-cocoon emission in
SN 2017iuk associated with GRB 171205A. Moreover, \textit{Swift} X-Ray

days after the SN and decaying onwards, which can be ascribed to an afterglow
component. Cocoon and X-ray emission are both signatures of jet-powered GRBs.
In the case of SN 2020bvc, we find that the jet is off axis (by $\approx$ 23
degrees), as also indicated by the lack of early ($\approx 1$ day) X-ray
emission which explains why no coincident GRB was detected promptly or in

relate these representations to five color forests. These combinatorial
structures resemble Schnyder woods and transversal structures, respectively. In
particular there is a bijection to certain alpha-orientations and consequently
a lattice structure on the set of five color forests of a given graph. This
lattice structure plays a role in an algorithm that is supposed to compute a
contact representation with pentagons for a given graph. Based on a five color
forest the algorithm builds a system of linear equations and solves it, if the
solution is non-negative, it encodes distances between corners of a pentagon
representation. In this case the representation is constructed and the
algorithm terminates. Otherwise negative variables guide a change of the five
color forest and the procedure is restarted with the new five color forest.
Similar algorithms have been proposed for contact representations with

are generated according to the underlying cluster structure on the vertices.
The (ferromagnetic) Ising model, on the other hand, assigns $\pm 1$ labels to
vertices according to an underlying graph structure in a way that if two
vertices are connected in the graph then they are more likely to be assigned
the same label. In SBM, one aims to recover the underlying clusters from the
graph structure while in Ising model, an extensively-studied problem is to
recover the underlying graph structure based on i.i.d. samples (labelings of
the vertices).
  In this paper, we propose a natural composition of SBM and the Ising model,
which we call the Stochastic Ising Block Model (SIBM). In SIBM, we take SBM in
its simplest form, where $n$ vertices are divided into two equal-sized clusters
and the edges are connected independently with probability $p$ within clusters
and $q$ across clusters. Then we use the graph $G$ generated by the SBM as the
underlying graph of the Ising model and draw $m$ i.i.d. samples from it. The
objective is to exactly recover the two clusters in SBM from the samples
generated by the Ising model, without observing the graph $G$. As the main
result of this paper, we establish a sharp threshold $m^\ast$ on the sample

$m^\ast$ can be calculated from the parameters of SIBM. We show that when $m\ge

for almost all choices of parameters of SIBM, the success probability of any

current-induced spin-orbit torque in complex magnets, we develop a unified
theory of current-induced spin-orbital coupled dynamics. The theory describes
angular momentum transfer between different degrees of freedom in solids, e.g.,
the electron orbital and spin, the crystal lattice, and the magnetic order
parameter. Based on the continuity equations for the spin and orbital angular
momenta, we derive equations of motion that relate spin and orbital current
fluxes and torques describing the transfer of angular momentum between
different degrees of freedom. We then propose a classification scheme for the
mechanisms of the current-induced torque in magnetic bilayers. Based on our
first-principles implementation, we apply our formalism to two different
magnetic bilayers, Fe/W(110) and Ni/W(110), which are chosen such that the
orbital and spin Hall effects in W have opposite sign and the resulting spin-
and orbital-mediated torques can compete with each other. We find that while
the spin torque arising from the spin Hall effect of W is the dominant
mechanism of the current-induced torque in Fe/W(110), the dominant mechanism in
Ni/W(110) is the orbital torque originating in the orbital Hall effect of W. It
leads to negative and positive effective spin Hall angles, respectively, which
can be directly identified in experiments. This clearly demonstrates that our
formalism is ideal for studying the angular momentum transfer dynamics in
spin-orbit coupled systems as it goes beyond the ""spin current picture"" by
naturally incorporating the spin and orbital degrees of freedom on an equal
footing. Our calculations reveal that, in addition to the spin and orbital
torque, other contributions such as the interfacial torque and self-induced
anomalous torque within the ferromagnet are not negligible in both material
systems.

in the context of medical imaging due to its adaptability and robustness in 3D
object modeling. A field that utilizes BSI is Image Guided Surgery (IGS). IGS
provides navigation using medical images, which can be segmented and
reconstructed into 3D models, often through BSI. Image registration tasks also
use BSI to align pre-operative data to intra-operative data. However, such IGS
tasks are computationally demanding, especially when applied to 3D medical
images, due to the complexity and amount of data involved. Therefore,
optimization of IGS algorithms is greatly desirable, for example, to perform
image registration tasks intra-operatively and to enable real-time
applications. A traditional CPU does not have sufficient computing power to
achieve these goals. In this paper, we introduce a novel GPU implementation of
BSI to accelerate the calculation of the deformation field in non-rigid image
registration algorithms.
  Methods. Our BSI implementation on GPUs minimizes the data that needs to be
moved between memory and processing cores during loading of the input grid, and
leverages the large on-chip GPU register file for reuse of input values.
Moreover, we re-formulate our method as trilinear interpolations to reduce
computational complexity and increase accuracy. To provide pre-clinical
validation of our method and demonstrate its benefits in medical applications,
we integrate our improved BSI into a registration workflow for compensation of
liver deformation (caused by pneumoperitoneum, i.e., inflation of the abdomen)
and evaluate its performance.
  Results. Our approach improves the performance of BSI by an average of 6.5x
and interpolation accuracy by 2x compared to three state-of-the-art GPU
implementations. We observe up to 34% acceleration of non-rigid image
registration.

Specifically, at each time-step, the agents locally compute a so-called
pseudo-gradient to guide the updates of the decision variables, which can be
applied in the fields where the gradient information is unknown, not available
or non-existent. A surplus-based method is adopted to remove the doubly
stochastic requirement on the weighting matrix, which enables the
implementation of the algorithm in graphs having no associated doubly
stochastic weighting matrix. For the convergence results, the proposed
algorithm is able to obtain the exact convergence to the optimal value with any
positive, non-summable and non-increasing step-sizes. Furthermore, when the
step-size is also square-summable, the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to
achieve the exact convergence to an optimal solution. In addition to the
standard convergence analysis, the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm
is also investigated. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is
verified through numerical simulations.

topic models has become popular among social scientists because of their
scalability. The unsupervised nature of the models makes them suitable for
exploring topics in a corpus without prior knowledge. However, researchers find
that these models often fail to measure specific concepts of substantive
interest by inadvertently creating multiple topics with similar content and
combining distinct themes into a single topic. In this paper, we empirically
demonstrate that providing a small number of keywords can substantially enhance
the measurement performance of topic models. An important advantage of the
proposed keyword assisted topic model (keyATM) is that the specification of
keywords requires researchers to label topics prior to fitting a model to the
data. This contrasts with a widespread practice of post-hoc topic
interpretation and adjustments that compromises the objectivity of empirical
findings. In our application, we find that keyATM provides more interpretable
results, has better document classification performance, and is less sensitive
to the number of topics than the standard topic models. Finally, we show that
keyATM can also incorporate covariates and model time trends. An open-source
software package is available for implementing the proposed methodology.

Inactivated bits are resolved using information gathered from decoding frozen

applied to any linear code by representing it as a polar code with dynamic
frozen bits. SCL decoders are partially characterized using density evolution
to compute the average number of inactivations required to achieve the maximum

the number of paths in SCL decoding. The technique is applied to analyze

non-Newtonian behaviour, such as discontinuous shear thickening (DST) and shear
jamming (SJ). The essential contribution of particle surface roughness and
adhesive forces confirms that stress-activated contacts can play a key role in
these phenomena. By employing a system of microparticles coated by responsive
polymers that allow friction, adhesion, and surface roughness to be selectively
and independently tuned as a function of temperature, we offer a way to
disentangle these contributions. We find that DST occurs at lower shear rates
when friction and adhesion between particles are enhanced at high temperatures.
Additionally, the temperature-responsive polymers provide lubricity at low
temperatures that can mask surface roughness. The link between single-particle
properties and macroscopic rheology is elucidated via lateral force microscopy,
which reveals the nature of rheologically relevant contact conditions. In situ
temperature tuning during shear allows contact conditions to be modified, and
DST to be switched on and off on demand. These findings strengthen our
understanding of the microscopic parameters affecting DST and identify new
routes for the design of smart, non-Newtonian fluids.

if its components are black holes or not. The former property (TD) is finite
for neutron stars but vanishes for black holes (in general relativity), whereas
the latter is finite for black holes and negligible for neutron stars, and
affects the GW phase evolution of binaries in a distinctly different way. We
introduce waveform parameters that characterize the strength of tidal-heating,
and are zero when there is no horizon. We develop Bayesian methods that use TD
and TH for distinguishing the presence or absence of horizons in a binary. This
is timely owing to several claims that these stellar-mass objects, especially,
with masses heavier than those of neutron stars, may not have a horizon but may
be black hole mimickers or exotic compact objects (ECOs). It is also
astrophysically important to have the tools to test the presence or absence of
horizons in mass-gap binaries and, thereby, help detect the heaviest neutron
star or the lightest black hole. A proper accounting of tidal-heating in binary
waveform models will also be critical for an unbiased measurement of
characteristics of the equation of state of neutron stars in GW observations of
binaries containing them -- or even to probe the existence of ECOs. We show
that purely based on GW waveforms it will not be possible to discern binary
horizons in the mass gap in Advanced LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors unless the
binary is within a few tens of Mpc. However, third generation ground-based
detectors will be able to do so for binaries a few hundred Mpc away.

movement ecology research in the realm of big data science. That data growth

animal ecologists need a greater understanding of technical skills such as

Therefore, collaboration has become increasingly crucial, as research requires
both domain knowledge and technical expertise. Datasets of animal movement and

described in scientific journals. However, there is little connectivity between

variety of applications, such as dialog generation, image generation and
disentangled representation learning. However, the existing VAE models have
some limitations in different applications. For example, a VAE easily suffers
from KL vanishing in language modeling and low reconstruction quality for
disentangling. To address these issues, we propose a novel controllable
variational autoencoder framework, ControlVAE, that combines a controller,
inspired by automatic control theory, with the basic VAE to improve the
performance of resulting generative models. Specifically, we design a new
non-linear PI controller, a variant of the proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) control, to automatically tune the hyperparameter (weight) added in the
VAE objective using the output KL-divergence as feedback during model training.
The framework is evaluated using three applications; namely, language modeling,
disentangled representation learning, and image generation. The results show
that ControlVAE can achieve better disentangling and reconstruction quality
than the existing methods. For language modelling, it not only averts the
KL-vanishing, but also improves the diversity of generated text. Finally, we
also demonstrate that ControlVAE improves the reconstruction quality of
generated images compared to the original VAE.

Recent development in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides new
opportunities to mmWave communications. In this study, we propose a mmWave
system, which used low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), with the
aid of several RIS arrays. Moreover, each RIS array has many reflectors with
discrete phase shift. By employing the linear spatial processing, these arrays
form a synthetic channel with increased spatial diversity and power gain, which
can support MIMO transmission. We develop a MIMO detector according to the
characteristics of the synthetic channel. RIS arrays can provide spatial
diversity to support MIMO transmission, however, different number, antenna
configuration, and deployment of RIS arrays affect the bit error rate (BER)
performance. We present state evolution (SE) equations to evaluate the BER of
the proposed MIMO detector in the different cases. The BER performance of
indoor system is studied extensively through leveraging by the SE equations. We
reveal numerous insights about the RIS effects and discuss the appropriate

Regulators (PAR) and Power Transformers. The analysis prevents mal-operation of
differential relays in case of transients other than faults which include
magnetizing inrush, sympathetic inrush, external faults with CT saturation,
capacitor switching, non-linear load switching, and ferroresonance. A gradient
boosting classifier (GBC) is used to distinguish the internal faults from the
transient disturbances based on 1.5 cycles of 3-phase differential currents
registered by a change detector. After the detection of an internal fault, GBCs
are used to locate the faulty unit (Power Transformer, PAR series, or exciting
unit) and identify the type of fault. In case a transient disturbance is
detected, another GBC classifies them into the six transient disturbances. Five
most relevant frequency and time domain features obtained using Information
Gain are used to train and test the classifiers. The proposed algorithm
distinguishes the internal faults from the other transients with a balanced
accuracy of 99.95%. The faulty transformer unit is located with a balanced
accuracy of 99.5% and the different transient disturbances are identified with
a balanced accuracy of 99.3%. Moreover, the reliability of the scheme is
verified for different rating and connection of the transformers involved, CT
saturation, and noise levels in the signals. These GBC classifiers can work
together with a conventional differential relay and offer a supervisory control

transients and to develop the two and three-winding transformer models for
creating the internal faults including inter-turn and inter-winding faults.

silicon itself can have sufficient thermal emissivity in order to cool the 200

language questions from KGs and target answers. Previous works mostly focus on
a simple setting which is to generate questions from a single KG triple. In
this work, we focus on a more realistic setting where we aim to generate
questions from a KG subgraph and target answers. In addition, most of previous
works built on either RNN-based or Transformer based models to encode a
linearized KG sugraph, which totally discards the explicit structure
information of a KG subgraph. To address this issue, we propose to apply a
bidirectional Graph2Seq model to encode the KG subgraph. Furthermore, we
enhance our RNN decoder with node-level copying mechanism to allow directly
copying node attributes from the KG subgraph to the output question. Both
automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that our model achieves new
state-of-the-art scores, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin
on two QG benchmarks. Experimental results also show that our QG model can
consistently benefit the Question Answering (QA) task as a mean of data
augmentation.

lock-exchange facility are conducted for a range of Reynolds numbers, $Re=
\frac{U_Fh}{\nu} =$ 485-12270. The velocity and density fields are captured
simultaneously using a PIV-PLIF system. A moving average method is employed to
compute the mean field and a host of turbulence statistics, namely, turbulent
kinetic energy ($K$), shear production ($P$), buoyancy flux ($B$), and energy
dissipation ($\epsilon$) during the slumping phase of the current. The
subsequent findings are used to ascertain the quantitative values of mixing
efficiency, $Ri_{f}$, Ozmidov length-scale ($L_O$), Kolmogorov length-scale
($L_\kappa$), and eddy diffusivities of momentum ($\kappa_m$) and scalar
($\kappa_\rho$). Two different forms of $Ri_{f}$ are characterized in this
study, denoted by $Ri_{f}^I=\frac{B}{P}$ and
$Ri_{f}^{II}=\frac{B}{B+\epsilon}$. The results cover the entire diffusive
regime (3 $<Re_b<$ 10) and a portion of the intermediate regime (10 $<Re_b<$
50), where $Re_b=\frac{\epsilon}{\nu N^2}$ is the buoyancy Reynolds number that
measures the level of turbulence in a shear-stratified flow. The values of $P$,
$B$, and $\epsilon$ show a marked increase at the interface of the ambient
fluid and the current, owing to the development of a shear-driven mixed layer.
Based on the changes in the turbulence statistics and the length scales, it is
inferred that the turbulence decays along the length of the current. The mixing
efficiency monotonically increases in the diffusive regime ($Re_{b}<$10), and
is found to have an upper bound of $Ri_{f}^{I}\approx$ 0.15 and
$Ri_{f}^{II}\approx$ 0.2 in the intermediate regime. Using the values of
$Ri_{f}$, the normalized eddy diffusivity of momentum is parameterized as
$\frac{\kappa_m}{\nu.Ri_{g}}$=1.2$Re_{b}$ and normalized eddy diffusivity of
scalar as $\frac{\kappa_{\rho}}{\nu}$=0.2$Re_{b}$

planes of oriented crystals is accompanied by incoherent scattering by atomic
cores. While the coherent particle deflection, described by the axial or planar
averaged potential, becomes more and more classical at high energies, the
incoherent scattering of relativistic particles remains essentially quantum.
Though the latter reminds the scattering by atoms of amorphous medium at high
enough momentum transfers, at the smallest ones the incoherent scattering
process in crystals experiences some modification by the influence of the
inhomogeneity of the atom distribution in the plane, normal to the crystal axis
or plane. Considering the axial case as a more general example, we present a
consistent theory of high energy particles incoherent scattering in oriented
crystals. The latter takes into consideration both the quantum scattering
nature and the atom distribution inhomogeneity, revealing the limited
applicability of the scattering cross section notion. The way to incorporate
the quantum scattering features into the widely used classical trajectory
simulations is elaborated using newly introduced mean square scattering angle
definition.

concerns time from occurrence of an event of interest to the current time point
and has recently emerged as a new summary measure for cumulative information
inherent in time-to-event data. This summary measure provides several benefits
over the traditional methods, including more straightforward interpretation yet
less sensitivity to heavy censoring. However, there exists no systematic
modeling approach to inferring the quantile inactivity time in the literature.
In this paper, we propose a regression method for the quantiles of the
inactivity time distribution under right censoring. The consistency and
asymptotic normality of the regression parameters are established. To avoid
estimation of the probability density function of the inactivity time
distribution under censoring, we propose a computationally efficient method for
estimating the variance-covariance matrix of the regression coefficient
estimates. Simulation results are presented to validate the finite sample
properties of the proposed estimators and test statistics. The proposed method
is illustrated with a real dataset from a clinical trial on breast cancer.

and resultant patterns of dried deposits of aqueous colloidal sessile droplets,
when the droplets are initially elevated to a high temperature before being
placed on a substrate held at ambient temperature. The system is then released
for natural evaporation without applying any external perturbation. Infrared
thermography and optical profilometry were used as essential tools for
interfacial temperature measurements and quantification of the coffee-ring
dimensions, respectively. Initially, a significant temperature gradient exists
along the liquid-gas interface as soon as the droplet is deposited on the
substrate which triggers a Marangoni stress-induced recirculation flow directed
from the top of the droplet towards the contact line along the liquid-gas
interface. Thus, the flow is in the reverse direction to that seen in the
conventional substrate heating case. Interestingly, this temperature gradient
decays rapidly -- within the first 10% of the total evaporation time and the
droplet-substrate system reaches thermal equilibrium with ambient thereafter.
Despite fast decay of the temperature gradient, the coffee-ring dimensions
significantly diminish, leading to an inner deposit. This suppression of the
coffee-ring effect is attributed to the fact that the initial Marangoni
stress-induced recirculation flow continues until the last stage of the
evaporation, even after the interfacial temperature gradient vanishes. This is
essentially a consequence of liquid inertia. Overall, together with a new
experimental condition, the present investigation discloses a distinct nature
of Marangoni stress-induced flow in the drying droplet and its role in
influencing the associated colloidal deposits, which was not explored
previously.

IoDs can harvest energy from the radio-frequency (RF) signals received from the
PUs. By utilizing the harvested energy, they provide relay cooperation to PUs
and realize their own communications. For harvesting energy, a time-switching

because of a good mix of efficiency, quality of the generated representations

context in which words are used. Differences in word meaning that depends on
time, location, topic, and other factors, can be studied by analyzing
embeddings generated from different corpora in collections that are
representative of these factors. For example, language evolution can be studied
using a collection of news articles published in different time periods. In
this paper, we present a general framework to support cross-corpora language
studies with word embeddings, where embeddings generated from different corpora
can be compared to find correspondences and differences in meaning across the
corpora. CADE is the core component of our framework and solves the key problem
of aligning the embeddings generated from different corpora. In particular, we
focus on providing solid evidence about the effectiveness, generality, and
robustness of CADE. To this end, we conduct quantitative and qualitative
experiments in different domains, from temporal word embeddings to language
localization and topical analysis. The results of our experiments suggest that
CADE achieves state-of-the-art or superior performance on tasks where several
competing approaches are available, yet providing a general method that can be
used in a variety of domains. Finally, our experiments shed light on the
conditions under which the alignment is reliable, which substantially depends
on the degree of cross-corpora vocabulary overlap.

the number of detectors is lowered, which is more than a plausible scenario for
many practical situations, the number of possible solutions that can
characterize the source increases dramatically, leading to severe errors. In
this paper, a Lagrangian stochastic based method for identifying these
suspected points, which will be referred to as 'degenerate space', is
formulated and analysed. Then, a new procedure for quantitative prediction of
the effect of deploying a new detector in space is used to design an adaptive
scheme for source term estimation. This scheme has been tested for several
scenarios, differing by the location of the initial detectors, and is shown to
reduce dramatically the degeneracy formed by insufficient information. The
combined formulation of degenerate space with the new adaptive scheme is shown

issues regarding these models. Specifically, training of these models on small
medical image datasets is still challenging, with many studies promoting
techniques such as transfer learning. Moreover, these models are infamous for
producing over-confident predictions and for failing silently when presented
with out-of-distribution (OOD) data at test time. In this paper, we advocate
for multi-task learning, i.e., training a single model on several different
datasets, spanning several different organs of interest and different imaging
modalities. We show that not only a single CNN learns to automatically
recognize the context and accurately segment the organ of interest in each
context, but also that such a joint model often has more accurate and
better-calibrated predictions than dedicated models trained separately on each
dataset. Our experiments show that multi-task learning can outperform transfer
learning in medical image segmentation tasks. For detecting OOD data, we
propose a method based on spectral analysis of CNN feature maps. We show that
different datasets, representing different imaging modalities and/or different
organs of interest, have distinct spectral signatures, which can be used to
identify whether or not a test image is similar to the images used to train a
model. We show that this approach is far more accurate than OOD detection based
on prediction uncertainty. The methods proposed in this paper contribute
significantly to improving the accuracy and reliability of CNN-based medical
image segmentation models.

anisotropy is not large and the considered effects do not relate to the
existence of singled-out directions in crystals, one may use a more simple
model of an isotropic medium with a good accuracy, after having chosen its
parameters in an optimal way. Based on the quantum mechanical description it is
shown that the method of approximation of the moduli of elasticity of a crystal
by the model of an isotropic medium, proposed earlier in [2], follows from the
requirement of the minimal difference between the free energies of a crystal
and an approximating isotropic medium. The two-parametric Debye model is
formulated, which, in contrast to the standard model where the average speed of
phonons is introduced, takes into account the existence in an isotropic medium
of both longitudinal and transverse phonons. The proposed model contains,
except the Debye energy, an additional dimensionless parameter and,
consequently, the law of corresponding states for the heat capacity being
characteristic of the standard model does not hold. With taking account of the
two phonon branches the structure of the density of phonon states proves to be
more complex as compared to the standard model and has a singularity that
resembles Van Hove singularities in real crystals. As an example, an
application of the two-parametric Debye theory to such crystals of the cubic
system as tungsten, copper, lead is considered. It is shown that the
calculation of the low-temperature heat capacity of these crystals by means of
the approximated moduli of elasticity within the framework of the
two-parametric model leads to a considerably better agreement with experiment
than in the case of the standard Debye model.

our lives and bring significant changes to the world. Several IoT applications
have been envisioned to facilitate data driven and smart application for the
user. Smart City and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) offer a futuristic
vision of smart, secure and safe experience to the end user, and at the same
time efficiently manage the sparse resources and optimize the efficiency of
city operations. However, outbreaks and pandemics like COVID-19 have revealed
limitations of the existing deployments, therefore, architecture, applications
and technology systems need to be developed for swift and timely enforcement of
guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks. This
work outlines novel architecture, potential use-cases and some future
directions in developing such applications using Smart City and ITS.

periodic arrangements of elastic frictionless beads were studied numerically
using the discrete element method. Under pure hydrostatic compression, the SC
arrangement tends to transform into a defective hexagonal close-packed or
amorphous structure. The BCC assembly exhibits several modes of collapse, one
of which, identified as cI16 structure, is consistent with the behavior of BCC
metals Li and Na under high pressure. The presence of a deviatoric stress leads
to the transformation of the BCC structure into face-centered cubic (FCC) one
via the Bain path. The observed effects provide important insights on the
origins of mechanical behavior of atomic systems, while the elastic spheres
model used in our work can become a useful paradigm, expanding the capabilities
of a hard sphere model widely used in many branches of science.

Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) is measured by imaging the self-emission x-rays coming
from the multi-keV plasma. Equivalent diagnostic response can be generated by
integrated radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (rad-MHD) simulations from programs
such as HYDRA and GORGON. There have been only limited quantitative ways to
compare the image morphology, that is the texture, of simulations and
experiments. We have developed a metric of image morphology based on the Mallat
Scattering Transformation (MST), a transformation that has proved to be
effective at distinguishing textures, sounds, and written characters. This
metric is designed, demonstrated, and refined by classifying ensembles (i.e.,
classes) of synthetic stagnation images, and by regressing an ensemble of
synthetic stagnation images to the morphology (i.e., model) parameters used to
generate the synthetic images. We use this metric to quantitatively compare
simulations to experimental images, experimental images to each other, and to
estimate the morphological parameters of the experimental images with
uncertainty. This coordinate space has proved very adept at doing a
sophisticated relative background subtraction in the MST space. This was needed
to compare the experimental self emission images to the rad-MHD simulation
images.

innovative working mechanism that allows multifold-translational-motion control
of semiconductor micro/nanomotors by AC dielectrophoresis with simple
visible-light stimulation. We study the dielectrophoresis forces on
semiconducting particles of various geometries in aqueous suspension by
modeling with the consideration of both the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation and
electrical-double-layer-charging effect. With the obtained understanding, we
rationally design a manipulation system that can versatilely transport
semiconductor micro/nanomotors and orient them towards desired directions at
the same time by tuning the light intensity in an electric field. This research
may guide the development of a new type of micro/nanomachine platform with high
versatility and control. It is relevant to nanorobotics and nanodevice
assembly.

capacity renders developing efficient file-delivery methods imperative. One
such method is femto-caching, which, despite its great potential, imposes
several challenges such as efficient resource management. We study a resource
allocation problem for joint caching and transmission in small cell networks,
where the system operates in two consecutive phases: (i) cache placement, and
(ii) joint file- and transmit power selection followed by broadcasting. We
define the utility of every small base station in terms of the number of
successful reconstructions per unit of transmission power. We then formulate
the problem as to select a file from the cache together with a transmission
power level for every broadcast round so that the accumulated utility over the
horizon is maximized. The former problem boils down to a stochastic knapsack
problem, and we cast the latter as a multi-armed bandit problem. We develop a
solution to each problem and provide theoretical and numerical evaluations. In
contrast to the state-of-the-art research, the proposed approach is especially
suitable for networks with time-variant statistical properties. Moreover, it is
applicable and operates well even when no initial information about the
statistical characteristics of the random parameters such as file popularity
and channel quality is available.

the different types of acquisition involve different regions of the brain. In
language comprehension, native language comprehension and bilingual's
comprehension has been considered. Comprehension involve different brain
