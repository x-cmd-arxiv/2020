particularly vulnerable class of road users,the cyclists. Knowing the cyclists'
orientation is of great relevance since it provides a good notion about their
future trajectory, which is crucial to avoid accidents in the context of
intelligent transportation systems. Using Transfer Learning with pre-trained
models and TensorFlow, we present a performance comparison between the main
algorithms reported in the literature for object detection,such as SSD, Faster
R-CNN and R-FCN along with MobilenetV2, InceptionV2, ResNet50, ResNet101
feature extractors. Moreover, we propose multi-class detection with eight
different classes according to orientations. To do so, we introduce a new
dataset called ""Detect-Bike"", containing 20,229 cyclist instances over 11,103
images, which has been labeled based on cyclist's orientation. Then, the same
Deep Learning methods used for detection are trained to determine the target's
heading. Our experimental results and vast evaluation showed satisfactory
performance of all of the studied methods for the cyclists and their
orientation detection, especially using Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 proved to be
precise but significantly slower. Meanwhile, SSD using InceptionV2 provided
good trade-off between precision and execution time, and is to be preferred for
real-time embedded applications.

detect non-thermal gas motions around DM Tau of between 0.25 c$_s$ and 0.33

only systems with directly measured non-zero turbulence. Using the same

of upper limits in this small sample, and the modest turbulence levels

Tau that could lead this system to be more turbulent than the others.

considerable attention worldwide from industry and governments, while academic

what (generically) ""best practice"" means, independent of meaningfully
identifying specific individual practices. Confusion is evident from guidelines
that conflate desired outcomes with security practices to achieve those
outcomes. How do best practices, good practices, and standard practices differ?
Or guidelines, recommendations, and requirements? Can something be a best
practice if it is not actionable? We consider categories of best practices, and
how they apply over the lifecycle of IoT devices. For concreteness in our
discussion, we analyze and categorize a set of 1014 IoT security best
practices, recommendations, and guidelines from industrial, government, and

to the Regge-Wheeler equation in the proper limit. We compute the quasi-normal
modes (QNMs) of the decoupled perturbations using the Schutz-Iyer-Will's WKB
method. We discuss the stability of the charged black holes by investigating
the dependence of quasi-normal frequencies on the parameters of the theory,
correcting some errors in the literature. It is found that all the axial
perturbations are stable for the cases where the WKB method applies. There are
cases where the conventional WKB method does not apply, like the
three-turning-points problem, so that a more generalized formalism is necessary
for studying their QNMs and stabilities. We find that, for the degenerate
horizons with the ""point-like"" horizons at the origin, the QNMs are quite
long-lived, close to the quasi-resonance modes, in addition to the ""frozen""
QNMs for the Nariai-type horizons and the usual (short-lived) QNMs for the

where the pressure is identified with the cosmological constant. Our numerical
computation shows that the process of condensation is favored at finite

with its contexts, shapes, and relations (e.g., symmetry) together with proper
operations. We benchmark the MNS dataset using four predominant neural network
models as baselines in this visual reasoning task. Comprehensive experiments
show that current neural-network-based models still struggle to understand
number concepts and relational operations. We show that a simple brute-force
search algorithm could work out some of the problems without context
information. Crucially, taking geometric context into account by an additional
perception module would provide a sharp performance gain with fewer search
steps. Altogether, we call for attention in fusing the classic search-based
algorithms with modern neural networks to discover the essential number
concepts in future research.

in the di-leptonic decay channel, and assuming 300 $fb^{-1}$ integrated
luminosity (IL). In addition to the presence of two opposite sign leptons, a
photon, and missing energy, the distinctive signature of this process is the
presence of two intact protons flying few millimeters from the initial beam
direction in both sides of interaction points which suppress the background
process effectively. To exploit this feature of signal we benefit from forward
detectors (FDs) placed about 200 meters from the interaction point to register
the kinematics of tagged protons. In order to overcome the major sources of
backgrounds, we introduced three categories of selection cuts dealing with
objects that strike the central detector, protons hitting the FDs, and
correlations of central objects and protons, respectively. We also evaluate the
probability of pile-up protons to be tagged in the FDs as a function of the
mean number of pile-up. Then the sensitivity of the LHC to observe this process
and constraints on multi-boson effective couplings are extracted. The obtained
expected limits show very good improvements for dimension-8 quartic couplings

Resonance Imaging (MRI). Although being highly accurate, deep CNN models lack
transparency and interpretability, precluding adequate clinical reasoning and
not complying with most current regulatory demands. One popular choice for
explaining deep image models is occluding regions of the image to isolate their
influence on the prediction. However, existing methods for occluding patches of
brain scans generate images outside the distribution to which the model was
trained for, thus leading to unreliable explanations. In this paper, we propose
an alternative explanation method that is specifically designed for the brain
scan task. Our method, which we refer to as Swap Test, produces heatmaps that
depict the areas of the brain that are most indicative of AD, providing
interpretability for the model's decisions in a format understandable to
clinicians. Experimental results using an axiomatic evaluation show that the
proposed method is more suitable for explaining the diagnosis of AD using MRI
while the opposite trend was observed when using a typical occlusion test.
Therefore, we believe our method may address the inherent black-box nature of
deep neural networks that are capable of diagnosing AD.

for quasielectrons show behaviors that are not compatible with the expected
topological properties or their construction involves ad hoc elements. It was
shown, however, that for lattice fractional quantum Hall systems, it is
possible to find a relatively simple quasielectron wavefunction that has all

the question: what happens to this wavefunction in the continuum limit? Here we
demonstrate that, although one obtains a finite continuum wavefunction when the
quasielectron is on top of a lattice site, such a limit of the lattice
quasielectron does not exist in general. In particular, if the quasielectron is
put anywhere else than on a lattice site, the lattice wavefunction diverges
when the continuum limit is approached. The divergence can be removed by
projecting the state on the lowest Landau level, but we find that the projected
state does also not have the properties expected for anyonic quasielectrons. We
hence conclude that the lattice quasielectron wavefunction does not solve the
difficulty of finding trial states for anyonic quasielectrons in the continuum.

modeling. To reliably abstract an operation process, modelers rely on text
information to study and understand details of operations. Aiming at reducing
modelers' interpretation load and ensuring the reliability of the abstracted
information, this research proposes a systematic methodology to automate the
abstraction of operation processes. The methodology applies rule-based
information extraction to automatically extract operation process-related
information from unstructured text and creates graphical representations of
operation processes using the extracted information. To demonstrate the
applicability and feasibility of the proposed methodology, a text description
of an earthmoving operation is used to create its corresponding graphical

modeling through achieving automated abstraction of operation processes, which
largely reduces modelers' interpretation load and ensures the reliability of

initial steep decay, followed by a nearly constant emission phase (so called
""plateau"") which can extend up to thousands of seconds. While the steep decay
is usually interpreted as the tail of the prompt gamma-ray flash, the
long-lasting plateau is commonly associated to the emission from the external
shock sustained by energy injection from a long lasting central engine. A
recent study proposed an alternative interpretation, ascribing both the steep
decay and the plateau to high-latitude emission (HLE) from a ""structured jet""
whose energy and bulk Lorentz factor depend on the angular distance from the
jet symmetry axis. In this work we expand over this idea and explore more
realistic conditions: (a) the finite duration of the prompt emission, (b) the
angular dependence of the optical depth and (c) the lightcurve dependence on
the observer viewing angle. We find that, when viewed highly off-axis, the
structured jet HLE lightcurve is smoothly decaying with no clear distinction
between the steep and flat phase, as opposed to the on-axis case. For a
realistic choice of physical parameters, the effects of a latitude-dependent
Thomson opacity and finite duration of the emission have a marginal effect on
the overall lightcurve evolution. We discuss the possible HLE of GW170817,
showing that the emission would have faded away long before the first Swift-XRT
observations. Finally, we discuss the prospects for the detection of HLE from
off-axis GRBs by present and future wide-field X-ray telescopes and X-ray

emerged as one of the most important multi-agent systems on the power grid by
enabling agents to sell their excessive local energy to each other or back to
the grid. However, it requests all the agents to disclose their sensitive data
(e.g., each agent's fine-grained local generation and demand load). In this
paper, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first privacy preserving
distributed energy trading framework, Private Energy Market (PEM), in which all
the agents privately compute an optimal price for their trading (ensured by a
Nash Equilibrium), and allocate pairwise energy trading amounts without
disclosing sensitive data (via novel cryptographic protocols). Specifically, we
model the trading problem as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game for all the
agents (i.e., buyers and sellers) to determine the optimal price, and then
derive the pairwise trading amounts. Our PEM framework can privately perform
all the computations among all the agents without a trusted third party. We
prove the privacy, individual rationality, and incentive compatibility for the
PEM framework. Finally, we conduct experiments on real datasets to validate the

covariance matrix which includes statistical and systematic uncertainties. For
a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, we find $\Omega_{\rm

distance moduli. For a $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological model, the addition of SLSNe~I
to a `baseline' measurement consisting of Planck temperature together with type
Ia supernovae, results in a small improvement in the constraints of $w_0$ and
$w_a$ of 4\%. We present simulations of future surveys with 868 and 492 SLSNe I

cosmological constraints in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model with the same precision

regimes range from long-lived NES at low core-area fraction, characterised by a
planetary-like motion of the internal drops, to short-lived ones at high
core-area fraction, in which a pre-chaotic motion results from multi-body
collisions of inner drops, as combined with self-consistent hydrodynamic
interactions. The onset of pre-chaotic behavior is marked by transitions of the
cores from one vortex to another, a process that we interpret as manifestations
of the system to maximize its entropy by filling voids, as they arise

deformation of a sheet of cells. Yet, how precisely cells as individual
mechanical entities can act to morph a tissue reliably and efficiently into
three dimensions during outgrowth is still puzzling especially when cells are
tightly connected as in plant tissue. In plants, the mechanics of cells within
a tissue is particularly well defined as individual cell growth is essentially
the mechanical yielding of cell-wall in response to internal turgor pressure.
Cell wall stiffness is controlled by biological signalling and, hence, cell
growth is observed to respond to mechanical stresses building up within a
tissue. What is the role of the mechanical feedback during morphing of tissue
in three dimensions? Here, we develop a three dimensional vertex model to
investigate tissue mechanics at the onset of organ outgrowth at the tip of a
plant shoot. We find that organ height is primarily governed by the ratio of
growth rates of faster growing cells initiating the organ to slower growing
cells surrounding them. Remarkably, the outgrowth rate is higher when cells
growth responds to the tissue-wide mechanical stresses. Our quantitative
analysis of simulation data shows that tissue mechanical feedback on cell
growth can act via twofold mechanism. First, the feedback guides patterns of
cellular growth. Second, the feedback modifies the stress patterns on the
cells, consequently amplifying and propagating growth anisotropies. This
mechanism may allow plants to grow organs efficiently out of the meristem by
reorganizing the cellular growth rather than inflating growth rates.

planar graph drawings or geometric intersection representations are of growing
interest in topological graph theory and graph drawing. In such an extension
problem, we are given a tuple $(G,H,\mathcal{H})$ consisting of a graph $G$, a
connected subgraph $H$ of $G$ and a drawing $\mathcal{H}$ of $H$, and the task
is to extend $\mathcal{H}$ into a drawing of $G$ while maintaining some desired
property of the drawing, such as planarity.
  In this paper we study the problem of extending partial 1-planar drawings,
which are drawings in the plane that allow each edge to have at most one
crossing. In addition we consider the subclass of IC-planar drawings, which are
1-planar drawings with independent crossings. Recognizing 1-planar graphs as
well as IC-planar graphs is \NP-complete and the \NP-completeness easily
carries over to the extension problem. Therefore, our focus lies on
establishing the tractability of such extension problems in a weaker sense than
polynomial-time tractability. Here, we show that both problems are
fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the number of edges missing
from $H$, i.e., the edge deletion distance between $H$ and $G$. The second part
of the paper then turns to a more powerful parameterization which is based on
measuring the vertex+edge deletion distance between the partial and complete
drawing, i.e., the minimum number of vertices and edges that need to be deleted
to obtain $H$ from $G$.

in the signal processing stage is removing the twin image that is caused by the
phase-conjugate wavefront from the recorded holograms. Twin image removal is
typically formulated as a non-linear inverse problem due to the irreversible
scattering process when generating the hologram. Recently, end-to-end deep
learning-based methods have been utilized to reconstruct the object wavefront

in-line digital hologram. However, massive data pairs are required to train
deep learning models for acceptable reconstruction precision. In contrast to
typical image processing problems, well-curated datasets for in-line digital
holography does not exist. Also, the trained model highly influenced by the
morphological properties of the object and hence can vary for different
applications. Therefore, data collection can be prohibitively cumbersome in
practice as a major hindrance to using deep learning for digital holography. In
this paper, we proposed a novel implementation of autoencoder-based deep
learning architecture for single-shot hologram reconstruction solely based on
the current sample without the need for massive datasets to train the model.
The simulations results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed

correct the one-electron limit of any approximate density functional for the

uncorrected approximate functionals, where those functionals are right by
construction. The right limits can be restored by locally scaling down the
energy density of the PZ SIC in many-electron regions, but then a spurious
correction to the exact functional would be found unless the self-Hartree and
exact self-xc terms of the PZ SIC energy density were expressed in the same
gauge. Only the local density approximation satisfies the same-gauge condition
for the energy density, which explains why the recent local-scaling SIC (LSIC)
is found here to work excellently for atoms and molecules only with this basic
approximation, and not with the more advanced generalized gradient
approximations (GGAs) and meta-GGAs, which lose the Hartree gauge via
simplifying integrations by parts. The transformation of energy density that
achieves the Hartree gauge for the exact xc functional can also be applied to
approximate functionals. Doing so leads to a simple scaled-down
self-interaction (sdSIC) correction that is typically much more accurate than
PZ SIC in tests for many molecular properties (including equilibrium bond
lengths). The present work shows unambiguously that the largest errors of PZ
SIC applied to standard functionals at three levels of approximation can be
removed by restoring their correct slowly-varying-density limits. It also
confirms the relevance of these limits to atoms and molecules.

electronic health records (EHRs) pose many analytic challenges. In particular,
a patient's health status influences when and what data are recorded,
generating sampling bias in the collected data. In this paper, we consider
recurrent event analysis using EHR data. Conventional regression methods for
event risk analysis usually require the values of covariates to be observed
throughout the follow-up period. In EHR databases, time-dependent covariates
are intermittently measured during clinical visits, and the timing of these
visits is informative in the sense that it depends on the disease course.
Simple methods, such as the last-observation-carried-forward approach, can lead
to biased estimation. On the other hand, complex joint models require
additional assumptions on the covariate process and cannot be easily extended
to handle multiple longitudinal predictors. By incorporating sampling weights
derived from estimating the observation time process, we develop a novel
estimation procedure based on inverse-rate-weighting and kernel-smoothing for
the semiparametric proportional rate model of recurrent events. The proposed
methods do not require model specifications for the covariate processes and can
easily handle multiple time-dependent covariates. Our methods are applied to a

double-diffusive convection identified in a recent linear analysis (Silva et

regime transitions remain abrupt. In the semi-convecting and the fingering
regimes characteristic flow velocities are small compared to those in the
thermally- and compositionally-dominated overturning regimes, while zonal flows
remain weak in all regimes apart from the thermally-dominated one.
Compositionally-dominated overturning convection exhibits significantly
narrower azimuthal structures compared to all other regimes while differential
rotation becomes the dominant flow component in the thermally-dominated case as
driving is increased. Dynamo action occurs in all regimes apart from the regime
of fingering convection. While dynamos persist in the semi-convective regime
they are very much impaired by small flow intensities and very weak
differential rotation in this regime which makes poloidal to toroidal field
conversion problematic. The dynamos in the thermally-dominated regime include
oscillating dipolar, quadrupolar and multipolar cases similar to the ones known
from earlier parameter studies. Dynamos in the compositionally-dominated regime
exhibit subdued temporal variation and remain predominantly dipolar due to weak
zonal flow in this regime. These results significantly enhance our
understanding of the primary drivers of planetary core flows and magnetic
fields.

These idealized assumptions, however, makes the existing audio adversarial
attacks mostly impossible to be launched in a timely fashion in practice (e.g.,
playing unnoticeable adversarial perturbations along with user's streaming

these materials. However, their sensitivity to the electron beam illumination
and hence structural instabilities usually prevent us from obtaining the
intrinsic information or even lead to significant artifacts. Here, we
systematacially investigate the structural degradation behaviors under
different experimental factors to reveal the optimized conditions for TEM
characterizations of OIHPs by using low-dose electron diffraction and imaging
techniques. We find that a low temperature does not slow down the beam damage
but instead induces a rapid amorphization for OIHPs. Moreover, a less severe
damage is observed at a higher accelerating voltage. The beam-sensitivity is
found to be facet-dependent that a (100) exposed MAPbI3 surface is more stable
than (001) surface. With these guidance, we successfully acquire the atomic
structure of pristine MAPbI3 and identify the characterization window that is
very narrow. These findings are helpful to guide future electron microscopy
characterization of these beam-sensitive materials, which are also useful for
finding strategies to improve the stability and the performance of the

is a serious threat from the data security perspective. There is a need of
secure and robust encryption algorithm that can be implemented on each and
diverse software and hardware platforms. Also, in block symmetric encryption
algorithms, substitution boxes are the most vital part. In this paper, we
investigate semifield substitution boxes using permutation of symmetric group
on a set of size 8 S_8 and establish an effective procedure for generating S_8
semifield substitution boxes having same algebraic properties. Further, the
strength analysis of the generated substitution boxes is carried out using the
well-known standards namely bijectivity, nonlinearity, strict avalanche
criterion, bit independence criterion, XOR table and differential invariant.
Based on the analysis results, it is shown that the cryptographic strength of
generated substitution boxes is on par with the best known $8\times 8$
substitution boxes. As application, an encryption algorithm is proposed that
can be employed to strengthen any kind of secure communication. The presented
algorithm is mainly based on the Shannon idea of (S-P) network where the
process of substitution is performed by the proposed S_8 semifield substitution
boxes and permutation operation is performed by the binary cyclic shift of
substitution box transformed data. In addition, the proposed encryption
algorithm utilizes two different chaotic maps. In order to ensure the
appropriate utilization of these chaotic maps, we carry out in-depth analyses
of their behavior in the context of secure communication and apply the
pseudo-random sequences of chaotic maps in the proposed image encryption
algorithm accordingly. The statistical and simulation results imply that our
encryption scheme is secure against different attacks and can resist linear and
differential cryptanalysis.

the problem of scheduling in an input queued switch. While throughput
maximizing algorithms in a switch are well-understood, delay analysis was
developed only recently. It was recently shown that the well-known MaxWeight
algorithm achieves optimal scaling of mean queue lengths in steady state in the
heavy-traffic regime, and is within a factor less than $2$ of a universal lower
bound. However, MaxWeight is not used in practice because of its high time
complexity. In this paper, we study several low complexity algorithms and show
that their heavy-traffic performance is identical to that of MaxWeight. We
first present a negative result that picking a random schedule does not have
optimal heavy-traffic scaling of queue lengths even under uniform traffic. We
then show that if one picks the best among two matchings or modifies a random
matching even a little, using the so-called flip operation, it leads to
MaxWeight like heavy-traffic performance under uniform traffic. We then focus
on the case of non-uniform traffic and show that a large class of low time
complexity algorithms have the same heavy-traffic performance as MaxWeight, as
long as it is ensured that a MaxWeight matching is picked often enough. We also
briefly discuss the performance of these algorithms in the large scale
heavy-traffic regime when the size of the switch increases simultaneously with
the load. Finally, we perform empirical study on a new algorithm to compare its
performance with some existing algorithms.

abstracted in the form of a continuous-time sampled-data system under the
control of a neural network controller. First, a novel reachable set
computation method in adaptation to simulations generated out of neural
networks is developed. The reachability analysis of a class of feedforward
neural networks called multilayer perceptrons (MLP) with general activation
functions is performed in the framework of interval arithmetic. Then, in
combination with reachability methods developed for various dynamical system
classes modeled by ordinary differential equations, a recursive algorithm is
developed for over-approximating the reachable set of the closed-loop system.
The safety verification for neural network control systems can be performed by
examining the emptiness of the intersection between the over-approximation of
reachable sets and unsafe sets. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has
been validated with evaluations on a robotic arm model and an adaptive cruise

widely-accepted technique that explains the prediction of any classifier
faithfully by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted
instance. As an extension of LIME, this paper proposes an high-interpretability
and high-fidelity local explanation method, known as Local Explanation using
feature Dependency Sampling and Nonlinear Approximation (LEDSNA). Given an
instance being explained, LEDSNA enhances interpretability by feature sampling
with intrinsic dependency. Besides, LEDSNA improves the local explanation
fidelity by approximating nonlinear boundary of local decision. We evaluate our
method with classification tasks in both image domain and text domain.
Experiments show that LEDSNA's explanation of the back-box model achieves much
better performance than original LIME in terms of interpretability and

magnetization per site, could encode information about the underlying QPT. The
decay rates of time-dependent and single-site observables exhibit a dynamical
crossover that separates two dynamical regions, ordered and disordered, both of

  Generation","Accepted for main conference in EMBC 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gastric endoscopy is a standard clinical process that enables medical
practitioners to diagnose various lesions inside a patient's stomach. If any
lesion is found, it is very important to perceive the location of the lesion
relative to the global view of the stomach. Our previous research showed that
this could be addressed by reconstructing the whole stomach shape from
chromoendoscopic images using a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, in which
indigo carmine (IC) blue dye sprayed images were used to increase feature
matches for SfM by enhancing stomach surface's textures. However, spraying the
IC dye to the whole stomach requires additional time, labor, and cost, which is
not desirable for patients and practitioners. In this paper, we propose an
alternative way to achieve whole stomach 3D reconstruction without the need of
the IC dye by generating virtual IC-sprayed (VIC) images based on
image-to-image style translation trained on unpaired real no-IC and IC-sprayed
images. We have specifically investigated the effect of input and output color
channel selection for generating the VIC images and found that translating
no-IC green-channel images to IC-sprayed red-channel images gives the best SfM
reconstruction result.

macroscopic fraction of exactly degenerate zero energy states. In contrast to
other bipartite quasicrystals, such as the kite-and-dart one, these zero energy
states cannot be attributed to a global mismatch $\Delta n$ between the number
of sites in the two sublattices that form the quasicrystal. Here, we argue that
these zero energy states are instead related to a local mismatch $\Delta n(\bf
r)$. Although $\Delta n(\bf r)$ averages to zero, its staggered average over
self-organized domains gives the correct number of zero energy states.
Physically, the local mismatch is related to a hidden structure of nested
self-similar domains that support the zero energy states. This allows us to
develop a real space renormalization-group scheme, which yields the scaling law
for the fraction of zero energy states, $Z$, versus size of their support
domain, $N$, as $Z\propto N^{-\eta}$ with $\eta =1-\ln 2/\ln(1+\tau) \approx
0.2798$ (where $\tau$ is the golden ratio). It also reproduces the known total
fraction of the zero energy states, $81-50\tau\approx 0.0983$. We also show
that the exact degeneracy of these states is protected against a wide variety
of local perturbations, such as irregular or random hopping amplitudes,
magnetic field, random dilution of the lattice, etc. We attribute this
robustness to the hidden domain structure and speculate about its underlying
topological origin.

formalized as the task of semantic matching. Existing work in this area has
been largely focused on matching between short texts (e.g., question
answering), or between a short and a long text (e.g., ad-hoc retrieval).
Semantic matching between long-form documents, which has many important
applications like news recommendation, related article recommendation and
document clustering, is relatively less explored and needs more research
effort. In recent years, self-attention based models like Transformers and BERT
have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of text matching. These
models, however, are still limited to short text like a few sentences or one
paragraph due to the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention with
respect to input text length. In this paper, we address the issue by proposing
the Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical (SMITH) Encoder for
long-form document matching. Our model contains several innovations to adapt
self-attention models for longer text input. In order to better capture
sentence level semantic relations within a document, we pre-train the model
with a novel masked sentence block language modeling task in addition to the
masked word language modeling task used by BERT. Our experimental results on
several benchmark datasets for long-form document matching show that our

to increase maximum input text length from 512 to 2048. We will open source a

accelerate future research on long-form document matching.

corresponding dual model. The framework is composed of dual pseudo-labeling and
dual learning method, which enables an NLU model to make full use of data
(labeled and unlabeled) through a closed-loop of the primal and dual tasks. By
incorporating the dual task, the framework can exploit pure semantic forms as
well as unlabeled sentences, and further improve the NLU and SSG models
iteratively in the closed-loop. The proposed approaches are evaluated on two
public datasets (ATIS and SNIPS). Experiments in the semi-supervised setting

not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down
and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not

also predicted by this fraction-order model. Furthermore, the existence and
uniqueness of a bounded solution under the initial condition are considered in

analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium

quasars. They have been observed to also emanate from systems containing
compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates.
The corresponding Lorentz factors, $\Gamma$, were found to correlate with the
compactness of the central objects. In the case of quasars and AGNs, plasmas
with $\Gamma$-factors larger than $8$ were detected. However, numerically
consistent modelling of propagating shock-fronts with $\Gamma \geq 4$ is a
difficult issue, as the non-linearities underlying the transport operators
increase dramatically with $\Gamma$, thereby giving rise to a numerical
stagnation of the time-advancement procedure or alternatively they may diverge
completely. In this paper, we present a unified numerical solver for modelling
the propagation of one-dimensional shock fronts with high Lorentz factors. The
numerical scheme is based on the finite-volume formulation with adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) and domain decomposition for parallel computation. It unifies
both time-explicit and time-implicit numerical schemes within the framework of
the pre-conditioned defect-correction iteration solution procedure. We find
that time-implicit solution procedures are remarkably superior over their
time-explicit counterparts in the very high $\Gamma$-regime and therefore most
suitable for consistent modelling of relativistic outflows in AGNs and
micro-quasars.

However, since CNNs are usually over-parameterized, a pre-trained network

relatively small $l_{1}$ norm and contribute little to the output
(\textbf{Reason}). While filter pruning removes these invalid filters for
efficiency consideration, we tend to reactivate them to improve the
representation capability of CNNs. In this paper, we introduce filter grafting
(\textbf{Method}) to achieve this goal. The activation is processed by grafting
external information (weights) into invalid filters. To better perform the
grafting, we develop a novel criterion to measure the information of filters
and an adaptive weighting strategy to balance the grafted information among
networks. After the grafting operation, the network has fewer invalid filters
compared with its initial state, enpowering the model with more representation
capacity. Meanwhile, since grafting is operated reciprocally on all networks
involved, we find that grafting may lose the information of valid filters when
improving invalid filters. To gain a universal improvement on both valid and

organized the ""2018 Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge"" using 154 3D LGE-MRIs,

the left atrium segmented by three medical experts, ultimately attracting the
participation of 27 international teams. In this paper, extensive analysis of

offering an overall picture of the major design choices of convolutional neural

operating in highly unstructured or completely unknown environments. Under
these conditions, not only robotic systems must deal with limited localisation
information, but also their manoeuvrability is constrained by their dynamics
and often suffer from uncertainty. In order to cope with these constraints,
this manuscript proposes an uncertainty-based framework for mapping and
planning feasible motions online with probabilistic safety-guarantees. The
proposed approach deals with the motion, probabilistic safety, and online
computation constraints by: (i) incrementally mapping the surroundings to build
an uncertainty-aware representation of the environment, and (ii) iteratively
(re)planning trajectories to goal that are kinodynamically feasible and
probabilistically safe through a multi-layered sampling-based planner in the
belief space. In-depth empirical analyses illustrate some important properties
of this approach, namely, (a) the multi-layered planning strategy enables rapid
exploration of the high-dimensional belief space while preserving asymptotic
optimality and completeness guarantees, and (b) the proposed routine for
probabilistic collision checking results in tighter probability bounds in
comparison to other uncertainty-aware planners in the literature. Furthermore,
real-world in-water experimental evaluation on a non-holonomic torpedo-shaped
autonomous underwater vehicle and simulated trials in the Stairwell scenario of

in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several African countries, especially South Africa, have
already taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical
distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced
human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of
such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing
interests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities
and testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and
socio-economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to
intervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the
COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the
national lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial
exponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times
of about $2.5$ days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with
doubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth
reported for Hubei/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a
computational data-driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay
Municipality (with $1.14$ million inhabitants) hints that keeping current
levels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of
insufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently
complied with to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring,
slightly stronger, more specific interventions combined with sufficient
compliance may constitute a viable option for interventions for regions in
South Africa and potentially for large parts of the African continent.

thought that certain probabilistic properties of the monitored observations

procedures based on differences of empirical distribution functions that are
designed to be particularly sensitive to changes in the comtemporary
distribution of multivariate time series. The proposed detectors are
adaptations of statistics used in a posteriori (offline) change-point testing
and involve a weighting allowing to give more importance to recent
observations. The resulting sequential change-point detection procedures are
carried out by comparing the detectors to threshold functions estimated through
resampling such that the probability of false alarm remains approximately
constant over the monitoring period. A generic result on the asymptotic
validity of such a way of estimating a threshold function is stated. As a
corollary, the asymptotic validity of the studied sequential tests based on
empirical distribution functions is proven when these are carried out using a

resulting procedures. The application of the derived sequential tests is

grow unhindered to a large number density. Non-linear interactions between the

non-linearities may also destroy a cosmic abundance of these light particles,

In this paper, we derive SH$^+$--H fine and hyperfine-resolved rate
coefficients from the recent quantum calculations for the SH$^+$--H collisions,
including inelastic, exchange and reactive processes. The method used is based
on the infinite order sudden approach. State-to-state rate coefficients between
the first 31 fine levels and 61 hyperfine levels of SH$^+$ were obtained for
temperatures ranging from 10 to 1000 K. Fine structure-resolved rate
coefficients present a strong propensity rule in favour of $\Delta j = \Delta

hyperfine transitions. {The new rate coefficients will help significantly in
the interpretation of SH$^+$ spectra from PDRs and UV-irradiated shocks where

for automatic topic extraction from text, since they avoid the complicated
mathematical derivations for model inference as in traditional topic models
such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these models either
typically assume improper prior (e.g. Gaussian or Logistic Normal) over latent
topic space or could not infer topic distribution for a given document. To
address these limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach, called
Bidirectional Adversarial Topic (BAT) model, which represents the first attempt
of applying bidirectional adversarial training for neural topic modeling. The
proposed BAT builds a two-way projection between the document-topic
distribution and the document-word distribution. It uses a generator to capture
the semantic patterns from texts and an encoder for topic inference.
Furthermore, to incorporate word relatedness information, the Bidirectional
Adversarial Topic model with Gaussian (Gaussian-BAT) is extended from BAT. To
verify the effectiveness of BAT and Gaussian-BAT, three benchmark corpora are
used in our experiments. The experimental results show that BAT and
Gaussian-BAT obtain more coherent topics, outperforming several competitive
baselines. Moreover, when performing text clustering based on the extracted
topics, our models outperform all the baselines, with more significant
improvements achieved by Gaussian-BAT where an increase of near 6\% is observed

  with Bernstein Bounds","ACL 2020",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most NLP datasets are not annotated with protected attributes such as gender,
making it difficult to measure classification bias using standard measures of
fairness (e.g., equal opportunity). However, manually annotating a large
dataset with a protected attribute is slow and expensive. Instead of annotating
all the examples, can we annotate a subset of them and use that sample to
estimate the bias? While it is possible to do so, the smaller this annotated
sample is, the less certain we are that the estimate is close to the true bias.
In this work, we propose using Bernstein bounds to represent this uncertainty
about the bias estimate as a confidence interval. We provide empirical evidence
that a 95% confidence interval derived this way consistently bounds the true
bias. In quantifying this uncertainty, our method, which we call
Bernstein-bounded unfairness, helps prevent classifiers from being deemed
biased or unbiased when there is insufficient evidence to make either claim.
Our findings suggest that the datasets currently used to measure specific
biases are too small to conclusively identify bias except in the most egregious
cases. For example, consider a co-reference resolution system that is 5% more
accurate on gender-stereotypical sentences -- to claim it is biased with 95%
confidence, we need a bias-specific dataset that is 3.8 times larger than

to their infiltrative nature and rapid progression. The process of
distinguishing tumor boundaries from healthy cells is still a challenging task
in the clinical routine. Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI
modality can provide the physician with information about tumor infiltration.
Therefore, this paper proposes a new generic deep learning architecture; namely
DeepSeg for fully automated detection and segmentation of the brain lesion
using FLAIR MRI data.
  Methods: The developed DeepSeg is a modular decoupling framework. It consists
of two connected core parts based on an encoding and decoding relationship. The
encoder part is a convolutional neural network (CNN) responsible for spatial
information extraction. The resulting semantic map is inserted into the decoder
part to get the full resolution probability map. Based on modified U-Net
architecture, different CNN models such as Residual Neural Network (ResNet),
Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), and NASNet have been utilized in this
study.
  Results: The proposed deep learning architectures have been successfully
tested and evaluated on-line based on MRI datasets of Brain Tumor Segmentation
(BraTS 2019) challenge, including s336 cases as training data and 125 cases for
validation data. The dice and Hausdorff distance scores of obtained
segmentation results are about 0.81 to 0.84 and 9.8 to 19.7 correspondingly.
  Conclusion: This study showed successful feasibility and comparative
performance of applying different deep learning models in a new DeepSeg
framework for automated brain tumor segmentation in FLAIR MR images. The
proposed DeepSeg is open-source and freely available at

image understanding. In particular, the use of RGB-D sensors in handling these
tasks has emerged as an important area of focus for better visual
understanding. Meanwhile, deep neural networks, specifically convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), have become widespread and have been applied to many
visual tasks by replacing hand-crafted features with effective deep features.
However, it is an open problem how to exploit deep features from a multi-layer
CNN model effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework
that extracts discriminative feature representations from multi-modal RGB-D
images for object and scene recognition tasks. In the first stage, a pretrained
CNN model has been employed as a backbone to extract visual features at
multiple levels. The second stage maps these features into high level
representations with a fully randomized structure of recursive neural networks
(RNNs) efficiently. To cope with the high dimensionality of CNN activations, a
random weighted pooling scheme has been proposed by extending the idea of
randomness in RNNs. Multi-modal fusion has been performed through a soft voting
approach by computing weights based on individual recognition confidences (i.e.
SVM scores) of RGB and depth streams separately. This produces consistent class
label estimation in final RGB-D classification performance. Extensive
experiments verify that fully randomized structure in RNN stage encodes CNN
activations to discriminative solid features successfully. Comparative
experimental results on the popular Washington RGB-D Object and SUN RGB-D Scene
datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior or on-par
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods both in object and scene
recognition tasks. Code is available at

in ultra-dense networks with massive connections which is crucial for Internet

successive interference canceler (SIC) should be implemented for interference
mitigation and mostly in the literature, perfect SIC is assumed for NOMA
involved systems. Unfortunately, this is not the case for practical scenarios
and this imperfect SIC effect limits the performance of NOMA involved systems.
In addition, it causes unfairness between users. In this paper, we introduce
reversed decode-forward relaying NOMA (R-DFNOMA) to improve user fairness
compared to conventional DFNOMA (C-DFNOMA) which is widely analyzed in
literature. In the analysis, we define imperfect SIC effect dependant to
channel fading and with this imperfect SIC, we derive exact expressions for
ergodic capacity (EC) and outage probability (OP). Moreover, we evaluate bit
error performance of proposed R-DFNOMA and derive bit error probability (BEP)
in closed-form which has not been also studied well in literature. Then, we
define user fairness index in terms of all key performance indicators (KPIs)

are validated, and it is proved that proposed R-DFNOMA provides better user
fairness than C-DFNOMA in terms of all KPIs. Finally, we discuss the effect of
power allocations at the both source and relay on the performance metrics and

of Coulomb correlation effects at low twist angles ($\theta$) is a result of
nearly flat low-energy electronic bands and divergent density of states (DOS)

insulating states, and quantum anomalous Hall effect close to the critical (or
magic) angle $\theta = \theta_{c} \approx 1.1^\circ$, but also unconventional
metallic states that are claimed to exhibit non-Fermi liquid (NFL) excitations.
However, unlike superconductivity and the correlation-induced gap in the DOS,
unambiguous signatures of NFL effects in the metallic state remain
experimentally elusive. Here we report simultaneous measurement of electrical
resistivity ($\rho$) and thermoelectric power ($S$) in tBLG at $\theta \approx

and nuclear physics experiments. Since the semiconductor detector has superior
spatial and kinematic resolutions as well as good response time than other
types of detectors, it has become one of the most important detectors recently.
When charged particles pass through the semiconductor detector, electron-hole
pairs are formed inside the detector and move toward the electrode by the
electric field inside the detector. At this time, the trajectory and momentum
can be determined through the generated current signal.
  In this study, we introduce an open-source application named Fast Silicon
Device Simulation that is developed for fast simulation of a typical silicon
semiconductor detector, such as a p-type pad on an n-type wafer with a
reverse-bias voltage. Iterative and multi-grid methods are used to calculate
the potential and electric field in the simulation fast. Current signals
produced by the simulation are compared with results by Silvaco TCAD and
Garfield++ simulations. The simulation program is based on the ROOT that has

whether a given formula in a first-order theory is expressible as a Boolean
combination of monadic predicates in the theory. Recently, Veanes et al. showed
the usefulness of monadic decomposability in the context of SMT (i.e. the input
formula is quantifier-free), and found various interesting applications
including string analysis. However, checking monadic decomposability is
undecidable in general. Decidability for certain theories is known (e.g.
Presburger Arithmetic, Tarski's Real-Closed Field), but there are very few
results regarding their computational complexity. In this paper, we study
monadic decomposability of integer linear arithmetic in the setting of SMT. We
show that this decision problem is coNP-complete and, when monadically
decomposable, a formula admits a decomposition of exponential size in the worst
case. We provide a new application of our results to string constraint solving
with length constraints. We then extend our results to variadic
decomposability, where predicates could admit multiple free variables (in
contrast to monadic decomposability). Finally, we give an application to
quantifier elimination in integer linear arithmetic where the variables in a
block of quantifiers, if independent, could be eliminated with an exponential
(instead of the standard doubly exponential) blow-up.

0.3 $\times$10$^{-11}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ sec$^{-1}$ in 0.4-20 keV. Strong X-ray
pulsations with a period of 103.144$\pm$0.001 seconds are detected in 0.3-7 keV

single pulse to a double pulse at higher energy. At energies above 20 keV, we

Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the propagation of droplets

of droplets in space and time under varying external conditions of temperature,
humidity and wind flow by using laws of statistical and fluid mechanics. The
effects of drag, diffusion and the gravity on droplets of different sizes and
ejection velocities have been considered during their motion in the air. In
still air we found that bigger droplets traverse larger distance but the
smaller droplets remain suspended in the air for longer time. So, in still air
the horizontal distance that a healthy individual should maintain from an
infected one is determined by the bigger droplets but the time interval to be
maintained is determined by the smaller droplets. We show that in places with
wind flow the lighter droplets travel larger distance and remain suspended in
the air for longer time. Therefore, we conclude that both temporal and the
geometric distance that a healthy individual should maintain from an infected
one is determined by the smaller droplets under flowing air which makes the use
of mask mandatory to prevent the virus. The maintenance of only stationary
separation between healthy and infected individuals is not substantiated. The
quantitative results obtained here will be useful to devise strategies for
preventing the spread of other types of droplets also containing
microorganisms.

L-mode of tokamak operation, (ii) a suppressed transport regime, characterized
by a higher value of the energy confinement time, low-amplitude relative
fluctuations driven by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, a strong E x B sheared

(iii) a degraded confinement regime, characterized by a catastrophically large
interchange-driven turbulent transport, which reminds the crossing of the

stationary interface between a regular medium and the moving medium, assuming
motion perpendicular to the interface, and shows that the related waves are
symmetric in terms of the energy refraction angle, while being asymmetric in
terms of the phase refraction angle, with one of the waves subject to negative
refraction, and shows that the wave impedances of the two transmitted waves are
equal. Third, it generalizes the problem to the case where the medium moves
obliquely with respect to the interface. Finally, it highlights the connection

Nevertheless, they commonly exhibit considerable sensitivity to some input

we examine a novel meta-projections-based approach which allows us to evaluate
the model's current trends and assess whether generated projections are at a
transient or stable state. Meta-projections can be extracted from graphs of
successive estimations of model's parameters and resulting projections, over a
sequence of days being gradually added to the employed model. In other words,
projections are carried out on truncated time series of cumulative numbers of
confirmed cases with increased lengths at each successive evaluation. This
allows us to trace the values of model parameters over a certain period of time
and examine their trends which may converge to specific values for
settled-growth cases or exhibit a changing or even an erratic behavior for
cases that undergo epidemiological transitions and/or are inappropriately
described by the current model instance(s). We have computed meta-projections

are developing formal models of real systems in areas where complex models
occur, such as networks, cyber-physical systems, hardware/software codesign,

  (1) Large case studies are essential to show that specification formalisms
and modelling techniques are applicable to real systems, whereas many research
papers only consider toy examples or tiny case studies.
  (2) Developing an accurate model of a real system takes a large amount of
time, often months or years. In most scientific papers, however, salient
details of the model need to be skipped due to lack of space, and to leave room
for formal verification methodologies and results.

Numerical simulations show that the evolving dynamics of the network is

model allows a simple derivation of the simpler model, which is a single scalar
delay differential equation (DDE), wherein the variation in $\beta$ appears
through an integral closely related to the moment generating function of

be expanded in a series that shows a direct correspondence with the original
compartmental DDE with a single $\beta$. Even otherwise, the new scalar DDE can
be solved using either numerical integration over $u$ at each time step, or
with the analytical integral if available in some useful form. Our work
provides a new academic example of complete dimensional collapse, ties up an

generalized motivic cohomology theory represented by the tensor unit object
admits Thom classes. We also show that the stable $\mathbb{A}^1$-derived
category does not admit Thom isomorphisms for oriented vector bundles and, more
generally, for symplectic bundles. In order to do so we compute the first
homology sheaves of the motivic sphere spectrum and show that the class in the
coefficient ring of $\mathbb{A}^1$-homology corresponding to the second motivic
Hopf map $\nu$ is nonzero which provides an obstruction to the existence of a
reasonable theory of Thom classes in $\mathbb{A}^1$-cohomology.

show that disentanglement in the first layer of the generator network leads to
disentanglement in the generated image. Through a grid-based structure, we
achieve several aspects of disentanglement without complicating the network

scale-space disentanglement, and disentanglement of the foreground object from
the background style allowing fine-grained control over the generated images.

batteries. To avoid severe safety issues (e.g., thermal runaway), initial
faults should be timely detected and resolved. In this paper, we consider
parallel-connected battery cells with only one voltage and one current sensor.
The lack of independent current sensors makes it difficult to detect individual
cell degradation. To this end, based on the high-frequency response of the
battery, a simplified fault detection-oriented model is derived and validated
by a physics-informed battery model. The resistance of the battery string,
which is significantly influenced by the faulty cell, is estimated and used as
the health indicator. The statistical resistance distribution of battery
strings is first analyzed considering the distribution of fresh and aged cells.
A fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed and the thresholds (i.e., 2 standard
deviation interval) are obtained through statistical analysis. Monte Carlo
simulation results show that the proposed fault diagnosis algorithm can balance
false alarms and missed detections well. In addition, it is verified that the
proposed algorithm is robust to the uniform parameter changes of individual
battery cells.

located on the upper and lower sides of a cylinder immersed in a
two-dimensional flow domain. The learning environment supports four flow
configurations with Reynolds numbers 100, 200, 300 and 400, respectively. A new
smoothing interpolation function is proposed to help the PPO algorithm to learn
to set continuous actions, which is of great importance to effectively suppress
problematic jumps in lift and allow a better convergence for the training
process. It is shown that the DRL controller is able to significantly reduce
the lift and drag fluctuations and to actively reduce the drag by approximately
5.7%, 21.6%, 32.7%, and 38.7%, at $Re$=100, 200, 300, and 400 respectively.
More importantly, it can also effectively reduce drag for any previously unseen

of the second core are investigated using 1D studies spanning a wide range of
initial cloud core masses from 0.5 to 100 $M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expand
to 2D collapse simulations for a few cases of 1, 5, 10, and 20 $M_{\odot}$. We
follow the evolution of the second core for $\geq$ 100 years after its
formation, for each of these non-rotating cases. Our results indicate a
dependence of several second core properties on the initial cloud core mass.
For the first time, due to an unprecedented resolution, our 2D non-rotating

the second core, which is formed due to the gravitational collapse of a 1
$M_{\odot}$ cloud core. Additionally, we find large-scale oscillations of the
second accretion shock front triggered by the standing accretion shock
instability, which has not been seen before in early evolutionary stages of

is very time-consuming to access, integrate, explore, and exploit. We developed
CoVex, the first interactive online platform for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 host

experimentally validated virus-human protein interactions, 2) human
protein-protein interactions and 3) drug-target interactions. The web interface
allows user-friendly visual exploration of the virus-host interactome and
implements systems medicine algorithms for network-based prediction of drugs.
Thus, CoVex is an important resource, not only to understand the molecular
mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 pathogenicity, but also in
clinical research for the identification and prioritization of candidate
therapeutics. We apply CoVex to investigate recent hypotheses on a systems

focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose
models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it
can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared,
especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason
for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different
regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical
area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social
coherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the
epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an
important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model
for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To the

of new cases that may result from loss of immunity--and the exchange of people

strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of
the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated
using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the
parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State
and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we
identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the
initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing
posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of
different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and
demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest
that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that
underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.

from Euclidean parallel space $\mathbb{E}$ to embedded fractal space

more than $\mathcal{O}(n^\mathbb{H})$ threads with $\mathbb{H}$ being the
Hausdorff dimension of the fractal, making it parallel space efficient. When
compared to a bounding-box (BB) approach, $\lambda(\omega)$ offers a
sub-exponential improvement in parallel space and a monotonically increasing
speedup $n \ge n_0$. The Sierpinski gasket fractal is used as a particular case
study and the experimental performance results show that $\lambda(\omega)$
reaches up to $9\times$ of speedup over the bounding-box approach. A
tensor-core based implementation of $\lambda(\omega)$ is also proposed for
modern GPUs, providing up to $\sim40\%$ of extra performance. The results

implementation in practical systems. One of the key challenges is the
difficulty to implement distributed AI across a massive number of heterogeneous
devices. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed AI solution that
enables data-driven AI solutions in heterogeneous and potentially massive-scale
networks. Although it still in an early stage of development, FL-inspired
architecture has been recognized as one of the most promising solutions to
fulfill ubiquitous AI in 6G. In this article, we identify the requirements that
will drive convergence between 6G and AI. We propose an FL-based network
architecture and discuss its potential for addressing some of the novel
challenges expected in 6G. Future trends and key research problems for
FL-enabled 6G are also discussed.

taking into account vertical acceleration. A variable friction coefficient
based on the $\mu(I)$ rheology is considered. The model is obtained from an
asymptotic analysis in a local reference system, where the non-hydrostatic
contribution is supposed to be small compared to the hydrostatic one. The
non-hydrostatic counterpart of the pressure may be written as the sum of two
terms: one corresponding to the stress tensor and the other to the vertical
acceleration. The model introduced here is weakly non-hydrostatic, in the sense
that the non-hydrostatic contribution related to the stress tensor is not taken
into account due to its complex implementation. A simple and efficient
numerical scheme is proposed. It consists of a three-step splitting procedure,
and it is based on a hydrostatic reconstruction. Two key points are: (i) the
friction force has to be taken into account before solving the non-hydrostatic
pressure. Otherwise, the incompressibility condition is not ensured; (ii) both
the hydrostatic and the non-hydrostatic pressure are taken into account when
dealing with the friction force. The model and numerical scheme are then
validated based on several numerical tests, including laboratory experiments of
granular collapse. The influence of non-hydrostatic terms and of the choice of
the coordinate system (Cartesian or local) is analyzed. We show that
non-hydrostatic models are less sensitive to the choice of the coordinate
system. In general, the non-hydrostatic model introduced here much better
reproduces granular collapse experiments compared to hydrostatic models. An
important result is that the simulated mass profiles up to the deposit and the
front velocity are greatly improved. As expected, the influence of the
non-hydrostatic pressure is shown to be larger for small values of the slope.

data and tasks. For those models that consider space, most of them primarily
rely on some notions of distance. These models suffer from higher computational
complexity during training while still losing information beyond the relative
distance between entities. In this work, we propose a location-aware KG
embedding model called SE-KGE. It directly encodes spatial information such as
point coordinates or bounding boxes of geographic entities into the KG
embedding space. The resulting model is capable of handling different types of
spatial reasoning. We also construct a geographic knowledge graph as well as a
set of geographic query-answer pairs called DBGeo to evaluate the performance
of SE-KGE in comparison to multiple baselines. Evaluation results show that
SE-KGE outperforms these baselines on the DBGeo dataset for geographic logic
query answering task. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our
spatially-explicit model and the importance of considering the scale of
different geographic entities. Finally, we introduce a novel downstream task
called spatial semantic lifting which links an arbitrary location in the study
area to entities in the KG via some relations. Evaluation on DBGeo shows that

However, it cannot capture the Poisson effect correctly. This shortcoming was
addressed via state-based PD, but the kinematics are not accurately preserved.
Continuum-kinematics-inspired peridynamics (CPD) provides a geometrically exact
framework whose underlying kinematics coincide with that of CCM and captures
the Poisson effect correctly. In CPD, one distinguishes between one-, two- and
three-neighbour interactions. One-neighbour interactions are equivalent to the
bond-based interactions of the original PD formalism. However, two- and
three-neighbour interactions are fundamentally different from state-based

to them an antigen receptor allowing tumor cells to be recognized and targeted.
These new cells are called CAR-T cells and are re-infused back into the patient
after expansion in-vitro. This approach has been successfully used to treat
B-cell malignancies (B-cell leukemias and lymphomas). However, its application
to the treatment of T-cell leukemias faces several problems. One of these is
fratricide, since the CAR-T cells target both tumor and other CAR-T cells. This
leads to nonlinear dynamical phenomena amenable to mathematical modeling. In
this paper we construct a mathematical model describing the competition of
CAR-T, tumor and normal T-cells and studied some basic properties of the model
and its practical implications. Specifically, we found that the model
reproduced the observed difficulties for in-vitro expansion of the therapeutic
cells found in the laboratory. The mathematical model predicted that CAR-T cell
expansion in the patient would be possible due to the initial presence of a
large number of targets. We also show that, in the context of our mathematical

monitoring (PHM) is considered a fundamental block for public health services.
However, traditional public health data collection approaches, such as
clinic-visit-based data integration or health surveys, could be very costly and
time-consuming. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cost-effective
approach called Compressive Population Health (CPH), where a subset of a given
area is selected in terms of regions within the area for data collection in the
traditional way, while leveraging inherent spatial correlations of neighboring
regions to perform data inference for the rest of the area. By alternating
selected regions longitudinally, this approach can validate and correct
previously assessed spatial correlations. To verify whether the idea of CPH is
feasible, we conduct an in-depth study based on spatiotemporal morbidity rates
of chronic diseases in more than 500 regions around London for over ten years.
We introduce our CPH approach and present three extensive analytical studies.
The first confirms that significant spatiotemporal correlations do exist. In
the second study, by deploying multiple state-of-the-art data recovery
algorithms, we verify that these spatiotemporal correlations can be leveraged
to do data inference accurately using only a small number of samples. Finally,
we compare different methods for region selection for traditional data
collection and show how such methods can further reduce the overall cost while
maintaining high PHM quality.

number of IoT connected devices is expected to reach billions in the coming few
years. However, IoT has different application frameworks. Furthermore, IoT
applications require higher security standards. In this work, an IoT
application framework is presented with a security embedded structure using the
integration between message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) and user managed
access (UMA). The performance analysis of the model is presented. Comparing the
model with existing models and different design structures shows that the model
presented in this work is promising for a functioning IoT design model with
security. The security in the model is a built-in feature in its structure. The
model is built on recommended frameworks; therefore, it is ready for
integration with other web standards for data sharing, which will help in
making IoT application integrated from different developing parties.

  Intelligent Vehicles","13 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, the driver emotion facial
expression (DEFE) dataset, for driver spontaneous emotions analysis. The
dataset includes facial expression recordings from 60 participants during
driving. After watching a selected video-audio clip to elicit a specific
emotion, each participant completed the driving tasks in the same driving
scenario and rated their emotional responses during the driving processes from
the aspects of dimensional emotion and discrete emotion. We also conducted
classification experiments to recognize the scales of arousal, valence,
dominance, as well as the emotion category and intensity to establish baseline
results for the proposed dataset. Besides, this paper compared and discussed
the differences in facial expressions between driving and non-driving
scenarios. The results show that there were significant differences in AUs
(Action Units) presence of facial expressions between driving and non-driving
scenarios, indicating that human emotional expressions in driving scenarios
were different from other life scenarios. Therefore, publishing a human emotion
dataset specifically for the driver is necessary for traffic safety
improvement. The proposed dataset will be publicly available so that
researchers worldwide can use it to develop and examine their driver emotion
analysis methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the only
public driver facial expression dataset.
