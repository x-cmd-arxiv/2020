multiple categories from point clouds. Due to the nature of point clouds, i.e.
unstructured, sparse and noisy, some features benefit-ting multi-class
discrimination are underexploited, such as shape information. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3D shape signature to explore the shape information from point
clouds. By incorporating operations of symmetry, convex hull and chebyshev
fitting, the proposed shape sig-nature is not only compact and effective but
also robust to the noise, which serves as a soft constraint to improve the
feature capability of multi-class discrimination. Based on the proposed shape
signature, we develop the shape signature networks (SSN) for 3D object
detection, which consist of pyramid feature encoding part, shape-aware grouping
heads and explicit shape encoding objective. Experiments show that the proposed
method performs remarkably better than existing methods on two large-scale
datasets. Furthermore, our shape signature can act as a plug-and-play component
and ablation study shows its effectiveness and good scalability

loops that were attributed to signatures of explosive events (EEs). We have
chosen one such uni-directional flowing cool loop system observed by IRIS where
one of the footpoints is associated with significantly broadened Si IV line
profiles. The line profile broadening indirectly indicates the occurrence of
numerous EEs below the transition region (TR), while it directly infers a large
velocity enhancement /perturbation further causing the plasma flows in the
observed loop system. The observed features are implemented in a model
atmosphere in which a low-lying bi-polar magnetic field system is perturbed in
the chromosphere by a velocity pulse with a maximum amplitude of 200 km/s. The
data-driven 2-D numerical simulation shows that the plasma motions evolve in a
similar manner as observed by IRIS in the form of flowing plasma filling the
skeleton of a cool loop system. We compare the spatio-temporal evolution of the
cool loop system in the framework of our model with the observations, and
conclude that their formation is mostly associated with the velocity response
of the transient energy release above their footpoints in the chromosphere/TR.
Our observations and modeling results suggest that the velocity responses most
likely associated to the EEs could be one of the main candidates for the
dynamics and energetics of the flowing cool loop systems in the lower solar
atmosphere.

epidemic, this paper treats a population of $N$ individuals as an inhomogeneous
random social network (IRSN). The nodes of the network represent different
types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships.
An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on
day $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social
behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability
distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is
given for the basic SI (""susceptible-infective"") network contagion model, which
focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main
result is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of
the system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves
only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network
models, including ""removed"" (R) and ""exposed"" (E) classes, are formulated.
These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for
the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of
different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social
distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an
algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a
number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as
the framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent
based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic
modelling.

agents that operate in the presence of other learning agents. Central to
achieving this is how the agents coordinate. One way to coordinate is by
learning to communicate with each other. Can the agents develop a language
while learning to perform a common task? In this paper, we formulate and study
a MARL problem where cooperative agents are connected to each other via a fixed
underlying network. These agents can communicate along the edges of this
network by exchanging discrete symbols. However, the semantics of these symbols
are not predefined and, during training, the agents are required to develop a
language that helps them in accomplishing their goals. We propose a method for
training these agents using emergent communication. We demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed framework by applying it to the problem of
managing traffic controllers, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance as
compared to a number of strong baselines. More importantly, we perform a
detailed analysis of the emergent communication to show, for instance, that the
developed language is grounded and demonstrate its relationship with the

work that performs an in depth analysis of emergent communication in a

possible to represent them within their compressed space while at the same time
offering indexed search functionalities. As this new technology permeated
through applications like bioinformatics, the string collections experienced a
growth that outperforms Moore's Law and challenges our ability of handling them
even in compressed form. It turns out, fortunately, that many of these rapidly
growing string collections are highly repetitive, so that their information
content is orders of magnitude lower than their plain size. The statistical
compression methods used for classical collections, however, are blind to this
repetitiveness, and therefore a new set of techniques has been developed in
order to properly exploit it. The resulting indexes form a new generation of
data structures able to handle the huge repetitive string collections that we
are facing.
  In this survey we cover the algorithmic developments that have led to these
data structures. We describe the distinct compression paradigms that have been
used to exploit repetitiveness, the fundamental algorithmic ideas that form the
base of all the existing indexes, and the various structures that have been
proposed, comparing them both in theoretical and practical aspects. We conclude
with the current challenges in this fascinating field.

security in urban spaces, which has augmented the relevance given to visual
surveillance solutions able to detect, track and identify persons of interest
in crowds. In particular, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a potential tool
for this kind of analysis, as they provide a cheap way for data collection,
cover large and difficult-to-reach areas, while reducing human staff demands.
In this context, all the available datasets are exclusively suitable for the
pedestrian re-identification problem, in which the multi-camera views per ID
are taken on a single day, and allows the use of clothing appearance features
for identification purposes. Accordingly, the main contributions of this paper
are two-fold: 1) we announce the UAV-based P-DESTRE dataset, which is the first
of its kind to provide consistent ID annotations across multiple days, making
it suitable for the extremely challenging problem of person search, i.e., where
no clothing information can be reliably used. Apart this feature, the P-DESTRE
annotations enable the research on UAV-based pedestrian detection, tracking,
re-identification and soft biometric solutions; and 2) we compare the results
attained by state-of-the-art pedestrian detection, tracking, reidentification
and search techniques in well-known surveillance datasets, to the effectiveness
obtained by the same techniques in the P-DESTRE data. Such comparison enables
to identify the most problematic data degradation factors of UAV-based data for
each task, and can be used as baselines for subsequent advances in this kind of
technology. The dataset and the full details of the empirical evaluation

resulting in incomplete and unstructured scene interpretation. In this paper,
we investigate the problem of scene de-occlusion, which aims to recover the
underlying occlusion ordering and complete the invisible parts of occluded
objects. We make the first attempt to address the problem through a novel and
unified framework that recovers hidden scene structures without ordering and
amodal annotations as supervisions. This is achieved via Partial Completion
Network (PCNet)-mask (M) and -content (C), that learn to recover fractions of
object masks and contents, respectively, in a self-supervised manner. Based on
PCNet-M and PCNet-C, we devise a novel inference scheme to accomplish scene
de-occlusion, via progressive ordering recovery, amodal completion and content
completion. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes demonstrate the superior
performance of our approach to other alternatives. Remarkably, our approach
that is trained in a self-supervised manner achieves comparable results to
fully-supervised methods. The proposed scene de-occlusion framework benefits
many applications, including high-quality and controllable image manipulation

we are able to obtain approximate solutions of the fluctuations and finite-size

deviations from the deterministic solution are well captured by a Gaussian
distribution whose properties we derive, including its correlation matrix and
corrections to the average values. On the other hand, close to a critical point

in reducing its spread. It is therefore important to understand public
reactions and information dissemination in all major forms, including on social
media. This article investigates important issues reflected on Twitter in the
early stages of the public reaction to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: A
thematic analysis of the most retweeted English-language tweets mentioning
COVID-19 during March 10-29, 2020. Findings: The main themes identified for the
87 qualifying tweets accounting for 14 million retweets were: lockdown life;
attitude towards social restrictions; politics; safety messages; people with
COVID-19; support for key workers; work; and COVID-19 facts/news. Research
limitations/implications: Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through
unofficial tweets. Users shared social distancing information, helped build
support for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed
support for key workers, and helped each other cope with social isolation. A
few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government
messages sometimes failed. Practical implications: Public health campaigns in
future may consider encouraging grass roots social web activity to support
campaign goals. At a methodological level, analysing retweet counts emphasised
politics and ignored practical implementation issues. Originality/value: This
is the first qualitative analysis of general COVID-19-related retweeting.

  invited review from 2019 assembly of the Asia-Oceania Geosciences Society",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The weather layers of the gas giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, comprise the
shallow atmospheric layers that are influenced energetically by a combination
of incoming solar radiation and localised latent heating of condensates, as
well as by upwelling heat from their planetary interiors. They are also the
most accessible regions of those planets to direct observations. Recent
analyses in Oxford of cloud-tracked winds on Jupiter have demonstrated that
kinetic energy is injected into the weather layer at scales comparable to the
Rossby radius of deformation and cascades both upscale, mostly into the
extra-tropical zonal jets, and downscale to the smallest resolvable scales in
Cassini images. The large-scale flow on both Jupiter and Saturn appears to
equilibrate towards a state which is close to marginal instability according to
Arnol'd's 2nd stability theorem. This scenario is largely reproduced in a
hierarchy of numerical models of giant planet weather layers, including
relatively realistic models which seek to predict thermal and dynamical
structures using a full set of parameterisations of radiative transfer,
interior heat sources and even moist convection. Such models include the Jason
GCM, developed in Oxford, which also represents the formation of (energetically
passive) clouds of NH3, NH4SH and H2O condensates and the transport of
condensable tracers. Recent results show some promise in comparison with
observations from the Cassini and Juno missions, but some observed features
(such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot and other compact ovals) are not yet captured
spontaneously by any weather layer model. We review recent work in this vein

controller in a nonlinear fashion, often incorporating feedback mechanisms.
Interdependence of systems poses additional difficulties, as cross-system
connections enable malicious activity to spread between layers, increasing
systemic risk. In this paper we explore the conditions for an optimal control
of cascading failures in a system of interdependent networks. Specifically, we
study the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model incorporating a control mechanism,
which affects the frequency of cascades occurring in individual layers. This
modification allows us to explore sandpile-like dynamics near the critical
state, with supercritical region corresponding to infrequent large cascades and
subcritical zone being characterized by frequent small avalanches. Topological
coupling between networks introduces dependence of control settings adopted in
respective layers, causing the control strategy of a given layer to be
influenced by choices made in other connected networks. We find that the
optimal control strategy for a layer operating in a supercritical regime is to
be coupled to a layer operating in a subcritical zone, since such condition
corresponds to reduced probability of inflicted avalanches. However this
condition describes a parasitic relation, in which only one layer benefits.
Second optimal configuration is a mutualistic one, where both layers adopt the
same control strategy. This work demonstrates that control protocols in systems
of interdependent networks need to take into account higher-order organization
of the system and cannot be designed independently, maximizing benefits only
for their individual layers.

of seeking medical care/being tested for individuals in those age groups
compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, suggesting an actual increase in
the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the
German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among
individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age

and dwarf stars, depends strongly on microscopic physics modeling of warm dense
matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma. This complex state of matter consists of a
transient mixture of degenerate and nearly-free electrons, molecules, and ions.
This regime challenges both experiment and analytical modeling, necessitating
predictive \emph{ab initio} atomistic computation, typically based on quantum
mechanical Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT). However, cubic
computational scaling with temperature and system size prohibits the use of DFT
through much of the WDM regime. A recently-developed stochastic approach to
KS-DFT can be used at high temperatures, with the exact same accuracy as the
deterministic approach, but the stochastic error can converge slowly and it
remains expensive for intermediate temperatures (<50 eV). We have developed a
universal mixed stochastic-deterministic algorithm for DFT at any temperature.
This approach leverages the physics of KS-DFT to seamlessly integrate the best
aspects of these different approaches. We demonstrate that this method
significantly accelerated self-consistent field calculations for temperatures
from 3 to 50 eV, while producing stable molecular dynamics and accurate
diffusion coefficients.

innovations into our $\beta$-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($\beta$-NMR)

linewidth, resonances, while a simultaneous in-situ $^1$H NMR measurement
allows us to calibrate and stabilize the magnetic field to ppm precision, thus
eliminating the need for additional $\beta$-NMR reference measurements.
Furthermore, we use ab initio calculations of NMR shielding constants to
improve the accuracy of the reference magnetic moment, thus removing a large
systematic error. We demonstrate the potential of this combined approach with
the 1.1 s half-life radioactive nucleus $^{26}$Na, which is relevant for
biochemical studies. Our technique can be readily extended to other isotopic

periodically classifying accelerometer samples collected by vehicles as they
drive in real time. Our key finding is that even adjacent patches of road
surfaces contain characteristics that are sufficiently unique to differentiate
between lanes, i.e., roads inherently exhibit differing bumps, cracks,
potholes, and surface unevenness. Cars can capture this road surface
information as they drive using inexpensive, easy-to-install accelerometers
that increasingly come fitted in cars and can be accessed via the CAN-bus. We
collect an aggregate of 60 km driving data and synthesize more based on this
that capture factors such as variable driving speed, vehicle suspensions, and
accelerometer noise. Our formulated LSTM-based deep learning model, LaNet,
learns lane-specific sequences of road surface events (bumps, cracks etc.) and
yields 100% lane classification accuracy with 200 meters of driving data,
achieving over 90% with just 100 m (correspondingly to roughly one minute of
driving). We design the LaNet model to be practical for use in real-time lane
classification and show with extensive experiments that LaNet yields high
classification accuracy even on smooth roads, on large multi-lane roads, and on
drives with frequent lane changes. Since different road surfaces have different
inherent characteristics or entropy, we excavate our neural network model and
discover a mechanism to easily characterize the achievable classification
accuracies in a road over various driving distances by training the model just
once. We present LaNet as a low-cost, easily deployable and highly accurate way
to achieve fine-grained lane identification.

optimizing a non-convex objective, where a controlled and properly scaled
Gaussian noise is added to the stochastic gradients to steer the iterates

which is reversible in time. By adding an anti-symmetric matrix to the drift
term of the overdamped Langevin diffusion, one gets a non-reversible diffusion

our highest-dosing cases, a monolayer-like electronic structure emerges,

the topmost valence band below $E_F$, we can directly measure a band overlap of
$\sim$ 0.2 eV. However, 3D bulk-like states still contribute to the spectra
even after considerable dosing. Our work provides a reference point for the

each system tends to experience an increase in its n-Renyi entropies, such as

properties of a system determine how quickly its Renyi entropies increase and,
therefore, how sensitive the system is to becoming entangled. We find that the
rate at which the n-Renyi entropy increases in an interaction is determined by
a quantity which we term the n-fragility of the system. The 2-fragility is
closely related to the notion of 2-norm coherence, in that it too quantifies
the extent to which a density matrix is off-diagonal with respect to the
eigenbasis of a reference operator. Nevertheless, the 2-fragility is not a
coherence monotone in the resource theoretic sense since it depends also on the
eigenvalues of the reference operator. It is this additional sensitivity to the
eigenvalues of the reference operator, here the interaction Hamiltonian, which
enables the 2-fragility to quantify the rate of entropy production in
interactions. We give an example using the light-matter interaction and we
anticipate applications to the study of the rates at which two systems exchange

  enhanced with neural networks","20 pages, 13 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum annealing is a practical approach to approximately implement the
adiabatic quantum computational model under a real-world setting. The goal of
an adiabatic algorithm is to prepare the ground state of a problem-encoded
Hamiltonian at the end of an annealing path. This is typically achieved by
driving the dynamical evolution of a quantum system slowly to enforce
adiabaticity. Properly optimized annealing schedules often significantly
accelerate the computational process. Inspired by the recent success of deep
reinforcement learning such as DeepMind's AlphaZero, we propose a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and its enhanced version boosted with neural
networks, which we name QuantumZero (QZero), to automate the design of
annealing schedules in a hybrid quantum-classical framework. Both the MCTS and
QZero algorithms perform remarkably well in discovering effective annealing
schedules even when the annealing time is short for the 3-SAT examples we
consider in this study. Furthermore, the flexibility of neural networks allows
us to apply transfer-learning techniques to boost QZero's performance. We
demonstrate in benchmark studies, that MCTS and QZero perform more efficiently
than other reinforcement learning algorithms in designing annealing schedules.

  statement of Thm 6.1; this does not affect our main results",,,,"math.OC cs.DS cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit Matrix Balancing, a pre-conditioning task used ubiquitously for
computing eigenvalues and matrix exponentials. Since 1960, Osborne's algorithm
has been the practitioners' algorithm of choice and is now implemented in most
numerical software packages. However, its theoretical properties are not well
understood. Here, we show that a simple random variant of Osborne's algorithm
converges in near-linear time in the input sparsity. Specifically, it balances
$K\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n\times n}$ after $O(m\epsilon^{-2}\log\kappa)$
arithmetic operations, where $m$ is the number of nonzeros in $K$, $\epsilon$
is the $\ell_1$ accuracy, and $\kappa=\sum_{ij}K_{ij}/(\min_{ij:K_{ij}\neq
0}K_{ij})$ measures the conditioning of $K$. Previous work had established
near-linear runtimes either only for $\ell_2$ accuracy (a weaker criterion
which is less relevant for applications), or through an entirely different
algorithm based on (currently) impractical Laplacian solvers.
  We further show that if the graph with adjacency matrix $K$ is moderately
connected--e.g., if $K$ has at least one positive row/column pair--then
Osborne's algorithm initially converges exponentially fast, yielding an
improved runtime $O(m\epsilon^{-1}\log\kappa)$. We also address numerical
precision by showing that these runtime bounds still hold when using
$O(\log(n\kappa/\epsilon))$-bit numbers.
  Our results are established through an intuitive potential argument that
leverages a convex optimization perspective of Osborne's algorithm, and relates
the per-iteration progress to the current imbalance as measured in Hellinger
distance. Unlike previous analyses, we critically exploit log-convexity of the
potential. Our analysis extends to other variants of Osborne's algorithm: along
the way, we establish significantly improved runtime bounds for cyclic, greedy,
and parallelized variants.

exotic objects. The simplest possible naked singularity spacetime emerges from
the Einstein massless scalar field theory with the advantage that it smoothly
translates to the Schwarzschild solution by the variation of the scalar charge.
This background, known as the Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime is the subject of
interest in this work. %A further advantage of working with this spacetime is
that it smoothly translates to the Schwarzschild solution by the variation of

Similarly, we derive the expression for the luminosity from the accretion disk

designing durable concurrent data structures that are efficient and also

biological networks, computer and information networks, to name a few.
Community detection is a basic step for exploring and analysing these network
data. Typically, homogenous network is a type of networks which consists of
only one type of objects with one type of links connecting them. There has been
a large body of developments in models and algorithms to detect communities
over it. However, real-world networks naturally exhibit heterogeneous qualities
appearing as multiple types of objects with multi-relational links connecting
them. Those heterogeneous information could facilitate the community detection
for its constituent homogeneous networks, but has not been fully explored. In
this paper, we exploit heterogeneous multi-relational networks (HMRNet) and
propose an efficient message passing based algorithm to simultaneously detect
communities for all homogeneous networks. Specifically, an HMRNet is
reorganized into a hierarchical structure with homogeneous networks as its
layers and heterogeneous links connecting them. To detect communities in such
an HMRNet, the problem is formulated as a maximum a posterior (MAP) over a
factor graph. Finally a message passing based algorithm is derived to find a
best solution of the MAP problem. Evaluation on both synthetic and real-world
networks confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.

the behavior of entanglement of purification near critical point is different

Glavan and Lin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 081301 (2020)] by rescaling the coupling
$\alpha \rightarrow \alpha/(D-4)$ and taking the limit $D\rightarrow 4$ at the
level of equations of motion. This prescription, though was shown to bring
non-trivial effects for some spacetimes with particular symmetries, remains
mysterious and calls for scrutiny. Indeed, there is no continuous way to take
the limit $D\rightarrow 4$ in the higher $D$-dimensional equations of motion
because the tensor indices depend on the spacetime dimension and behave
discretely. On the other hand, if one works with four-dimensional spacetime
indices the contribution corresponding to the Gauss-Bonnet term vanishes
identically in the equations of motion. A necessary condition (but may not be
sufficient) for this procedure to work is that there is an embedding of the
four-dimensional spacetime into the higher $D$-dimensional spacetime so that
the equations in the latter can be properly interpreted after taking the limit.
In this note, working with 2D Einstein gravity, we show several subtleties when
applying the method used in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 081301 (2020)].

contribution of gradients of convolutional weights. Second, we combine saliency
maps at different layers to test the ability of saliency methods to extract
complementary information at different network levels (e.g.~trading off spatial
resolution and distinctiveness) and we explain why some methods fail at
specific layers (e.g., Grad-CAM anywhere besides the last convolutional layer).

paper, from a return-on-investment point of view, we present a deep analysis of

from its semantic-awareness rather than the spatial-adaptiveness. Inspired by
this point, we propose class-adaptive normalization (CLADE), a lightweight
variant that is not adaptive to spatial positions or layouts. Benefited from
this design, CLADE greatly reduces the computation cost while still being able
to preserve the semantic information during the generation. Extensive

analyze the crossover from Newtonian to non-Newtonian behavior with increasing
shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$. Above a critical shear rate $\dot{\gamma}_c$ where a
non-Newtonian response sets in, the transient dynamics are associated with the
occurrence of short-lived vertical shear bands, i.e. bands of high mobility
that form perpendicular to the flow direction. In the glass states, long-lived
horizontal shear bands, i.e. bands of high mobility parallel to the flow
direction, are observed in addition to vertical ones. The systems with shear
bands are characterized in terms of mobility maps, stress-strain relations,
mean-squared displacements, and (local) potential energies. The initial
formation of a horizontal shear band provides an efficient stress release,
corresponds to a local minimum of the potential energy, and is followed by a
slow broadening of the band towards the homogeneously flowing fluid in the
steady-state. Whether a horizontal or a vertical shear band forms cannot be
predicted from the initial undeformed sample. Furthermore, we show that with

These developments include calculi that allow assigning priorities to threads,
type systems that can rule out priority inversions, and accompanying cost
models for predicting responsiveness. These advances share one important
limitation: all of this work assumes purely functional programming. This is a
significant restriction, because many realistic interactive applications, from
games to robots to web servers, use mutable state, e.g., for communication
between threads.
  In this paper, we lift the restriction concerning the use of state. We
present $\lambda_i^4$, a calculus with implicit parallelism in the form of
prioritized futures and mutable state in the form of references. Because both
futures and references are first-class values, $\lambda_i^4$ programs can
exhibit complex dependencies, including interaction between threads and with
the external world (users, network, etc). To reason about the responsiveness of
$\lambda_i^4$ programs, we extend traditional graph-based cost models for
parallelism to account for dependencies created via mutable state, and we
present a type system to outlaw priority inversions that can lead to unbounded

significant differences were found only for a few variables, most notably
overall reaction times. Results reported here provide the basis for

flooding depend strongly on the evolution of the wind field and precipitation
distribution after landfall. However, research has yet to test the detailed
response of a mature TC and its hazards to changes in surface forcing in
idealized settings. This work tests the transient response of an idealized
hurricane to instantaneous transitions in two key surface properties associated
with landfall: surface roughening and drying. Simplified axisymmetric
experiments are performed in CM1 where surface drag coefficient and evaporative
fraction are each systematically modified beneath a mature hurricane. Surface
drying stabilizes the eyewall and consequently weakens the overturning
circulation, thereby reducing inward angular momentum transport that slowly
decays the wind field only within the inner-core. In contrast, surface
roughening initially ($\sim$12 hours) rapidly weakens the entire low-level wind
field and enhances the overturning circulation dynamically despite the
concurrent thermodynamic stabilization of the eyewall; thereafter the storm
gradually decays similar to drying. As a result, total precipitation
temporarily increases with roughening but uniformly decreases with drying.
Storm size decreases monotonically and rapidly with surface roughening, while
the radius of maximum wind can increase with moderate surface drying. Overall,
this work provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding the inland
evolution of real storms in nature.

K20-ID5 and COS4-11337 are compact star forming galaxies with powerful

H$\alpha$ emission. The outflows do not appear to have any impact on the
instantaneous star formation activity of the host galaxies, but they carry a
significant amount of kinetic energy which could heat the halo gas and
potentially lead to a reduction in the rate of cold gas accretion onto the
galaxies. The outflow from COS4-11337 is propagating directly towards its
companion galaxy COS4-11363, at a projected separation of 5.4 kpc. COS4-11363
shows signs of shock excitation and recent truncation of star formation
activity, which could plausibly have been induced by the outflow from

begun to explore these effects, but almost all studies have been restricted to
simplified models with constant CR diffusivity and/or streaming speeds.
Physical models of CR propagation/scattering via extrinsic turbulence and

functions of local plasma properties. In a companion paper, we consider a wide

cosmic-ray propagation scalings which satisfy both detailed Milky Way (MW) and
extra-galactic $\gamma$-ray constraints. Here, we compare the effects of these
models relative to simpler 'diffusion+streaming' models on galaxy and CGM

local variations in CR diffusivity, with median diffusivity increasing with
galacto-centric radii and decreasing with galaxy mass and redshift. These
effects lead to a more rapid dropoff of CR energy density in the CGM (compared
to simpler models), in turn producing weaker effects of CRs on galaxy star
formation rates (SFRs), CGM absorption profiles and galactic outflows. The
predictions of the more physical CR models tend to lie 'in between' models

ratio $C_v \equiv {\Delta v_h}^2/(GM/L)$, where $\Delta v_h$ is half of the
observed perpendicular velocity difference across a filament, and $M/L$ is the
filament's mass per unit length, can distinguish between filaments formed
purely due to turbulent compression and those formed due to gravity-induced
accretion. We conclude that the perpendicular velocity gradient observed in the
Serpens South northwest filament can be caused by gravity-induced anisotropic
accretion of material from a flattened layer. Using synthetic observations of
our simulated filaments, we also propose that a density-selection effect may
explain observed subfilaments (one filament breaking into two components in
velocity space) as reported in Dhabal et al. (2018).

addressing the gauge hierarchy problem. Its main actor, the relaxion, is a
light spin-zero field which dynamically relaxes the Higgs mass with respect to
its natural large value. We show that the relaxion is generically stabilized at
a special position in the field space, which leads to suppression of its mass
and potentially unnatural values for the model's effective low-energy
couplings. In particular, we find that the relaxion mixing with the Higgs can
be several orders of magnitude above its naive naturalness bound. Low energy
observers may thus find the relaxion theory being fine-tuned although the
relaxion scenario itself is constructed in a technically natural way. More
generally, we identify the lower and upper bounds on the mixing angle. We
examine the experimental implications of the above observations at the
luminosity and precision frontiers. A particular attention is given to the
impressive ability of future nuclear clocks to search for rapidly oscillating
scalar ultra-light dark matter, where the future projected sensitivity is

helium-core white dwarf companion. In this work we present the analysis of an
optical spectroscopic campaign, where the companion star absorption features
reveal one of the lightest known white dwarfs. We determine a white dwarf
radial velocity semi-amplitude of K_2 = 218.9 +- 2.2 km/s, which combined with
that of the pulsar derived from the precise radio timing, yields a mass ratio
of q=10.44+- 0.11. We also attempt to infer the white dwarf mass from
observational constraints using new binary evolution models for extremely
low-mass white dwarfs, but find that they cannot reproduce all observed
parameters simultaneously. In particular, we cannot reconcile the radius
predicted from binary evolution with the measurement from the photometric
analysis (R_WD=0.047+-0.003 Rsun). Our limited understanding of extremely
low-mass white dwarf evolution, which results from binary interaction,
therefore comes as the main factor limiting the precision with which we can
measure the mass of the white dwarf in this system. Our conservative white
dwarf mass estimate of M_WD = 0.165 +- 0.015 Msun, along with the mass ratio
enables us to infer a pulsar mass of M_NS = 1.72 +- 0.16 Msun. This value is
clearly above the canonical 1.4 Msun, therefore adding PSR J1012+5307 to the
growing list of massive millisecond pulsars.

level in the saturated regime for all masses. In the $L_{\rm x}/L_{\rm

results on the empirical $L_{\rm x} - P_{\rm rot}$ relation to provide an
estimate for the age decay of X-ray luminosity. We compare predictions of this
relationship with the actual X-ray luminosities of M stars with known ages from
100 Myr to a few billion years. We find remarkably good agreement between the
predicted $L_{\rm x}$ and the observed values for partially convective stars.
However, for fully convective stars at ages of a few billion years, the
constructed $L_{\rm x}-$age relation overpredicts the X-ray luminosity because
the angular momentum evolution model underpredicts the rotation period of these
stars. Finally, we examine the effect of different parameterizations for the
Rossby number ($R_{\rm O}$) on the shape of the activity-rotation relation in
$L_{\rm x}/L_{\rm bol}-R_{\rm O}$ space, and we find that the slope in the

combination of certain components of the graviton and the four-form potential.
The angular integrals on the five-sphere lead to selection rules for the
interactions with important consequences on the dynamics. This implies the
existence of new terms contributing to the structure functions that we

We present results from two searches targeting emission coincident with the sky
localization of each gravitational wave event within a 1000 second time window

unbinned maximum likelihood analysis, which uses neutrino data from IceCube to
search for point-like neutrino sources consistent with the sky localization of
GW events. The other uses the Low-Latency Algorithm for Multi-messenger
Astrophysics, which incorporates astrophysical priors through a Bayesian
framework and includes LIGO-Virgo detector characteristics to determine the
association between the GW source and the neutrinos. No significant neutrino
coincidence is seen by either search during the first two observing runs of the
LIGO-Virgo detectors. We set upper limits on the time-integrated neutrino
emission within the 1000 second window for each of the 11 GW events. These
limits range from 0.02-0.7 $\mathrm{GeV~cm^{-2}}$. We also set limits on the
total isotropic equivalent energy, $E_{\mathrm{iso}}$, emitted in high-energy

We also discover an intriguing trade-off between measurement time and
thermometric precision that is controlled by the impurity-gas coupling, with
weak coupling leading to the greatest sensitivities. This is explained as a
consequence of the slow decoherence associated with the onset of the Anderson
orthogonality catastrophe, which dominates the gas dynamics following its local

doping concentration exceeds $5*10^{17}$ $cm^{-3}$, the carbon atoms
increasingly form triatomic clusters. The tri-carbon defect structure is
unambiguously proven by the isotope effect on the defects' local vibrational

composition $(~99 $%$ ^{12}C, ~1$%$ ^{13}C)$ at $1679$ $cm^{-1}$ and $1718$

enriched with the $^{13}C$ isotope (~99 % and ~50 %) are consistently
interpreted on the basis of the harmonic oscillator model taking into account
the probability of possible isotope combinations. Including the polarization
dependence of the LVM absorption, we show that the tri-carbon defects form a
triatomic molecule-like structure in two crystallographically different
configurations: a basal configuration with the carbon bonds near the basal
plane and an axial configuration with one of the carbon bonds along the c-axis.
Finally, the disappearance of the LVMs under additional below-bandgap
illumination is interpreted as defect recharging, i.e. the tri-carbon defects
possess at least one charge state transition level within the bandgap and
contribute to optical absorption as well as to the electrical charge balance.

known example of an emergent mesoscopic lattice, the vortex lattice in a
superfluid. We show that a tight binding approach can successfully describe
collective modes. We begin with a single isolated vortex in a two dimensional
system. With suitable pinning mechanims, the low energy excitations take the
form of localized pairing fluctuations. They can be viewed as wave-like
disturbances that propagate around the vortex centre, in the azimuthal
direction. In particular, the lowest energy excitations are gyrotropic and
breathing modes. The former corresponds to circular motion of the eye of the
vortex, while the latter represents an oscillation between sharper and broader
vortex profiles. These modes are `bosonic' analogues of atomic orbitals with
the vortex profile playing the role of the nuclear potential. Moving to a
sparse vortex lattice with well separated vortices, the single-vortex
excitations provide a convenient basis for finding normal modes. We derive an
analogue of Bloch's theorem in this context, revealing a non-trivial phase
contribution arising from the orbital field. We set up a tight binding
prescription and use it to explicitly determine the band structure of
excitations about a square vortex lattice. Our results can be tested in
ultracold atomic gases with synthetic magnetic fields.

approximate Bayesian modeling to infer the dust properties that produce the
observed decrease of the IR excess with age, in the range between 4.5 and

numerical method to viscously evolve each gas disc together with the radial
drift of dust particles that have grown to 100 $\mu$m in size. For a 2 Myr old
cluster of stars, we find a slightly sub-linear scaling between the gas disc
mass and the gas accretion rate ($M_\mathrm{g}\propto\dot{M}^{0.9}$). However,
for the dust mass we find that evolved dust discs have a much weaker scaling
with the gas accretion rate, with the precise scaling depending on the age at
which the cluster is sampled and the intrinsic age spread of the discs in the
cluster. Ultimately, we find that the dust mass present in protoplanetary disc
is on the order of 10-100 Earth masses in 1-3 Myr old star-forming regions, a
factor of 10 to 100 depleted from the original dust budget. As the dust drains
from the outer disc, pebbles pile up in the inner disc and locally increase the
dust-to-gas ratio by a factor of up to 4 above the initial value. In these high
dust-to-gas ratio regions we find conditions that are favourable for
planetesimal formation via the streaming instability and subsequent growth by
pebble accretion. We also find the following scaling relations with stellar
mass within a 1-2 Myr old cluster: a slightly super-linear scaling between the
gas accretion rate and stellar mass ($\dot{M}\propto M_\star^{1.4}$), a
slightly super-linear scaling between the gas disc mass and the stellar mass

beam (PB) model-based dose calculation is fast but inaccurate due to the
approximation when dealing with inhomogeneities. Monte Carlo (MC) dose
calculation is the most accurate method, but it is time consuming. We
hypothesize that deep learning methods can boost the accuracy of PB dose
calculation to the level of MC. In this work, we developed a deep learning
model that converts PB to MC doses for different tumor sites. The proposed
model is based on our newly developed hierarchically densely connected U-Net
(HD U-Net) network, and it uses the PB dose and patient CT image as inputs to
generate the MC dose. We used 290 patients (90 with head and neck, 93 with
liver, 75 with prostate, and 32 with lung cancer) to train, validate, and test
the model. For each tumor site, we performed four numerical experiments to
explore various combinations of training datasets. Training the model on data
from all tumor sites together and using the dose distribution of each
individual beam as input yielded the best performance for all four tumor sites.
The average gamma index (1mm/1% criteria) between the converted dose and the MC
dose was 92.8%, 92.7%, 89.7% and 99.6% for head and neck, liver, lung, and
prostate test patients, respectively. The average time for dose conversion for
a single field was less than 4 seconds. In conclusion, our deep learning-based
approach can quickly boost the accuracy of proton PB dose distributions to that
of MC dose distributions. The trained model can be readily adapted to new
datasets for different tumor sites and from different hospitals through
transfer learning. This model can be added as a plug-in to the clinical
workflow of proton therapy treatment planning to improve the accuracy of proton
dose calculation.

We show that trapped-ion experiments instead allow to reproduce and

reproduce widely-used transport models, such as Marcus theory. It also provides
access to transfer regimes that are unattainable for molecular experiments,
while controlling and measuring the relevant observables on the level of
individual quanta. Our numerical simulations predict an unconventional quantum
transfer regime, featuring a transition from quantum adiabatic- to
resonance-assisted transfer as a function of the donor-acceptor energy gap,
that can be reached by increasing the electronic coupling at low temperatures.
Trapped ion-based quantum simulations thus promise to enhance our microscopic
understanding of molecular electron transfer processes, and may help to reveal

component in the CMB primary anisotropies; this conclusion is, however,
weakened by current large-scale structure (LSS) data. Interpreting the result
as a conservative upper limit on the isocurvature component, the combined bound
on the ALP mass from all probes is $m_{a} \gtrsim 10^{-19}$ eV, with some
dependence on how $m_{a}$ evolves with temperature. The expected sensitivity of
cosmic shear and galaxy clustering from future LSS experiments and CMB lensing
suggests improved bounds of $m_{a} \gtrsim 10^{-18}$-$10^{-13}$ eV, depending
on scale cuts used to avoid non-linearities and the ALP mass-temperature
dependence.

polarization pattern in the CMB is one of the major goals of current and future
CMB experiments. Besides foregrounds, a potential hurdle in this search is the
anisotropic secondary $B$-mode polarization generated by the scattering of CMB
photons off free electrons produced during patchy cosmological reionization.
Robust predictions of these secondary anisotropies are challenging because of
uncertainties in the reionization history. In this paper, we revise estimates
of the reionization-induced $B$-mode signal by incorporating recent advances in
the understanding of reionization through observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest. To derive these $B$-mode estimates, we use high-dynamic-range radiative
transfer simulations of reionization that are calibrated to the Ly$\alpha$
data. These simulations are also consistent with a variety of other
high-redshift observations. We find that around multipoles $\ell\approx 100$,
reionization induces $B$-mode power with $\ell(\ell+1)C_\ell^{BB}/2\pi\approx
4\times 10^{-6}\,\mu$K$^2$. This secondary signal is thus at the level of the
primordial signal with the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r<10^{-4}$, and can increase
by a factor of $\sim 50$ if reionization is sourced by highly clustered sources
residing in haloes with mass of $\sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. Our findings suggest
that the contribution of patchy reionization to the search for primordial
gravitational waves is unlikely to be a concern for currently planned CMB
experiments.

conventional matter dominates today, we find that the ghost component can bring
the future expansion and the past contraction of the model to a finite halt.
Moreover, at the moment the expansion or contraction stops, we find that the
tendency of the universe is to bounce back and re-collapse or re-expand.
Therefore, the presence of a (never dominant) ghost-field with negative density
could, in principle, drive the universe into an eternal cycle of finite
expansion, collapse, and re-expansion. Our study outlines the key features of
such a scenario and provides a simple condition for it to occur. We also derive
an autonomous set of differential equations and then employ dynamical-system
techniques to identify two families of fixed points, with and without spatial
curvature respectively. The members of the first family correspond to coasting
universes and are stable in the Lyapunov sense. Those of the latter family are
unstable repellers when their matter satisfies the strong energy condition and
Lyapunov stable in the opposite case.

$\sim5\times$ stronger than expected in the $\Lambda$CDM model from R>100

emerging curvature is capable of telling a plausible albeit radically different

demonstrate that while stacked imprints of R>100 $Mpc/h$ supervoids in cosmic
microwave background temperature maps can discriminate between the AvERA and
$\Lambda$CDM models, their characteristic differences may remain hidden using
alternative void definitions and stacking methodologies. Testing the extremes,
we then also show that the CMB Cold Spot can plausibly be explained in the
AvERA model as an ISW imprint. The coldest spot in the AvERA map is aligned
with multiple low-$z$ supervoids with R>100 $Mpc/h$ and central underdensity
$\delta_{0}\approx-0.3$, resembling the observed large-scale galaxy density
field in the Cold Spot area. We hence conclude that the anomalous imprint of
supervoids may well be the canary in the coal mine, and existing observational
evidence for dark energy should be re-interpreted to further test alternative

possible. code2vec is a recently released embedding approach that uses the
proxy task of method name prediction to map Java methods to feature vectors.
However, experimentation with code2vec shows that it learns to rely on variable

embed an entire collection of methods such as those present in a typical Java

simple approach to creating class-level embeddings by aggregating sets of

compressed for storage and transmission. Our paper tackles the highly practical
problem of predicting the quality of compressed videos (perhaps during the

from only a few annotated examples. A key challenge for them is how to avoid
overfitting because limited training data is available. While prior works
usually limited the overall model capacity to alleviate overfitting, this
hampers segmentation accuracy. We demonstrate how to increase overall model
capacity to achieve improved performance, by introducing objectness, which is
class-agnostic and so not prone to overfitting, for complementary use with
class-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility of
our simple approach of introducing objectness for different base architectures
that rely on different data loaders and training schedules (DENet, PFENet) as
well as with different backbone models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and HRNetV2-W48).
Given only one annotated example of an unseen category, experiments show that
our method outperforms state-of-art methods with respect to mIoU by at least
4.7% and 1.5% on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i respectively.

appearing in $X$ we associate the empirical measure ascribing to every block
$C\in\Lambda^l$ the frequency of occurrences of $C$ in $B$. By comparing the
values ascribed to blocks $C$ we define a metric on the combined space of
blocks $B$ and probability measures $\mu$ on $X$, whose restriction to the
space of measures is compatible with the weak-$\star$ topology. Next, in this
combined metric space we fix an open set $\mathcal U$ containing all ergodic
measures, and we say that a block $B$ is ""ergodic"" if $B\in\mathcal U$.
  In this paper we prove the following main result: Given $\varepsilon>0$,
every $x\in X$ decomposes as a concatenation of blocks of bounded lengths in
such a way that, after ignoring a set $M$ of coordinates of upper Banach
density smaller than $\varepsilon$, all blocks in the decomposition are
ergodic. The second main result concerns subshifts whose set of ergodic
measures is closed. We show that, in this case, no matter how $x\in X$ is
partitioned into blocks (as long as their lengths are sufficiently large and
bounded), after ignoring a set $M$ of upper Banach density smaller than
$\varepsilon$, all blocks in the decomposition are ergodic. The first half of
the paper is concluded by examples showing, among other things, that the small
set $M$, in both main theorems, cannot be avoided.
  The second half of the paper is devoted to generalizing the two main results
described above to subshifts $X\subset\Lambda^G$ with the action of a countable
amenable group $G$. The role of long blocks is played by blocks whose domains
are members of a F\o lner sequence while the decomposition of $x\in X$ into
blocks (of which majority is ergodic) is obtained with the help of a congruent

fluids is presented. Yield-stress fluids are known to slide over solid surfaces
if the tangential stress exceeds the {\it sliding yield stress}. The sliding
may occur due to various microscopic phenomena such as the formation of a
infinitesimal lubrication layer of the solvent and/or elastic deformation of
the suspended soft particles in the vicinity of the solid surfaces. This leads
to a `stick-slip' law which complicates the modelling and analysis of the
hydrodynamic characteristics of the yield-stress fluid flow. In the present
study, we formulate the problem of sliding flow beyond one-dimensional
rheometric flows. Then, a numerical scheme based on the augmented Lagrangian
method is presented to attack these kind of problems. Theoretical tools are
developed for analysing the flow/no-flow limit. The whole framework is
benchmarked in planar Poiseuille flow and validated against analytical
solutions. Then two more complex physical problems are investigated: slippery
particle sedimentation and pressure-driven sliding flow in porous media. The
{\it yield limit} is addressed in detail for both flow cases. In the particle
sedimentation problem, method of characteristics---slipline method---in the
presence of slip is revisited from the perfectly-plastic mechanics and used as
a helpful tool in addressing the yield limit. Finally, flows through model and
randomized porous media are studied. The randomized configuration is chosen to
capture more sophisticated aspects of the yield-stress fluid flows in porous
media at the yield limit---channelization.

all the rotating masses directly connected to the grid. During the last decade,
the integration of renewable energy sources, mainly photovoltaic installations

in power systems. This change is mainly due to the fact that most renewables
have power electronics at the grid interface. The overall impact on stability
and reliability analysis of power systems is very significant. The power
systems become more dynamic and require a new set of strategies modifying
traditional generation control algorithms. Indeed, renewable generation units
are decoupled from the grid by electronic converters, decreasing the overall
inertia of the grid. 'Hidden inertia', 'synthetic inertia' or 'virtual inertia'
are terms currently used to represent artificial inertia created by converter
control of the renewable sources. Alternative spinning reserves are then needed
in the new power system with high penetration renewables, where the lack of
rotating masses directly connected to the grid must be emulated to maintain an
acceptable power system reliability. This paper reviews the inertia concept in
terms of values and their evolution in the last decades, as well as the damping
factor values. A comparison of the rotational grid inertia for traditional and

extensive discussion on wind and photovoltaic power plants and their

the binding state of titanium in the core-shell nanoparticles which was found

fine-tune it based on the gradients from the classifier and a reconstruction

prediction by the classifier and suppresses those that are irrelevant i.e.
serves as a feature attribution method to boost interpretability. In contrast
to most other attribution frameworks, TSInsight is capable of generating both
instance-based and model-based explanations. We evaluated TSInsight along with
9 other commonly used attribution methods on 8 different time-series datasets

deep networks and typically co-locate with each other. Here we propose to
design them using an automated approach. Instead of designing them separately,
we unify them into a single tensor-to-tensor computation graph, and evolve its
structure starting from basic mathematical functions. Examples of such
mathematical functions are addition, multiplication and statistical moments.
The use of low-level mathematical functions, in contrast to the use of
high-level modules in mainstream NAS, leads to a highly sparse and large search
space which can be challenging for search methods. To address the challenge, we
develop efficient rejection protocols to quickly filter out candidate layers
that do not work well. We also use multi-objective evolution to optimize each
layer's performance across many architectures to prevent overfitting. Our
method leads to the discovery of EvoNorms, a set of new
normalization-activation layers with novel, and sometimes surprising structures
that go beyond existing design patterns. For example, some EvoNorms do not
assume that normalization and activation functions must be applied
sequentially, nor need to center the feature maps, nor require explicit
activation functions. Our experiments show that EvoNorms work well on image
classification models including ResNets, MobileNets and EfficientNets but also
transfer well to Mask R-CNN with FPN/SpineNet for instance segmentation and to
BigGAN for image synthesis, outperforming BatchNorm and GroupNorm based layers

However, for nonparaxial light, the recently discovered transverse spin

of the polarization state of the wave. Here we demonstrate, both theoretically
and experimentally, that this transverse spin survives even in nonparaxial
fields (e.g., tightly focused or evanescent) generated from a totally

to the fundamental difference between the degrees of polarization for 2D

However, while prominent online applications exploit messaging in natural

economics literature focuses on the connection between structured stylized
messaging to strategic decisions in games and multi-agent encounters. This
paper aims to connect these two strands of research, which we consider highly
timely and important due to the vast online textual communication on the web.
Particularly, we introduce the following question: can free text expressed in
natural language serve for the prediction of action selection in an economic
context, modeled as a game?
  In order to initiate the research on this question, we introduce the study of
an individual's action prediction in a one-shot game based on free text he/she
provides, while being unaware of the game to be played. We approach the problem
by attributing commonsensical personality attributes via crowd-sourcing to free
texts written by individuals, and employing transductive learning to predict
actions taken by these individuals in one-shot games based on these attributes.
Our approach allows us to train a single classifier that can make predictions
with respect to actions taken in multiple games. In experiments with three
well-studied games, our algorithm compares favorably with strong alternative
approaches. In ablation analysis, we demonstrate the importance of our modeling
choices---the representation of the text with the commonsensical personality
attributes and our classifier---to the predictive power of our model.

effective Hamiltonian, consisting of a core-nucleon Woods-Saxon potential and a
simplified version of the Furutani-Horiuchi-Tamagaki interaction with the
mass-dependent scaling, is optimized in the sp space. To diagonalize the
Hamiltonian matrix, we employ the Davidson method and the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group technique. Results: Our optimized GSM Hamiltonian offers
a good reproduction of binding energies and spectra with the root-mean-square
(rms) deviation from experiment of 160 keV. Since the model performs well when
used to predict known excitations that have not been included in the fit, it
can serve as a reliable tool to describe poorly known states. A case in point
is our prediction for the pair of unbound mirror nuclei $^{10}$Li-$^{10}$N in
which a huge Thomas-Ehrman shift dramatically alters the pattern of low-energy
excitations. Conclusion: The new model will enable comprehensive studies of
structure and reactions aspects of light drip-line nuclei.

resulted in the development of a variety of specialised logics. For C11-style

logic and Owicki-Gries reasoning to verify correctness of weak memory programs.
The technique introduces a set of high-level assertions over C11 states
together with a set of basic Hoare-style axioms over atomic weak memory
statements (e.g., reads/writes), but retains all other standard proof
obligations for compound statements. This paper takes this line of work further
by showing Nipkow and Nieto's encoding of Owicki-Gries in the Isabelle theorem

straightforward manner. We exemplify our techniques over several litmus tests
from the literature and a non-trivial example: Peterson's algorithm adapted for
C11. For the examples we consider, the proof outlines can be automatically
discharged using the existing Isabelle tactics developed by Nipkow and Nieto.
The benefit here is that programs can be written using a familiar pseudocode
syntax with assertions embedded directly into the program.

using huge pre-trained models with hundreds of millions of parameters. However,
these models suffer from heavy model sizes and high latency such that they
cannot be deployed to resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we
propose MobileBERT for compressing and accelerating the popular BERT model.
Like the original BERT, MobileBERT is task-agnostic, that is, it can be
generically applied to various downstream NLP tasks via simple fine-tuning.
Basically, MobileBERT is a thin version of BERT_LARGE, while equipped with
bottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions
and feed-forward networks. To train MobileBERT, we first train a specially
designed teacher model, an inverted-bottleneck incorporated BERT_LARGE model.
Then, we conduct knowledge transfer from this teacher to MobileBERT. Empirical
studies show that MobileBERT is 4.3x smaller and 5.5x faster than BERT_BASE
while achieving competitive results on well-known benchmarks. On the natural
language inference tasks of GLUE, MobileBERT achieves a GLUEscore o 77.7 (0.6
lower than BERT_BASE), and 62 ms latency on a Pixel 4 phone. On the SQuAD

ambiguity in the data that can only be resolved with higher-level knowledge of
the structure. Automatic algorithms do exist, but there are many use cases
where they fail. The gold standard is still manual segmentation or review.
Unfortunately, even for an expert, manual segmentation is laborious, time
consuming, and prone to errors. Existing 3D segmentation tools are often
designed based on the underlying algorithm, and do not take into account human
mental models, their lower-level perception abilities, and higher-level
cognitive tasks. Our goal is to analyze manual segmentation using the critical
decision method (CDM) in order to gain a better understanding of the low-level
(perceptual and marking) actions and higher-level decision-making processes
that segmenters use. A key challenge we faced is that decision-making consists
of an accumulated set of low-level visual-spatial decisions that are
inter-related and difficult to articulate verbally. To address this, we
developed a novel hybrid protocol which integrates CDM with eye-tracking,
observation, and targeted questions. In this paper, we develop and validate
data coding schemes for this hybrid data set that discern segmenters' low-level
actions, higher-level cognitive tasks, overall task structures, and
decision-making processes. We successfully detect the visual processing changes
based on tasks sequences and micro decisions reflected in the eye-gaze data and
identified different segmentation decision strategies utilized by the

carbonaceous-rich component of these grain populations emits in infrared bands,
observed remotely for decades with telescopes and satellites. They are a key
ingredient of astrochemical dust evolution. The precise carriers for most of
these bands are still unknown and not well reproduced in the laboratory. In
this work, we show the high-energy mechanochemical synthesis of disordered
aromatic and aliphatic analogues provides interstellar relevant dust particles.
The mechanochemical milling of carbon-based solids under a hydrogen atmosphere
produces particles with a spectroscopic match to astrophysical observations of
aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The H/C ratio for the analogues that
best reproduce these astronomical infrared observations lies in the 5$\pm$2%
range. This value is much lower than diffuse interstellar hydrogenated
amorphous carbons, another Galactic dust grain component observed in
absorption, and it most probably provides a constraint on the hydrogenation
degree of the most aromatic carbonaceous dust grain carriers. A broad band,
observed in AIBs, in the 7.4-8.3 $\mu$m range is correlated to the hydrogen
content, and thus the structural evolution in the analogues produced. The
mechanochemical process can be seen as an experimental reactor to stimulate
local energetic chemical reactions. It introduces bond disorder and hydrogen
chemical attachment on the produced defects, with an effect similar to the
interstellar space very localised chemical reactions with solids. From the
vantage point of astrophysics, these laboratory interstellar dust analogues
will be used to predict dust grain evolution under simulated interstellar
conditions, including harsh radiative environments. Such interstellar analogues
offer an opportunity to derive a global view on the cycling of matter in other

significant interest due to a range of properties, such as layer-dependent
inversion symmetry, valley-contrasted Berry curvatures, and strong spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). Of particular interest is niobium diselenide (NbSe2), whose
superconducting state in few-layer samples is profoundly affected by an unusual
type of SOC called Ising SOC. Combined with the reduced dimensionality, the
latter stabilizes the superconducting state against magnetic fields up to ~35 T
and could lead to other exotic properties such as nodal and crystalline
topological superconductivity. Here, we report transport measurements of
few-layer NbSe$_2$ under in-plane external magnetic fields, revealing an
unexpected two-fold rotational symmetry of the superconducting state. In
contrast to the three-fold symmetry of the lattice, we observe that the
magnetoresistance and critical field exhibit a two-fold oscillation with
respect to an applied in-plane magnetic field. We find similar two-fold
oscillations deep inside the superconducting state in differential conductance
measurements on NbSe$_2$/CrBr$_3$ superconductor-magnet junctions. In both
cases, the anisotropy vanishes in the normal state, demonstrating that it is an
intrinsic property of the superconducting phase. We attribute the behavior to
the mixing between two closely competing pairing instabilities, namely, the
conventional s-wave instability typical of bulk NbSe$_2$ and an unconventional
d- or p-wave channel that emerges in few-layer NbSe2. Our results thus
demonstrate the unconventional character of the pairing interaction in a

the light-matter interaction and to shape the spectral features of the
electromagnetic fields. Important efforts have been carried out to develop
modal theories of open optical cavities relying on an expansion of the fields
on the eigen-fields of the cavity. Here, we show how such an expansion predicts
the temporal dynamics of optical resonators. We consider a Fabry-Perot cavity
to derive the full analytical expressions of the internal and scattered field
on the quasi-normal modes basis together with the complex eigen-frequencies. We
evince the convergence and accuracy of this expansion before deriving the
impulse response function (IRF) of the open cavity. We benefit from this modal
expansion and IRF to demonstrate that the eigen-modes of the open cavity impact
the signals only during the transient regimes and not in the permanent regime.

understanding high- $T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates. In the model with
next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ (the $t'$- Hubbard model), pairing is
strongly influenced by $t'$ . In particular, a recent study on a width-4
cylinder observed quasi-long-rage superconducting order, associated with a
negative $t'$ , which was taken to imply superconductivity in the
two-dimensional (2D) limit. In this work we study more carefully pairing in the
width-4 $t'$-Hubbard model. We show that in this specific system, the pairing
symmetry with $t'<0$ is not the ordinary $d$-wave one would expect in the 2D
limit. Instead we observe a so-called plaquette d-wave pairing. The plaquette
d-wave exists only on a width-4 cylinder, and so is not representative of the
2D limit. We find that a negative $t'$ suppresses the conventional d-wave,
leading to plaquette pairing. In contrast, a different $t''$ coupling acting
diagonally on the plaquettes suppresses plaquette pairing, leading to
conventional $d$-wave pairing.

from the attempt to mitigate privacy leakage in multiple reporting: tracking of
users participating in the data collection via the mechanisms added to provide

the differential privacy framework.
  Specifically, we define the trackable parameter as the log of the maximum
ratio between the probability that a set of reports originated from a single
user and the probability that the same set of reports originated from two users
(with the same private value). We explore the implications of this new
definition. We show how differentially private and untrackable mechanisms can
be combined to achieve a bound for the problem of detecting when a certain user
changed their private value.
  Examining Google's deployed solution for everlasting privacy, we show that
RAPPOR (Erlingsson et al. ACM CCS, 2014) is trackable in our framework for the
parameters presented in their paper.
  We analyze a variant of randomized response for collecting statistics of
single bits, Bitwise Everlasting Privacy, that achieves good accuracy and
everlasting privacy, while only being reasonably untrackable, specifically
grows linearly in the number of reports. For collecting statistics about data
from larger domains (for histograms and heavy hitters) we present a mechanism
that prevents tracking for a limited number of responses.

mechanism as the input of another, in the scope of Differential Privacy, and

machine-learning techniques, specifically sparse regression to obtain high
corrections of the turbulence anisotropy tensor and the production of
turbulence kinetic energy as functions of the RANS mean-flow. The LES-RANS

Centauri b, to the choice of a convection parameterization. Compared to a
mass-flux convection parameterization, a simplified convection adjustment
parameterization leads to a $>$60% decrease of the cloud albedo, increasing the
mean day-side temperature by $\approx$10 K. The representation of convection
also affects the atmospheric conditions of the night side, via a change in
planetary-scale wave patterns. As a result, using the convection adjustment
scheme makes the night-side cold traps warmer by 17-36 K for the planets in our
simulations. The day-night thermal contrast is sensitive to the representation
of convection in 3D GCM simulations, so caution should be taken when
interpreting emission phase curves. The choice of convection treatment,
however, does not alter the simulated climate enough to result in a departure
from habitable conditions, at least for the atmospheric composition and
planetary parameters used in our study. The near-surface conditions both in the
Trappist-1e and Proxima b cases remain temperate, allowing for an active water
cycle. We further advance our analysis using high-resolution model experiments,
in which atmospheric convection is simulated explicitly. Our results suggest
that in a hypothetical global convection-permitting simulation the surface
temperature contrast would be higher than in the coarse-resolution simulations
with parameterized convection. In other words, models with parameterized
convection may overestimate the inter-hemispheric heat redistribution
efficiency.

meaningfully improve the comprehension of domain-specific reviews. In this
paper, we introduce xSense, an effective system for review comprehension using

QA model significantly, demonstrating the usefulness of incorporating
commonsense into review comprehension pipelines. To facilitate future research

further exacerbated by inefficiencies in mapping the computation to hardware.
We present a novel method for designing neural network topologies that directly
map to a highly efficient FPGA implementation. By exploiting the equivalence of
artificial neurons with quantized inputs/outputs and truth tables, we can train
quantized neural networks that can be directly converted to a netlist of truth
tables, and subsequently deployed as a highly pipelinable, massively parallel
FPGA circuit. However, the neural network topology requires careful
consideration since the hardware cost of truth tables grows exponentially with
neuron fan-in. To obtain smaller networks where the whole netlist can be
placed-and-routed onto a single FPGA, we derive a fan-in driven hardware cost
model to guide topology design, and combine high sparsity with low-bit
activation quantization to limit the neuron fan-in. We evaluate our approach on
two tasks with very high intrinsic throughput requirements in high-energy
physics and network intrusion detection. We show that the combination of
sparsity and low-bit activation quantization results in high-speed circuits
with small logic depth and low LUT cost, demonstrating competitive accuracy
with less than 15 ns of inference latency and throughput in the hundreds of
millions of inferences per second.

X-ray data obtained with NuSTAR and NICER allowing us to characterize the

the outburst the maximum broadband X-ray luminosity of the system reached
$1-2\times10^{39}$ erg/s, thus exceeding by about one order of magnitude the
Eddington limit for a typical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ mass neutron star (NS).

orientation is equally as likely to appear. However, this rotational symmetry
is not widely utilised as prior knowledge in modern Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), resulting in data hungry models that learn independent
features at each orientation. Allowing CNNs to be rotation-equivariant removes
the necessity to learn this set of transformations from the data and instead
frees up model capacity, allowing more discriminative features to be learned.
This reduction in the number of required parameters also reduces the risk of
overfitting. In this paper, we propose Dense Steerable Filter CNNs (DSF-CNNs)
that use group convolutions with multiple rotated copies of each filter in a
densely connected framework. Each filter is defined as a linear combination of
steerable basis filters, enabling exact rotation and decreasing the number of
trainable parameters compared to standard filters. We also provide the first
in-depth comparison of different rotation-equivariant CNNs for histology image

imaging as it aids in the analysis and diagnosis of diseases. Nevertheless, a
main drawback of deep models is that they require a large amount of pixel-level
labels, which are laborious and expensive to obtain. To mitigate this problem,
weakly supervised learning has emerged as an efficient alternative, which
employs image-level labels, scribbles, points, or bounding boxes as
supervision. Among these, image-level labels are easier to obtain. However,
since this type of annotation only contains object category information, the
segmentation task under this learning paradigm is a challenging problem. To
address this issue, visual salient regions derived from trained classification
networks are typically used. Despite their success to identify important
regions on classification tasks, these saliency regions only focus on the most
discriminant areas of an image, limiting their use in semantic segmentation. In
this work, we propose a manifold driven attention-based network to enhance
visual salient regions, thereby improving segmentation accuracy in a weakly
supervised setting. Our method generates superior attention maps directly
during inference without the need of extra computations. We evaluate the
benefits of our approach in the task of segmentation using a public benchmark

modelling approach for free-living gait (walking) analysis. Gait is a promising
target for non-obtrusive monitoring because it is common and indicative of
various movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), yet its analysis
has largely been limited to experimentally controlled lab settings. To locate
and characterize stationary gait segments in free living using accelerometers,
we present an unsupervised statistical framework designed to segment signals
into differing gait and non-gait patterns. Our flexible probabilistic framework
combines empirical assumptions about gait into a principled graphical model
with all of its merits. We demonstrate the approach on a new video-referenced
dataset including unscripted daily living activities of 25 PD patients and 25
controls, in and around their own houses. We evaluate our ability to detect
gait and predict medication induced fluctuations in PD patients based on

dimensional ($5d$) general relativity, though we do make connections with the
corresponding Kaluza-Klein effective $4d$ theory. We show that the luminosity
of gravitational waves emitted in $5d$ gravity by a binary with the same
characteristics (same masses and separation distance) as a $4d$ binary is
20.8\% less relative to the $4d$ case, to leading post-Newtonian order. The
phase of the gravitational waveform differs by 26\% relative to the $4d$ case,
to leading post-Newtonian order. Such a correction arises mainly due to the
coupling between matter and dilaton field in the effective $4d$ picture and
agrees with previous calculations when we set black holes' scalar charges to be
those computed from the Kaluza-Klein reduction. The above corrections to the
waveform and the luminosity are inconsistent with the gravitational-wave and
binary pulsar observations and thus they effectively rule out the possibility
of such a simple compactified higher dimensions scenario. We also comment on
how our results change if there are several compactified extra dimensions, and

essential capability for autonomous vehicles. Since autonomous vehicles need to
navigate in dynamically changing environments, they are expected to make
accurate predictions regardless of where they are and what driving
circumstances they encountered. Several methodologies have been proposed to
solve prediction problems under different traffic situations. These works
usually combine agent trajectories with either color-coded or vectorized high
definition (HD) map as input representations and encode this information for
behavior prediction tasks. However, not all the information is relevant in the
scene for the forecasting and such irrelevant information may be even
distracting to the forecasting in certain situations. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose a novel generic representation for various driving environments by
taking the advantage of semantics and domain knowledge. Using semantics enables
situations to be modeled in a uniform way and applying domain knowledge filters
out unrelated elements to target vehicle's future behaviors. We then propose a
general semantic behavior prediction framework to effectively utilize these
representations by formulating them into spatial-temporal semantic graphs and
reasoning internal relations among these graphs. We theoretically and
empirically validate the proposed framework under highly interactive and
complex scenarios, demonstrating that our method not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance, but also processes desirable zero-shot

in both interfaces resonate with each other. This differs essentially from the

including when and where to intervene to guarantee a positive patient outcome,
is a major open challenge. Network neuroscience and control theory offer useful
tools that may guide improvements in parameter selection for control of
anomalous neural activity. Here we use a novel method to characterize dynamic
controllability across consecutive effective connectivity (EC) networks based
on regularized partial correlations between implanted electrodes during the
onset, propagation, and termination phases of thirty-four seizures. We estimate
regularized partial correlation adjacency matrices from one-second time windows
of intracranial electrocorticography recordings using the Graphical Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (GLASSO). Average and modal
controllability metrics calculated from each resulting EC network track the
time-varying controllability of the brain on an evolving landscape of
conditionally dependent network interactions. We show that average
controllability increases throughout a seizure and is negatively correlated
with modal controllability throughout. Furthermore, our results support the
hypothesis that the energy required to drive the brain to a seizure-free state
from an ictal state is smallest during seizure onset; yet, we find that
applying control energy at electrodes in the seizure onset zone may not always
be energetically favorable. Our work suggests that a low-complexity model of
time-evolving controllability may offer new insights for developing and
improving control strategies targeting seizure suppression.

researchers to question how much these networks actually ``know'' about natural
language. Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing, a
researcher chooses a linguistic task and trains a supervised model to predict
annotations in that linguistic task from the network's learned representations.
If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations
encode knowledge related to the task. A commonly held belief is that using
simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that simpler models will
identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an
information-theoretic operationalization of probing as estimating mutual
information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the
highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will
result in a tighter estimate, and thus reveal more of the linguistic
information inherent in the representation. The experimental portion of our
paper focuses on empirically estimating the mutual information between a
linguistic property and BERT, comparing these estimates to several baselines.

respect to a desired direction (i.e., a reference angle) and it can be applied
to many real life scenarios, such as video-conferencing or taking group photos.
However, previous work on this topic mainly suffers of two limitations: (1)
Low-quality image generation and (2) Low redirection precision. In this paper,
we propose to alleviate these problems by means of a novel gaze redirection
framework which exploits both a numerical and a pictorial direction guidance,
jointly with a coarse-to-fine learning strategy. Specifically, the coarse
branch learns the spatial transformation which warps input image according to
desired gaze. On the other hand, the fine-grained branch consists of a
generator network with conditional residual image learning and a multi-task
discriminator. This second branch reduces the gap between the previously warped
image and the ground-truth image and recovers finer texture details. Moreover,
we propose a numerical and pictorial guidance module~(NPG) which uses a
pictorial gazemap description and numerical angles as an extra guide to further
improve the precision of gaze redirection. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches in terms of both image quality and redirection precision. The code

based on a general small-signal model consisting of a dc grid with arbitrary
topology and MMCs with dq controllers. The general small-signal model developed
by a systematic way can be used for small-disturbance stability analysis. To
verify the developed small-signal model, a comparison between the developed

small-signal model. Based on the eigenvalues sensitivity and the Taylor Series
of eigenvalues, a set of inequality constraints are derived and used to
efficiently estimate the stability regions of all coupled slopes of the droop

resums higher order Coulomb corrections to all orders in the strong coupling

of radiative dissipations on the responses. The properties of tidal responses
depend on thermal timescales $\tau_*$ in the envelope and Ekman number Ek in
the core and on weather the forcing frequency $\omega$ is in the inertial range
or not, where the inertial range is defined by $|\omega|\le2\Omega$ for the
rotation frequency $\Omega$. If ${\rm Ek}\gtrsim 10^{-7}$, the viscous
dissipation in the core is dominating the thermal contributions in the envelope
for $\tau_*\gtrsim 1$ day. If ${\rm Ek}\lesssim 10^{-7}$, however, the viscous
dissipation is comparable to or smaller than the thermal contributions and the
envelope plays an important role to determine the tidal torques. If the forcing
is in the inertial range, frequency resonance of the tidal forcing with core
inertial modes significantly affects the tidal torques, producing numerous
resonance peaks of the torque. Depending on the sign of the torque in the

In this paper, we investigate whether the graph structure is necessary for

construct a strong baseline model to establish that, with the proper use of
pre-trained models, graph structure may not be necessary for multi-hop question
answering. We point out that both graph structure and adjacency matrix are
task-related prior knowledge, and graph-attention can be considered as a

that graph-attention or the entire graph structure can be replaced by
self-attention or Transformers.

due to its effectiveness and universal-usability. However, the online
deployment of BERT is often blocked by its large-scale parameters and high
computational cost. There are plenty of studies showing that the knowledge
distillation is efficient in transferring the knowledge from BERT into the
model with a smaller size of parameters. Nevertheless, current BERT
distillation approaches mainly focus on task-specified distillation, such
methodologies lead to the loss of the general semantic knowledge of BERT for
universal-usability. In this paper, we propose a sentence representation
approximating oriented distillation framework that can distill the pre-trained
BERT into a simple LSTM based model without specifying tasks. Consistent with
BERT, our distilled model is able to perform transfer learning via fine-tuning
to adapt to any sentence-level downstream task. Besides, our model can further
cooperate with task-specific distillation procedures. The experimental results
on multiple NLP tasks from the GLUE benchmark show that our approach
outperforms other task-specific distillation methods or even much larger
models, i.e., ELMO, with efficiency well-improved.

Chinese machine reading comprehension datasets become available. To add
diversity in this area, in this paper, we propose a new task called Sentence
Cloze-style Machine Reading Comprehension (SC-MRC). The proposed task aims to
fill the right candidate sentence into the passage that has several blanks. We
built a Chinese dataset called CMRC 2019 to evaluate the difficulty of the
SC-MRC task. Moreover, to add more difficulties, we also made fake candidates
that are similar to the correct ones, which requires the machine to judge their
correctness in the context. The proposed dataset contains over 100K blanks
(questions) within over 10K passages, which was originated from Chinese
narrative stories. To evaluate the dataset, we implement several baseline
systems based on the pre-trained models, and the results show that the
state-of-the-art model still underperforms human performance by a large margin.
We release the dataset and baseline system to further facilitate our community.

use the non extensive Tsallis statistics to find the entropic index in the
partonic stages of the relativistic heavy ion collisions. We find that the
temperature and the entropic index have a linear relationship during the
partonic stages of the heavy ion collision. This has already been observed in
the hadronic phase. A detailed analysis of the dependence of the entropic index
on the system shows that for increasing space time rapidity, the entropic index
of the partonic system increases. The entropic index also depends on the beam
collision energy. The calculation of the entropic index from the experimental
data fitting of the transverse momenta deals with the hadronic phase. However,
our current study shows that the behaviour of the entropic index in the initial
non-equilibrium stage of the collision is very similar to the behaviour of the
entropic index in the hadronic stage.

a larger set of items based on tests whose outcomes indicate whether any
defective item is present. This problem is relevant in areas such as medical
testing, data science, communications, and many more. Motivated by physical
considerations, we consider a sparsity-based constrained setting (Gandikota et
al., 2019) in which the testing procedure is subject to one of the following
two constraints: items are finitely divisible and thus may participate in at
most $\gamma$ tests; or tests are size-constrained to pool no more than $\rho$
items per test. While information-theoretic limits and algorithms are known for
the non-adaptive setting, relatively little is known in the adaptive setting.
We address this gap by providing an information-theoretic converse that holds
even in the adaptive setting, as well as a near-optimal noiseless adaptive
algorithm for $\gamma$-divisible items. In broad scaling regimes, our upper and
lower bounds asymptotically match up to a factor of $e$. We also present a
simple asymptotically optimal adaptive algorithm for $\rho$-sized tests. In
addition, in the non-adaptive setting with $\gamma$-divisible items, we use the
Definite Defectives (DD) decoding algorithm and study bounds on the required
number of tests for vanishing error probability under the random near-constant
test-per-item design. We show that the number of tests required can be
significantly less than the Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP)
decoding algorithm, and is asymptotically optimal in broad scaling regimes.

High-Resolution ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to distinguish these two
fundamentally different methods. The key difference between them can be
attributed to the gradient correction term, which is reflected by the Hessian
term in the High-Resolution ODE. Our goal is to understand how this term can
affect the convergence rate and the choice of our step size. To achieve this
goal, we introduce the notion of $\beta$-High Resolution ODE, $0\leq \beta\leq
1$ and prove that within certain range of step size, there is a phase
transition happening at $\beta_c$. When $\beta_c\leq\beta\leq 1$, the algorithm
associated with $\beta$-High Resolution ODE have the same convergence rate as
NAG-SC. When $0\leq \beta\leq \beta_c$, this algorithm will have the slower
convergence rate than NAG-SC.

  No. 1, 2020 (New Series), pp 181-196",,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Restrictive mass quarantine or lockdown has been implemented as
the most important controlling measure to fight against COVID-19. Many
countries have enforced 2 - 4 weeks' lockdown and are extending the period
depending on their current disease scenario. Most probably the 14-day period of
estimated communicability of COVID-19 prompted such decision. But the idea
that, if the susceptible population drops below certain threshold, the
infection would naturally die out in small communities after a fixed time
(following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was
proposed by Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community
Size (CCS). Methods: We propose an SEIR model that explains COVID-19 disease
dynamics. Using our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to
extinction (TTE) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal number of
lockdown days required and size of quarantined population. Findings: With the
given country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have
identified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops
below CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it
is introduced from outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We
have calculated the country-specific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown
days. Thus, smaller lockdown phase is sufficient to contain COVID-19. On a
cautionary note, our model indicates another rise in infection almost a year
later but on a lesser magnitude.

modeling, and the appropriate presentation of estimates and their
uncertainties. Specifically, we consider the importance of accounting for
survey stratification and cluster-level non-spatial excess variation in survey
outcomes when fitting geostatistical models. We also discuss the trade-off
between the geographical scale and precision of model-based estimates, and
demonstrate visualization methods for mapping and ranking that emphasize the
probabilistic interpretation of results. A novel approach to coverage map

polyphones - characters having multiple pronunciations. Although many academic
efforts have been made to address it, there has been no open dataset that can
serve as a standard benchmark for fair comparison to date. In addition, most of
the reported systems are hard to employ for researchers or practitioners who
want to convert Chinese text into pinyin at their convenience. Motivated by
these, in this work, we introduce a new benchmark dataset that consists of
99,000+ sentences for Chinese polyphone disambiguation. We train a simple
neural network model on it, and find that it outperforms other preexisting G2P
systems. Finally, we package our project and share it on PyPi.

degree of the polarization in the late phase significantly changes from that

emission line and therefore we reliably estimate the interstellar polarization

subtracting the estimated interstellar polarization, we find that the intrinsic
polarization at the early phase is only ~ 0.2 %, which indicates an almost
spherical photosphere, with an axial ratio ~ 1.05. The intrinsic polarization
at the late phase increases to ~ 0.8 %, which corresponds to the photosphere
with an axial ratio 1.2. A nearly constant position angle of the polarization
suggests the inner ejecta are almost axisymmetric. By these observations, we
conclude that the inner ejecta are more aspherical than the outer ejecta. It
may suggest the presence of a central energy source producing aspherical inner
ejecta.

synthesize novel motion video for a target person that imitates the movement
from a reference video. It is a video-to-video translation task in which the
estimated poses are used to bridge two domains. Despite substantial progress on
the topic, there exist several problems with the previous methods. First, there
is a domain gap between training and testing pose sequences--the model is
tested on poses it has not seen during training, such as difficult dancing
moves. Furthermore, pose detection errors are inevitable, making the job of the
generator harder. Finally, generating realistic pixels from sparse poses is
challenging in a single step. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
pose-to-video translation framework for generating high-quality videos that are
temporally coherent even for in-the-wild pose sequences unseen during training.
We propose a pose augmentation method to minimize the training-test gap, a
unified paired and unpaired learning strategy to improve the robustness to
detection errors, and two-stage network architecture to achieve superior
texture quality. To further boost research on the topic, we build two human
motion datasets. Finally, we show the superiority of our approach over the

involves repeated inversion (of the forward model) and denoising until
convergence. Remarkably, PnP regularization produces promising results for
several restoration applications. However, a fundamental question in this

algorithm is not strictly derived from an optimization framework. This question
has been investigated in recent works, but there are still many unresolved
problems. For example, it is not known if convergence can be guaranteed if we
use generic kernel denoisers (e.g. nonlocal means) within the ISTA framework
(PnP-ISTA). We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, fixed-point
convergence of PnP-ISTA is indeed guaranteed for linear inverse problems such

for inpainting). We compare our theoretical findings with existing results,

ion collision experiments exhibits a significant temperature-gradient between
the central and peripheral regions of the collisions, which in turn, is capable
of inducing an electric field in the medium; a phenomenon known as Seebeck
effect. The effect is quantified by the magnitude of the induced electric field
per unit temperature-gradient - the Seebeck coefficient ($S$). We study the
coefficient, $S$ in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in
relaxation-time approximation, as a function of temperature ($T$) and chemical
potential ($\mu$), wherein we find that with current quark masses, the
magnitude of $S$ for individual flavours as well as that for the medium as a
whole decreases with $T$ and increases with $\mu$, with the electric charge of
the flavour deciding the sign of $S$. The emergence of a strong magnetic field
($B$) in the non-central collisions at heavy-ion collider experiments motivates
us to study the effect of $B$ on Seebeck effect. The strong $B$ affects $S$ in
multifold ways, via : a) modification of phase-space due to the dimensional
reduction, b) dispersion relation in lowest Landau level (occupation
probability), and c) relaxation-time. We find that a strong $B$ not only
decreases the magnitudes of $S$'s of individual species, it also flips their
signs. This leads to a faster reduction of the magnitude of $S$ of the medium
than its counterpart at $B=0$. We then explore how the interactions among
partons in perturbative thermal QCD in the quasiparticle framework affect
Seebeck effect, where we find that even in strong B, there is no more a flip of
the sign of $S$ for individual species and an enhancement of the magnitudes of
$S$ of individual species as well as that of the medium, compared to current

in the context of the canonical tensor model, a tensor model for quantum
gravity in the canonical formalism. This matrix model also appears in the same
form with different ranges of parameters and variables, when the replica trick
is applied to the spherical $p$-spin model ($p=3$) in spin glass theory.
Previous studies of this matrix model suggested the presence of a continuous
phase transition around $R\sim N^2/2$, where $N$ and $R$ designate its matrix
size $N\times R$. This relation between $N$ and $R$ intriguingly agrees with a
consistency condition of the tensor model in the leading order of $N$,
suggesting that the tensor model is located near or on the continuous phase
transition point and therefore its continuum limit is automatically taken in
the $N\rightarrow \infty$ limit. In the previous work, however, the evidence
for the phase transition was not satisfactory due to the slowdown of the Monte
Carlo simulations. In this work, we provide a new setup for Monte Carlo
simulations by integrating out the radial direction of the matrix. This new
strategy considerably improves the efficiency, and allows us to clearly show
the existence of the phase transition. We also present various characteristics
of the phases, such as dynamically generated dimensions of configurations,
cascade symmetry breaking, and a parameter zero limit, to discuss some
implications to the canonical tensor model.

studies show that blazars dominate (93%) the already-identified EGRET sources
(142), suggesting that among the unidentified sources (129) there could still
be faint blazars. Due to the presence of a strong non-thermal component inside
their jets, blazars are found to display a weaker depression at 4000 {\AA}
(K4000<0.4). In this study, we aimed at determining the K4000 break for a
selected sample among the potential blazar candidates from unidentified EGRET
sources to confirm their blazar nature. We used two blazar candidates,
3EGJ1800-0146 and 3EGJ1709-0817 associated with radio counterparts, J1802-0207
and J1713-0817, respectively. Their optical counterparts were obtained through
spectroscopic observations using Robert Stobie spectrograph (RSS) at the
Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in South Africa. The observed Ca II H &
K lines depression at 4000 {\AA} in spectra of these sources show a shallow
depression, K4000=0.35+-0.02 and 0.24+-0.01, respectively, suggesting that
these sources are blazar candidates. Moreover, the redshifts z=0.165 and 0.26
measured in their spectra confirm the extragalactic nature of these sources.

system, generating an asynchronous, pixel-wise stream of data. Learning from
such data is generally performed through heavy preprocessing and event
integration into images. This requires buffering of possibly long sequences and
can limit the response time of the inference system. In this work, we instead
propose to directly use events from a DVS camera, a stream of intensity changes
and their spatial coordinates. This sequence is used as the input for a novel
\emph{asynchronous} RNN-like architecture, the Input-filtering Neural ODEs
(INODE). This is inspired by the dynamical systems and filtering literature.
INODE is an extension of Neural ODEs (NODE) that allows for input signals to be
continuously fed to the network, like in filtering. The approach naturally
handles batches of time series with irregular time-stamps by implementing a
batch forward Euler solver. INODE is trained like a standard RNN, it learns to
discriminate short event sequences and to perform event-by-event online
inference. We demonstrate our approach on a series of classification tasks,
comparing against a set of LSTM baselines. We show that, independently of the
camera resolution, INODE can outperform the baselines by a large margin on the
ASL task and it's on par with a much larger LSTM for the NCALTECH task.
Finally, we show that INODE is accurate even when provided with very few

that the rates of AIC events from the double WD mergers in the Galaxy are in
the range of 1.4-8.9*10^-3 yr^-1 for all ONe/CO WD+ONe/CO WD mergers, and in

also found that the number of single NSs from AIC events in our Galaxy may
range from 0.328*10^7 to 1.072*10^8. The chirp mass of double WDs for producing
AIC events distribute in the range of 0.55-1.25 Msun. We estimated that more

observations from the discrete distribution, if some estimator incurs an error
$\varepsilon$ with probability at most $\delta$, then plugging in the PML
distribution incurs an error $2\varepsilon$ with probability at most
$\delta\cdot \exp(3\sqrt{n})$. In this paper, we strengthen the above result
and show that using a careful chaining argument, the error probability can be
reduced to $\delta^{1-c}\cdot \exp(c'n^{1/3+c})$ for arbitrarily small

concentration property without any sample splitting, where as a byproduct we
obtain better trade-offs between the polynomial approximation error and the
maximum magnitude of coefficients in the Poisson approximation of $1$-Lipschitz

generalize over unseen situations, which is often approached by training them
on a diversity of tasks (or environments). A powerful method to foster
diversity is to procedurally generate tasks by sampling their parameters from a
multi-dimensional distribution, enabling in particular to propose a different
task for each training episode. In practice, to get the high diversity of
training tasks necessary for generalization, one has to use complex procedural
generation systems. With such generators, it is hard to get prior knowledge on
the subset of tasks that are actually learnable at all (many generated tasks
may be unlearnable), what is their relative difficulty and what is the most
efficient task distribution ordering for training. A typical solution in such
cases is to rely on some form of Automated Curriculum Learning (ACL) to adapt
the sampling distribution. One limit of current approaches is their need to
explore the task space to detect progress niches over time, which leads to a
loss of time. Additionally, we hypothesize that the induced noise in the
training data may impair the performances of brittle DRL learners. We address
this problem by proposing a two stage ACL approach where 1) a teacher algorithm
first learns to train a DRL agent with a high-exploration curriculum, and then
2) distills learned priors from the first run to generate an ""expert
curriculum"" to re-train the same agent from scratch. Besides demonstrating 50%
improvements on average over the current state of the art, the objective of
this work is to give a first example of a new research direction oriented

Interestingly, while these phase transitions have proven to be notoriously
difficult to analyze using traditional methods, they can be characterized

It can be described as a dynamic network with vertices that correspond to the
subscribers of the telephone network and emerging directional edges that
correspond to the connections between the respective subscribers. The position
of the edge and its direction is determined by the incoming and outgoing calls
from the corresponding vertices. The subject of the article is the statistical
properties of the connections of a certain subset of telephone network
subscribers. Such connections are dynamic in nature due to their appearance and
disappearance. The number of outgoing (or incoming) connections occurred during
a day at a selected vertex is used as the main characteristic. The distribution
density of the number of outgoing (or incoming) connections (or calls) of such
a network has been analyzed using the experimental data. It has been shown that
such a distribution density over the number of calls obeys the lognormal
distribution density, which depends on the two parameters. The values of two
parameters, namely the mean value and the variance, determining the lognormal
distribution density are established. The reasons for the appearance of a
lognormal distribution density over the number of incoming (or outgoing)
connections have been discussed. The statistical properties of other groups of
subscribers have been considered as well. In particular, the group that makes a
large number of outgoing calls to various subscribers of the telephone network
has been selected for a separate study. The members of this group, who create
and distribute spam can be called spammers. It has been shown that these
groups, spammers for example, also obeys the lognormal distribution density

function. In this paper, we exploit this hierarchical structure by introducing
a novel algorithm that avoids evaluating the clauses exhaustively. Instead we
use a simple look-up table that indexes the clauses on the features that
falsify them. In this manner, we can quickly evaluate a large number of clauses
through falsification, simply by iterating through the features and using the
look-up table to eliminate those clauses that are falsified. The look-up table

sizes of extremes above the thresholds (exceeding size) conform to a

connecting the two corresponding marginal distributions with the Frank and AMH

probability to observe another extreme in $\Delta t$ time since the last

computational performance of these models, thereby the validity of commonly
applied simplifying assumptions, are assessed. Benchmark simulations reveal
that omission of gas flow, i.e. neglecting convective transport in gas phase,
results in the underestimation of evaporation rates by 23-54%. When gas flow is
considered but the effect of buoyancy is modeled using Boussinesq approximation
instead of assigning temperature dependent density throughout the gas domain,
evaporation rate can be underestimated by up to 16%.

candidate MAXI J1348-630, discovered on 2019 January 26 with the Gas Slit
Camera (GSC) on-board MAXI. During the monitoring period, the source exhibited
two outburst peaks, where the first peak flux (at T=14 day from the discovery
of T =0) was ~4 Crab (2-20 keV) and the second one (at T =132 day) was ~0.4
Crab (2-20 keV). The source exhibited distinct spectral transitions between the
high/soft and low/hard states and an apparent ""q""-shape curve on the
hardness-intensity diagram, both of which are well-known characteristics of
black hole binaries. Compared to other bright black hole transients, MAXI
J1348-630 is characterized by its low disk-temperature (~0.75 keV at the
maximum) and high peak flux in the high/soft state. The low peak-temperature
leads to a large innermost radius that is identified as the Innermost Stable
Circular Orbit (ISCO), determined by the black hole mass and spin. Assuming the
empirical relation between the soft-to-hard transition luminosity (Ltrans) and
the Eddington luminosity (LEdd), Ltrans/LEdd ~ 0.02, and a face-on disk around
a non-spinning black hole, the source distance and the black hole mass are
estimated to be D ~ 4 kpc and ~7 (D/4 kpc) Mo, respectively. The black hole is
more massive if the disk is inclined and the black hole is spinning. These
results suggest that MAXI J1348-630 may host a relatively massive black hole
among the known black hole binaries in our Galaxy.

multi-scale features from different layers of the feature extractor, has

KTN spacetime represents either a black or a naked singularity. We solve the
governing equations that describe the relativistic accretion flow in KTN
spacetime and obtain all possible global transonic accretion solutions around
KTN black hole in terms of the energy $({\cal E})$ and angular momentum
$(\lambda)$ of the flow. We identify the region of the parameter space in
$\lambda-{\cal E}$ plane that admits the flow to possess multiple critical
points for KTN black hole. We examine the modification of the parameter space
due to $a_{\rm k}$ and $n$ and find that the role of $a_{\rm k}$ and $n$ in
determining the parameter space is opposite to each other. This clearly
indicates that the NUT parameter $n$ effectively mitigates the effect of black
hole rotation in deciding the accretion flow structure. Further, we calculate
the maximum disc luminosity ($L_{\rm max}$) corresponding to the accretion
solutions around the KTN black hole and for a given set of $a_{\rm k}$ and $n$.
In addition, we also investigate all possible flow topologies around the naked
singularity and find that there exists a region around the naked singularity
which remains inaccessible to the flow. We study the critical point properties
for naked singularities and find that the flow possesses maximum of four
critical points. Finally, we obtain the parameter space for multiple critical
points for naked singularity and find that parameter space is shrunk and
shifted to lower $\lambda$ and higher ${\cal E}$ side as $a_{\rm k}$ is
increased which ultimately disappears.

focus for 2D nanomaterial research over the last 10 years, however, only a

ditellurides. In particular, nanoscale platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) has rarely
been investigated, despite its potential applications in catalysis, photonics
and spintronics. Of the reports published, the majority examine
mechanically-exfoliated flakes from chemical vapor transport (CVT) grown
crystals. While this production method is ideal for fundamental studies, it is
very resource intensive therefore rendering this process unsuitable for large
scale applications. In this report, the synthesis of thin films of PtTe2
through the reaction of solid-phase precursor films is described. This offers a
production method for large-area, thickness-controlled PtTe2, suitable for a
range of applications. These polycrystalline PtTe2 films were grown at
temperatures as low as 450 degC, significantly below the typical temperatures
used in the CVT synthesis methods. To investigate their potential
applicability, these films were examined as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The films showed
promising catalytic behavior, however, the PtTe2 was found to undergo chemical
transformation to a substoichiometric chalcogenide compound under ORR
conditions. This study shows while PtTe2 is stable and highly useful for HER,
this property does not apply to ORR, which undergoes a fundamentally different
mechanism. This study broadens our knowledge of the electrocatalysis of TMDs.

then, the disease has spread all over the world, with the United States
becoming the country with the highest number of cases. Governments around the

recommendations and ad campaigns for improved hygiene practices, enacting
social distancing requirements and limiting large public gatherings, and
stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. In the United States, while the response has
varied greatly from state to state, we clearly see that the effect of these
public safety measures is significant and, if these measures continue to remain
in effect, or are expanded to a nationwide lockdown, the pandemic can be
controlled and the disease likely overcome with mitigated consequences. In this
paper, we model the spread of the novel coronavirus using a causal model. We
find that, with continued lockdown measures, the United States can, according
to this model, limit the total number of infections to ~1.35 million and the
total number of deaths to ~72 thousand. A 60 day lockdown can save countless
lives.

coherent with the context. This research field has achieved promising progress
by using neural image inpainting methods. Nevertheless, there is still a
critical challenge in guessing the missed content with only the context pixels.
The goal of this paper is to fill the semantic information in corrupted images
according to the provided descriptive text. Unique from existing text-guided
image generation works, the inpainting models are required to compare the
semantic content of the given text and the remaining part of the image, then
find out the semantic content that should be filled for missing part. To
fulfill such a task, we propose a novel inpainting model named Text-Guided Dual
Attention Inpainting Network (TDANet). Firstly, a dual multimodal attention
mechanism is designed to extract the explicit semantic information about the
corrupted regions, which is done by comparing the descriptive text and
complementary image areas through reciprocal attention. Secondly, an image-text
matching loss is applied to maximize the semantic similarity of the generated
image and the text. Experiments are conducted on two open datasets. Results
show that the proposed TDANet model reaches new state-of-the-art on both
quantitative and qualitative measures. Result analysis suggests that the
generated images are consistent with the guidance text, enabling the generation
of various results by providing different descriptions. Codes are available at

even in an unseen environment. We argue that this ability is largely due to
three main reasons: the incorporation of prior knowledge (or experience), the
adaptation of it to the new environment using the observed visual cues and most
importantly optimistically searching without giving up early. This is currently
missing in the state-of-the-art visual navigation methods based on
Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we propose to use externally
learned prior knowledge of the relative object locations and integrate it into
our model by constructing a neural graph. In order to efficiently incorporate
the graph without increasing the state-space complexity, we propose our
Graph-based Value Estimation (GVE) module. GVE provides a more accurate
baseline for estimating the Advantage function in actor-critic RL algorithm.
This results in reduced value estimation error and, consequently, convergence
to a more optimal policy. Through empirical studies, we show that our agent,
dubbed as the optimistic agent, has a more realistic estimate of the state
value during a navigation episode which leads to a higher success rate. Our
extensive ablation studies show the efficacy of our simple method which
achieves the state-of-the-art results measured by the conventional visual
navigation metrics, e.g. Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length

of samples. We also compare 3D CFs in real and redshift space. Results. The
dominant elements of the cosmic web are clusters and filaments, separated by
voids filling most of the volume. In individual 2D sheets, the positions of
clusters and filaments do not coincide. As a result, in projection, the
clusters and filaments fill in 2D voids. This leads to a decrease in the
amplitudes of CFs (and power spectra) in projection. For this reason, the
amplitudes of 2D CFs are lower than the amplitudes of 3D correlation functions:
the thicker the 2D sample, the greater the difference. Conclusions. Spatial CFs
of galaxies contain valuable information about the geometrical properties of
the cosmic web that cannot be found from projected CFs.

the Oberth effect in the theory of the rocket movement. The realizations of the

relativistic case similar to the well known Penrose process in the ergosphere
of the rotating black hole it is shown that the same situation as in ergosphere
of the black hole occurs in rotating coordinate system in Minkowski space-time
out of the static limit due to existence of negative energies. In relativistic
cases differently from the nonrelativistic ones the mass of the fragment can be
larger than the mass of the decaying body. Negative energies for particles are
possible in relativistic case in cosmology of the expanding space when the

that the healthy agent's behavior is characterized by a distinct correlation

learned representation of the healthy agent is characterized by a distinct

contributions. In the 1980s, a celebrated formal calculation by Caflisch and
Luke suggested that velocity fluctuations in dimension $d=3$ should diverge
with the size of the sedimentation tank, contradicting both intuition and
experimental observations. The role of long-range self-organization of
suspended particles in form of hyperuniformity was later put forward to explain
additional screening of this divergence in steady-state observations. In the
present contribution, we develop the first rigorous theory that allows to
justify all these formal calculations of the physics literature.

the study of the rapid evolution of flare plasma temperature, turbulence, mass

comparable spectral and time resolution, while subsequent solar cycles have
delivered far fewer and less intense flares. The BCS data archive thus offers
an unparalleled resource for flare studies. A recent re-assessment of the BCS
calibration and its operations is extended here by using data during a
spacecraft scan in the course of a flare on 1980 November~6 that highlights
small deformations in the crystal curvature of the important channel~1 (viewing
lines of \caxix\ and satellites). The results explain long-standing anomalies
in spectral line ratios which have been widely discussed in the past. We also
provide an in-flight estimation of the BCS collimator field of view which
improves the absolute intensity calibration of the BCS. The BCS channel~1
background is shown to be entirely due to solar continuum radiation, confirming
earlier analyses implying a time-variable flare abundance of Ca. We suggest

investigated analytically in two dimensions by means of a reduced fluid model

the classical ""cat's eyes"" solutions and the linear stability is studied by
analysing the second variation of a conserved functional, according to the
Energy-Casimir method. The stability analysis is carried out on the domain
bounded by the separatrices of the vortices. Two cases are considered,
corresponding to a ratio between perpendicular equilibrium ion and electron
temperature much greater or much less than unity, respectively. In the former
case, equilibrium flows depend on an arbitrary function. Stability is attained
if the equilibrium electron temperature anisotropy is bounded from above and
from below, with the lower bound corresponding to the condition preventing the
firehose instability. A further condition sets an upper limit to the amplitude
of the vortices, for a given choice of the equilibrium flow. For cold ions, two
sub-cases have to be considered. In the first one, equilibria correspond to
those for which the velocity field is proportional to the local Alfv\'en
velocity. Stability conditions imply: an upper limit on the amplitude of the
flow, which automatically implies firehose stability, an upper bound on the
electron temperature anisotropy and again an upper bound on the size of the
vortices. The second sub-case refers to equilibrium electrostatic potentials
which are not constant on magnetic flux surfaces and the resulting stability
conditions correspond to those of the first sub-case in the absence of flow.

  Memory",,,,,"cs.OS cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several emerging technologies for byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM)
have been considered to replace DRAM as the main memory in computer systems
during the last years. The disadvantage of a lower write endurance, compared to
DRAM, of NVM technologies like Phase-Change Memory (PCM) or Ferroelectric RAM
(FeRAM) has been addressed in the literature. As a solution, in-memory
wear-leveling techniques have been proposed, which aim to balance the
wear-level over all memory cells to achieve an increased memory lifetime.
Generally, to apply such advanced aging-aware wear-leveling techniques proposed
in the literature, additional special hardware is introduced into the memory
system to provide the necessary information about the cell age and thus enable
aging-aware wear-leveling decisions.
  This paper proposes software-only aging-aware wear-leveling based on common
CPU features and does not rely on any additional hardware support from the
memory subsystem. Specifically, we exploit the memory management unit (MMU),
performance counters, and interrupts to approximate the memory write counts as
an aging indicator. Although the software-only approach may lead to slightly
worse wear-leveling, it is applicable on commonly available hardware. We
achieve page-level coarse-grained wear-leveling by approximating the current
cell age through statistical sampling and performing physical memory remapping
through the MMU. This method results in non-uniform memory usage patterns
within a memory page. Hence, we further propose a fine-grained wear-leveling in
the stack region of C / C++ compiled software.
  By applying both wear-leveling techniques, we achieve up to $78.43\%$ of the
ideal memory lifetime, which is a lifetime improvement of more than a factor of
$900$ compared to the lifetime without any wear-leveling.

We calculate the stellar density using star counts obtained from Gaia
DR2 up to a Galactocentric distance R=20 kpc with a deconvolution technique for
the parallax errors. Then we analyse the density in order to study the
structure of the outer Galactic disc, mainly the warp.
  METHODS. In order to carry out the deconvolution, we used the Lucy inversion
technique for recovering the corrected star counts. We also used the Gaia
luminosity function of stars with $M_G<10$ to extract the stellar density from
the star counts.
  RESULTS. The stellar density maps can be fitted by an exponential disc in the
radial direction $h_r=2.07\pm0.07$ kpc, with a weak dependence on the azimuth,
extended up to 20 kpc without any cut-off. The flare and warp are clearly
visible. The best fit of a symmetrical S-shaped warp gives $z_w= z_\odot+(37\pm
4.2(stat.)-0.91(syst.))$ pc $(R/R_\odot )^{2.42\pm 0.76(stat.) + 0.129 (syst.)}
sin(\phi+9.3\pm 7.37 (stat.) +4.48 (syst.))$ for the whole population. When we
analyse the northern and southern warps separately, we obtain an asymmetry of
an $\sim25\%$ larger amplitude in the north. This result may be influenced by
extinction because the Gaia G band is quite prone to extinction biases.
However, we tested the accuracy of the extinction map we used, which shows that
the extinction is determined very well in the outer disc. Nevertheless, we
recall that we do not know the full extinction error, and neither do we know
the systematic error of the map, which may influence the final result.
  The analysis was also carried out for very luminous stars alone ($M_G<-2$),
which on average represents a younger population. We obtain similar
scale-length values, while the maximum amplitude of the warp is $20-30\%$
larger than with the whole population. The north-south asymmetry is maintained.

and computer vision. Deep neural networks have seen the surge of successful
methods in natural image matting in recent years. In contrast to traditional
propagation-based matting methods, some top-tier deep image matting approaches
tend to perform propagation in the neural network implicitly. A novel structure
for more direct alpha matte propagation between pixels is in demand. To this
end, this paper presents a hierarchical opacity propagation (HOP) matting
method, where the opacity information is propagated in the neighborhood of each
point at different semantic levels. The hierarchical structure is based on one
global and multiple local propagation blocks. With the HOP structure, every
feature point pair in high-resolution feature maps will be connected based on
the appearance of input image. We further propose a scale-insensitive
positional encoding tailored for image matting to deal with the unfixed size of

that thermal fluctuations prefer the same three phases as well. Moreover, we
find that exotic topological phase transitions driven by the binding-unbinding

pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential
of this intervention is not well understood. We develop a compartmental model
for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general,
asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious.
Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of
New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively
ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of
COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use
decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the
product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts
blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the
impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear,
indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Masks
are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy
persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption
scenarios suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately
(50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths
over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by
34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Our results suggest use of
face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing
community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide
benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with
other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when
adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.

one-step ADER Discontinuous Galerkin method for the simulation of linear
seismic waves in the sea bottom that are generated by the propagation of free
surface water waves. A hyperbolic reformulation of the Serre-Green-Naghdi model
for nonlinear dispersive free surface flows is coupled with a first order
velocity-stress formulation for linear elastic wave propagation in the sea
bottom. Cartesian non-conforming meshes are defined and the coupling is
achieved by an appropriate time-dependent pressure boundary condition in the
three-dimensional domain for the elastic wave propagation, where the pressure
is a combination of hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic pressure in the water
column above the sea bottom. The use of a first order hyperbolic reformulation
of the nonlinear dispersive free surface flow model leads to a straightforward
coupling with the linear seismic wave equations, which are also written in
first order hyperbolic form. It furthermore allows the use of explicit time
integrators with a rather generous CFL-type time step restriction associated
with the dispersive water waves, compared to numerical schemes applied to
classical dispersive models. Since the two systems employed are written in the
same form of a first order hyperbolic system they can also be efficiently
solved in a unique numerical framework. We choose the family of arbitrary high
order accurate discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes. The developed
methodology is carefully assessed by first considering several benchmarks for
each system separately showing a good agreement with exact and numerical
reference solutions. Finally, also coupled test cases are addressed. Throughout
this paper we assume the elastic deformations in the solid to be sufficiently
small so that their influence on the free surface water waves can be neglected.

structured parallelism is also exploited using tasks to leverage the full
benefits of a pure data-flow execution model. However, task creation and

efficient exploitation of fine-grained structured parallelism, especially on

subject to exogenous disturbances and polyhedral constraints on the state and
input trajectories. The underlying system is composed of a finite collection of
dynamically coupled subsystems, where each subsystem is assumed to have a
dedicated local controller. The decentralization of information is expressed
according to sparsity constraints on the state measurements that each local
controller has access to. In this context, we investigate the design of
decentralized controllers that are affinely parameterized in their measurement
history. For problems with partially nested information structures, the
optimization over such policy spaces is known to be convex. Convexity is not,
however, guaranteed under more general (nonclassical) information structures in
which the information available to one local controller can be affected by
control actions that it cannot access or reconstruct. With the aim of
alleviating the nonconvexity that arises in such problems, we propose an
approach to decentralized control design where the information-coupling states
are effectively treated as disturbances whose trajectories are constrained to
take values in ellipsoidal contract sets whose location, scale, and orientation
are jointly optimized with the underlying affine decentralized control policy.
We establish a natural structural condition on the space of allowable contracts
that facilitates the joint optimization over the control policy and the
contract set via semidefinite programming.

This problem is especially critical in a manufacturing setting where smart
factories rely on machine learning for product quality control by analyzing
industrial images. Such images are typically large and may only need to be
partially analyzed where only a small portion is problematic (e.g., identifying
defects on a surface). Since manual labeling these images is expensive, weak
supervision is an attractive alternative where the idea is to generate weak
labels that are not perfect, but can be produced at scale. Data programming is
a recent paradigm in this category where it uses human knowledge in the form of
labeling functions and combines them into a generative model. Data programming
has been successful in applications based on text or structured data and can
also be applied to images usually if one can find a way to convert them into
structured data. In this work, we expand the horizon of data programming by
directly applying it to images without this conversion, which is a common
scenario for industrial applications. We propose Inspector Gadget, an image
labeling system that combines crowdsourcing, data augmentation, and data
programming to produce weak labels at scale for image classification. We

are not designed to detect local optima and do not have any obvious benefit to
cross large Hamming gaps.
  We suggest a mechanism called stagnation detection that can be added as a

self-adjusting algorithms). Added to a simple (1+1) EA, we prove an expected
runtime on the well-known Jump benchmark that corresponds to an asymptotically
optimal parameter setting and outperforms other mechanisms for multimodal
optimization like heavy-tailed mutation. We also investigate the module in the

previous benefits of this algorithm on unimodal problems with more efficient
multimodal optimization.

example where both self-adjusting mechanisms, including stagnation detection,
do not help to find a beneficial setting of the mutation rate. Finally, we

adversarial learning methods have been proposed to learn the reward function
together with the dialogue policy. However, to alternatively update the
dialogue policy and the reward model on the fly, we are limited to
policy-gradient-based algorithms, such as REINFORCE and PPO. Moreover, the
alternating training of a dialogue agent and the reward model can easily get
stuck in local optima or result in mode collapse. To overcome the listed
issues, we propose to decompose the adversarial training into two steps. First,
we train the discriminator with an auxiliary dialogue generator and then
incorporate a derived reward model into a common RL method to guide the

the proposed method: (1) achieves a remarkable task success rate using both

in the field of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) in brain MRI. The main
principle behind these works is to learn a model of normal anatomy by learning
to compress and recover healthy data. This allows to spot abnormal structures
from erroneous recoveries of compressed, potentially anomalous samples. The
concept is of great interest to the medical image analysis community as it i)
relieves from the need of vast amounts of manually segmented training data---a
necessity for and pitfall of current supervised Deep Learning---and ii)
theoretically allows to detect arbitrary, even rare pathologies which
supervised approaches might fail to find. To date, the experimental design of
most works hinders a valid comparison, because i) they are evaluated against
different datasets and different pathologies, ii) use different image
resolutions and iii) different model architectures with varying complexity. The
intent of this work is to establish comparability among recent methods by
utilizing a single architecture, a single resolution and the same dataset(s).
Besides providing a ranking of the methods, we also try to answer questions
like i) how many healthy training subjects are needed to model normality and
ii) if the reviewed approaches are also sensitive to domain shift. Further, we
identify open challenges and provide suggestions for future community efforts
and research directions.

traditionally focused on shock-dominated, magnetized plasma dynamics described

applications covering any-dimensional scalar to system PDEs, with e.g.
Korteweg-de Vries solutions generalizing early findings on soliton behaviour,
shallow water applications in round or square pools, hydrodynamic convergence
tests as well as challenging computational fluid and plasma dynamics
applications. The recent addition of a parallel multigrid solver opens up new
avenues where also elliptic constraints or stiff source terms play a central
role. This is illustrated here by solving several multi-dimensional
reaction-diffusion-type equations. We document the minimal requirements for
adding a new physics module governed by any nonlinear PDE system, such that it
can directly benefit from the code flexibility in combining various temporal

paradigm and is defined through FaaS platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda) executing
event-triggered code snippets (i.e., functions). Many studies that empirically
evaluate the performance of such FaaS platforms have started to appear but we
are currently lacking a comprehensive understanding of the overall domain. To
address this gap, we conducted a multivocal literature review (MLR) covering
112 studies from academic (51) and grey (61) literature. We find that existing
work mainly studies the AWS Lambda platform and focuses on micro-benchmarks
using simple functions to measure CPU speed and FaaS platform overhead (i.e.,
container cold starts). Further, we discover a mismatch between academic and
industrial sources on tested platform configurations, find that function
triggers remain insufficiently studied, and identify HTTP API gateways and
cloud storages as the most used external service integrations. Following
existing guidelines on experimentation in cloud systems, we discover many flaws
threatening the reproducibility of experiments presented in the surveyed
studies. We conclude with a discussion of gaps in literature and highlight
methodological suggestions that may serve to improve future FaaS performance
evaluation studies.

grid-modelling approach to derive some basic physical characteristics of both
stellar components in WR 147. For the currently accepted distance of 630 pc to
WR 147, the values of mass-loss rate derived from modelling its optical spectra
are in acceptable correspondence with that from modelling its X-ray emission.
However, they give a lower radio flux than observed. A plausible solution for
this problem could be if the volume filling factor at large distances from the
star (radio-formation region) is smaller than close to the star
(optical-formation region). Adopting this, the model can match well both
optical and thermal radio emission from WR 147. The global view on the
colliding-wind binary WR 147 thus shows that its observational properties in
different spectral domains can be explained in a self-consistent physical
picture.

cyclo[$18$]carbon molecule with atomic and molecular hydrogen at impact energy,
$E$, in the range of 0.5-25 eV. We utilize the density-functional tight-binding
method to perform molecular dynamics simulations to emulate the interaction of
a carbon ring when colliding with atomic or molecular hydrogen. From our
results, the formation of the C$_{18}$H molecules is likely to occur upon
irradiating by H atoms at $E < 10$ eV and by H$_2$ molecules at $2 < E < 15$ eV
center of mass energy. Formation of C$_{18}$H$_2$ molecules is only observed at
around $E = 2$ eV. Our results show that the absorption of hydrogen is more
prone in atomic than in molecular hydrogen atmosphere. Thus, we find that the
probability of physio-absorption reaches up to 80 \% for atomic projectiles
with $E < 5$ eV but only up to 10 \% for the molecular ones. Our analysis shows
that the deformation of the carbon ring due to the hydrogen bonding produces
transition from $sp$ to $sp^2$ hybridization. The angle between the carbon
atoms at the locations near to the H bond in the resulting ring is not 120$^o$
but instead 110$^o$ degrees. No molecular fragmentation of the C$_{18}$ ring is
observed.

textured MgO tunnel barrier is fabricated by two different techniques:
sputtering and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The maximal spin injection
efficiency is comparable for both methods. Additionally, the effect of
annealing is also investigated for the two types of samples. Both samples show
the same trend: an increase of the electroluminescence circular polarization
(Pc) with the increase of annealing temperature, followed by a saturation of Pc
beyond 350{\deg}C annealing. Since the increase of Pc starts well below the
crystallization temperature of the full CoFeB bulk layer, this trend could be
mainly due to an improvement of chemical structure at the top CoFeB/MgO
interface. This study reveals that the control of CoFeB/MgO interface is
essential important for an optimal spin injection into semiconductor.

In this work we focus on evasion attacks, where a model is trained in a safe

minimal perturbation of a test instance that changes the model outcome.
  We propose a model-agnostic strategy that builds a robust ensemble by
training its basic models on feature-based partitions of the given dataset. Our
algorithm guarantees that the majority of the models in the ensemble cannot be

tree ensembles, and we also propose an approximate certification method for

studies of palmprint recognition are mainly based on constrained datasets
collected by dedicated devices in controlled environments, which has to reduce
the flexibility and convenience. In addition, general deep palmprint
recognition algorithms are often too heavy to meet the real-time requirements
of embedded system. In this paper, a new palmprint benchmark is established,
which consists of more than 20,000 images collected by 5 brands of smart phones
in an unconstrained manner. Each image has been manually labeled with 14 key
points for region of interest (ROI) extraction. Further, the approach called
Deep Distillation Hashing (DDH) is proposed as benchmark for efficient deep
palmprint recognition. Palmprint images are converted to binary codes to
improve the efficiency of feature matching. Derived from knowledge
distillation, novel distillation loss functions are constructed to compress
deep model to further improve the efficiency of feature extraction on light
network. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both constrained and
unconstrained palmprint databases. Using DDH, the accuracy of palmprint
identification can be increased by up to 11.37%, and the Equal Error Rate (EER)

the feasibility of our database, and DDH can outperform other baselines to

However, many studies have recently reported deviations from isotropy with a
definitive conclusion yet to be made. New, independent methods to robustly test
the cosmic isotropy are of crucial importance. In this work, we investigate the
directional behavior of the X-ray luminosity-temperature ($L_X-T$) relation of
galaxy clusters. A tight correlation exists between the luminosity and
temperature of the X-ray-emitting intracluster medium. While the measured
luminosity depends on the underlying cosmology, the temperature can be
determined without any cosmological assumptions. By exploiting this property
one can effectively test the isotropy of cosmological parameters over the full
extragalactic sky. Here, we used 313 homogeneously selected X-ray galaxy
clusters from the MCXC catalog and obtained core-excised temperatures for all
of them. We find that the behavior of the $L_X-T$ relation heavily depends on
the direction of the sky. Strong anisotropies are detected at a $\sim 4\sigma$
level toward $(l,b)\sim (280^{\circ}, -20^{\circ})$. Several X-ray and
cluster-related effects that could potentially explain these anisotropies were
examined, but none did so. Interestingly, two other available cluster samples
appear to have a similar behavior throughout the sky, while being fully
independent of each other and our sample. Performing a joint analysis of the
three samples, the final anisotropy is further intensified ($\sim 5\sigma$),
toward $(l,b)\sim (303^{\circ}, -27^{\circ})$, which is in good agreement with
other cosmological probes. This result demonstrates that X-ray galaxy cluster
studies that assume perfect isotropy can produce strongly biased results
whether the underlying reason is cosmological or related to X-rays. The
identification of the exact nature of these anisotropies is therefore crucial.

This study shows that RLF increases for increasing full width half maximum

reason, we compared bolometric luminosity of RL and RQ quasars sample which
have FWHM of H$\beta$ broad emission line greater than 15000km/s (High Broad

an efficient removal of pump photons from the probe beam, to achieve a good

remains well below 500 fs. We demonstrate the practical applicability of this

their structural and electronic properties. For this purpose, we adopt a
specific scheme of structural relaxation which allows us to distinguish between
the energy cost of distorting each layer and the gain in stacking them
together. In most cases we find that the BP tends to contract along the softer
armchair direction, as already reported for similar structures. This
contraction can attain up to 5\% of strain, which might deteriorate its very
good transport properties along the armchair direction. To prevent this, we
propose a twisted-bilayer configuration where the largest part of the stress
applies on the zigzag axis, resulting in a lower impact on the transport
properties of BP. We also investigated a \Pblue/hBN bilayer. A peculiar
hybridization between the valence states of the two layers lets us suggest that
electron-hole pairs excited in the bilayer will exhibit a mixed character, with
electrons localized solely in the \Pblue{ }layer, and holes spread onto the two

system and assume that we have access to safe trajectories generated by an

then propose and analyze an optimization-based approach to learning a CBF that
enjoys provable safety guarantees under suitable Lipschitz smoothness
assumptions on the underlying dynamical system. A strength of our approach is
that it is agnostic to the parameterization used to represent the CBF, assuming
only that the Lipschitz constant of such functions can be efficiently bounded.
Furthermore, if the CBF parameterization is convex, then under mild
assumptions, so is our learning process. We end with extensive numerical
evaluations of our results on both planar and realistic examples, using both
random feature and deep neural network parameterizations of the CBF. To the
best of our knowledge, these are the first results that learn provably safe

nascent protein. It remains difficult, however, to predict which proteins
cotranslationally fold. Here, we simulate evolution of model proteins to
investigate how native structure influences evolution of cotranslational
folding. We developed a model that connects protein folding during and after
translation to cellular fitness. Model proteins evolved improved folding speed
and stability, with proteins adopting one of two strategies for folding
quickly. Low contact order proteins evolve to fold cotranslationally. Such
proteins adopt native conformations early on during the translation process,
with each subsequently translated residue establishing additional native
contacts. On the other hand, high contact order proteins tend not to be stable
in their native conformations until the full chain is nearly extruded. We also
simulated evolution of slowly translating codons, finding that slower
translation speeds at certain positions enhances cotranslational folding.
Finally, we investigated real protein structures using a previously published
dataset that identified evolutionarily conserved rare codons in E. coli genes
and associated such codons with cotranslational folding intermediates. We found
that protein substructures preceding conserved rare codons tend to have lower
contact orders, in line with our finding that lower contact order proteins are
more likely to fold cotranslationally. Our work shows how evolutionary
selection pressure can cause proteins with local contact topologies to evolve

instability provides new opportunities for exploring the competition mechanism

that study, two orthogonal quadratures of cavity field are coupled to two
different Zeeman states of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we
propose a novel scheme to couple two density-wave degrees of freedom of a BEC
to two quadratures of the cavity field. Being drastically different from
previous studies, the light-matter quadratures coupling in our model is endowed
with a tunable coupling angle. Apart from the uniform and self-organized
phases, we unravel a dynamically unstable state induced by the cavity
dissipation. Interestingly, the dissipation defines a particular coupling
angle, across which the instabilities disappear. Moreover, at this critical
coupling angle, one of the two atomic density waves can be independently
excited without affecting one another. It is also found that our system can be
mapped into a reduced three-level model under the commonly used
low-excitation-mode approximation. However, the effectiveness of this
approximation is shown to be broken by the dissipation nature for some special
system parameters, hinting that the low-excitation-mode approximation is
insufficient in capturing some dissipation-sensitive physics. Our work enriches
the quantum simulation toolbox in the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics system and
broadens the frontiers of light-matter interaction.

estimates for the weak-type $(1,1)$ inequality for the Riesz tranforms it
suffices to study the corresponding weak-type inequality for Riesz transforms
applied to a finite linear combination of Dirac masses. We use this fact to
give a new proof of the best known dimensional upper bound, while our reduction

  phases of the disease",,,,,"q-bio.PE stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One major bottleneck in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the limited number
of critical care beds. Due to the dynamic development of infections and the
time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them
enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can
easily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we
suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2)
allows for making predictions depending on different future growth of
infections. We have evaluated our model for three regions, namely Berlin
(Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment
measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model
parameters. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and an
average stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy
and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3
days) and the average stay (4 and 8 days) in ICU shorter. The region-specific
models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued
exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. Thus, the
model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our
predictions are based on small data sets and disregard non-stationary dynamics,
our model is simple, robust, and can be used in early phases of the disease
when data are scarce.

for maximum-likelihood decoding and minimum distance computation for binary
linear codes. Two aspects in particular have been demonstrated to improve the
performance of IP solvers as well as adaptive linear programming decoders: the
dynamic generation of forbidden-set (FS) inequalities, a family of valid
cutting planes, and the utilization of so-called redundant parity-checks
(RPCs). However, to date, it had remained unclear how to solve the exact RPC
separation problem (i.e., to determine whether or not there exists any violated
FS inequality w.r.t. any known or unknown parity-check). In this note, we prove
NP-hardness of this problem. Moreover, we formulate an IP model that combines
the search for most violated FS cuts with the generation of RPCs, and report on
computational experiments. Empirically, for various instances of the minimum
distance problem, it turns out that while utilizing the exact separation IP
does not appear to provide a computational advantage, it can apparently be
avoided altogether by combining heuristics to generate RPC-based cuts.

modern data analysis. Especially when combined with other difficulty factors,
such as the presence of noise, overlapping class distributions, and small
disjuncts, data imbalance can significantly impact the classification
performance. Furthermore, some of the data difficulty factors are known to
affect the performance of the existing oversampling strategies, in particular
SMOTE and its derivatives. This effect is especially pronounced in the
multi-class setting, in which the mutual imbalance relationships between the
classes complicate even further. Despite that, most of the contemporary
research in the area of data imbalance focuses on the binary classification
problems, while their more difficult multi-class counterparts are relatively
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel oversampling technique, a
Multi-Class Combined Cleaning and Resampling (MC-CCR) algorithm. The proposed
method utilizes an energy-based approach to modeling the regions suitable for
oversampling, less affected by small disjuncts and outliers than SMOTE. It
combines it with a simultaneous cleaning operation, the aim of which is to
reduce the effect of overlapping class distributions on the performance of the
learning algorithms. Finally, by incorporating a dedicated strategy of handling
the multi-class problems, MC-CCR is less affected by the loss of information
about the inter-class relationships than the traditional multi-class
decomposition strategies. Based on the results of experimental research carried
out for many multi-class imbalanced benchmark datasets, the high robust of the
proposed approach to noise was shown, as well as its high quality compared to

of the decision as to whether a post is subject to criminal law into an NLP
task. Comparing existing regulatory regimes for hate speech, we base our
investigation on the European Union's framework as it provides a widely
applicable legal minimum standard. Accurately judging whether a post is
punishable or not usually requires legal training. We show that, by breaking
the legal assessment down into a series of simpler sub-decisions, even
laypersons can annotate consistently. Based on a newly annotated dataset, our
experiments show that directly learning an automated model of punishable
content is challenging. However, learning the two sub-tasks of `target group'
and `targeting conduct' instead of an end-to-end approach to punishability
yields better results. Overall, our method also provides decisions that are
more transparent than those of end-to-end models, which is a crucial point in
legal decision-making.

crystalline silicon in potassium hydroxide (KOH) allows a range of shapes
formed and has significant impacts on MEMS (microelectromechanical systems),
AFM (atomic force microscopy), and microfluidics. Here, a crystal direction
dependent dry etching principle in an inductively-coupled plasma reactive ion
etcher is presented, which allows to selectively reveal desired crystal planes
in monocrystalline diamond by controlling the etching conditions. The principle
is demonstrated when the kinetic energy of incident ions on diamond surfaces is
reduced below a certain threshold leading to anisotropic etching and faceting
along specific crystal planes. Using the principle, monolithic diamond
nanopillars for magnetometry using nitrogen vacancy centers are fabricated. In
these nanopillars, a half-tapering angle up to 21{\deg} is achieved, the
highest angle reported, which leads to a high photon efficiency and high
mechanical strength of the nanopillar. These results represent the first
demonstration of crystallographic orientation dependent reactive ion etch
principle, which opens a new window for shaping specific nanostructures which
is at the heart of nanotechnology. It is believed that this principle will
prove to be valuable for structuring and patterning of other single crystal

(SWIPT) systems employing practical non-linear energy harvester (EH) circuits.
Since the voltage across the reactive elements of realistic EH circuits cannot
drop or rise instantaneously, EHs have memory which we model with a Markov
decision process (MDP). Moreover, since an analytical model that accurately
models all non-linear effects and the unavoidable impedance mismatch of EHs is
not tractable, we propose a learning based model for the EH circuit. We
optimize the input signal distribution for maximization of the harvested power
under a constraint on the minimum mutual information between transmitter (TX)
and information receiver (IR). We distinguish the cases where the MDP state is
known and not known at TX and IR. When the MDP state is known, the formulated
optimization problem for the harvested power is convex. In contrast, if TX and
IR do not know the MDP state, the resulting optimization problem is non-convex
and solved via alternating optimization, which is shown to yield a limit point
of the problem. Our simulation results reveal that the rate-power region of the
considered SWIPT system depends on the symbol duration, the EH input power
level, the EH impedance mismatch, and the type of EH circuit. In particular, a
shorter symbol duration enables higher bit rates at the expense of a
significant decrease in the average harvested power. Furthermore, whereas
half-wave rectifiers outperform full-wave rectifiers in the low and medium
input power regimes, full-wave rectifiers are preferable if the input power at
the EH is high.

owing to the (almost) infinite domain; (2) heterogeneity problem, different
tuples may not fit the same (regression) model. In this study, enlightened by
the conditional dependencies that hold conditionally over certain tuples rather
than the whole relation, we propose to learn a regression model individually
for each complete tuple together with its neighbors. Our IIM, Imputation via
Individual Models, thus no longer relies on sharing similar values among the k
complete neighbors for imputation, but utilizes their regression results by the
aforesaid learned individual (not necessary the same) models. Remarkably, we
show that some existing methods are indeed special cases of our IIM, under the
extreme settings of the number l of learning neighbors considered in individual
learning. In this sense, a proper number l of neighbors is essential to learn
the individual models (avoid over-fitting or under-fitting). We propose to
adaptively learn individual models over various number l of neighbors for
different complete tuples. By devising efficient incremental computation, the
time complexity of learning a model reduces from linear to constant.
Experiments on real data demonstrate that our IIM with adaptive learning

fail-safe distributions of fluid viscous dampers for seismic retrofitting.
Failure is modeled as either complete damage of the dampers or partial
degradation of the dampers' properties. In general, this leads to optimization
problems with large number of constraints. Thus, the use of a working-set
optimization algorithm is proposed. The main idea is to solve a sequence of
relaxed optimization sub-problems with a small sub-set of all constraints. The
algorithm terminates once a solution of a sub-problem is found that satisfies
all the constraints of the problem. The retrofitting cost is minimized with
constraints on the inter-story drifts at the peripheries of frame structures.
The structures considered are subjected to a realistic ensemble of ground
motions, and their response is evaluated with time-history analyses. The
transient optimization problem is efficiently solved with a gradient-based
sequential linear programming algorithm. The gradients of the response
functions are calculated with a consistent adjoint sensitivity analysis
procedure. Promising results attained for 3-D irregular frames are presented
and discussed. The numerical results highlight the fact that the optimized

in equities and a large chunk of the foreign exchange market. In spite of the
availability of data from multiple markets, current approaches in trading rely
mainly on learning trading strategies per individual market. In this paper, we
take a step towards developing fully end-to-end global trading strategies that
leverage systematic trends to produce superior market-specific trading
strategies. We introduce QuantNet: an architecture that learns market-agnostic
trends and use these to learn superior market-specific trading strategies. Each
market-specific model is composed of an encoder-decoder pair. The encoder
transforms market-specific data into an abstract latent representation that is
processed by a global model shared by all markets, while the decoder learns a
market-specific trading strategy based on both local and global information
from the market-specific encoder and the global model. QuantNet uses recent
advances in transfer and meta-learning, where market-specific parameters are
free to specialize on the problem at hand, whilst market-agnostic parameters
are driven to capture signals from all markets. By integrating over
idiosyncratic market data we can learn general transferable dynamics, avoiding
the problem of overfitting to produce strategies with superior returns. We
evaluate QuantNet on historical data across 3103 assets in 58 global equity
markets. Against the top performing baseline, QuantNet yielded 51% higher
Sharpe and 69% Calmar ratios. In addition we show the benefits of our approach
over the non-transfer learning variant, with improvements of 15% and 41% in
Sharpe and Calmar ratios. Code available in appendix.

populations (i.e., ions with energies of a few times the solar wind energy).
Here, we present results from a series of three-dimensional hybrid simulations
of collisionless shocks in the solar wind. We focus on the influence of the
shock-normal angle, $\theta_{Bn}$, and the shock speed, $V_s$, on producing
protons with energies a few to hundreds of times the thermal energy of the
upstream plasma. The combined effects of $\theta_{Bn}$ and $V_s$ result in
shocks with Alfv\'en Mach numbers in the range 3.0 to 6.0 and fast magnetosonic
Mach numbers in the range 2.5 to 5.0, representing moderate to strong
interplanetary shocks. We find that $\theta_{Bn}$ largely organizes the shape
of proton energy spectra while shock speed controls acceleration efficiency.
All shocks accelerate protons at the shock front but the spectral evolution
depends on $\theta_{Bn}$. Shocks with $\theta_{Bn} \geq 60^\circ$ produce
isolated bursts of suprathermal protons at the shock front while shocks with
$\theta_{Bn} \leq 45^\circ$ create suprathermal beams upstream of the shock.
Downstream proton energy spectra have exponential or smoothed broken power-law
forms when $\theta_{Bn} \geq 45^\circ$, and a single power-law form when
$\theta_{Bn} \leq 30^\circ$. Protons downstream of the strongest shocks have
energies at least 100 times the upstream thermal energy, with $\theta_{Bn} \leq
30^\circ$ shocks producing the highest energy protons and $\theta_{Bn} \geq

sulphuretted molecules are not as abundant as expected in the interstellar
medium, and the identity of the main sulphur reservoir is still an open
question. Our goal is to investigate the H$_{2}$S chemistry in dark clouds, as
this stable molecule is a potential sulphur reservoir. Using millimeter
observations of CS, SO, H$_{2}$S, and their isotopologues, we determine the
physical conditions and H$_{2}$S abundances along the cores TMC 1-C, TMC 1-CP,
and Barnard 1b. The gas-grain model Nautilus is then used to model the sulphur
chemistry and explore the impact of photo-desorption and chemical desorption on
the H$_2$S abundance. Our model shows that chemical desorption is the main
source of gas-phase H$_2$S in dark cores. The measured H$_{2}$S abundance can
only be fitted if we assume that the chemical desorption rate decreases by more
than a factor of 10 when $n_{\rm H}>2\times10^{4}$. This change in the
desorption rate is consistent with the formation of thick H$_2$O and CO ice
mantles on grain surfaces. The observed SO and H$_2$S abundances are in good
agreement with our predictions adopting an undepleted value of the sulphur
abundance. However, the CS abundance is overestimated by a factor of $5-10$.
Along the three cores, atomic S is predicted to be the main sulphur reservoir.
We conclude that the gaseous H$_2$S abundance is well reproduced, assuming
undepleted sulphur abundance and chemical desorption as the main source of
H$_2$S. The behavior of the observed H$_{2}$S abundance suggests a changing
desorption efficiency, which would probe the snowline in these cores. Our
model, however, overestimates the observed gas-phase CS abundance. Given the
uncertainty in the sulphur chemistry, our data are consistent with a cosmic
elemental S abundance with an uncertainty of a factor of 10.

graph databases. Query languages for RDF databases usually include primitives
to support path queries, linking pairs of vertices of the graph that are
connected by a path of labels belonging to a given language. Languages such as
SPARQL include support for paths defined by regular languages (by means of
Regular Expressions). A context-free path query is a path query whose language
can be defined by a context-free grammar. Context-free path queries can be used
to implement queries such as the ""same generation queries"", that are not
expressible by Regular Expressions. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm
for context-free path query processing. We prove the correctness of our
approach and show its run-time and memory complexity. We show the viability of
our approach by means of a prototype implemented in Go. We run our prototype
using the same cases of study as proposed in recent works, comparing our
results with another, recently published algorithm. The experiments include
both synthetic and real RDF databases. Our algorithm can be seen as a step
forward, towards the implementation of more expressive query languages.

show direct evidence of the highly anisotropic transport of polaritons in a

harmful to all. More specifically, we found that a social dilemma emerges in
the vicinity of the transition to the congested traffic if the probability of
random deceleration is low, which can also happen in more realistic single-lane

deceleration when the overtaking car returns to its lane. We analyze how the

several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic

data analytics has led to a proliferation of data management and analysis
systems. Typically, these systems are built around highly specialized
monolithic operators optimized for the underlying hardware. While effective in
the short term, such an approach makes the operators cumbersome to port and
adapt, which is increasingly required due to the speed at which algorithms and
hardware evolve. To address this limitation, we present Modularis, an execution
layer for data analytics based on sub-operators, i.e.,composable building
blocks resembling traditional database operators but at a finer granularity. To
demonstrate the advantages of our approach, we use Modularis to build a
distributed query processing system supporting relational queries running on an
RDMA cluster, a serverless cloud platform, and a smart storage engine.
Modularis requires minimal code changes to execute queries across these three
diverse hardware platforms, showing that the sub-operator approach reduces the
amount and complexity of the code. In fact, changes in the platform affect only
sub-operators that depend on the underlying hardware. We show the end-to-end
performance of Modularis by comparing it with a framework for SQL processing
(Presto), a commercial cluster database (SingleStore), as well as
Query-as-a-Service systems (Athena, BigQuery). Modularis outperforms all these
systems, proving that the design and architectural advantages of a modular
design can be achieved without degrading performance. We also compare Modularis
with a hand-optimized implementation of a join for RDMA clusters. We show that
Modularis has the advantage of being easily extensible to a wider range of join
variants and group by queries, all of which are not supported in the hand-tuned
join.

achieve a comb-like spectrum of equally spaced modes even when a perfect

up to 8 modes with very high quality factor and diffraction limited volumes can
be engineered in the bichromatic-type potential of a two-dimensional photonic
crystal cavity fabricated in a thin silicon membrane. To cope with the tight
tolerance in terms of frequency spacings and resonance linewidths, we develop a
permanent post-processing technique that allows the selective tuning of

a typical size that results from self-gravity assisted planetesimal formation,
is often thought to be inefficient. Many models therefore use small km-sized
planetesimals, or invoke the accretion of pebbles. Furthermore, models based on
planetesimal accretion often use the ad hoc assumption of planetesimals
distributed radially in a minimum mass solar nebula fashion. We wish to
investigate the impact of various initial radial density distributions in
planetesimals with a dynamical model for the formation of planetesimals on the
resulting population of planets. In doing so, we highlight the directive role
of the early stages of dust evolution into pebbles and planetesimals in the
circumstellar disk on the following planetary formation. We have implemented a
two population model for solid evolution and a pebble flux regulated model for
planetesimal formation into our global model for planet population synthesis.
This framework is used to study the global effect of planetesimal formation on
planet formation. As reference, we compare our dynamically formed planetesimal
surface densities with ad-hoc set distributions of different radial density
slopes of planetesimals. Even though required, it is not solely the total
planetesimal disk mass, but the planetesimal surface density slope and
subsequently the formation mechanism of planetesimals, that enables planetary
growth via planetesimal accretion. Highly condensed regions of only 100 km
sized planetesimals in the inner regions of circumstellar disks can lead to gas
giant growth. Pebble flux regulated planetesimal formation strongly boosts
planet formation, because it is a highly effective mechanism to create a steep
planetesimal density profile. We find this to lead to the formation of giant
planets inside 1 au by 100 km already by pure planetesimal accretion.

namely, whether quantum chaotic systems can exhibit sensitivity to initial
conditions, in a form that directly generalizes the notion of classical chaos
in phase space. We develop a linear response theory for complexity, and
demonstrate that the complexity can exhibit exponential sensitivity in response
to perturbations of initial conditions for chaotic systems. Two immediate
significant results follows: i) the complexity linear response matrix gives
rise to a spectrum that fully recovers the Lyapunov exponents in the classical
limit, and ii) the linear response of complexity is given by the out-of-time

that correlation lengths can be obtained by decimation - thinning a

the data becomes incompressible. The correlation length and its critical
exponents are thus accessible with no a-priori knowledge of an order parameter

agrees well with that computed from the decay of two-point correlation
functions $g_{2}(r)$ when they exist. But the CID reveals the correlation

by ""cloaking"" the data with a Rudin-Shapiro sequence.

and has been used to improve the performance of machine translation and
abstractive text summarization. Different from neural machine translation, in
the task of text summarization, salience estimation for words, phrases or
sentences is a critical component, since the output summary is a distillation
of the input text. Although the typical attention mechanism can conduct text
fragment selection from the input text conditioned on the decoder states, there
is still a gap to conduct direct and effective salience detection. To bring
back direct salience estimation for summarization with neural networks, we
propose a Multi-Attention Learning framework which contains two new attention
learning components for salience estimation: supervised attention learning and
unsupervised attention learning. We regard the attention weights as the
salience information, which means that the semantic units with large attention
value will be more important. The context information obtained based on the
estimated salience is incorporated with the typical attention mechanism in the
decoder to conduct summary generation. Extensive experiments on some benchmark
datasets in different languages demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework for the task of abstractive summarization.

final layer as a coarse prediction to refine and generate finer density maps in
a progressive fashion using residual learning. Additionally, the residual
learning is guided by an uncertainty-based confidence weighting mechanism that
permits the flow of only high-confidence residuals in the refinement path. The

quantum correlations. However, an explicit counterexample shows that a new

can exactly reconstruct rotationally symmetric quantum probabilities typical of
two-electron singlet states. Observable probabilities are consistent with the
usual arithmetic employed by macroscopic observers, but counterfactual aspects
of Bell's theorem are sensitive to the choice of hidden-variable arithmetic and
calculus. The model is classical in the sense of Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and
Bell: elements of reality exist and probabilities are modeled by integrals of
hidden-variable probaility densities. Probability densities have a
Clauser-Horne product form typical of local realistic theories. However,
neither the product nor the integral nor the representation of rotations are
the usual ones. The integral has all the standard properties but only with
respect to the arithmetic that defines the product. Certain formal
transformations of integral expressions one finds in the usual proofs \`a la
Bell do not work, so standard Bell-type inequalities cannot be proved. The
system we consider is deterministic, local-realistic, rotationally invariant,
observers have free will, detectors are perfect, so is free of all the

computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that
enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by

science, and electrical engineering fields. Sentiment analysis is contextual
mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in the
source material and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of
their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.
According to the speech structure, three models are used in speech recognition
to do the match: Acoustic Model, Phonetic Dictionary and Language Model. Any
speech recognition program is evaluated using two factors: Accuracy (percentage
error in converting spoken words to digital data) and Speed (the extent to
which the program can keep up with a human speaker). For the purpose of
converting speech to text (STT), we will be studying the following open source
toolkits: CMU Sphinx and Kaldi. The toolkits use Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and I-vector for feature extraction. CMU Sphinx has been
used with pre-trained Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM), while Kaldi is used with pre-trained Neural Networks (NNET) as acoustic
models. The n-gram language models contain the phonemes or pdf-ids for
generating the most probable hypothesis (transcription) in the form of a
lattice. The speech dataset is stored in the form of .raw or .wav file and is
transcribed in .txt file. The system then tries to identify opinions within the
text, and extract the following attributes: Polarity (if the speaker expresses
a positive or negative opinion) and Keywords (the thing that is being talked
about).

Our results demonstrated that the ERD was prominent during AO, whereas ERS was
typical during MI at the alpha band across the sensorimotor area. A combination
of the filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) and support vector machine

higher performance of decoding neural intentions from the MI paradigm in

aspect of using our developed tasks based on the integration of both AO and MI
to build future exoskeleton-based rehabilitation systems.

concern about the spread of radicalization in the United States. Previous
research suggests that radicalized individuals are destabilized by various
environmental (or endemic) factors, exposed to extremist ideology, and
subsequently reinforced by members of their community. As such, the spread of
radicalization may proceed through a social contagion process, in which
extremist ideologies behave like complex contagions that require multiple
exposures for adoption. In this study, I applied an epidemiological method
called two-component spatio-temporal intensity modeling to data from 416
far-right extremists exposed in the United States between 2005 and 2017. The
results indicate that patterns of far-right radicalization in the United States
are consistent with a complex contagion process, in which reinforcement is
required for transmission. Both social media usage and group membership enhance
the spread of extremist ideology, suggesting that online and physical
organizing remain primary recruitment tools of the far-right movement.
Additionally, I identified several endemic factors, such as poverty, that
increase the probability of radicalization in particular regions. Future
research should investigate how specific interventions, such as online
counter-narratives to battle propaganda, may be effectively implemented to
mitigate the spread of far-right extremism in the United States.

histories. On the other hand, the traditional User-based Collaborative
Filtering (UserCF) makes recommendations based on the interests of the
""neighbors"", which provides the possibility to supplement the weaknesses of
RNN-based methods. However, conventional UserCF only uses a single similarity
metric to model the relationships between users, which is too coarse-grained
and thus limits the performance. In this paper, we propose a framework of deep
neural networks to integrate the RNN-based sequential recommendations and the
key ideas from UserCF, to develop Collaborative Sequential Recommendation
Networks (CSRNs). Firstly, we build a directed co-reading network of users, to
capture the fine-grained topic-specific similarities between users in a vector
space. Then, the CSRN model encodes users with RNNs, and learns to attend to
neighbors and summarize what news they are reading at the moment. Finally, news
articles are recommended according to both the user's own state and the
summarized state of the neighbors. Experiments on two public datasets show that
the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly.

Neural Networks (SNN), has attracted great research interests thanks to its
high computational power, biological plausibility from the brain, simple
structure and low training complexity. By exploring the design space in network
architectures and parameters, recent works have demonstrated great potential
for improving the accuracy of LSM model with low complexity. However, these
works are based on manually-defined network architectures or predefined
parameters. Considering the diversity and uniqueness of brain structure, the
design of LSM model should be explored in the largest search space possible. In
this paper, we propose a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) based framework to
explore both architecture and parameter design space for automatic
dataset-oriented LSM model. To handle the exponentially-increased design space,
we adopt a three-step search for LSM, including multi-liquid architecture
search, variation on the number of neurons and parameters search such as
percentage connectivity and excitatory neuron ratio within each liquid.
Besides, we propose to use Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to implement the
three-step heuristic search. Three datasets, including image dataset of MNIST
and NMNIST and speech dataset of FSDD, are used to test the effectiveness of
our proposed framework. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can
produce the dataset-oriented optimal LSM models with high accuracy and low
complexity. The best classification accuracy on the three datasets is 93.2%,
92.5% and 84% respectively with only 1000 spiking neurons, and the network
connections can be averagely reduced by 61.4% compared with a single LSM.
Moreover, we find that the total quantity of neurons in optimal LSM models on
three datasets can be further reduced by 20% with only about 0.5% accuracy
loss.

the performance of existing methods drops when the target person is too
small/large, or the motion is too fast/slow relative to the scale and speed of
the training data. Moreover, to our knowledge, many of these methods are not
designed or trained under severe occlusion explicitly, making their performance
on handling occlusion compromised. Addressing these problems, we introduce a
spatio-temporal network for robust 3D human pose estimation. As humans in
videos may appear in different scales and have various motion speeds, we apply
multi-scale spatial features for 2D joints or keypoints prediction in each
individual frame, and multi-stride temporal convolutional net-works (TCNs) to
estimate 3D joints or keypoints. Furthermore, we design a spatio-temporal
discriminator based on body structures as well as limb motions to assess
whether the predicted pose forms a valid pose and a valid movement. During
training, we explicitly mask out some keypoints to simulate various occlusion
cases, from minor to severe occlusion, so that our network can learn better and
becomes robust to various degrees of occlusion. As there are limited 3D
ground-truth data, we further utilize 2D video data to inject a semi-supervised

  Chest Radiography Diagnosis","8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chest radiography is a general method for diagnosing a patient's condition
and identifying important information; therefore, radiography is used
extensively in routine medical practice in various situations, such as
emergency medical care and medical checkup. However, a high level of expertise
is required to interpret chest radiographs. Thus, medical specialists spend
considerable time in diagnosing such huge numbers of radiographs. In order to
solve these problems, methods for generating findings have been proposed.
However, the study of generating chest radiograph findings has primarily
focused on the English language, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies
have studied Japanese data on this subject. There are two challenges involved
in generating findings in the Japanese language. The first challenge is that
word splitting is difficult because the boundaries of Japanese word are not
clear. The second challenge is that there are numerous orthographic variants.
For deal with these two challenges, we proposed an end-to-end model that
generates Japanese findings at the character-level from chest radiographs. In
addition, we introduced the attention mechanism to improve not only the
accuracy, but also the interpretation ability of the results. We evaluated the
proposed method using a public dataset with Japanese findings. The
effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed using the Bilingual
Evaluation Understudy score. And, we were confirmed from the generated findings
that the proposed method was able to consider the orthographic variants.
Furthermore, we confirmed via visual inspection that the attention mechanism
captures the features and positional information of radiographs.

design process and qualification under postulated accident conditions. Breach,
rupture, fracture, melting, and other fuel failure modes may occur during the
use of nuclear fuels or when they are exposed to extreme overpower conditions.
Therefore, it is crucial for the fuel to retain reasonable structural integrity
and coolable geometry. The experimental facility of Transient Reactor Test
(TREAT) was designed and constructed in November 1958 to conduct transient
testing of fuels and structural materials. The magnitude of nuclear heating is
one of the most important key parameters in test design, analysis, and data
interpretation in TREAT. Some steady-state tests are able to measure heating
directly via enthalpy rise of coolant in thermally-isolated loops, but an
enormous number of important tests must rely upon nuclear modeling to correlate
core operating parameters to specimen nuclear heating. Uncertainties of these
models and their inputs can prevent experimenters from achieving desired
conditions and hamper advanced models from describing the phenomena to the
level of confidence needed. The situation can be even more difficult for
unsteady/transient tests where nuclear heating is intentionally varied over
short time scales. This research develops a novel nuclear heating sensor
technology which directly measures the parameters of interest using
spatially-resolved real-time thermometry of fissionable instrument materials,
demonstrate the instruments' use in TREAT, and perform data comparisons to
nuclear models to facilitate an advanced understanding of transient power
coupling. Here we present our results of the designed probe and its testing
outcome.

  System",,,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adaptive link selection for buffer-aided relaying can achieve significant
performance gain compared with the conventional relaying with fixed
transmission criterion. However, most of the existing link-selection strategies
are designed based on perfect channel state information (CSI), which are very
complex by requiring channel estimator. To solve this issue, in this paper, we
investigate a buffer-aided differential chaos-shift-keying based simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (DCSK-SWIPT) relay system, where a
decode-and-forward protocol is considered and the relay is equipped with a data
buffer and an energy buffer. In particular, we propose two link-selection
protocols for the proposed system based on harvested energy, data-buffer status
and energy-shortage status, where the CSI is replaced by the harvested energy
to avoid the channel estimation and the practical problem of the decoding cost
at the relay is considered. Furthermore, the bit-error-rate (BER) and
average-delay closed-form expressions of the proposed protocols are derived
over multipath Rayleigh fading channels, which are validated via simulations.
Finally, results demonstrate that both the proposed protocols not only provide
better BER performance than the conventional DCSK system and DCSK-SWIPT relay
system but also achieve better BER performance and lower average delay in
comparison to the conventional signal-to-noise-ratio-based buffer-aided
DCSK-SWIPT relay systems.

they are commonly corrupted by single or multiple noise type at the same time,
due to various reasons, these two reasons are the triggers for moving toward
parallel image processing to find alternatives of image de-noising techniques.
This paper presents a parallel hybrid filter implementation for gray scale
medical image de-noising. The hybridization is between adaptive median and
wiener filters. Parallelization is implemented on the adaptive median filter to
overcome the latency of neighborhood operation, parfor implicit parallelism
powered by MatLab 2013a is used. The implementation is tested on an image of
2.5 MB size, which is divided into 2, 4 and 8 partitions; a comparison between
the proposed implementation and sequential implementation is given, in terms of
time. Thus, each case has the best time when assigned to number of threads
equal to the number of its partitions. Moreover, Speed up and efficiency are
calculated for the algorithm and they show a measured enhancement.

connected with systems across the globe even in mobile state. Hence, the
current Internet is facing scalability issue. Therefore, leaving IP based
Internet behind due to scalability, the world is moving to the Future Internet
Architecture, called Named Data Networking (NDN). Currently, the number of
nodes connected to the Internet is in billions. And, the number of requests
sent is in millions per second. NDN handles such huge numbers by modifying the
IP architecture to meet the current requirements. NDN is scalable, produces
less traffic and congestion, provides high level security, saves bandwidth,
efficiently utilizes multiple network interfaces and have many more
functionalities. Similarly, Bloom Filter is the only good choice to deploy in
various modules of NDN to handle the huge number of packets. Bloom Filter is a
simple probabilistic data structure for the membership query. This article
presents a detailed discussion on the role of Bloom Filter in implementing NDN.
The article includes a precise discussion on Bloom Filter and the main
components of the NDN architecture, namely, packet, content store, forward
information base and pending interest table are also discussed briefly.

developed for lattice core sandwich panels modeled as 2-D equivalent
single-layer (ESL), first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) micropolar
plates. The nonlinearity is due to the moderate macrorotations of the plate
which are modeled by including the von Karman strains in the micropolar strain
measures. Weak form Galerkin method with linear Lagrange interpolations is used
to develop the displacement-based finite element model. Selective reduced
integration is used to eliminate shear locking and membrane locking. The novel
finite element model is used to study the nonlinear bending and linear free
vibrations of web-core and pyramid core sandwich panels. Clamped and free edge
boundary conditions are considered for the first time for the 2-D micropolar
ESL-FSDT plate theory. The present 2-D finite element results are in good
agreement with the corresponding detailed 3-D FE results for the lattice core
sandwich panels. The 2-D element provides computationally cost-effective
solutions; in a nonlinear bending example, the number of elements required for
the 2-D micropolar plate is of the order 10^3, whereas for the corresponding
3-D model the order is 10^5.

interesting auxetic and acoustic behavior. The architectured chiral material is
made up of a periodic repetition of square or hexagonal rigid and heavy blocks
connected by linear elastic interfaces, whose chirality results from an equal
rotation of the blocks with respect to the line connecting their centroids. The
governing equation of the Lagrangian model is derived and a hermitian
eigenproblem is formulated to obtain the frequency band structure. An
equivalent micropolar continuum is analytically derived through a standard
continualization approach in agreement with the procedure proposed by
Bacigalupo and Gambarotta (2017) from which an approximation of the frequency
spectrum is derived. Moreover, the overall elastic moduli of the equivalent
Cauchy continuum are obtained in closed form via a proper condensation
procedure. The parametric analysis involving the overall elastic moduli of the
Cauchy equivalent continuum model and the frequency band structure is carried
out to catch the influence of the chirality angle and of the ratio between the
tangential and normal stiffness of the interface. Finally, it is shown how
chirality and interface stiffness may affect strong auxeticity and how the
equivalent micropolar model provides dispersion curves in excellent agreement
with the current ones for a wide range of the wave vector magnitude.
