  ecological systems","41 pages, 1 figure",,,,"math.PR math.DS q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The classification of the long-term behavior of dynamical systems is a
fundamental problem in mathematics. For both deterministic and stochastic
dynamics specific classes of models verify Palis' conjecture: the long-term
behavior is determined by a finite number of stationary distributions. In this
paper we consider the classification problem for stochastic models of
interacting species. For a large class of three-species, stochastic
differential equation models, we prove a variant of Palis' conjecture: the
long-term statistical behavior is determined by a finite number of stationary
distributions and, generically, three general types of behavior are possible:
1) convergence to a unique stationary distribution that supports all species,
2) convergence to one of a finite number of stationary distributions supporting
two or fewer species, 3) convergence to convex combinations of single species,
stationary distributions due to a rock-paper-scissors type of dynamic.
Moreover, we prove that the classification reduces to computing Lyapunov
exponents (external Lyapunov exponents) that correspond to the average
per-capita growth rate of species when rare. Our results stand in contrast to
the deterministic setting where the classification is incomplete even for
three-dimensional, competitive Lotka--Volterra systems. For these SDE models,
our results also provide a rigorous foundation for ecology's modern coexistence
theory (MCT) which assumes the external Lyapunov exponents determine long-term
ecological outcomes.

  fast-forwarding to the future via statistical simulations",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Ground motion scenarios exists for most of the seismically active areas
around the globe. They essentially correspond to shaking level maps at given
earthquake return times which are used as reference for the likely areas under
threat from future ground displacements. Being landslides in seismically
actively regions closely controlled by the ground motion, one would expect that
landslide susceptibility maps should change as the ground motion patterns
change in space and time. However, so far, statistically-based landslide
susceptibility assessments have primarily been used as time-invariant.In other
words, the vast majority of the statistical models does not include the
temporal effect of the main trigger in future landslide scenarios. In this
work, we present an approach aimed at filling this gap, bridging current
practices in the seismological community to those in the geomorphological and
statistical ones. More specifically, we select an earthquake-induced landslide
inventory corresponding to the 1994 Northridge earthquake and build a Bayesian
Generalized Additive Model of the binomial family, featuring common
morphometric and thematic covariates as well as the Peak Ground Acceleration
generated by the Northridge earthquake. Once each model component has been
estimated, we have run 1000 simulations for each of the 217 possible ground
motion scenarios for the study area.
  From each batch of 1000 simulations, we have estimated the mean and 95\%
Credible Interval to represent the mean susceptibility pattern under a specific
earthquake scenario, together with its uncertainty level. Because each
earthquake scenario has a specific return time, our simulations allow to
incorporate the temporal dimension into any susceptibility model, therefore
driving the results toward the definition of landslide hazard.

  rewinding to the past via statistical simulations",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The vast majority of landslide susceptibility studies assumes the slope
instability process to be time-invariant under the definition that ""the past
and present are keys to the future"". This assumption may generally be valid.
However, the trigger, be it a rainfall or an earthquake event, clearly varies
over time. And yet, the temporal component of the trigger is rarely included in
landslide susceptibility studies and only confined to hazard assessment. In
this work, we investigate a population of landslides triggered in response to
the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake ($M_w = 6.5$) including the associated ground
motion in the analyses, these being carried out at the Slope Unit (SU) level.
We do this by implementing a Bayesian version of a Generalized Additive Model
and assuming that the slope instability across the SUs in the study area
behaves according to a Bernoulli probability distribution. This procedure would
generally produce a susceptibility map reflecting the spatial pattern of the
specific trigger and therefore of limited use for land use planning. However,
we implement this first analytical step to reliably estimate the ground motion
effect, and its distribution, on unstable SUs. We then assume the effect of the
ground motion to be time-invariant, enabling statistical simulations for any
ground motion scenario that occurred in the area from 1933 to 2017. As a
result, we obtain the full spectrum of potential susceptibility patterns over
the last century and compress this information into a susceptibility model/map
representative of all the possible ground motion patterns since 1933. This
backward statistical simulations can also be further exploited in the opposite
direction where, by accounting for scenario-based ground motion, one can also
use it in a forward direction to estimate future unstable slopes.

$\sigma\approx 0.58$ shift-error standard deviation when the surface code is

Fukui et al. and Vuillot et al. report a threshold between $\sigma\approx 0.54$

code. The modified surface-GKP code effectively renders the mode-level physical
noise asymmetric, biasing the logical-level noise on the GKP-qubits. The code
can thus benefit from the resilience of the surface code against biased noise.
We use the approximate maximum likelihood decoding algorithm of Bravyi et al.
to obtain our threshold estimates. Throughout, we consider an idealized
scenario where measurements are noiseless and GKP states are ideal. Our work

  Networks",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic selection techniques aim at selecting the local experts around each
test sample in particular for performing its classification. While generating
the classifier on a local scope may make it easier for singling out the locally
competent ones, as in the online local pool (OLP) technique, using the same
base-classifier model in uneven distributions may restrict the local level of
competence, since each region may have a data distribution that favors one
model over the others. Thus, we propose in this work a problem-independent
dynamic base-classifier model recommendation for the OLP technique, which uses
information regarding the behavior of a portfolio of models over the samples of
different problems to recommend one (or several) of them on a per-instance
manner. Our proposed framework builds a multi-label meta-classifier responsible
for recommending a set of relevant model types based on the local data
complexity of the region surrounding each test sample. The OLP technique then
produces a local pool with the model that yields the highest probability score
of the meta-classifier. Experimental results show that different data
distributions favored different model types on a local scope. Moreover, based
on the performance of an ideal model type selector, it was observed that there
is a clear advantage in choosing a relevant model type for each test instance.
Overall, the proposed model type recommender system yielded a statistically
similar performance to the original OLP with fixed base-classifier model. Given
the novelty of the approach and the gap in performance between the proposed
framework and the ideal selector, we regard this as a promising research
direction. Code available at

for clothes, which aims to solve the problem of clothing trials on e-commerce
websites. Given the images of two people: a person and a model, it generates a
rendition of the person wearing the clothes of the model. This is useful
considering the fact that on most e-commerce websites images of only clothes
are not usually available. We follow a three-stage approach to achieve our
objective. In the first stage, LGVTON warps the clothes of the model using a
Thin-Plate Spline (TPS) based transformation to fit the person. Unlike previous
TPS-based methods, we use the landmarks (of human and clothes) to compute the
TPS transformation. This enables the warping to work independently of the
complex patterns, such as stripes, florals, and textures, present on the
clothes. However, this computed warp may not always be very precise. We,
therefore, further refine it in the subsequent stages with the help of a mask
generator (Stage 2) and an image synthesizer (Stage 3) modules. The mask
generator improves the fit of the warped clothes, and the image synthesizer
ensures a realistic output. To tackle the problem of lack of paired training
data, we resort to a self-supervised training strategy. Here paired data refers
to the image pair of model and person wearing the same cloth. We compare LGVTON
with four existing methods on two popular fashion datasets namely MPV and
DeepFashion using two performance measures, FID (Fr\'echet Inception Distance)
and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index). The proposed method in most cases
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

and white graphs are employed to calculate the one-triplon contribution up to
high orders in perturbation about the dimer limit for bimodal and continuous
disorder. For the square lattice we find that the lifetime of the gap mode is
increased by stronger quantum correlations while stronger disorder effects are
observed for the triangular lattice due to geometric frustration. For
intra-dimer disorder, in-band energy gaps are observed for both lattices which
can be understood in terms of a level repulsion on dimers with low and high
intra-dimer exchange that are close in energy at the momentum where the in-band
gap opens. For the highly frustrated kagome lattice disorder even allows to
decrease the gap energy. In addition, the localization length of the low-energy
flat band is increased up to order $7$ in perturbation theory. The interplay of
quenched disorder, geometric frustration, and strong correlations leads
therefore to rich structures in the dynamical structure factor of

given potentially arbitrary sampling intervals. We then extend this algorithm
to handle nonlinearities by leveraging Koopman theory. The resulting algorithm
performs a spectral decomposition in a nonlinear, data-dependent basis. The

expressing the objective in the frequency domain allows us to compute global

exploiting the computational properties of the Fast Fourier Transform. Because
of their close relation to Bayesian Spectral Analysis, uncertainty

$GU(2n,A,\Lambda)$. Further, let $(I,\Gamma)$ be a form ideal of $(A,\Lambda)$.
One can associate with $(I,\Gamma)$ the corresponding elementary subgroup
$FU(2n,I,\Gamma)$ and the relative elementary subgroup $EU(2n,I,\Gamma)$ of
$GU(2n,A,\Lambda)$. Let $(J,\Delta)$ be another form ideal of $(A,\Lambda)$. In
the present paper we prove an unexpected result that the non-obvious type of
generators for $\big[EU(2n,I,\Gamma),EU(2n,J,\Delta)\big]$, as constructed in
our previous papers with Hazrat, are redundant and can be expressed as products
of the obvious generators, the elementary conjugates
$Z_{ij}(ab,c)=T_{ji}(c)T_{ij}(ab)T_{ji}(-c)$ and $Z_{ij}(ba,c)$, and the
elementary commutators $Y_{ij}(a,b)=[T_{ji}(a),T_{ij}(b)]$, where
$a\in(I,\Gamma)$, $b\in(J,\Delta)$, $c\in(A,\Lambda)$. It follows that
$\big[FU(2n,I,\Gamma),FU(2n,J,\Delta)\big]=
\big[EU(2n,I,\Gamma),EU(2n,J,\Delta)\big]$. In fact, we establish much more
precise generation results. In particular, even the elementary commutators
$Y_{ij}(a,b)$ should be taken for one long root position and one short root
position. Moreover, $Y_{ij}(a,b)$ are central modulo
$EU(2n,(I,\Gamma)\circ(J,\Delta))$ and behave as symbols. This allows us to
generalise and unify many previous results,including the multiple elementary
commutator formula, and dramatically simplify their proofs.

explanation of how ancient distribution defined the existence of two families;
Pioneer DNA and electron microscopy from Brazil; and primitive attempts at
systematics using embryology or isolated anatomical characteristics. Finally,
the 1980-2020 period, with research centered in Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica

their adhesive net and how the glue works; the reconstruction of Cambrian

topological reconstruction of each event from the TPC data prior to performing
a one-parameter fit. Measured times and positions of detected photons are fit
to the expected pattern of light from the tracks as reconstructed using the
electron drift. The event can be treated as a rigid body with only the neutrino
interaction time as a free parameter. The optical properties of LAr are
comparable to those of water for Cherenkov light in visible wavelengths.
Data-Monte Carlo comparisons of the light patterns, given the known track
topology from electron drift, enable in situ calibration of the optical model
and further optimization of the timing. A back-of-the-envelope calculation
predicts that the single parameter fit for the interaction time requires a
significantly lower photodetector coverage than needed for the same precision
in conventional warm-liquid detectors.

effort-averse strategic sensors on discrete-time LTI systems. In our setting,
sensors exert costly effort to collect data, and report their effort to the
system operator. However, sensors do not directly benefit from the output of
the system, so they will not exert much effort to ensure accuracy and may even
falsify their reported effort to maximize their utility. We explore payment
mechanisms that incentivize truthful reporting from strategic sensors. We
demonstrate the influence of the true and reported effort on the expected
operational cost. Then, we use the realizations of the system cost to construct
a payment function. We show that payment functions typically used in static

modified payment function that elicits truthful reporting, which requires terms
that compensate for the dynamic impact of reported efforts on the closed-loop

variational framework which jointly performs reconstruction and registration,

expand these subspaces. The methods presented involve modifications in the
one-body network representation of the many-body Hamiltonians which generate
new interacting terms in these Hamiltonians. The subspace of many-particle
localized states can be preserved in the interacting Hamiltonian, by projecting
the interacting terms onto the subspace of many-body extended states or by
constructing the interacting Hamiltonian applying origami rules to the network.
Expanded subspaces of localized states are found if interacting terms that mix
subspaces with different number of particles are introduced. Furthermore, we
present numerical methods for the determination of many-body localized states
that allows one to address larger clusters and larger number of particles than
those accessible by full diagonalization of the interacting Hamiltonian. These
methods rely on the generalization of the concept of compact localized state in

degeneracy conditions, crucial for the absence of Ostrogradski ghosts, are
found to be required for the validity of the Kerr-Schild ansatz while on the
other hand, theories with no parity symmetry are excluded from the solution
generating method. The extended Kerr-Schild symmetry turns out to be a very
useful tool to easily construct black hole solutions from simple seed
configurations. In particular, the generating method developed is adapted to
construct generic black holes but also regular black hole solutions within
Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories. As a particular example
we show how to construct explicitly the Hayward metric as a solution to a
specific DHOST theory.

reinforcement learning works, however, this effect is still not well
understood. The primary purpose of the work presented here is to investigate
the impact that an auxiliary task's prediction timescale has on the agent's
policy performance. We consider auxiliary tasks which learn to make on-policy
predictions using temporal difference learning. We test the impact of
prediction timescale using a specific form of auxiliary task in which the input
image is used as the prediction target, which we refer to as temporal
difference autoencoders (TD-AE). We empirically evaluate the effect of TD-AE on
the A2C algorithm in the VizDoom environment using different prediction
timescales. While we do not observe a clear relationship between the prediction
timescale on performance, we make the following observations: 1) using
auxiliary tasks allows us to reduce the trajectory length of the A2C algorithm,
2) in some cases temporally extended TD-AE performs better than a straight
autoencoder, 3) performance with auxiliary tasks is sensitive to the weight
placed on the auxiliary loss, 4) despite this sensitivity, auxiliary tasks
improved performance without extensive hyper-parameter tuning. Our overall
conclusions are that TD-AE increases the robustness of the A2C algorithm to the
trajectory length and while promising, further study is required to fully
understand the relationship between auxiliary task prediction timescale and the
agent's performance.

under multiple constraints. An example is the hyper-parameter tuning problem of
machine learning algorithms. In particular, the minimization of the estimation
of the generalization error of a deep neural network and at the same time the
minimization of its prediction time. We may also consider as a constraint that
the deep neural network must be implemented in a chip with an area below some
size. Here, both the objectives and the constraint are black boxes, i.e.,
functions whose analytical expressions are unknown and are expensive to
evaluate. Bayesian optimization (BO) methodologies have given state-of-the-art
results for the optimization of black-boxes. Nevertheless, most BO methods are
sequential and evaluate the objectives and the constraints at just one input
location, iteratively. Sometimes, however, we may have resources to evaluate
several configurations in parallel. Notwithstanding, no parallel BO method has
been proposed to deal with the optimization of multiple objectives under
several constraints. If the expensive evaluations can be carried out in
parallel (as when a cluster of computers is available), sequential evaluations
result in a waste of resources. This article introduces PPESMOC, Parallel
Predictive Entropy Search for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with
Constraints, an information-based batch method for the simultaneous
optimization of multiple expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions under the
presence of several constraints. Iteratively, PPESMOC selects a batch of input
locations at which to evaluate the black-boxes so as to maximally reduce the
entropy of the Pareto set of the optimization problem. We present empirical
evidence in the form of synthetic, benchmark and real-world experiments that
illustrate the effectiveness of PPESMOC.

correlated equilibria in normal-form games is a celebrated result in the theory
of multi-agent systems. Specifically, it has been known for more than 20 years
that when all players seek to minimize their internal regret in a repeated
normal-form game, the empirical frequency of play converges to a normal-form
correlated equilibrium. Extensive-form (that is, tree-form) games generalize
normal-form games by modeling both sequential and simultaneous moves, as well
as private information. Because of the sequential nature and presence of
partial information in the game, extensive-form correlation has significantly
different properties than the normal-form counterpart, many of which are still
open research directions. Extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) has been
proposed as the natural extensive-form counterpart to normal-form correlated
equilibrium. However, it was currently unknown whether EFCE emerges as the
result of uncoupled agent dynamics. In this paper, we give the first uncoupled
no-regret dynamics that converge to the set of EFCEs in $n$-player general-sum
extensive-form games with perfect recall. First, we introduce a notion of
trigger regret in extensive-form games, which extends that of internal regret
in normal-form games. When each player has low trigger regret, the empirical
frequency of play is close to an EFCE. Then, we give an efficient
no-trigger-regret algorithm. Our algorithm decomposes trigger regret into local
subproblems at each decision point for the player, and constructs a global
strategy of the player from the local solutions at each decision point.

a broad range of objects, including challenging ones with global or partial
symmetries. An object is represented by compact surface fragments which allow
handling symmetries in a systematic manner. Correspondences between densely
sampled pixels and the fragments are predicted using an encoder-decoder
network. At each pixel, the network predicts: (i) the probability of each
object's presence, (ii) the probability of the fragments given the object's
presence, and (iii) the precise 3D location on each fragment. A data-dependent
number of corresponding 3D locations is selected per pixel, and poses of
possibly multiple object instances are estimated using a robust and efficient
variant of the PnP-RANSAC algorithm. In the BOP Challenge 2019, the method
outperforms all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on the T-LESS and LM-O

game, we place a tipsy cop and a drunken robber at different vertices of a
finite connected graph $G$. The game consists of independent moves where the
robber begins the game by moving to an adjacent vertex from where he began,
this is then followed by the cop moving to an adjacent vertex from where she
began. Since the robber is inebriated, he takes random walks on the graph,
while the cop being tipsy means that her movements are sometimes random and
sometimes intentional. Our main results give formulas for the probability that
the robber is still free from capture after $m$ moves of this game on highly
symmetric graphs, such as the complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and
cycle graphs. We also give the expected encounter time between the cop and

show separately the impact of each data set and remark that it is especially
CMB lensing the one data set that shifts the peak the most towards

tail large deviations of the edge eigenvalues of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random
graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$, in the regime of $p$ where the edge of the spectrum
is no longer governed by global observables, such as the number of edges, but
rather by localized statistics, such as high degree vertices. Going beyond the
recent developments in mean-field approximations of related problems, this
paper provides a comprehensive treatment of the large deviations of the
spectral edge in this entire regime, which notably includes the well studied
case of constant average degree. In particular, for $r \geq 1$ fixed, we pin
down the asymptotic probability that the top $r$ eigenvalues are jointly
greater/less than their typical values by multiplicative factors bigger/smaller
than $1$, in the regime mentioned above. The proof for the upper tail relies on
a novel structure theorem, obtained by building on estimates of Krivelevich and
Sudakov (2003), followed by an iterative cycle removal process, which shows,
conditional on the upper tail large deviation event, with high probability the
graph admits a decomposition in to a disjoint union of stars and a spectrally
negligible part. On the other hand, the key ingredient in the proof of the
lower tail is a Ramsey-type result which shows that if the $K$-th largest
degree of a graph is not atypically small (for some large $K$ depending on
$r$), then either the top eigenvalue or the $r$-th largest eigenvalue is larger
than that allowed by the lower tail event on the top $r$ eigenvalues, thus
forcing a contradiction. The above arguments reduce the problems to developing
a large deviation theory for the extremal degrees which could be of independent
interest.

widely studied measures in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as it constitutes a
proxy for entropy production. In quantum systems, it has been shown that the
irreversible work has an additional, genuinely quantum mechanical contribution,
due to coherence produced by the driving protocol. The goal of this paper is to
explore this contribution in systems that undergo a quantum phase transition.
Substantial effort has been dedicated in recent years to understand the role of
quantum criticality in work protocols. However, practically nothing is known
about how coherence contributes to it. To shed light on this issue, we study
the entropy production in infinitesimal quenches of the one-dimensional XY
model. For quenches in the transverse field, we find that for finite
temperatures the contribution from coherence can, in certain cases, account for
practically all of the entropy production. At low temperatures, however, the
coherence presents a finite cusp at the critical point, whereas the entropy
production diverges logarithmically. Alternatively, if the quench is performed
in the anisotropy parameter, we find that there are situations where all of the
entropy produced is due to quantum coherences.

methodology was applied to the free particle and the harmonic oscillator
problems, where the numerically-averaged path obtained from the Monte-Carlo
simulation converges to the analytical solution from classical mechanics, in an
analogous way with a canonical system where energy is minimized by sampling the
state space and computing the average state for each system. Thus, we expect
that this procedure can be general enough to solve other differential equations

First, we revisit the constraints on particle DM that decays or annihilates to

massive star: the lower the metallicity, the more compact the star, especially
during its post-MS evolution. We study this effect in the context of binary
evolution. Using the stellar-evolution code MESA, we computed evolutionary
tracks of stars at different metallicities, exploring variations of factors
known to affect the radial expansion (e.g. semiconvection, overshooting,
rotation). We find observational support for an evolution in which already at
metallicity $0.2Z_{\odot}$ massive stars remain relatively compact during the
Hertzprung-Gap (HG) phase and most of their expansion occurs during core-helium
burning (CHeB). Consequently, we show that metallicity has a strong influence
on the type of mass transfer evolution in binary systems. At solar metallicity,
a case-B mass transfer is initiated shortly after the end of MS, and a giant
donor is almost always a rapidly expanding HG star. At lower metallicity, the
parameter space for mass transfer from a more evolved CHeB star increases
dramatically. This means that envelope stripping and formation of helium stars
in low-metallicity environments occurs later in the evolution of the donor,
implying a much shorter duration of the Wolf-Rayet phase (even by an order of
magnitude) and higher final core masses. This metallicity effect is independent
of the impact of metallicity-dependent stellar winds. At very low
metallicities, a significant fraction of massive stars in binaries engages in
the first episode of mass transfer very late into their evolution, when they
already have a well-developed CO core. The remaining lifetime ($< 10^4$ yr) is
unlikely to be enough to strip the entire H-rich envelope. We also briefly
discuss the extremely small parameter space for mass transfer from massive
convective-envelope donors in the context of binary black hole merger
formation.

final states contain jets whose substructure encodes their non-QCD origin. This
is a relatively subtle signature of strongly coupled beyond the Standard Model
dynamics, and thus it is crucial that analyses incorporate systematic errors to
account for the approximations that are being made when modeling the signal. We
estimate theoretical uncertainties for a canonical substructure observable
designed to be sensitive to the gauge structure of the underlying object, the
two-point energy correlator $e_2^{(\beta)}$, by computing envelopes between
resummed analytic distributions and numerical results from Pythia. We explore

We propose an explanation which involves the Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark

photons at their exit. We show that the emitted spectrum is consistent with
(Fraser et al. 2014), and that our calculation is not sensitive to the specific

level of 20-25%, much larger than conventional dark matter models (1-10%).
Since the AQN emission spectrum extends up to $\sim $ 100 keV, well beyond the
keV sensitivity of XMM-Newton, we predict the AQN contribution to the hard
X-ray and $\gamma$-ray backgrounds in the Earth's environment. The Gamma-Ray

escape the Milky Way so quickly that their trajectories will be almost straight
lines. Previous works have shown how these `hypervelocity stars' are
subsequently deflected by the gravitational field of the Milky Way and the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), but have neglected to account for the reflex
motion of the Milky Way in response to the fly by of the LMC. A consequence of
this motion is that the hypervelocity stars we see on the outskirts of the
Milky Way today were ejected from where the Milky Way centre was hundreds of
millions of years ago. This change in perspective causes large apparent
deflections in the trajectories of the hypervelocity stars, which are of the
same order as the deflections caused by the gravitational force of the Milky
Way and LMC. We quantify these deflections by simulating the production of
hypervelocity stars in an isolated Milky Way (with a spherical or flattened
dark matter halo), in a fixed-in-place Milky Way with a passing LMC, and in a
Milky Way which responds to the passage of the LMC. The proper motion precision
necessary to measure these deflections will be possible with the combination of
Gaia with the proposed GaiaNIR successor mission, and these measurements will
unlock the hypervelocity stars as probes of the shape of the Milky Way, the
mass of the LMC, and of the dance of these two galaxies.

to use crowdsourcing to carry out a lens search targeting massive galaxies
selected from over 442 square degrees of photometric data from the Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. We selected a sample of $\sim300,000$ galaxies with
photometric redshifts in the range $0.2 < z_{phot} < 1.2$ and photometrically
inferred stellar masses $\log{M_*} > 11.2$. We crowdsourced lens finding on
this sample of galaxies on the Zooniverse platform, as part of the Space Warps
project. The sample was complemented by a large set of simulated lenses and
visually selected non-lenses, for training purposes. Nearly 6,000 citizen
volunteers participated in the experiment. In parallel, we used YattaLens, an
automated lens finding algorithm, to look for lenses in the same sample of
galaxies. Based on a statistical analysis of classification data from the
volunteers, we selected a sample of the most promising $\sim1,500$ candidates
which we then visually inspected: half of them turned out to be possible (grade
C) lenses or better. Including lenses found by YattaLens or serendipitously
noticed in the discussion section of the Space Warps website, we were able to
find 14 definite lenses, 129 probable lenses and 581 possible lenses. YattaLens
found half the number of lenses discovered via crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is
able to produce samples of lens candidates with high completeness and purity,
compared to currently available automated algorithms. A hybrid approach, in
which the visual inspection of samples of lens candidates pre-selected by
discovery algorithms and/or coupled to machine learning is crowdsourced, will
be a viable option for lens finding in the 2020s.

rate of $-8.64 \pm 1.26$ msec/yr, based on transit-timing measurements spanning
12 years. Proposed explanations for the period change include tidal orbital
decay, apsidal precession, and acceleration of the system along the line of
sight. To investigate further, we performed new radial velocity measurements
and speckle imaging of WASP-4. The radial-velocity data show that the system is
accelerating towards the Sun at a rate of $-0.0422\pm 0.0028$ m/s/day. The
associated Doppler effect should cause the apparent period to shrink at a rate
of $-5.94 \pm 0.39$ msec/yr, comparable to the observed rate. Thus, the
observed change in the transit period is mostly or entirely produced by the
line-of-sight acceleration of the system. This acceleration is probably caused
by a wide-orbiting companion of mass 10-300$\,M_{\rm Jup}$ and orbital distance
10-100$\,$AU, based on the magnitude of the radial-velocity trend and the
non-detection of any companion in the speckle images. We expect that the
orbital periods of 1 out of 3 hot Jupiters will change at rates similar to
WASP-4b, based on the hot-Jupiter companion statistics of Knutson et al.
(2014). Continued radial velocity monitoring of hot Jupiters is therefore
essential to distinguish the effects of tidal orbital decay or apsidal
precession from line-of-sight acceleration.

configurations of the symmetry breaking field, which can enjoy exceptional
stability as in the Skyrme model of nuclear forces. Here we argue that similar
models may describe magic angle graphene, a remarkable new material . When the
angle between two sheets of graphene is near the magic angle of $\sim 1^\circ$,
insulating behavior is observed, which gives way to superconductivity on
changing the electron density. We propose a unifying description of both the
order underlying the insulator as well as the superconductor. While the
symmetry breaking condensate leads to the ordered phase, topological solitons
in the condensate - skyrmions - are shown to be bosons that carry an electric
charge of 2e. Condensation of skyrmions leads to a superconductor whose pairing
strength, symmetry and other properties are inferred. More generally, we show
how topological textures can mitigate Coulomb repulsion to pair electrons and
provide a new route to superconductivity. Our mechanism potentially applies to
much wider class of systems but crucially invokes certain key ingredient such
as inversion symmetry present in magic angle graphene. We discuss how these
insights not only clarify why certain correlated moire materials do not
superconduct, they also point to promising new platforms where robust

systems, such as the formation of non-trivial spin liquids in two and three

been observed that the sign of the bond-directional exchange is of crucial
relevance for the field-induced physics, with antiferromagnetic couplings
giving rise to an intermediate spin liquid regime between the low-field gapped
Kitaev spin liquid and the high-field polarized state, which is not present in
the ferromagnetically coupled model. Here, by employing a Majorana mean-field
approach for a magnetic field pointing along the [001] direction, we present a
systematic study of field-induced spin liquid phases for a variety of two and
three-dimensional lattice geometries. We find that antiferromagnetic couplings
generically lead to (i) spin liquid phases that are considerably more stable in
field than those for ferromagnetic couplings, and (ii) an intermediate spin
liquid phase which arises from a change in the topology of the Majorana band
structure. Close inspection of the mean-field parameters reveal that the
intermediate phase occurs due to a field-driven sign change in an 'effective'
$z$-bond energy parameter. Our results clearly demonstrate the richness of the

We find that the induced-Compton scatterings of the coherent radiation by

and around the source of this radiation. This severely restricts those models
for FRBs that invoke relativistic shocks and maser type instabilities at
distances less than about $10^{13}$ cm of the neutron star. Radiation traveling
upstream, in these models, forces particles to move away from the shock with a
LF larger than the LF of the shock front. This suspends the photon generation
process after it has been operating for less than ~0.1 ms (observer frame
duration). We show that masers operating in shocks at distances larger than
$10^{13}$ cm cannot simultaneously account for the burst duration of 1 ms or
more and the observed ~1 GHz frequencies of FRBs without requiring an excessive
energy budget ($10^{46}$ erg); the energy is not calculated by imposing any
efficiency consideration, or other details, for the maser mechanism, but is
entirely the result of ensuring that particle acceleration by induced-Compton
forces upstream of the shock front does not choke off the maser process. For
the source to operate more or less continuously for a few ms, it should be
embedded in a strong magnetic field - cyclotron frequency $\gg$ wave frequency
- so that radiation forces do not disperse the plasma and shut-off the engine.

the range of safe exploration. The use of polynomial kernels allows us to

which are defined on the Riemannian manifold of quaternions. Such graph
optimization on distributions-on-manifolds enables a natural treatment of
multimodal hypotheses, ambiguities and uncertainties arising in many computer
vision applications such as SLAM, SfM, and object pose estimation. We first
formally define the problem as a generalization of the classical rotation graph
synchronization, where in our case the vertices denote probability measures
over rotations. We then measure the quality of the synchronization by using
Sinkhorn divergences, which reduces to other popular metrics such as
Wasserstein distance or the maximum mean discrepancy as limit cases. We propose
a nonparametric Riemannian particle optimization approach to solve the problem.
Even though the problem is non-convex, by drawing a connection to the recently

iron emission line. Compared to other supergiant HMXBs, the Fe K$\alpha$ line
equivalent width is low in SMC X-1 - from less than 10 eV in high state to up

with the hard X-ray spectrum steepening with increasing flux. We also report a
highly variable normalisation of the power-law component across these 16
super-orbital states. Pulsations in the hard X-rays for both the instruments
were detected in all but two observations. The pulse profiles are near
sinusoidal with two peaks and the relative intensity of the second peak
decreasing with decreasing luminosity. These findings suggest that the
super-orbital modulation in SMC X-1 is not caused by absorption in precessing

trajectory in the field space, features at the largest scales of the types
suggested by CMB temperature anisotropies are more difficult to achieve in
models involving two canonical scalar fields due to the presence of

solve control problems for very large-scale networks (VLSNs) of linear
dynamical systems based on graphon limits. This paper provides a solution
method based on invariant subspace decompositions for a class of graphon linear
quadratic regulation (LQR) problems where the local dynamics share homogeneous
parameters but the graphon couplings may be heterogeneous among the coupled
agents. Graphon couplings in this paper appear in states, controls and costs,
and these couplings may be represented by different graphons. By exploring a
common invariant subspace of the couplings, the original problem is decomposed
into a network coupled LQR problem of finite dimension and a decoupled infinite
dimensional LQR problem. A centralized optimal solution, and a nodal
collaborative optimal control solution where each agent computes its part of
the optimal solution locally, are established. The application of these
solutions to finite network LQR problems may be via (i) the graphon control
methodology [3], or (ii) the representation of finite LQR problems as special
cases of graphon LQR problems. The complexity of these solutions involves
solving one nd X nd dimensional Riccati equation and one n X n Riccati
equation, where n is the dimension of each nodal agent state and d is the
dimension of the nontrivial common invariant subspace of the coupling
operators, whereas a direct approach involves solving an nN X nN dimensional
Riccati equation, where N is the size of the network. For situations where the
graphon couplings do not admit exact low-rank representations, approximate
control is developed based on low-rank approximations. Finally, an application
to the regulation of harmonic oscillators coupled over large networks with
uncertainties is demonstrated.

limit rules out strong contribution of the high-redshift Universe to the

The fueling and feedback of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are important

Mergers are thought to have the capability to bring gas inwards and ignite
nuclear activity, especially for more powerful AGNs. However, there is still
significant ongoing debate on whether mergers can trigger AGNs and, if they do,
whether mergers are a significant triggering mechanism. Methods. We select a
low-redshift ($0.005<z<0.1$) sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
and a high-redshift ($0 < z < 0.6$) sample from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly
(GAMA) survey. We take advantage of the convolutional neural network technique
to identify mergers. We use mid-infrared (MIR) color cut and optical emission
line diagnostics to classify AGNs. We also include Low Excitation Radio
Galaxies (LERGs) to investigate the connection between mergers and low
accretion rate AGNs. Results. We find that AGNs are more likely to be found in
mergers than non-mergers, with an AGN excess up to $1.81\pm{0.16}$, suggesting
that mergers can trigger AGNs. We also find the fraction of mergers in AGNs is
higher than that in non-AGN controls, for both MIR and optically selected AGNs,
as well as LERGs, with values between $16.40\pm{0.5}\%$ and $39.23\pm{2.10}\%$,
implying a non-negligible to potentially significant role of mergers in
triggering AGNs. This merger fraction in AGNs increases as stellar mass
increases which supports the idea that mergers are more important for
triggering AGNs in more massive galaxies. In terms of merger fraction as a
function of AGN power we find a positive trend for MIR selected AGNs and a
complex trend for optically selected AGNs, which we interpret under an
evolutionary scenario proposed by previous studies. In addition, obscured MIR
selected AGNs are more likely to be hosted in mergers than unobscured MIR
selected AGNs.

estimations on real pandemic situations (mainly due to the inability to acquire
objective real data over whole populations). The previously introduced model of
closed self-organized criticality (SOC), is adapted in the case of a
virus-induced epidemic. In this version this physical model can distinguish the
virus spread according to the virus aggressiveness. The study presented,
highlights the critical value of virus density over a population. For low
values of the initial virus density (lower than the critical value) it is
proved that the virus-diffusion behavior is safe and quantitatively similar to
usual real epidemical data. However, it is revealed that very close to the
critical point, the critical slowing-down (CSD) phenomenon, introduced by the
theory of critical phenomena, emerges, leading to a tremendous increase of both
the percentage of active carriers and the duration of the epidemic. A behavior
of the epidemic obeying to a second order phase transition, also occurs. For
virus density values higher than the critical value, the epidemic duration
becomes extremely prolonged. Additionally, the effect of the closed system
population size revealed interesting properties. All these results, together
with an investigation of the effectiveness of applying physical contact
restriction measures, document scientifically their worthiness, while they also
demonstrate the limits for which herd immunity holds safely. Finally, the model
has been compared against real epidemic data in the case of Greece, which
imposed restrictive measures consistently and in time.

While various methods involving heterogeneous geometries, magnetic properties,
and surface chemistries have been proposed to enhance independent control, the
main challenge has been that the motion between all microwsimmers remains
coupled through the global control signal of the magnetic field. Katsamba and
Lauga proposed transchiral microrobots, a theoretical design with magnetized
spirals of opposite handedness. The competition between the spirals can be
tuned to give an intrinsic nonlinearity that each device can function only
within a given band of frequencies. This allows individual microrobots to be
selectively controlled by varying the frequency of the rotating magnetic field.
Here we present the experimental realization and characterization of
transchiral micromotors composed of independently driven magnetic helices. We
show a swimming micromotor that yields negligible net motion until a critical
frequency is reached and a micromotor that changes its translation direction as
a function of the frequency of the rotating magnetic field. This work
demonstrates a crucial step towards completely decoupled and addressable

fluctuations in the total transverse momentum at fixed multiplicity. We first
study the factorization of the fixed multiplicity momentum dependent two
particle correlation function into a product of $v_0(p_T^a)$ and $v_0(p_T^b)$
within realistic hydrodynamic simulations. Then we present computations of
$v_0(p_T)$ for different particle types. We determine the relation between the
integrated $v_0$ and previously measured observables, and compare results from
a hybrid hydrodynamics based model to experimental data. The effects of bulk
viscosity and an initial pre-equilibrium stage on the results are quantified.
We find that $v_0$ is strongly correlated with the initial state entropy per
elliptic area, $S/A$. Using this result, we explain how the observed
correlations between the elliptic flow and the transverse momentum (both in
simulations and experiment) reflect the initial state correlations between
$1/A$ and ellipticity $\varepsilon_2$ at fixed multiplicity. We argue that the
systematic experimental study of $v_0$, with the same sophistication as used
for the other $v_n$, can contribute significantly to our understanding of quark

the class of polarized axial symmetry, under perturbations of the Schwarzschild
data induced on a hypersurface $\{r=\e\}$, $\e<<2M$. Our result is only partly
a stability result, in that we show that while a (space-like) singularity
persists under perturbations as above, the behaviour of the metric approaching
the singularity is much more involved than for the Schwarzschild solution.
Indeed, we find that the solution displays
asymptocially-velocity-term-dominated dynamics and approaches a different
Kasner solution at each point of the singularity. These Kasner-type asymptotics
are very far from isotropic, since (as in Schwarzschild) there are two
contracting directions and one expanding one.
  Our proof relies on energy methods and on a new approach to the EVE in axial
symmetry, which we believe has wider applicability: In this symmetry class and
under a suitable geodesic gauge, the EVE can be studied as a free wave coupled
to (nonlinear) ODEs, which couple the geometry of the projected, 2+1 space-time
to the free wave. The fact that the nonlinear part of the Einstein equations is
described by ODEs lies at the heart of how one can overcome a certain linear

markedly different from that of their crystalline counterparts, but exhibits

harmonic approximation sound attenuation $\Gamma$ obeys quartic, Rayleigh
scattering scaling for small wavevectors $k$ and quadratic scaling for
wavevectors above the Ioffe-Regel limit. However, simulations and experiments
do not provide a clear picture of what to expect at finite temperatures where
anharmonic effects become relevant. Here we study sound attenuation at finite
temperatures for model glasses of various stability, from unstable glasses that
exhibit rapid aging to glasses whose stability is equal to those created in
laboratory experiments. We find several scaling laws depending on the
temperature and stability of the glass. First, we find the large wavevector
quadratic scaling to be unchanged at all temperatures. Second, we find that at
small wavectors $\Gamma \sim k^{1.5}$ for an aging glass, but $\Gamma \sim k^2$
when the glass does not age on the timescale of the calculation. For our most
stable glass, we find that $\Gamma \sim k^2$ at small wavevectors, then a
crossover to Rayleigh scattering scaling $\Gamma \sim k^4$, followed by another
crossover to the quadratic scaling at large wavevectors. Our computational
observation of this quadratic behavior reconciles simulation, theory and
experiment, and will advance the understanding of the temperature dependence of
thermal conductivity of glasses.

learned with a multi-layer perceptron, which is trained on feature pairs

to the features of the previous set of classes, and maps features to a

Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art

configuration, where X is the alkaline earth element and A and B are the group
5A pnictogens. We find that an ""extended s"" state at the valence band minimum,
described alternatively as a cation valence state or a modulated interstitial
planewave state, plays a crucial role in both topological and thermoelectric
properties. Several of these compounds may house topological phases, while
transport calculations indicate they may also find themselves useful in
thermoelectric applications.

M_{\star}=10.73-11.03$ $M_{\odot{}}$ at $z < 0.1$, and analyze their location

have different spectroscopic properties, most of them being classified either
as AGN or composite. We found that the majority of our sources are located
below the main sequence of star formation in the SFR-stellar mass diagram, and
in the green valley or red sequence in the color-stellar mass diagram. We argue
that IOAGs seem to correspond to the transition area where the galaxies are
moving from star-forming to quiescent, and from the blue cloud to the red
sequence and/or to recently quenched galaxies.

(DNN), which in a mathematically rigorous manner, allows us to incorporate
history (or memory) into the network -- it ensures all layers are connected to

time-discretization of a fractional in time nonlinear ordinary differential
equation (ODE). The learning problem then is a minimization problem subject to
that fractional ODE as constraints. We emphasize that an analogy between the
existing DNN and ODEs, with standard time derivative, is well-known by now. The
focus of our work is the Fractional-DNN. Using the Lagrangian approach, we
provide a derivation of the backward propagation and the design equations. We
test our network on several datasets for classification problems.
Fractional-DNN offers various advantages over the existing DNN. The key
benefits are a significant improvement to the vanishing gradient issue due to
the memory effect, and better handling of nonsmooth data due to the network's
ability to approximate non-smooth functions.

Unlike in other methods for general impurity problems, an approximation of the
continuous hybridization function by a finite number of bath states is not
needed, and accessing low temperature does not incur an exponential cost. We
test the method for the example of molecular systems, where we systematically
vary temperature, interatomic distance, and basis set size. We further apply
the method to an impurity problem generated by a self-energy embedding
calculation of correlated antiferromagnetic NiO. We find that the method is
ideal for quantum impurity problems with a large number of orbitals but only

preventing the existence of massless Goldstone bosons, remain to be
synchronized in all regimes characterized by a modified CPT symmetry. In the
domain of parameter space where the ""would be Goldstone bosons"" can be

cease to exist. The mechanism is also in tact at the standard exceptional
points. However, at the zero exceptional points, that is when the eigenvalues

mechanism breaks down as the Goldstone bosons can not be identified and the
gauge vector bosons remain massless. This breakdown coincides with the
vanishing of the CPT inner product of symmetry breaking vacua defined on the
eigenvector space of mass squared matrix. We verify this behaviour for a theory

\emph{overfull} if $|E(G)|>\Delta \lfloor |V(G)|/2\rfloor$. The \emph{core} of
$G$, denoted $G_{\Delta}$, is the subgraph of $G$ induced by its vertices of
degree $\Delta$. A classic result of Vizing shows that $\chi'(G)$, the
chromatic index of $G$, is either $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$. It is NP-complete to
determine the chromatic index for a general graph. However, if $G$ is overfull
then $\chi'(G)=\Delta+1$. Hilton and Zhao in 1996 conjectured that if $G$ is a
simple connected graph with $\Delta\ge 3$ and $\Delta(G_\Delta)\le 2$, then
$\chi'(G)=\Delta+1$ if and only if $G$ is overfull or $G=P^*$, where $P^*$ is
obtained from the Petersen graph by deleting a vertex. This conjecture, if
true, implies an easy approach for calculating $\chi'(G)$ for graphs $G$
satisfying the conditions. The progress on the conjecture has been slow: it was
only confirmed for $\Delta=3,4$, respectively, in 2003 and 2017. In this paper,
we confirm this conjecture for all $\Delta\ge 4$.

model-based inversion with underlying assumptions on particle properties.
Furthermore, the presence of sampling biases such as velocity differentials are
often overlooked by the simple ex-situ calibrations, which introduces as an
additional source of error. In contrast, digital inline holography (DIH), a
single camera coherent imaging technique, can both measure particle size
distributions without the need for a model-based inversion and can directly
provide information on the shape characteristics of the particles. In this
study, we evaluate the performance of an LD system in characterizing
polydisperse droplets produced in a flat fan spray using in-situ DIH based

examined. A droplet-trajectory-based correction for the LD-inferred size
distributions is proposed to compensate for the observed differences. We
validate the correction using NIST standard polydisperse particles undergoing
differential settling, and then apply the correction to polydisperse spray
droplet measurements. The correction improves agreement between LD and DIH size
distributions for droplets over two orders of magnitude, but with LD still
underestimating the fraction of droplets at sizes above ~1 mm. This
underestimation is possibly linked to the complex oscillatory and rotational
motion of droplets which cannot be faithfully captured by measurement or
modelled by the correction algorithm without additional information.

in situations where the terrain is not known a priori. For these reasons,
learning a terramechanics model online is desirable to increase the

(HVDT) at Atwood numbers up to 0.75 and large Reynolds numbers is studied by
using high-resolution Direct Numerical Simulations. To help understand the
highly non-equilibrium nature of buoyancy-driven HVDT, the flow evolution is
divided into four different regimes based on the behavior of turbulent kinetic
energy derivatives. The results show that each regime has a unique type of
dependency on both Atwood and Reynolds numbers. It is found that the local
statistics of the flow based on the flow composition are more sensitive to
Atwood and Reynolds numbers compared to those based on the entire flow. It is
also observed that at higher Atwood numbers, different flow features reach
their asymptotic Reynolds number behavior at different times. The energy
spectrum defined based on the Favre fluctuations momentum has less large scale
contamination from viscous effects for variable density flows with constant
properties, compared to other forms used previously. The evolution of the
energy spectrum highlights distinct dynamical features of the four flow
regimes. Thus, the slope of the energy spectrum at intermediate to large scales
evolves from -7/3 to -1, as a function of the production to dissipation ratio.
The classical Kolmogorov spectrum emerges at intermediate to high scales at the
highest Reynolds numbers examined, after the turbulence starts to decay.
Finally, the similarities and differences between buoyancy-driven HVDT and the
more conventional stationary turbulence are discussed and new strategies and
tools for analysis are proposed.

significant attention. These algorithms can be collectively called image domain
based methods, whose common drawback is the requirement of great number of
iterations for some acceptable solution. Meanwhile, the sparsity of images in a
certain transform domain has also been exploited in image denoising problems.
Sparsity transform learning algorithms can achieve extremely fast computations
as well as desirable performance. By taking both advantages of image domain and
transform domain in a general framework, we propose a sparsity transform
learning and weighted singular values minimization method (STLWSM) for IDN
problems. The proposed method can make full use of the preponderance of both

promote lattice dislocations to instanton-like objects, introducing
nonperturbative lattice artifacts to the step scaling function. Motivated by
the observation that Wilson flow sufficiently suppresses these artifacts, we
choose Wilson flow with the Symanzik operator as our preferred analysis. We
study systematic effects by calculating the step-scaling function based on
alternative flows (Zeuthen or Symanzik), alternative operators (Wilson
plaquette, clover), and also explore the effects of the perturbative tree-level
improvement. Further we investigate the effects due to the finite value of

particular, many control-theoretic LbC methods require subject matter expertise
in order to translate their own safety guarantees, often manifested as
preexisting data of safe trajectories or structural model knowledge. In this
paper, we focus on LbC where the controller is applied directly to a system of
which it has no or extremely limited direct experience, towards safety during
tabula-rasa or ``blank slate'' model-based learning and control. This explores
the boundary of the status-quo in control theory relating to requirements for
subject matter expertise. We show under basic and limited assumptions on the
underlying problem, we can translate probabilistic guarantees on feasibility to
nonlinear systems using existing results in stochastic MPC and DRO literature.
We also present a coupled and intuitive formulation for persistence of

of the proposed method. Our case studies of vehicle obstacle avoidance and safe
extreme fast charging of lithium-ion batteries reveal powerful empirical
results supporting the underlying DRO theory. Our method is widely applicable

consistent and simultaneous decoding of an arbitrary number of sequences. Our

previously generated output, to make a prediction at a given step of decoding.
Self-attention, in the GNN, is used to modulate the fusion mechanism locally at
each node and each step in the decoding process. We show the efficacy of our

makes the nexus between electricity generation on the physical side and the
consumers and the critical loads on the social side is the power flow
algorithm. Specifically, the levels of emotion, empathy, cooperation, and the
physical health of the consumers, prosumers are modeled in the proposed
community resilience optimization approach while accounting for the electric
power system constraints and their impact on the critical loads, which include
hospitals, shelters, and gas stations, to name a few. The optimization accounts
for the fact that the level of satisfaction of the society, the living
standards, and the social well-being are depended on the supply of energy,
including electricity. Evidently, the lack of electric energy resulting from
load shedding has an impact on both the mental and the psychical quality of
life, which in turn affects the community resilience. The developed constrained
community resilience optimization method is applied to two case studies,
including a two-area 6-buses system and a modified IEEE RTS 24-bus system.
Simulation results reveal that a decrease in the initial values of the emotion,
the risk perception, and the social media platform effect factor entails an
increase in load shedding, which in turn results in a decrease in community
resilience. In contrast, an increase in the initial values of cooperation,
empathy, physical health, the capacity of microgrids and distributed energy
resources results in a decrease in the load shedding, which in turn induces an
enhancement of the community resilience.

skeptically oriented, may convince spreaders to stop their activity or, once
exposed to the rumor, decide not to propagate it as a consequence, for example,
of fact-checking. We extend a previous, mean-field analysis of the combined
effect of these two mechanisms, active and passive skepticism, to include
spatial correlations. This can be done either analytically, through the pair
approximation, or simulating an agent-based version on diverse networks. Our
results show that while in mean-field there is no coexistence between spreaders
and susceptibles (although, depending on the parameters, there may be
bistability depending on the initial conditions), when spatial correlations are
included, because of the protective effect of the isolation provided by removed
agents, coexistence is possible.

different scenarios for each video depending on the variety of foreground and
background motion, frame rate, and occlusion. It is therefore difficult for a
single network with fixed parameters to generalize across different videos.
Ideally, one could have a different network for each scenario, but this is
computationally infeasible for practical applications. In this work, we propose
to adapt the model to each video by making use of additional information that
is readily available at test time and yet has not been exploited in previous
works. We first show the benefits of `test-time adaptation' through simple
fine-tuning of a network, then we greatly improve its efficiency by
incorporating meta-learning. We obtain significant performance gains with only
a single gradient update without any additional parameters. Finally, we show
that our meta-learning framework can be easily employed to any video frame
interpolation network and can consistently improve its performance on multiple

the complex plane. The motivation behind our questions, however, comes from
more general energy integrals of mathematical models of Hyperelasticity. The
Dirichlet Principle, the name coined by Riemann, tells us that the outer
variation of a harmonic mapping increases its energy. Surprisingly, when one
jumps into details about inner variations, which are just a change of
independent variables, new equations and related questions start to matter. The
inner variational equation, called the Hopf Laplace equation, is no longer the
Laplace equation. Its solutions are generally not harmonic; we refer to them as
Hopf harmonics. The natural question that arises is how does a change of
variables in the domain of a Hopf harmonic map affect its energy? We show,
among other results, that in case of a simply connected domain the energy
increases. This should be viewed as Riemann's Dirichlet Principle for Hopf
harmonics.
  The Dirichlet Principle for Hopf harmonics in domains of higher connectivity
is not completely solved. What complicates the matter is the insufficient
knowledge of global structure of trajectories of the associated Hopf quadratic
differentials, mainly because of the presence of recurrent trajectories.
Nevertheless, we have established the Dirichlet Principle whenever the Hopf
differential admits closed trajectories and crosscuts. Regardless of these
assumptions, we established the so-called Infinitesimal Dirichlet Principle for
all domains and all Hopf harmonics. Precisely, the second order term of inner
variation of a Hopf harmonic map is always nonnegative.

derivative ($\dot{\nu}$) of pulsars, the origin of which remains not well
understood yet, partly because the jump processes of most glitches are not well
time-resolved. There are three large glitches of the Crab pulsar, detected in
1989, 1996 and 2017, which were found to have delayed spin-up processes before
the normal recovery processes. Here we report two additional glitches of the
Crab pulsar occurred in 2004 and 2011 for which we discovered delayed spin up
processes, and present refined parameters of the largest glitch occurred in
2017. The initial rising time of the glitch is determined as $<0.48$ hour. We
also carried out a statistical study of these five glitches with observed
spin-up processes. The two glitches occurred in 2004 and 2011 have delayed
spin-up time scales ($\tau_{1}$) of $1.7\pm0.8$\,days and $1.6\pm0.4$\,days,
respectively. We find that the $\Delta{\nu}$ vs. $|\Delta{\dot\nu}|$ relation
of these five glitches is similar to those with no detected delayed spin-up
process, indicating that they are similar to the others in nature except that
they have larger amplitudes. For these five glitches, the amplitudes of the
delayed spin-up process ($|\Delta{\nu}_{\rm d1}|$) and recovery process
($\Delta{\nu}_{\rm d2}$), their time scales ($\tau_{1}$, $\tau_{2}$), and
permanent changes in spin frequency ($\Delta{\nu}_{\rm p}$) and total frequency
step ($\Delta{\nu}_{\rm g}$) have positive correlations. From these
correlations, we suggest that the delayed spin-up processes are common for all
glitches, but are too short and thus difficult to be detected for most
glitches.

measurement Kalman filter (CMKF) converts the raw measurement into Cartesian
coordinates prior to tracking, which avoids the pitfalls of the extended Kalman
filter (EKF). The challenges of CMKF are debiasing the converted measurement
and approximating the converted measurement error covariance. Due to no closed
form of biases, this letter utilizes the second order Taylor series expansion
of the conventional measurement conversion to find the conversion bias in
bistatic radar, which derives the Unbiased Converted Measurement (UCM). In
order to decorrelate the converted measurement error covariance from the
measurement noise, the prediction is utilized to evaluate the covariance, which
derives the Decorrelated Unbiased Converted Measurement (DUCM). Monte Carlo
simulations show that the DUCM is unbiased and consistent, and the DUCM filter
exhibits the improved performance compared with the conventional CMKF and the
UCM filter in bistatic radar tracking.

  Method for Semantic Segmentation","CVPRW 2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning segmentation from synthetic data and adapting to real data can
significantly relieve human efforts in labelling pixel-level masks. A key
challenge of this task is how to alleviate the data distribution discrepancy
between the source and target domains, i.e. reducing domain shift. The common
approach to this problem is to minimize the discrepancy between feature
distributions from different domains through adversarial training. However,
directly aligning the feature distribution globally cannot guarantee
consistency from a local view (i.e. semantic-level), which prevents certain
semantic knowledge learned on the source domain from being applied to the
target domain. To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-supervised approach
named Alleviating Semantic-level Shift (ASS), which can successfully promote
the distribution consistency from both global and local views. Specifically,
leveraging a small number of labeled data from the target domain, we directly
extract semantic-level feature representations from both the source and the
target domains by averaging the features corresponding to same categories
advised by pixel-level masks. We then feed the produced features to the
discriminator to conduct semantic-level adversarial learning, which
collaborates with the adversarial learning from the global view to better
alleviate the domain shift. We apply our ASS to two domain adaptation tasks,
from GTA5 to Cityscapes and from Synthia to Cityscapes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) ASS can significantly outperform the current unsupervised
state-of-the-arts by employing a small number of annotated samples from the
target domain; (2) ASS can beat the oracle model trained on the whole target
dataset by over 3 points by augmenting the synthetic source data with annotated
samples from the target domain without suffering from the prevalent problem of
overfitting to the source domain.

further classes of priors that are applicable in very general scenarios; one
where the sufficient statistics is not available and another where the

the interpretation and elicitation aspects of the classes proposed here as well

transferring or storing encoded symbols, while the process of encoding itself
is error-free. Motivated by recent applications of coding theory, in this
paper, we consider the case where the process of encoding is distributed and
prone to error. We introduce the problem of distributed encoding, comprising of
$K\in\mathbb{N}$ isolated source nodes and $N\in\mathbb{N}$ encoding nodes.
Each source node has one symbol from a finite field and sends it to all
encoding nodes. Each encoding node stores an encoded symbol, as a function of
the received symbols. However, some of the source nodes are controlled by the
adversary and may send different symbols to different encoding nodes. Depending
on the number of adversarial nodes, denoted by $\beta\in\mathbb{N}$, and the
number of symbols that each one generates, denoted by $v\in\mathbb{N}$, the
process of decoding from the encoded symbols could be impossible. Assume that a
decoder connects to an arbitrary subset of $t \in\mathbb{N}$ encoding nodes and
wants to decode the symbols of the honest nodes correctly, without necessarily
identifying the sets of honest and adversarial nodes. In this paper, we study
$t^*\in\mathbb{N}$, the minimum of $t$, which is a function of $K$, $N$,
$\beta$, and $v$. We show that when the encoding nodes use linear coding,
$t^*_{\textrm{linear}}=K+2\beta(v-1)$, if $N\ge K+2\beta(v-1)$, and
$t^*_{\textrm{linear}}=N$, if $N\le K+2\beta(v-1)$. In order to achieve
$t^*_{\textrm{linear}}$, we use random linear coding and show that in any
feasible solution that the decoder finds, the messages of the honest nodes are
decoded correctly. For the converse of the fundamental limit, we show that when
the adversary behaves in a particular way, it can always confuse the decoder
between two feasible solutions that differ in the message of at least one
honest node.

the HAE is a useful tracer for the large-scale structure of the Universe

filamentary structures. The H$\alpha$ LFs within a survey area of $\sim$2

a critical step for association analysis and predictive modeling. Signal
detection in the high dimensional setting often fails due to the limited sample

on the same scientific question. However, integrative analysis of high
dimensional data from multiple studies is challenging in the presence of
between study heterogeneity. The challenge is even more pronounced with
additional data sharing constraints under which only summary data but not
individual level data can be shared across different sites. In this paper, we
propose a novel data shielding integrative large-scale testing (DSILT) approach
to signal detection by allowing between study heterogeneity and not requiring
sharing of individual level data. Assuming the underlying high dimensional
regression models of the data differ across studies yet share similar support,
the DSILT approach incorporates proper integrative estimation and debiasing
procedures to construct test statistics for the overall effects of specific
covariates. We also develop a multiple testing procedure to identify
significant effects while controlling for false discovery rate (FDR) and false
discovery proportion (FDP). Theoretical comparisons of the DSILT procedure with
the ideal individual--level meta--analysis (ILMA) approach and other
distributed inference methods are investigated. Simulation studies demonstrate
that the DSILT procedure performs well in both false discovery control and
attaining power. The proposed method is applied to a real example on detecting
interaction effect of the genetic variants for statins and obesity on the risk

integral of discontinuous SMC, producing control signals of finite slope.
Nevertheless, LCSMC still generate chattering in the presence of fast parasitic
dynamics. In this paper, an analysis of chattering in systems driven by LCSMC
is performed using the Harmonic Balance (HB) approach. Two kinds of LCSMC are
considered: the first one is based on a linear sliding variable (LSV) and the
second one on a terminal switching variable (TSV). Predictions of the amplitude
and frequency of self-excited oscillations allowed to compute the average power
consumed by the controller, in order to maintain the trajectories into the real
sliding mode. A comparison of LCSMC with the Super-Twisting controller (STC),
which produce a continuous control signal with infinite slope, is performed.
Theoretical predictions and simulation results confirm that LCSMC may induce
fast-oscillations (chattering) of smaller amplitude and average power than
those ones caused by the STC. But, surprisingly, the chattering generated by
LSV-LCSMC could be smaller than that one caused by TSV-LCSMC, when the
actuators are fast enough. On the other hand, it tuns that if the sliding
dynamics of the LSV-LCSMC closed-loop is of similar speed as the actuators
dynamics, the system can loose even practical stability.

with two flat regions has two photon spheres and an antiphoton sphere for
$\lambda<\sqrt{2}/2$ and a photon sphere for $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}/2$. When
the parameter $\lambda$ is $\sqrt{2}/2$, the photon sphere is marginally
unstable because of degeneration of the photon spheres and antiphoton sphere.
We investigate gravitational lensing by the wormhole in weak and strong
gravitational fields. We find that the deflection angle of a light ray
reflected by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverges nonlogarithmically
in a strong deflection limit for $\lambda=\sqrt{2}/2$, while the deflection
angle reflected by the photon sphere diverges logarithmically for $\lambda \neq

significant attention by the scientific community. However, in real-world
scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby
precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in
order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic.
Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only $n$ nodes are observed
at a time and the most central between these $n$ nodes is immunized (or
attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until $1-p$ fraction of nodes
are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this
approach and determine the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ and the size of
the giant component $P_{\infty}$ for networks with arbitrary degree
distributions $P(k)$. In the limit of $n\to\infty$ we recover prior work on
targeted attack, whereas for $n=1$ we recover the known case of random failure.
Between these two extremes, we observe that as $n$ increases, $p_c$ increases
quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with
complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between
$|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|$ and $n$ as $|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|\sim n^{-1}\exp(-\alpha
n)$. For Scale-free (SF) networks, where $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}, 2<\gamma<3$, we
find that $p_c$ has a transition from zero to non-zero when $n$ increases from
$n=1$ to order of $\log N$ ($N$ is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks,
knowledge of order of $\log N$ nodes and immunizing them can reduce
dramatically an epidemics.

example in shallow water waves and nonlinear optics, for which several types of

ultracold atoms as a tunable quantum simulations platform for higher-order
systems. Degenerate quantum gases are well controlled model systems for the
experimental study of dispersive hydrodynamics in superfluids and have been
used to investigate phenomena such as vortices, solitons, dispersive shock
waves and quantum turbulence. With the advent of Raman-induced spin-orbit
coupling, the dispersion of a dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensate can be
modified in a flexible way, allowing for detailed investigations of
higher-order dispersion dynamics. Here we present a combined experimental and
theoretical study of shock structures generated in such a system. The breaking
of Galilean invariance by the spin-orbit coupling allows two different types of
shock structures to emerge simultaneously in a single system. Numerical
simulations suggest that the behavior of these shock structures is affected by
interactions with vortices in a manner reminiscent of emerging viscous
hydrodynamics due to an underlying quantum turbulence in the system. This
result suggests that spin-orbit coupling can be used as a powerful means to tun
the effective viscosity in cold-atom experiments serving as quantum simulators

leads to directly implementing information processing tasks on an IoT device
for bandwidth savings and privacy assurance. Particularly, monitoring and
tracking the observed signals in continuous form are common tasks for a variety
of near real-time processing IoT devices, such as in smart homes, body-area and
environmental sensing applications. However, these systems are likely low-cost
resource-constrained embedded systems, equipped with compact memory space,
whereby the ability to store the full information state of continuous signals
is limited. Hence, in this paper, we develop solutions of efficient timely
processing embedded systems for online classification and tracking of
continuous signals with compact memory space. Particularly, we focus on the
application of smart plugs that are capable of timely classification of
appliance types and tracking of appliance behavior in a standalone manner. We
implemented a smart plug prototype using low-cost Arduino platform with small
amount of memory space to demonstrate the following timely processing
operations: (1) learning and classifying the patterns associated with the
continuous power consumption signals, and (2) tracking the occurrences of
signal patterns using small local memory space. Furthermore, our system designs
are also sufficiently generic for timely monitoring and tracking applications
in other resource-constrained IoT devices.

  drift model using the coalescent, diffusion with orthogonal polynomials, and
  the Moran model","26 pages, 2 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In population genetics, extant samples are usually used for inference of past
population genetic forces. With the Kingman coalescent and the backward
diffusion equation, inference of the marginal likelihood proceeds from an
extant sample backward in time. Conditional on an extant sample, the Moran
model can also be used backward in time with identical results, up to a scaling
of time. In particular, all three approaches -- the coalescent, the backward
diffusion, and the Moran model -- lead to the identical marginal likelihood of
the sample. If probabilities of ancestral states are also inferred, either of
discrete ancestral allele particle configurations, as in the coalescent, or of
ancestral population allele proportions, as in the backward diffusion, the
backward algorithm needs to be combined with the corresponding forward
algorithm to the forward-backward algorithm. Generally orthogonal polynomials,
solving the diffusion equation, are numerically simpler than the other
approaches: they implicitly sum over many intermediate ancestral particle
configurations; furthermore, while the Moran model requires iterative matrix
multiplication with a transition matrix of a dimension of the population size
squared, expansion of the polynomials is only necessary up to the sample size.
For discrete samples, forward-in-time moving pure birth processes similar to
the Polya- or Hoppe-urn models complement the backward-looking coalescent.
Because, the sample size is a random variable forward in time, pure-birth
processes are unsuited to model population demography given extant samples.
With orthogonal polynomials, however, not only ancestral allele proportions but
also probabilities of ancestral particle configurations can be calculated
easily. Assuming only mutation and drift, the use of orthogonal polynomials is
numerically advantageous over alternative strategies.

  Coordination Against Uncoordinated Interference",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL)-based
multi-access point (AP) coordination method that is robust even against
unexpected decentralized operations of uncoordinated APs. Multi-AP coordination
is a promising technique towards IEEE 802.11be, and there are studies that use
RL for multi-AP coordination. Indeed, a simple RL-based multi-AP coordination
method diminishes the collision probability among the APs; therefore, the
method is a promising approach to improve time-resource efficiency. However,
this method is vulnerable to frame transmissions of uncoordinated APs that are
less aware of frame transmissions of other coordinated APs. To help the central
agent experience even such unexpected frame transmissions, in addition to the
central agent, the proposed method also competitively trains an adversarial AP
that disturbs coordinated APs by causing frame collisions intensively. Besides,
we propose to exploit a history of frame losses of a coordinated AP to promote
reasonable competition between the central agent and adversarial AP. The
simulation results indicate that the proposed method can avoid uncoordinated
interference and thereby improve the minimum sum of the throughputs in the
system compared to not considering the uncoordinated AP.

($M_{sub} > 2.5 \times 10^9h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, or $V_{max} > 70 kms^{-1}$) but
more abundant for less massive subhaloes in the NHD simulations. This results
in different shapes in the subhalo mass/$V_{max}$ function in two different

$10^{10} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ have larger $V_{max}$ in the NHD than DMO

The survival number fraction of the accreted low mass progenitors of the main

descent, which utilize the Bregman divergence as distance-measuring function

full-information feedback and bandit feedback. For the full-information
feedback model, the first algorithm attains an average regularized regret of
order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ with the total number of rounds $T$. The second

predefined area to serve a number of ground users. Due to the heterogeneous
nature of the network,the UAVs may cause severe interference to the
transmissions of each other. Hence, a judicious design of the user-UAV
association and UAV locations is desired. A potential game is defined where the
players are the UAVs. The potential function is the total sum-rate of the
users. The agents utility in the potential games is their marginal contribution
to the global welfare or their so-called wonderful life utility. A
game-theoretic learning algorithm, binary log-linear learning (BLLL), is then
applied to the problem. Given the potential game structure, a consequence of
our utility design, the stochastically stable states using BLLL are guaranteed
to be the potential maximizers. Hence, we optimally solve the user-UAV
association and 3D-location problem. Next, we exploit the sub-modular features
of the sum rate function for a given configuration of UAVs to design an
efficient greedy algorithm. Despite the simplicity of the greedy algorithm, it
comes with a guaranteed performance of $1-1/e$ of the optimal solution. To
further reduce the number of iterations, we propose another heuristic greedy
algorithm that provides very good results. Our simulations show that, in
practice, the proposed greedy approaches achieve significant performance in a
few number of iterations.

particularly severe when subsequent depth reconstructions are accumulated in an

aggregates initial depth predictions from multiple adjacent views into one

over a sky area of approximately 50 deg$^{2}$. In a purely blind search we did

Assuming a fiducial value for the HI spin temperature of $T_{\rm spin}$ = 100 K

inclination and position angle of the inner disk, which provides direct
evidence that the inner and outer disks are misaligned in this pre-transitional
system. This may account for the shadows previously detected in the outer disk.
We show that BrG emission arises from an even more compact region than the
inner disk, with an upper limit of 0.047 au (5 Rstar). Differential phase
measurements between the BrG line and the continuum allow us to measure the
astrometric displacement of the BrG line-emitting region relative to the

material are being designed for the CMS endcap calorimeter upgrade and have
been proposed for the electromagnetic calorimeters at CLIC, ILC and FCC-ee. The
silicon sensors in such experiments are foreseen to cover a very large area of
O(1000 $\mathrm{m^2}$). They are typically produced from 6- or 8-inch wafers
and consist of a few hundred smaller cells, each with an area of O(0.1 to 1.1
$\mathrm{cm^2}$). Currently the CMS endcap calorimeter upgrade is in a
prototyping phase with the aim of choosing the final sensor design. Flexible
systems are needed for quick sensor characterization as close as possible to
operating conditions, for testing different prototypes and for quality control
during mass production. The ARRAY system consists of an active switching matrix
PCB with 512 input channels and a passive probe card specific for each sensor
layout prototype. The probe card makes contact with each individual pad through
spring-loaded pins. ARRAY is designed to measure the leakage current and
capacitance per-cell for different bias voltages, keeping the entire sensor
area under bias. The Hexaboard probe card follows a similar principle: readout
electronics foreseen to be used in the final CMS detector are mounted on a PCB
that makes contact with the sensor through spring-loaded pins. It is used to
perform noise and charge collection efficiency measurements with irradiated
sensors without the need for module assembly. We present the design of the
ARRAY and Hexaboard systems as well as measurements performed on different CMS
prototype silicon sensors. We also compare the results with alternative
multi-needle setups.

increased importance of real-time heatwave risk management on a fine-grained

models consider higher-order stochastic spatial properties such as skewness and
kurtosis, which are key components for understanding and describing local
temperature fluctuations and UHI's. The developed models are applied to the
greater Tokyo metropolitan area for a detailed real-world data case study. The
analysis also demonstrates how to statistically incorporate a variety of real
data sets. This includes remotely sensed imagery and a variety of ground-based
monitoring site data to build models linking city and urban covariates to air

high-resolution spatial emulator outputs for ground surface temperature
modelling. The main class of processes studied includes the Tukey g-and-h
processes for capturing spatial and temporal aspects of heat processes in urban

This work is motivated by the need to identify features that discriminate
between neurological conditions on which local field potentials (LFPs) were

mean and thus the first moments of these random processes do not have
discriminating power. We propose the variation pattern classification (VPC)
method {which employs the (auto-)covariance operators as the discriminating
features} and uses the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to measure the discrepancy between
the (auto-)covariance operators of different groups. The proposed VPC method is
demonstrated to be sensitive to the discrepancy, {potentially leading to a
higher rate of classification}. One important innovation lies in the dimension
reduction where the VPC method data-adaptively determines the basis functions
(discriminative feature functions) that account for the major discrepancy. In
addition, the selected discriminative feature functions provide insights on the
discrepancy between different groups because they reveal the features of
variation pattern that differentiate groups. Consistency properties are
established and, furthermore, simulation studies and the analysis of rat brain
LFP trajectories empirically demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of
the proposed method.

GPa, our data reveal that the hole - electron carriers are thermally balanced

place. Within the pressure range from 1bar to PC, T* is continuously suppressed
by pressure, while TC increases monotonically. At about PC, T* is
indistinguishable and TC reaches a maximum value. Moreover, a pressure-induced
sign change of RH is found at ~PC where the orthorhombic-monoclinic phase
transition occurs. With further compression, TC decreases and disappears at ~
12 GPa. The correlation among the electron-hole balance, crystal structure and

number of successful applications to different kinds of operations research
problems is rather scarce. Reinforcement learning is based on the well-studied
dynamic programming technique and thus also aims at finding the best stationary
policy for a given Markov Decision Process, but in contrast does not require
any model knowledge. The policy is assessed solely on consecutive states (or
state-action pairs), which are observed while an agent explores the solution
space. The contributions of this paper are manifold. First we provide deep
theoretical insights to the widely applied standard discounted reinforcement
learning framework, which give rise to the understanding of why these
algorithms are inappropriate when permanently provided with non-zero rewards,
such as costs or profit. Second, we establish a novel near-Blackwell-optimal
reinforcement learning algorithm. In contrary to former method it assesses the
average reward per step separately and thus prevents the incautious combination
of different types of state values. Thereby, the Laurent Series expansion of
the discounted state values forms the foundation for this development and also
provides the connection between the two approaches. Finally, we prove the
viability of our algorithm on a challenging problem set, which includes a
well-studied M/M/1 admission control queuing system. In contrast to standard
discounted reinforcement learning our algorithm infers the optimal policy on

structures has been actively explored by recent studies. We investigate how the
key results are affected by two popular approximations. One is to implement the
streaming by accounting for only the relative motion while assuming ``baryons
trace dark matter"" spatially at the initialization of simulation. This neglects
the smoothing on the gas density taking place before the initialization. In our
simulation initialized at $z_i=200$, it overestimates the gas density power
spectrum by up to 40\% at $k\approx10^2~h~\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=20$. Halo mass
($M_h$) and baryonic fraction in halos ($f_{b,h}$) are also overestimated, but
the relation between the two remains unchanged. The other approximation tested
is to artificially amplify the density/velocity fluctuations in the cosmic mean
density to simulate the first minihalos that form in overdense regions. This
gives a head start to the halo growth while the subsequent growth is similar to
that in the mean density. The growth in a true overdense region, on the other
hand, is accelerated gradually in time. For example, raising $\sigma_8$ by 50\%
effectively transforms $z\rightarrow\sqrt{1.5}z$ in the halo mass growth
history while in 2-$\sigma$ overdensity, the growth is accelerated by a
constant in redshift: $z\rightarrow{z+4.8}$. As a result, halos have grown more
in the former than in the latter before $z\approx27$ and vice versa after. The
$f_{b,h}$-$M_h$ relation is unchanged in those cases as well, suggesting that
the Pop III formation rate for a given $M_h$ is insensitive to the tested
approximations.

important astrophysical discoveries of the recent years. Due to the extreme
matter and gravity conditions and the rich dynamics developed, it becomes a
tremendous challenge to accurately simulate numerically all the scales present
during the collision. Here we present how to study such systems by using large
eddy simulations with a self-consistent subgrid-scale gradient model, that we
generalized to the special relativistic case in a previous work and now extend
to the general relativistic case. Adapted from nonrelativistic scenarios, the
so-called gradient model allows to capture part of the effects of the hidden
dynamics on the resolved scales, by means of a physically-agnostic,
mathematically-based Taylor expansion of the nonlinear terms in the
conservative evolution equations' fluxes. We assess the validity of this
approach in bounding-box simulations of the magnetic Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. Several resolutions and a broad range of scenarios are considered
in order to carefully test the performance of the model under three crucial
aspects: (i) highly curved backgrounds, (ii) jumps on the fluid density
profiles and (iii) strong shocks. The results suggest our extension of the
gradient subgrid-scale model to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics is a
promising approach for studying binary neutron stars mergers, and potentially
to other relevant astrophysical scenarios.

reconstruction of knee bones directly from two bi-planar X-ray images.
Clinically, capturing the 3D models of the bones is crucial for surgical
planning, implant fitting, and postoperative evaluation. X-ray imaging
significantly reduces the exposure of patients to ionizing radiation compared
to Computer Tomography (CT) imaging, and is much more common and inexpensive
compared to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners. However, retrieving 3D
models from such 2D scans is extremely challenging. In contrast to the common
approach of statistically modeling the shape of each bone, our deep network
learns the distribution of the bones' shapes directly from the training images.
We train our model with both supervised and unsupervised losses using Digitally
Reconstructed Radiograph (DRR) images generated from CT scans. To apply our
model to X-Ray data, we use style transfer to transform between X-Ray and DRR
modalities. As a result, at test time, without further optimization, our
solution directly outputs a 3D reconstruction from a pair of bi-planar X-ray
images, while preserving geometric constraints. Our results indicate that our
deep learning model is very efficient, generalizes well and produces high
quality reconstructions.

protoplanetary disks exchange torques with the disk and change their semi-major
axis accordingly. This process is called type I migration and is strongly
dependent on the underlying disk structure. As a result, there are many
uncertainties about planetary migration in general. In a number of simulations,
the current type I migration rates lead to planets reaching the inner edge of
the disk within the disk lifetime. A new kind of torque exchange between planet
and disk, the thermal torque, aims to slow down inward migration via the
heating torque. The heating torque may even cause planets to migrate outwards,
if the planetary luminosity is large enough. Here, we study the influence on
planetary migration of the thermal torque on top of previous type I models. We
find that the formula of Paardekooper et al. (2011) allows for more outward
migration than that of Jim\'enez & Masset (2017) in most configurations, but we
also find that planets evolve to very similar mass and final orbital radius
using both formulae in a single planet-formation scenario, including pebble and
gas accretion. Adding the thermal torque can introduce new, but small, regions
of outwards migration if the accretion rates onto the planet correspond to
typical solid accretion rates following the pebble accretion scenario. If the
accretion rates onto the planets become very large, as could be the case in
environments with large pebble fluxes (e.g., high-metallicity environments),
the thermal torque can allow more efficient outward migration. However, even
then, the changes for the final mass and orbital positions in our planet
formation scenario are quite small. This implies that for single planet
evolution scenarios, the influence of the heating torque is probably
negligible.

problems, where both communication and sensing are considered. We first study
the optimal combination of two pre-generated subbeams, and their beamforming

derived to the constrained optimization problems, where the received signal

By converting the original intractable complex NP-hard global optimization

  Balancing Systems",,,,,"math.PR cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mean field models are a popular tool used to analyse load balancing policies.
In some cases the waiting time distribution of the mean field limit has an
explicit form. In other cases it can be computed as the solution of a set of
differential equations. Here we study the limit of the mean waiting time
$E[W_\lambda]$ as the arrival rate $\lambda$ approaches $1$ for a number of
load balancing policies when job sizes are exponential with mean $1$ (i.e. the
system gets close to instability). As $E[W_\lambda]$ diverges to infinity, we
scale with $-\log(1-\lambda)$ and present a method to compute the limit
$\lim_{\lambda\rightarrow 1^-}-E[W_\lambda]/\log(1-\lambda)$. This limit has a
surprisingly simple form for the load balancing algorithms considered. We
present a general result that holds for any policy for which the associated
differential equation satisfies a list of assumptions. For the LL(d) policy
which assigns an incoming job to a server with the least work left among d
randomly selected servers these assumptions are trivially verified. For this
policy we prove the limit is given by $\frac{1}{d-1}$. We further show that the
LL(d,K) policy, which assigns batches of $K$ jobs to the $K$ least loaded
servers among d randomly selected servers, satisfies the assumptions and the
limit is equal to $\frac{K}{d-K}$. For a policy which applies LL($d_i$) with
probability $p_i$, we show that the limit is given by
$\frac{1}{\sum_ip_id_i-1}$. We further indicate that our main result can also
be used for load balancers with redundancy or memory. In addition, we propose
an alternate scaling $-\log(p_\lambda)$ instead of $-\log(1-\lambda)$, for
which the limit $\lim_{\lambda\rightarrow 0^+}-E[W_\lambda]/\log(p_\lambda)$ is
well defined and non-zero (contrary to $\lim_{\lambda\rightarrow

techno-economic, resilience and reliability objectives. Storage and distributed
generation are optionally installed to complement renewable generation,
enabling the microgrid to supply priority demands during stochastic islanding
events with uncertain duration. For a comprehensive quantification and
optimization of microgrid resilience and reliability, islanding due to external

the traffic flow and unpredictable accidents/congestion. To give accurate and
reliable navigation results, predicting the future traffic
flow(speed,congestion,volume,etc) in a fast and accurate way is of great
importance. In this paper, we adopt the ideas of ensemble learning and develop
a two-stage machine learning model to give accurate navigation results. We
model the traffic flow as a time series and apply XGBoost algorithm to get
accurate predictions on future traffic conditions(1st stage). We then apply the
Top K Dijkstra algorithm to find a set of shortest paths from the give start
point to the destination as the candidates of the output optimal path. With the
prediction results in the 1st stage, we find one optimal path from the
candidates as the output of the navigation algorithm. We show that our
navigation algorithm can be greatly improved via EOPF(Enhanced Optimal Path
Finding), which is based on neural network(2nd stage). We show that our method
can be over 7% better than the method without EOPF in many situations, which
indicates the effectiveness of our model.

with normalized diffusion anisotropy indices (DAIs). Most often, the fractional
anisotropy (FA) is used, but several alternative DAIs have been introduced in
attempts to maximize the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in diffusion anisotropy
maps. Examples include the scaled relative anisotropy (sRA), the gamma variate
anisotropy index (GV), the surface anisotropy (UAsurf), and the lattice index
(LI). With the advent of multidimensional diffusion encoding it became possible
to determine the presence of microscopic diffusion anisotropy in a voxel, which
is theoretically independent of orientation coherence. In accordance with DTI,
the microscopic anisotropy is typically quantified by the microscopic
fractional anisotropy (uFA). In this work, in addition to the uFA, the four
microscopic diffusion anisotropy indices (uDAIs) usRA, uGV, uUAsurf, and uLI
are defined in analogy to the respective DAIs by means of the average diffusion
tensor and the covariance tensor. Simulations with three representative
distributions of microscopic diffusion tensors revealed distinct CNR
differences when differentiating between isotropic and microscopically
anisotropic diffusion. q-Space trajectory imaging (QTI) was employed to acquire
brain in-vivo maps of all indices. For this purpose, a 15 min protocol
featuring linear, planar, and spherical tensor encoding was used. The resulting
maps were of good quality and exhibited different contrasts, e.g. between gray
and white matter. This indicates that it may be beneficial to use more than one
uDAI in future investigational studies.

Revenue Maximization under the Size Budget (RMSB) problem. If taking into

distributed over the whole network. The objective function of RMSB and RMCB is
adatpive monotone and not adaptive submodular, but in some special cases, it is
adaptive submodular. We study the RMSB and RMCB problem under both the speical
submodular cases and general non-submodular cases, and propose RMSBSolver and

Especially, we give a data-dependent approximation ratio for RMSB problem under

an instance-level balanced replay scheme, which is a memory-efficient
approximation to balance the instance-level samples from the old-class images.
We also propose to use a meta-module for new-class learning, where the module
parameters are shared across incremental phases, gaining the learning-to-learn
knowledge incrementally, from the data-rich head to the data-poor tail. We

Universe. However, how these fierce explosions are produced itself is still a
highly debated issue. There are mainly two popular models for SNe Ia, i.e. the
double-degenerate scenario and the single-degenerate scenario. The
double-degenerate scenario suggests that SNe Ia are produced by the coalescence
of two degenerate white dwarfs, while the single-degenerate scenario suggests
that the continuous accretion of a single degenerate white dwarf from its
normal stellar companion will finally lead to a disastrous explosion when it is
over-massive, resulting in an SN Ia. The rapid development of the gravitational
wave astronomy sheds new light on the nature of SNe Ia. In this study, we
calculate the gravitational wave emissions of double white dwarf coalescences

found that the gravitational wave emissions from double white dwarf mergers in

set of methods to leverage information about the semantic hierarchy induced by
class labels. In the first part of the thesis, we inject label-hierarchy
knowledge to an arbitrary classifier and empirically show that availability of
such external semantic information in conjunction with the visual semantics
from images boosts overall performance. Taking a step further in this
direction, we model more explicitly the label-label and label-image
interactions by using order-preserving embedding-based models, prevalent in
natural language, and tailor them to the domain of computer vision to perform
image classification. Although, contrasting in nature, both the CNN-classifiers
injected with hierarchical information, and the embedding-based models
outperform a hierarchy-agnostic model on the newly presented, real-world ETH

improve speech understanding. Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG)
have shown that it is possible to identify the target speaker from single-trial
EEG recordings using auditory attention decoding (AAD) methods. AAD methods
reconstruct the attended speech envelope from EEG recordings, based on a linear
least-squares cost function or non-linear neural networks, and then directly
compare the reconstructed envelope with the speech envelopes of speakers to
identify the attended speaker using Pearson correlation coefficients. Since
these correlation coefficients are highly fluctuating, for a reliable decoding
a large correlation window is used, which causes a large processing delay. In
this paper, we investigate a state-space model using correlation coefficients
obtained with a small correlation window to improve the decoding performance of
the linear and the non-linear AAD methods. The experimental results show that
the state-space model significantly improves the decoding performance.

differential equations for the evolutionary dynamics of populations structured
by phenotypic traits have been used recently to address open questions
concerning the adaptation of asexual species to periodically fluctuating
environmental conditions. These deterministic continuum models are usually
defined on the basis of population-scale phenomenological assumptions and
cannot capture adaptive phenomena that are driven by stochastic variability in
the evolutionary paths of single individuals. In this paper, we develop a
stochastic individual-based model for the coevolution between two competing
phenotype-structured cell populations that are exposed to time-varying nutrient
levels and undergo spontaneous, heritable phenotypic variations with different
probabilities. The evolution of every cell is described by a set of rules that
result in a discrete-time branching random walk on the space of phenotypic
states. We formally show that the deterministic continuum counterpart of this
model comprises a system of non-local partial differential equations for the
cell population density functions coupled with an ordinary differential
equation for the nutrient concentration. We compare the individual-based model
and its continuum analogue, focussing on scenarios whereby the predictions of
the two models differ. Our results clarify the conditions under which
significant differences between the two models can emerge due to stochastic
effects associated with small population levels. These differences arise in the
presence of low probabilities of phenotypic variation, and become more apparent
when the two populations are characterised by less fit initial mean phenotypes
and smaller initial levels of phenotypic heterogeneity.

rely on projections of the inputs delivered by the learned policy into a safe

scales represent a family of molecular structures of unknown origin associated
with high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs). We aim to study G23.657-00.127,
which has a nearly circular ring of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers, and is the
most suitable target to test hypotheses on the origin of the maser rings. The
European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) was used at three
epochs spanning 10.3 yr to derive the spatio-kinematical structure of the 6.7
GHz methanol maser emission in the target. The maser cloudlets, lying in a
nearly symmetric ring, expand mainly in the radial direction with a mean
velocity of 3.2 km s$^{-1}$. There is an indication that the radial component
of the velocity increases with cloudlet's distance from the ring centre. The
tangential component does not show any clear evidence for rotation of the
cloudlets or any relationship with distance from the ring centre. The
blue-shifted masers may hint at an anticlockwise rotation of cloudlets in the
southern part of the ring. The nearly circular structure of the ring clearly
persisted for more than 10 yr. Interferometric data demonstrated that about one
quarter of cloudlets show significant variability in their brightness, although
the overall spectrum was non-variable in single-dish studies. Taking into
account the three-dimensional motion of the maser cloudlets and their spatial
distribution along a small ring, we speculate about two possible scenarios
where the methanol masers trace either a spherical outflow arising from an
(almost) edge-on disc, or a wide angle wind at the base of a protostellar jet.
The latter is associated with near- and mid-infrared emission detected towards
the ring. High angular resolution images of complementary (thermal) tracers are
needed to interpret the environment of methanol masers.

brain. Neuroscientific evidence for neuronal sequences has been reported in
domains as diverse as perception, motor control, speech, spatial navigation and
memory. Consequently, different dynamical principles have been proposed as
possible sequence-generating mechanisms. Combining experimental findings with
computational concepts like the Bayesian brain hypothesis and predictive coding
leads to the interesting possibility that predictive and inferential processes
in the brain are grounded on generative processes which maintain a sequential
structure. While probabilistic inference about ongoing sequences is a useful
computational model for both the analysis of neuroscientific data and a wide
range of problems in artificial recognition and motor control, research on the
subject is relatively scarce and distributed over different fields in the
neurosciences. Here we review key findings about neuronal sequences and relate
these to the concept of online inference on sequences as a model of
sensory-motor processing and recognition. We propose that describing sequential
neuronal activity as an expression of probabilistic inference over sequences
may lead to novel perspectives on brain function. Importantly, it is promising
to translate the key idea of probabilistic inference on sequences to machine
learning, in order to address challenges in the real-time recognition of speech
and human motion.

restricted to the most extreme and/or strongly lensed sources. Starting with
the beginning of early science operations in 2011, the last nine years of ALMA
observations have ushered in a new era for studies of high-redshift star
formation. With its long baselines, ALMA has allowed observations of distant
dust-obscured star formation with angular resolutions comparable to$-$or even

frequency coverage, it has provided an unprecedented look at the associated
molecular and atomic gas in these distant galaxies through targeted follow-up

Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole
globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of
the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and
deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and show that both
distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We
are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale
process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the
small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming
exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is
determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm
this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model,
describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our
theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within
a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how
well a simple dual-scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite

identified as the $^{28}$F ground state, with $S_n(^{28}$F$)=-199(6)$ keV,
while analysis of the $2n$ decay channel allowed a considerably improved
$S_n(^{27}$F$)=1620(60)$ keV to be deduced. Comparison with shell-model

assignments to be proposed for some of the lower-lying levels of $^{28}$F.
Importantly, in the case of the ground state, the reconstructed $^{27}$F$+n$
momentum distribution following neutron removal from $^{29}$F indicates that it
arises mainly from the $1p_{3/2}$ neutron intruder configuration. This
demonstrates that the island of inversion around $N=20$ includes $^{28}$F, and
most probably $^{29}$F, and suggests that $^{28}$O is not doubly magic.

contribution, the present paper notes that there are limitations in Mark's
model that makes it less realistic than it could in explaining real-world
experiences. Consequently, we present a more generalized modified framework in
which his model is a special case, by developing and introducing a new
hierarchy measure into the model to estimate the cooperation level in a set of
hierarchical structures omitted in Mark's work yet common in everyday
life--those with multiple leaders. We derived the conditions under which
cooperation can emerge in these groups, and verified our analytical predictions
in agent-based computer simulations. In so doing, not only does our model
elaborate on its predecessor and support Mark's general prediction. For theory,
our work further reveals two novel phenomena of group cooperation: Both the
relative number of cooperators to defectors in groups and the assortativity
among these different roles can backfire; they are not always the higher, the
better for cooperation to thrive. For methodology, the hierarchy measure
developed and our model using the measure may also be applied in future
research on a wide range of related topics.

all the particles are clustered in the left (respectively, right) half of the

stationary profile in the presence of this dichotomous resetting and show that
the diffusive current grows linearly in time, but unlike the resetting to a
single configuration, the current can have negative average value in this case.
For $r_1=r_2,$ the average current vanishes, and density profile becomes flat
in the stationary state, similar to the equilibrium SEP. However, the system
remains far from equilibrium and we characterize the nonequilibrium signatures
of this `zero-current state'. We show that both the spatial and temporal
density correlations in this zero-current state are radically different than in
equilibrium SEP. We also study the behaviour of this zero-current state under
an external perturbation and demonstrate that its response differs drastically

protons from laser-matter interactions. When the target is thin enough that
relativistic self-induced transparency (RSIT) sets in, all of the target
electrons get heated to high energies by the laser, which maximizes the
accelerating electric field and therefore the final ion energy. In this work,
we first investigate how ion acceleration by ultraintense femtosecond laser
pulses in transparent CH$_2$ solid foils is modified when turning from normal
to oblique ($45^\circ$) incidence. Due to stronger electron heating, we find
that higher proton energies can be obtained at oblique incidence but in thinner
optimum targets. We then show that proton acceleration can be further improved
by splitting the laser pulse into two half-pulses focused at opposite incidence
angles. An increase by $\sim 30\,\%$ in the maximum proton energy and by a
factor of $\sim 4$ in the high-energy proton charge is reported compared to the
reference case of a single normally incident pulse.

  A gapped periodic one-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$ is perturbed by adding a
constant electric field of intensity $\varepsilon \ll 1$ in the $j$-th
direction, and the linear response in terms of a $S$-current in the $i$-th
direction is computed, where $S$ is a generalized spin operator. We derive a
general formula for the spin conductivity that covers both the choice of the
conventional and of the proper spin current operator. We investigate the
independence of the spin conductivity from the choice of the fundamental cell
(Unit Cell Consistency), and we isolate a subclass of discrete periodic models
where the conventional and the proper $S$-conductivity agree, thus showing that
the controversy about the choice of the spin current operator is immaterial as
far as models in this class are concerned. As a consequence of the general
theory, we obtain that whenever the spin is (almost) conserved, the spin
conductivity is (approximately) equal to the spin-Chern number. The method
relies on the characterization of a non-equilibrium almost-stationary state
(NEASS), which well approximates the physical state of the system (in the sense
of space-adiabatic perturbation theory) and allows moreover to compute the
response of the adiabatic $S$-current as the trace per unit volume of the
$S$-current operator times the NEASS. This technique can be applied in a

collected data are separated into three parts: ee nuclei, oA nuclei without
spin or parity change (oA\_nc), and oA nuclei with spin and/or parity change
(oA\_c). Based on the residues between observed data and corresponding
calculations, the statistical and systematic uncertainties are decomposed from
the total uncertainty, from which one can clarify the effects from the shell
structure, pairing, and angular momentum change on describing $\alpha$ decay
half-life. If $N > 126$ and $N \leqslant 126$ nuclei are considered together,
the systematic uncertainty of residues between observed and predicted
half-lives are larger than if those groups are considered separately. Without
shell correction term, a much larger systematic uncertainty is found if
parameters obtained for $N \leqslant 126$ nuclei are used to describe the
half-lives of $N > 126$ nuclei. A global hindrance on the $\alpha$ decay
process is found in oA\_nc (oA\_c) nuclei comparing with ee (oA\_nc) nuclei. If
parameters obtained from ee (oA\_nc) nuclei are used, the half-lives of oA\_nc

non-renewable resource constraints. Examples for non-renewable resources
include raw materials, energy, or money. Usually they have an initial stock and
replenishments arrive over time at a-priori known time points and quantities.
The jobs have some requirements from the resources and a job can only be
started if the available quantity from each of the required resources exceeds
the requirements of the job. Upon starting a job, it consumes its requirements
which decreases the available quantities of the respective non-renewable
resources. There is a broad theoretical and practical background for this class
of problems. Most of the literature concentrate on the makespan, and the
maximum lateness objectives. This paper focuses on the total weighted
completion time objective for which the list of the approximation algorithms is
very short. In this paper we extend that list by considering new special cases
and obtain new complexity results and approximation algorithms. We show that
even if there is only a single non-renewable resource, and each job has unit
weight and requires only one unit from the resource, the problem is still
NP-hard, however, in our construction we need a high-multiplicity encoding of
the jobs in the input. We also propose an FPTAS for a variant in which the jobs
have arbitrary weights, and the number of supply time points is bounded by a
constant. Finally, we prove some non-trivial approximation guarantees for
simple greedy algorithms for some further variants of the problem.

operation of urban metro systems. Previous studies mainly model passenger flow
as time series by aggregating individual trips and then perform forecasting
based on the values in the past several steps. However, this approach
essentially overlooks the fact that passenger flow consists of trips from each
individual traveler. For example, a traveler's work trip in the morning can
help predict his/her home trip in the evening, while this causal structure
cannot be explicitly encoded in standard time series models. In this paper, we
propose a new forecasting framework for boarding flow by incorporating the
generative mechanism into standard time series models and leveraging the strong
regularity rooted in travel behavior. In doing so, we introduce returning flow
from previous alighting trips as a new covariate, which captures the causal
structure and long-range dependencies in passenger flow data based on travel
behavior. We develop the return probability parallelogram (RPP) to summarize
the causal relationships and estimate the return flow. The proposed framework
is evaluated using real-world passenger flow data, and the results confirm that
the returning flow -- a single covariate -- can substantially and consistently
improve various forecasting tasks, including one-step ahead forecasting,
multi-step ahead forecasting, and forecasting under special events. And the
proposed method is more effective for business-type stations with most
passengers come and return within the same day. This study can be extended to
other modes of transport, and it also sheds new light on general demand time
series forecasting problems, in which causal structure and long-range
dependencies are generated by the user behavior.

convolutions, is independent of any underlying mesh structure. The
convolutional kernel is applied on a neighborhood obtained from a local

Intuitively, geodesic convolutions can easily separate objects that are
spatially close but have disconnected surfaces, while Euclidean convolutions
can represent interactions between nearby objects better, as they are oblivious
to object surfaces. To realize a multi-resolution architecture, we borrow

gases, however, are governed by an intrinsic anisotropy of the two-body
interaction that depends on the orientation of the dipoles relative to each
other. Here we investigate how this interaction anisotropy modifies the shell
structure in a weakly interacting two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic trap.
Going beyond Hartree-Fock by applying the so-called ""importance-truncated""
configuration interaction (CI) method as well as quadratic CI with single- and
double-substitutions, we show how the magnetostriction in the system may be
counteracted upon by a deformation of the isotropic confinement, restoring the
symmetry.

of strong magnetic fields. The mixing between the pseudoscalar and vector
charmonium states at rest is observed to lead to appreciable negative
(positive) shifts in the masses of the pseudoscalar (longitudinal component of
the vector) charmonium states in vacuum/hadronic medium in the presence of high
magnetic fields. The pseudoscalar and vector charmonium masses in the hadronic
medium, calculated in an effective chiral model from the medium changes of a
scalar dilaton field, have additional significant modifications due to the
mixing effects. The masses of the $D$ and $\bar D$ mesons in the magnetized
hadronic matter are calculated within the chiral effective model. The partial
decay widths of the vector charmonium state to $D\bar D$ are computed using a
field theoretical model for composite hadrons with quark/antiquark
constituents, and are compared to the decay widths calculated using an
effective hadronic Lagrangian. The effects of the mixing are observed to lead
to significant contributions to the masses of the pseusoscalar and vector
charmonium states, and an appreciable increase in the decay width $\psi(3770)
\rightarrow D\bar D$ at large values of the magnetic fields. These studies of
the charmonium states in strong magnetic fields should have observable
consequences on the dilepton spectra, as well as on the production of the open
charm mesons and the charmonium states in ultra relativistic heavy ion
collision experiments.

information that can be extracted from a system upon successive measurements of
noncommuting observables, a scenario related to communication tasks. This
approach leads us to characterize incompatibility as a resource encoded in a
physical context, which involves both the quantum state and observables.
Moreover, starting with a measure of context incompatibility we derive a
measurement-incompatibility quantifier that is easily computable, admits a
geometrical interpretation, and is maximum only if the eigenbases of the

However, how to realize such arrays on a scalable platform such as silicon is

desired charge state and readout spins through spin-to-charge conversion
mechanisms. In this paper, we use two methods based on either a single-lead
charge detector, or a reprogrammable single electron transistor. Thanks to
these methods, we study the charge dynamics and sensitivity by performing
single shot detection of the charge. Finally, we can probe the charge stability
at any node of a linear array and assess the Coulomb disorder in the structure.
We find an electrochemical potential fluctuation induced by charge noise

predict that about 1880 (2700) $\Xi^{+}_{cc}$ events and 3750 (5400)

functional theory. The change in the energy bandgap can be tuned by the Si
atomic configuration, rather than the dopants ratio. The effects of the
concentration of the Si atoms and the shape of supercell are kept constant, and
only the interaction effects of two Si atoms are studied by varying their
positions. If the Si atoms are at the same sublattice positions, a maximum
bandgap is obtained leading to an increased Seebeck coefficient and figure of
merit. A deviation in the Wiedemann-Franz ratio is also found, and a maximum
value of the Lorenz number is thus discovered. Furthermore, a significant red
shift of the first peak of the imaginary part of the dielectric function
towards the visible range of the electromagnetic radiation is observed. On the
other hand, if the Si atoms are located at different sublattice positions, a
small bandgap is seen because the symmetry of sublattice remains almost
unchanged. Consequently, the Seebeck coefficient and the dielectric function
are only slightly changed compared to pristine graphene. In addition, the
electron energy loss function is suppressed in Si-doped graphene. These unique
variations of the thermal and the optical properties of Si-doped graphene are
of importance to understand experiments relevant to optoelectronic
applications.

make it necessary to also include the non-K\""ahler case, which has already been

the purpose of recognition. It is a key factor to achieve high face recognition
performances. Currently, the high performance of these face recognition systems
come with the cost of a strong bias against demographic and non-demographic
sub-groups. Recent work has shown that face quality assessment algorithms
should adapt to the deployed face recognition system, in order to achieve
highly accurate and robust quality estimations. However, this could lead to a
bias transfer towards the face quality assessment leading to discriminatory
effects e.g. during enrolment. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of
the correlation between bias in face recognition and face quality assessment.
Experiments were conducted on two publicly available datasets captured under
controlled and uncontrolled circumstances with two popular face embeddings. We
evaluated four state-of-the-art solutions for face quality assessment towards
biases to pose, ethnicity, and age. The experiments showed that the face
quality assessment solutions assign significantly lower quality values towards
subgroups affected by the recognition bias demonstrating that these approaches
are biased as well. This raises ethical questions towards fairness and
discrimination which future works have to address.

for an optimally functioning brain. For instance, lissencephaly and
polymicrogyria can lead to severe mental retardation, short life expectancy,
epileptic seizures, and tetraplegia. The construction of a quantitative model
on how and why these folds appear is the first step in understanding the cause
of these conditions. In recent years, there have been various attempts to
understand and model the mechanisms of brain folding. Previous works have shown
that mechanical instabilities play a crucial role in the formation of brain
folds, and that the geometry of the fetal brain is one of the main factors in
dictating the folding characteristics. However, modeling higher-order folding,
one of the main characteristics of the human brain, has not been fully tackled.
The effects of thickness inhomogeneity in the gyrogenesis of the mammalian
brain are studied through finite-element simulations of rectangular slabs. The
slabs are divided into two distinct regions, where the outer layer mimics the
gray matter, and the inner layer the underlying white matter. Differential
growth is introduced by only growing the top layer. The brain tissue is modeled
as a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material. Simulations are performed with both,
homogeneous and inhomogeneous cortical thickness. The homogeneous cortex is
shown to fold into a single wavelength, as common for bilayered materials,
while the inhomogeneous cortex folds into more complex conformations: In their
early stages of development, structures reminiscent of the deep sulci in the
brain are obtained. As the cortex continues to develop, secondary undulations,
which are shallower and more variable than the structures obtained in earlier
gyrification stage emerge, reproducing well-known characteristics of
higher-order folding in the mammalian, and particularly the human, brain.

open questions in particle and astroparticle phenomenology. Within the
framework of minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of
fundamental particles, the `mu-from-nu supersymmetric standard model',
$\mu\nu$SSM, solves the $\mu$-problem and reproduces neutrino data, only adding
couplings involving right-handed neutrinos. In this context, the supersymmetric
partner of the graviton, known as gravitino, becomes a natural DM candidate.
Working in the mentioned model, in this thesis we have analyzed the detection
of gamma-ray signals arising from decaying gravitino DM considering experiments
such as $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT. For this purpose all gravitino decays have been
taken into account, complementing previous works. The possibility of an
upcoming new generation of gamma-ray detectors has motivated the inclusion of
axino, the supersymmetric partner of the axion, as a DM candidate. In this
thesis, axino DM has been analyzed in the context of the $\mu\nu$SSM for the
first time. Finally, scenarios with multicomponent DM have been studied,
focusing on gravitinos and axinos coexisting as DM constituents. This novel
scenario includes two very different cases with distinctive features: axino
lighter than gravitino and vice versa. Considering the sensitivity of future
MeV-GeV gamma-ray telescopes, axino and gravitino prospects of detection were
analyzed in the mixed scenarios mentioned previously. In some parameter space
regions, both candidates can produce a signal, therefore a double-line feature
arises as a smoking gun that would uncover the DM composition.

while capturing structure information of networks. It has achieved great
success on many tasks of network analysis such as link prediction and node

learn static homogeneous networks effectively. However, networks in the real
world are more complex, e.g., networks may consist of several types of nodes

dynamic nodes and edges (called evolutionary patterns). Limited work has been
done for network embedding of dynamic heterogeneous networks as it is
challenging to learn both evolutionary and heterogeneous information
simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic heterogeneous network
embedding method, termed as DyHATR, which uses hierarchical attention to learn
heterogeneous information and incorporates recurrent neural networks with
temporal attention to capture evolutionary patterns. We benchmark our method on
four real-world datasets for the task of link prediction. Experimental results

adults over the age of 50 and can reduce their quality of life. Hence,
predicting the biomechanical bone strength, specifically of the proximal femur,

diagnosis of Osteoporosis as well as estimating fracture risk. Dual X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) has been used as a standard clinical procedure for
assessment and diagnosis of bone strength and osteoporosis through bone mineral

quantitative computer tomography (QCT) can be more sensitive and specific to
trabecular bone characterization because it reduces the overlap effects and

predict the biomechanical strength of the femur specimens using sophisticated
machine learning techniques such as multiregression (MultiReg) and support
vector regression with linear kernel (SVRlin). The prediction performance
achieved with these feature sets is compared to the standard approach that uses
the mean BMD of the specimens and multiregression models using root mean square

Charges in electrostatics induce image charges near conductive boundaries and
an external electric field induces polarization (dipoles, quadrupoles, and

elasticity induce image charges near boundaries and external stress induces
polarization (quadrupoles and other multipoles) inside holes and inclusions.
Stresses generated by these induced elastic multipoles as well as stresses
generated by their images near boundaries then lead to interactions between
holes and inclusions and with their images, which induce additional
polarization and thus additional deformation of holes and inclusions. We
present a method that expands induced polarization in a series of elastic
multipoles, which systematically takes into account the interactions of
inclusions and holes with the external field, between them, and with their
images. The results of our method for linear deformation of circular holes and

Poiseuille flow is studied by direct numerical simulation. Turbulence
lifetimes, the likelihood that turbulence is sustained, is investigated for
transitional flows with various slip lengths. Slip surfaces decrease the
likelihood of sustained turbulence compared to the no-slip case, and likelihood
is further decreased as slip length is increased. A deterministic analysis of
the effects of slip surfaces on transition to turbulence is performed using
nonlinear traveling wave solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, also known
as exact coherent solutions. Two solution families, dubbed P3 and P4, are used
since their lower-branch solutions are embedded on the boundary of the basin of
attraction of laminar and turbulent flows (Park & Graham 2015). Additionally,
they exhibit distinct flow structures -- the P3 and P4 are denoted as core mode
and critical layer mode, respectively. Distinct effects of slip surfaces on the
solutions are observed by the skin friction evolution, linear growth rate, and
phase-space projection of transitional trajectories. The slip surface modifies
transition dynamics little for the core mode, but considerably for the critical
layer mode. Most importantly, the slip surface promotes different transition
dynamics -- early and bypass-like transition for the core mode and delayed and
H-/K-type-like transition for the critical layer mode. Based on spatiotemporal
and quadrant analyses, it is found that slip surfaces promote the prevalence of
strong wall-toward motions (sweep-like events) near vortex cores close to the
channel centre, inducing an early transition, while sustained ejection events
are present in the region of the ${\Lambda}$-shaped vortex cores close to the
critical layer, resulting in a delayed transition.

cohesive zone model to predict the fracture response is explored for the
observed case of large scale bridging. To do so, FE simulations are performed
by replacing the discrete lattice of the open-cell metallic foam by a
compressible, elastic-plastic hardening solid while the fracture process zone
in the foam is represented by a cohesive zone, as characterised by a tensile
traction versus separation law. A detailed comparison of the cohesive zone
model with experimental observations reveals that it is possible to capture the
load versus displacement response but not the details of the fracture process
zone using a single set of process zone parameters.

sequence. We list explicit generators for the Lie algebra cohomology ring.
Secondly, we concentrate on the eigenspaces of the supersymmetric quantum

of near-resonance fluorescence along the atomic trajectory. The atom beam
source originates in a pushed two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D$^+$ MOT)
feeding a slightly off-axis three-dimensional moving optical molasses stage
that continuously cools and redirects the atom beam. The capture velocity of
the moving optical molasses is deliberately chosen to be low, $\sim 3$ m/s, to
reduce fluorescence, and the cooling light is detuned by several atomic
linewidths from resonance to reduce the absorption cross-section of
cooling-induced fluorescence. Near-resonance light from the 2D$^+$ MOT and the
push beam does not propagate to the output atomic trajectory due to a 10 degree
bend in the atomic trajectory. The atomic beam emitted from the two-stage
source has a flux up to $1.6(3)\times 10^9\;\textrm{atoms/s}$, with an

interference measurements at the atom beam output to study the sources of
decoherence in the presence of continuous cooling, and demonstrate that the
atom beam source effectively preserves high fringe contrast even during
cooling. This cold-atom beam source is appropriate for use in atom
interferometers and clocks, where continuous operation eliminates dead time,
the slow atom beam velocity (6 - 16 m/s) improves sensitivity, the narrow 3D

mean-motion resonance as a consequence of the convergent planetary migration.
The formation of mean-motion resonances is important for understanding how the
planetary systems are shaped in the disk environments. Motivated by recent
progress in the comprehension of the migration of partial gap-opening planets,
we have investigated the orbital evolution of the planet pairs in a wide range
of masses and disk properties with the aim to find out when the resonance
capture is likely to happen. Using the formula for the migration timescale of a
gap-opening planet developed in our previous work, we have derived a simple
criterion that allows us to predict when the migration will be convergent
(divergent). Further, we have verified the criterion using two-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations. We have found that the resonant pair of planets
formed at the early phase of evolution can depart from the resonance at later
times because the migration speed of the outer planet slows down due to the gap
formation. Moreover, adopting our formula of the migration timescale, we have
also carried out three-body simulations, which confirm the results of
hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we have compared our predictions with the
observations, selecting a sample of known two-planet systems.

multiple institutions (from Australia, USA, Canada, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the

therefore meteorite recoveries. The members have a choice to operate
independently, but they can also choose to work in a fully collaborative manner

excitations of electrons coupled to electromagnetic fields in a medium - are
relevant to sensing, photovoltaics, and light-emitting devices, among others.
Due to the SPP dispersion, a conventional antenna of fixed geometry, exhibiting
a narrow SPP resonance, cannot simultaneously operate in two different spectral
bands. In contrast, here it is demonstrated that in metallic disks, separated
by a nanometric spacer, the hybridized antibonding SPP mode stays in the
visible range, while the bonding one can be pushed down to the mid-infrared
range. Such an SPP dimer can sense two materials of nanoscale volumes, whose
fingerprint central frequencies differ by a factor of 5. Additionally, the
mid-infrared SPP resonance can be tuned by employing a phase-change material
(VO2) as a spacer. The dielectric constant of the phase-change material is
controlled by heating the material at the frequency of the antibonding optical
mode. These findings open the door to a new class of optoelectronic devices
able to operate in significantly different frequency ranges in the linear
regime, and with the same polarization of the illuminating wave.

propose Entropy-Constrained Trained Ternarization (EC2T), a general framework
to create sparse and ternary neural networks which are efficient in terms of
storage (e.g., at most two binary-masks and two full-precision values are
required to save a weight matrix) and computation (e.g., MAC operations are
reduced to a few accumulations plus two multiplications). This approach
consists of two steps. First, a super-network is created by scaling the
dimensions of a pre-trained model (i.e., its width and depth). Subsequently,
this super-network is simultaneously pruned (using an entropy constraint) and
quantized (that is, ternary values are assigned layer-wise) in a training
process, resulting in a sparse and ternary network representation. We validate
the proposed approach in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, showing
its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

show that the distribution of FBDM pre-crisis users fits well with the total
population from different sources. Due to usage habits, the elder population is
underrepresented in FBDM data. During the two mega-fires in California, FBDM
data effectively captured the temporal change of population arising from the
placing and lifting of evacuation orders. Coupled with monotonic trends, the
fall and rise of cold and hot spots of population revealed the areas with the
greatest population drop and potential places to house the displaced residents.
A comparison between the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires indicates that a
densely populated region can be evacuated faster than a scarcely populated one,
possibly due to the better access to transportation. In sparsely populated
fire-prone areas, resources should be prioritized to move people to shelters as
the displaced residents do not have many alternative options, while their
counterparts in densely populated areas can utilize their social connections to
seek temporary stay at nearby locations during an evacuation. Integrated with
an assessment on underrepresented communities, FBDM data and the derivatives
can provide much needed information of near real-time population displacement
for crisis response and disaster relief. As applications and data generation
mature, FBDM will harness crowdsourced data and aid first responder

RF signals work in the presence of occlusions and poor lighting, RF-ReID allows
for person ReID in such scenarios. Second, unlike photos and videos which

different biological tissue types has been demonstrated in a variety of medical
image processing tasks. We introduce anisotropic Minkowski Functionals (AMFs)
as a novel variant that captures the inherent anisotropy of the underlying
gray-level structures. To quantify the anisotropy characterized by our
approach, we further introduce a method to compute a quantitative measure
motivated by a technique utilized in MR diffusion tensor imaging, namely
fractional anisotropy. We showcase the applicability of our method in the
research context of characterizing the local structure properties of trabecular
bone micro-architecture in the proximal femur as visualized on multi-detector
CT. To this end, AMFs were computed locally for each pixel of ROIs extracted
from the head, neck and trochanter regions. Fractional anisotropy was then used
to quantify the local anisotropy of the trabecular structures found in these
ROIs and to compare its distribution in different anatomical regions. Our
results suggest a significantly greater concentration of anisotropic trabecular
structures in the head and neck regions when compared to the trochanter region
(p < 10-4). We also evaluated the ability of such AMFs to predict bone strength
in the femoral head of proximal femur specimens obtained from 50 donors. Our
results suggest that such AMFs, when used in conjunction with multi-regression
models, can outperform more conventional features such as BMD in predicting

obvious intuitive connection. However, the challenge till now has been that
there is no practical way to firmly establish if the solution to a problem is
actually random (or whether it has some hidden undiscovered structure, which
upon being detected would render it non-random). This has prevented the
conclusive declaration of hard problems (such as NP) as being definitely
intractable. For dealing with this, a concept called ""extensibility"" of a
sequence is developed. Based on this, a criterion termed as ""cardinality of
extended solution set"" is conceived to ascertain the (non)randomness of any
sequence. Further, this can then be used to establish the (in)tractability of
any problem depending on whether its solutions are random or non-random. This
criterion is applied to problems such as 2-SAT, 3-SAT and hardness of
approximation to analyze their (in)tractability. Finally, a proof for the
validity of the Unique Games Conjecture based on the same criterion is also

in various applications that deal with multiphase flow in porous media. Despite
recent improvements to enable pore-network modeling on simplified pore geometry
extracted from rock images and its computational efficiency compared to direct
numerical simulation methods, there are still limitations to modeling a large
representative pore-network for heterogeneous cores. These are due to the
technical limits on sample size to discern void space during imaging and
computational limits on pore-network extraction algorithms. Thus, there is a
need for pore-scale modeling approaches that have the natural advantages of
pore-network modeling and can overcome these limitations, thereby enabling
better representation of heterogeneity of the core and enhancing the accuracy
of prediction of properties. This paper addresses these issues with a workflow
that includes a novel pore-network stitching method to provide large-enough
representative pore-network. It uses CT images of heterogeneous cores at
different resolutions to characterize the pore structure in order to select few
signature parts and extract their pore-networks. The space between these
signature pore-networks is filled by using their statistics to generate
realizations of pore-networks which are then connected together using a layered
stitching method. We validate all steps of this method on different types of
rocks based on flow properties such as relative permeability. Then, we apply
the stochastic workflow on two large heterogeneous domain problems. We generate
multiple realizations and compare the average results with a reference
pore-network for each problem. We demonstrate that signature parts of a
heterogeneous core, which are a small portion of its entire volume, are
sufficient inputs for the developed method to construct a representative
pore-network.

is not associated with any elementary particle analogous to the graviton,

motions at very low temperatures and the matrix that traps them. These comprise
ionic solids such as ammonium tetraphenylborate (ATPB) or methane dilute in a
xenon matrix. In this manner, an enormous number qubits are present from
inception. Each kind of qubit has a multiplicity of transitions of interest
which are observed (without the need of external fields, ultra-low temperatures
or ultra-high vacuum conditions) using diverse well established experimental
techniques at frequencies ranging from 10 to 3300 cm-1. Described in detail are
the transitions in ATPB. These include: (i) the IR N-H asymmetric vibration of
the ammonium ion qubit which nearly freely rotate about their C3 axes inside
the tetraphenylborate matrix. This results in a multi-level
vibration-orientation which exhibits multiple bands even at very low
temperatures due to nuclear spin freezing between the first three orientation
levels. Accessible tunneling frequencies between the orientation levels and the
possibility to control inter-qubit distance make this qubit a strong candidate
to generate concurrently large entanglement and stable superposition in diverse
experimental set-ups; and (ii) the Raman allowed normal modes of the
tetraphenylborate anion qubit. These are experimentally resolved from very low
temperatures up to 300 K. Further qubit examples and transitions of interest
are examined. Experimental setups with multi-crystal arrays, both in a given or
several locations, become possible using this approach.

criminals are always finding new creative ways to trick internet users, be it
in the form of lottery scams, downloading scam apps for smartphones or fake
gambling websites. This paper presents a large-scale study on one particular
delivery method of online scam: pop-up scam on typosquatting domains.
Typosquatting describes the concept of registering domains which are very
similar to existing ones while deliberately containing common typing errors;
these domains are then used to trick online users while under the belief of
browsing the intended website. Pop-up scam uses JavaScript alert boxes to
present a message which attracts the user's attention very effectively, as they
are a blocking user interface element.
  Our study among typosquatting domains derived from the Majestic Million list
utilising an Austrian IP address revealed on 1219 distinct typosquatting URLs a
total of 2577 pop-up messages, out of which 1538 were malicious. Approximately
a third of those distinct URLs (403) were targeted and displayed pop-up
messages to one specific HTTP user agent only. Based on our scans, we present
an in-depth analysis as well as a detailed classification of different
targeting parameters (user agent and language) which triggered varying kinds of
pop-up scams. Furthermore, we expound the differences of current pop-up scam
characteristics in comparison with a previous scan performed in late 2018 and
examine the use of IDN homograph attacks as well as the application of message
localisation using additional scans with IP addresses from the United States

aim to find and describe the differences between a process model capturing the
expected process behavior and a corresponding event log recording the observed
behavior. Alignments are an established technique to compute the distance
between a trace in the event log and the closest execution trace of a
corresponding process model. Given a cost function, an alignment is optimal
when it contains the least number of mismatches between a log trace and a model
trace. Determining optimal alignments, however, is computationally expensive,
especially in light of the growing size and complexity of event logs from
practice, which can easily exceed one million events with traces of several
hundred activities. A common limitation of existing alignment techniques is the
inability to exploit repetitions in the log. By exploiting a specific form of
sequential pattern in traces, namely tandem repeats, we propose a novel
approximate technique that uses pre- and post-processing steps to compress the
length of a trace and recomputes the alignment cost while guaranteeing that the
cost result never under-approximates the optimal cost. In an extensive
empirical evaluation with 50 real-life model log pairs and against six
state-of-the-art alignment techniques, we show that the proposed compression
approach systematically outperforms the baselines by up to an order of
magnitude in the presence of traces with repetitions, and that the cost
over-approximation, when it occurs, is negligible.

correction to the Hilbert Lagrangian. In the first case, we will present the
most general square-curvature leading term, which is in fact the already-known
re-normalizable Stelle Lagrangian. In the second case, the topological current
has to be an axial-vector built only in terms of gravitational degrees of
freedom and with a unitary mass dimension, and we will display such an object.
The comparison of the two theories will eventually be commented.

  Case Study","Accepted for publication in the Data Science Journal",,,,"cs.CY stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was
declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020.
Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments that have been approved after
clinical trials. Social distancing measures, including travel bans, school
closure, and quarantine applied to countries or regions are being used to limit
the spread of the disease and the demand on the healthcare infrastructure. The
seclusion of groups and individuals has led to limited access to accurate
information. To update the public, especially in South Africa, announcements
are made by the minister of health daily. These announcements narrate the
confirmed COVID-19 cases and include the age, gender, and travel history of
people who have tested positive for the disease. Additionally, the South
African National Institute for Communicable Diseases updates a daily
infographic summarising the number of tests performed, confirmed cases,
mortality rate, and the regions affected. However, the age of the patient and
other nuanced data regarding the transmission is only shared in the daily
announcements and not on the updated infographic. To disseminate this
information, the Data Science for Social Impact research group at the
University of Pretoria, South Africa, has worked on curating and applying
publicly available data in a way that is computer-readable so that information
can be shared to the public - using both a data repository and a dashboard.
Through collaborative practices, a variety of challenges related to publicly
available data in South Africa came to the fore. These include shortcomings in
the accessibility, integrity, and data management practices between
governmental departments and the South African public. In this paper, solutions
to these problems will be shared by using a publicly available data repository
and dashboard as a case study.

electric power systems and emergency services. We investigate the effect of the
level of empathy, cooperation, coordination, flexibility, and experience of
individuals on their mental well-being. Furthermore, we explore the impact of
the information that is provided by emergency services and the impact of the
availability of electric energy on the physical, mental, and social well-being
of individuals. For our simulations, we use a stochastic, multi-agent-based
numerical framework that is reported in the companion paper for estimating the
social well-being of a community when facing natural disasters such as
hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis. The performance of the proposed
method is assessed by measuring community resilience for a multitude of effects
in the context of two case studies. These effects are analyzed for Gaussian
social random characteristics. Each case study considers nine agents, namely,
three areas of three communities each, yielding a total of six communities. The
results show that a high level of cooperation can positively change individual
behavior. In addition, the relationship among the individuals of a community is
so vital that the society with less population and more empathy may be more
resilient than the community with more population and less empathy.

  A Bayesian metaanalysis",,,,,"q-bio.NC stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When participants in an experiment have to name pictures while ignoring
distractor words superimposed on the picture or presented auditorily (i.e.,
picture-word interference paradigm), they take more time when the word to be
named (or target) and distractor words are from the same semantic category
(e.g., cat-dog). This experimental effect is known as the semantic interference
effect, and is probably one of the most studied in the language production
literature. The functional origin of the effect and the exact conditions in
which it occurs are however still debated. Since Lupker reported the effect in
the first response time experiment about 40 years ago, more than 300 similar
experiments have been conducted. The semantic interference effect was
replicated in many experiments, but several studies also reported the absence
of an effect in a subset of experimental conditions. The aim of the present
study is to provide a comprehensive theoretical review of the existing evidence
to date and several Bayesian meta-analyses and meta-regressions to determine
the size of the effect and explore the experimental conditions in which the
effect surfaces. The results are discussed in the light of current debates
about the functional origin of the semantic interference effect and its
implications for our understanding of the language production system.

stimulus sequences for cVEP BCI based on experimental studies regarding the
behavior and the properties of the actual EEG responses of the visual system to
coded visual stimuli, such that training time is reduced and the possible
number of targets is increased. EEG from 8 occipital sites is recorded with
2000 samples/sec per channel, in response to visual stimuli presented on a
computer monitor with 60Hz refresh rate. Onset and offset EEG responses to long
visual stimulus pulses are obtained through 160-trial signal averaging. These
edge responses are used to predict the EEG responses to arbitrary stimulus
sequences using the superposition principle. A BCI speller which utilizes the
target templates generated by this principle is also implemented and tested. It
is found that certain short stimulus patterns can be accurately predicted by
the superposition principle. BCI sequences that are constructed by combinations
of these optimal patterns yield higher accuracy (95.9%) and ITR (57.2 bpm)
compared to when the superposition principle is applied to conventional
m-sequences and randomly generated sequences. Training time for the BCI
application involves only the acquisition of the edge responses and is less
than 4 minutes, and a huge number of sequences is possible. This is the first
study in which cVEP BCI sequences are designed based on constraints obtained by
observing the actual brain responses to several stimulus patterns.

radio environments, where large numbers of small, low-cost and passive
elements, reflect the incident signal with an adjustable phase shift without
requiring a dedicated energy source. Inspired by the promising potential of
RIS-based transmission, we investigate the PLS of two vehicular network system
models: One with vehicle-to-vehicle communication with the source employing a
RIS-based access point, and the other is in the form of a vehicular adhoc
network (VANET), with a RIS-based relay deployed on a building; both models
assume the presence of an eavesdropper. The performance of the proposed systems
are evaluated in terms of the average secrecy capacity (ASC) and the secrecy
outage probability (SOP). We present accurate analytical expressions for the
two performance metrics and study the impact of various system parameters on
the overall performance of the two considered system configurations.
Monte-Carlo simulations are provided throughout to validate the results. The
results show that performance of the system in terms of the ASC and SOP is
affected by the location of the RIS-relay as well as the number of RIS cells.
Moreover, upto an order magnitude gain could be achieved within certain regions
when the number of RIS cells are doubled, clearly indicating the benefit of
employing a RIS configuration.

scheduling and control of wind energy farms for stable power production. In
recent years Machine Learning (ML) methods have been successfully applied in a
wide range of domains, including renewable energy. However, due to the
challenging nature of power prediction in wind farms, current models are far
short of the accuracy required by industry. In this paper, we deploy a
composite ML approach--namely a hybrid neuro-evolutionary algorithm--for
accurate forecasting of the power output in wind-turbine farms. We use
historical data in the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems
as input to estimate the power output from an onshore wind farm in Sweden. At
the beginning stage, the k-means clustering method and an Autoencoder are
employed, respectively, to detect and filter noise in the SCADA measurements.
Next, with the prior knowledge that the underlying wind patterns are highly
non-linear and diverse, we combine a self-adaptive differential evolution
(SaDE) algorithm as a hyper-parameter optimizer, and a recurrent neural network
(RNN) called Long Short-term memory (LSTM) to model the power curve of a wind
turbine in a farm. Two short time forecasting horizons, including ten-minutes
ahead and one-hour ahead, are considered in our experiments. We show that our
approach outperforms its counterparts.
