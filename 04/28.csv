main-sequence stars, by comparing astrometric positions of matched stars
between the multi-band imaging datasets from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey
and the SDSS Stripe 82. In doing this we use $3$ million galaxies to
recalibrate the astrometry and set up a common reference frame between the two
catalogues. The exquisite depth and the nearly $12$ years of time baseline
between HSC and SDSS enable high-precision measurements of statistical proper
motions for stars down to $i\simeq 24$. A validation of our method is
demonstrated by the agreement with the $Gaia$ proper motions, to the precision
better than $0.1$ mas yr$^{-1}$. To retain the precision, we make a correction
of the subtle effects due to the differential chromatic refraction in the SDSS
images based on the comparison with the $Gaia$ proper motions against colour of
stars, which is validated using the SDSS spectroscopic quasars. Combining with
the photometric distance estimates for individual stars based on the precise
HSC photometry, we show a significant detection of the net proper motions for
stars in each bin of distance out to $100$ kpc. The two-component tangential
velocities after subtracting the apparent motions due to our own motion display
rich phase-space structures including a clear signature of the Sagittarius
stream in the halo region of distance range $[10,\ 35]$ kpc. We also measure
the tangential velocity dispersion in the distance range $5-20$ kpc and find
that the data are consistent with a constant isotropic dispersion of $80\pm 10\
{\rm km/s}$. More distant stars appear to have random motions with respect to
the Galactic centre on average.

finding that high temperature chemistry, a cosmic-ray ionization rate of
10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ and timescales $>$10$^{5.0}$ years explain well the HOC$^+$

the highest HCO abundances derived for these regions. CO$^+$ is mainly formed
in PDRs since the highest CO$^+$ abundances of $\sim$(6-10)$\times$10$^{-10}$

prerequisite for inferring cell state transitions from such snapshots is to
distinguish whether transitions are coupled to cell divisions. To address this,
we present two minimal branching process models of cell division and
differentiation in a well-mixed population. These models describe dynamics
where differentiation and division are coupled or uncoupled. For each model, we
derive analytic expressions for each subpopulation's mean and variance and for
the likelihood, allowing exact Bayesian parameter inference and model selection
in the idealised case of fully observed trajectories of differentiation and
division events. In the case of snapshots, we present a sample path algorithm
and use this to predict optimal temporal spacing of measurements for
experimental design. We then apply this methodology to an \textit{in vitro}
dataset assaying the clonal growth of epiblast stem cells in culture conditions
promoting self-renewal or differentiation. Here, the larger number of cell
states necessitates approximate Bayesian computation. For both culture
conditions, our inference supports the model where cell state transitions are
coupled to division. For culture conditions promoting differentiation, our
analysis indicates a possible shift in dynamics, with these processes becoming
more coupled over time.

and logic devices in view of their compatibility with traditional silicon CMOS
technology, high switchable polarization, good endurance and thickness
scalability. These factors have led to steep rise in research on this class of
materials over the past number of years. At the same time, only a few reports
on the direct sensing of nanoscale ferroelectric properties exist, with many
questions remaining regarding the emergence of ferroelectricity in these
materials. While piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is ideally suited to
probe piezo- and ferro-electricity on the nanoscale, it is known to suffer
artifacts which complicate quantitative interpretation of results and can even
lead to claims of ferroelectricity in materials which are not ferroelectric. In
this paper we explore the possibility of using an improved PFM method based on
interferometric displacement sensing (IDS) to study nanoscale ferroelectricity
in bare Si doped HfO2. Our results indicate a clear difference in the local
remnant state of various HfO2 crystallites with reported values for the
piezoelectric coupling in range 0.6-1.5 pm/V. In addition, we report unusual
ferroelectric polarization switching including possible contributions from
electrostriction and Vegard effect, which may indicate oxygen vacancies or

matter of the Universe and be generated by the freeze-out production mechanism.
In the standard picture, the requirement of a long lifetime of the right-handed
neutrinos implies a small neutrino Yukawa coupling. As a consequence, they
never reach thermal equilibrium, thus prohibiting production by freeze-out. We
note that this limitation is alleviated if the neutrino Yukawa coupling is
large enough in the early Universe to thermalize the sterile neutrinos, and
then becomes tiny at a certain moment, which makes them drop out of
equilibrium. As a concrete example realization of this framework, we consider a
Froggatt-Nielsen model supplemented by an additional scalar field which obeys a
global symmetry (not the flavour symmetry). Initially, the vacuum expectation
value of the flavon is such, that the effective neutrino Yukawa coupling is
large and unsuppressed, keeping them in thermal equilibrium. At some point the
new scalar also gets a vacuum expectation value that breaks the symmetry. This
may occur in such a way that the vev of the flavon is shifted to a new
(smaller) value. In that case, the Yukawa coupling is reduced such that the
sterile neutrinos are rendered stable on cosmological time scales. We show that
this mechanism works for a wide range of sterile neutrino masses.

the inherently compositional and layered nature of visual scenes. While recent
work has made progress towards unsupervised learning of object-based scene
representations, most models still maintain a global representation space
(i.e., objects are not explicitly separated), and cannot generate scenes with
novel object arrangement and depth ordering. Here, we present an alternative
approach which uses an inductive bias encouraging modularity by training an
ensemble of generative models (experts). During training, experts compete for
explaining parts of a scene, and thus specialise on different object classes,
with objects being identified as parts that re-occur across multiple scenes.
Our model allows for controllable sampling of individual objects and
recombination of experts in physically plausible ways. In contrast to other
methods, depth layering and occlusion are handled correctly, moving this
approach closer to a causal generative scene model. Experiments on simple toy
data qualitatively demonstrate the conceptual advantages of the proposed
approach.

current task, but also on previously encountered, and as yet unencountered
tasks. In contrast, classical machine learning, which we define as, starts from
a blank slate, or tabula rasa and uses data only for the single task at hand.
While typical transfer learning algorithms can improve performance on future
tasks, their performance on prior tasks degrades upon learning new tasks
(called forgetting). Many recent approaches for continual or lifelong learning
have attempted to maintain performance on old tasks given new tasks. But
striving to avoid forgetting sets the goal unnecessarily low. The goal of
lifelong learning should be not only to improve performance on future tasks
(forward transfer) but also on past tasks (backward transfer) with any new
data. Our key insight is that we can synergistically ensemble representations
-- that were learned independently on disparate tasks -- to enable both forward
and backward transfer. This generalizes ensembling decisions (like in decision
forests) and complements ensembling dependently learned representations (like
in multitask learning). Moreover, we can ensemble representations in
quasilinear space and time. We demonstrate this insight with two algorithms:
representation ensembles of (1) trees and (2) networks. Both algorithms
demonstrate forward and backward transfer in a variety of simulated and
benchmark data scenarios, including tabular, image, and spoken, and adversarial
tasks. This is in stark contrast to the reference algorithms we compared to,
most of which failed to transfer either forward or backward, or both, despite
that many of them require quadratic space or time complexity.

reports of the event. Moreover, each BIP is: 'biased' if it favors one of the
two outcomes while reporting, or 'unbiased' if it favors neither outcome. Such
biases occur in information/social networks due to differences in users'
characteristics/worldviews.
  We study the impact of the BIPs' biases on an RIC's choices while deducing
the true information. Our work reveals that a ""graph-blind"" RIC looking for $n$
BIPs among its neighbors, acts peculiarly in order to minimize its probability
of making an error while deducing the true information. First, we establish the
counter-intuitive fact that the RIC's expected error is minimized by choosing
BIPs that are fully-biased against the a-priori likely event. Then, we study
the gains that fully-biased BIPs provide over unbiased BIPs when the error
rates of their binary channels are equalized, for fair comparison, at some
$r>0$. Specifically, the unbiased-to-fully-biased ratio of the RIC's expected
error probabilities grows exponentially with the exponent
$\frac{n}{2}\ln\left(4\rho_0^2\left(\frac{1}{r}-1\right)\right)$, where
$\rho_0$ is the event's prior probability of being $0$. This shows not only
that fully-biased BIPs are preferable to unbiased or heterogeneously-biased
BIPs, but also that the gains can be substantial for small $r$.

(mmWave) multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems. However,
conventional HBF methods are still with high complexity and strongly rely on
the quality of channel state information. We propose an extreme learning
machine (ELM) framework to jointly optimize transmitting and receiving
beamformers. Specifically, to provide accurate labels for training, we first
propose an factional-programming and majorization-minimization based HBF method
(FP-MM-HBF). Then, an ELM based HBF (ELM-HBF) framework is proposed to increase
the robustness of beamformers. Both FP-MM-HBF and ELM-HBF can provide higher
system sum-rate compared with existing methods. Moreover, ELM-HBF cannot only
provide robust HBF performance, but also consume very short computation time.

problems autonomously by specifying a high-level reward function only. However,
reinforcement learning algorithms struggle when, as is often the case, simple

pitfalls requires thoroughly exploring the environment, but creating algorithms
that can do so remains one of the central challenges of the field. We
hypothesise that the main impediment to effective exploration originates from
algorithms forgetting how to reach previously visited states (""detachment"") and
from failing to first return to a state before exploring from it
(""derailment""). We introduce Go-Explore, a family of algorithms that addresses
these two challenges directly through the simple principles of explicitly
remembering promising states and first returning to such states before
intentionally exploring. Go-Explore solves all heretofore unsolved Atari games
and surpasses the state of the art on all hard-exploration games, with orders
of magnitude improvements on the grand challenges Montezuma's Revenge and
Pitfall. We also demonstrate the practical potential of Go-Explore on a
sparse-reward pick-and-place robotics task. Additionally, we show that adding a
goal-conditioned policy can further improve Go-Explore's exploration efficiency
and enable it to handle stochasticity throughout training. The substantial
performance gains from Go-Explore suggest that the simple principles of
remembering states, returning to them, and exploring from them are a powerful
and general approach to exploration, an insight that may prove critical to the
creation of truly intelligent learning agents.

parameters of the UAV in this design. These dynamic structural parameters play
a vital role in the stability and control of the system. The length of
quadcopter arms is a variable parameter, and it is actuated using attitude
feedback-based control law. The MoI parameters are computed in real-time and
incorporated in the equations of motion of the system. The UAV utilizes the
angular motion of propellers and variable quadcopter arm lengths for position
and navigation control. The movement space of the CoG is a design parameter and
it is bounded by actuator limitations and stability requirements of the system.
A detailed information on equations of motion, flight controller design and
possible applications of this system are provided. Further, the proposed
shape-changing UAV system is evaluated by comparative numerical simulations for

is hampered by the low spectral resolution of CCD cameras, which creates a
degeneracy between the best-fit values of abundances and emission measure. The
combined contribution of shocked ambient medium and ejecta to the X-ray
emission complicates the determination of the ejecta mass and chemical
composition, leading to big uncertainties in mass estimates and it can
introduce a bias in the comparison between the observed ejecta composition and
the yields predicted by explosive nucleosynthesis. We explore the capabilities
of present and future spectral instruments with the aim of identifying a
spectral feature which may allow us to discriminate between metal-rich and
pure-metal plasmas in X-ray spectra of SNRs. We studied the behavior of the
most common X-ray emission processes of an optically thin plasma in the
high-abundance regime. We investigated spectral features of bremsstrahlung,
radiative recombination continua (RRC) and line emission, by exploring a wide
range of chemical abundances, temperatures and ionization parameters. We
synthesized X-ray spectra from a 3D hydrodynamic (HD) simulation of Cas A, by
using the response matrix from the Chandra/ACIS-S CCD detector and that of the
XRISM/Resolve X-ray calorimeter. We found that a bright RRC shows up when the
plasma is made of pure-metal ejecta, and a high spectral resolution is needed
to identify this ejecta signature. We verified the applicability of our novel
diagnostic tool and we propose a promising target for the future detection of
such spectral feature: the southeastern Fe-rich clump of Cas A. While there is
no way to unambiguously reveal pure-metal ejecta emission with CCD detectors,
X-ray calorimeters will be able to pinpoint the presence of pure-metal RRC and
to recover correctly absolute mass and the chemical composition of the ejecta.

$\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ and wants to hire worker nodes to help compute
the multiplication. The matrices should remain private from the workers, in an
information-theoretic sense. This problem has been considered in the literature
and codes with a predesigned threshold are constructed. More precisely, the
master assigns tasks to the workers and waits for a predetermined number of
workers to finish their assigned tasks. The size of the tasks assigned to the
workers depends on the designed threshold. We are interested in settings where
the size of the task must be small and independent of the designed threshold.
We design a rateless private matrix-matrix multiplications scheme, called RPM3.
Our scheme fixes the size of the tasks and allows the master to send multiple
tasks to the workers. The master keeps receiving results until it can decode
the multiplication. Two main applications require this property: i) leverage
the possible heterogeneity in the system and assign more tasks to workers that
are faster; and ii) assign tasks adaptively to account for a possibly
time-varying system.

spreading. Buildings hosting the continuous presence of the same users and
significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices,
universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with
infectors. Beside individual's risk-mitigation strategies performed (facial
masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants' load
limitation (towards ""social distancing"") and access control. Simulators could
support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an
Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built
environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate
occupants' movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based and
exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations.
Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies
and virus-related aspects. The model is calibrated on experimental data
(""Diamond Princess"" cruise) and then applied to a relevant case-study (a part
of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning
the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to
reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable
infected people's number. The building capacity limitation could support such
measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical masks use by
occupants (thus improving users' comfort issues). A preliminary model to
combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density combination is proposed. The
model could be modified to consider other recurring scenarios in other public
buildings (e.g. tourist facilities, cultural buildings).

the instability of the system with respect to the appearance of a spatial

the effective masses of an electron and a hole. A phase diagram for the system

the IoT solution tomesh together perfectly, they all have to be part of a
well-thought-out structure. That is where understanding the IoT architecture
becomes paramount. Because of the vast domain of IoT, there is no single
consensus on IoT architecture. Different researchers and organizations proposed
different architectures under a variety of classifications, mainly: conceptual,
standard and, industrial or commercial adoption. It is indispensable to make a
systematic analysis of IoT architecture to be able to compare the industrial
proposals and identify their similarities and their differences. In this work,
we summarize information about seven IoT industrial architectures in order to
propose an approach that makes possible a comparative analysis between
different IoT architectures. This work presents two main contributions: (i) an
approach for analyzing and comparing IoTarchitectures using Layer-Model; (ii) a
comparative study of seven industrial IoT architectures.

$\mathbf{Mod}$ of model categories admits a ""model 2-category structure"" whose
weak equivalences are the Quillen equivalences. We show that $\mathbf{Mod}$
does not have pullbacks and so cannot form a model 2-category. This lack of
pullbacks can be traced to the two-out-of-three axiom on the weak equivalences
of a model category. Accordingly, we define a premodel category to be a
complete and cocomplete category equipped with two nested weak factorization
systems. Combinatorial premodel categories form a complete and cocomplete
closed symmetric monoidal 2-category $\mathbf{CPM}$ whose tensor product
represents Quillen bifunctors. For a monoidal combinatorial premodel category
$V$, the 2-category $V\mathbf{CPM}$ of $V$-enriched combinatorial premodel
categories is simply the category of modules over $V$ (viewed as a monoid
object of $\mathbf{CPM}$), and therefore inherits the algebraic structure of
$\mathbf{CPM}$.
  The homotopy theory of a model category depends in an essential way on the
weak equivalences, so it does not extend directly to a general premodel
category. We develop a substitute homotopy theory for premodel categories
satisfying an additional property which holds automatically for model
categories and also for premodel categories enriched in a monoidal model
category. In particular, for a monoidal model category $V$, we obtain a notion
of Quillen equivalence of $V$-premodel categories which extends the one for
$V$-model categories. When $V$ is a tractable symmetric monoidal model
category, we construct a model 2-category structure on $V\mathbf{CPM}$ with
these Quillen equivalences as the weak equivalences, by adapting Szumi\l{}o's
construction of a fibration category of cofibration categories.

ionize their molecular core birthplaces, sweeping up material into parsec-size
shells. Owing to dissociation by starlight, the thinnest shells are expected to
host low molecular abundances and therefore little star formation. Here, we
expand previous maps taken with the IRAM 30m telescope and present
square-degree 12CO and 13CO (J=2-1) maps of the wind-driven ""Veil bubble'' that
surrounds the Trapezium cluster and its natal Orion molecular core (OMC).
Although widespread and extended CO emission is largely absent from the Veil,
we show that several CO ""globules'' exist and are embedded in the
[CII]158um-bright shell that confines the bubble. This includes the first
detection of quiescent CO at negative LSR velocities in Orion. Given the harsh
UV irradiation conditions in this translucent material, the detection of CO
globules is surprising. These globules are small (R=7,100 AU), not massive
(M=0.3M_Sun), and are moderately dense: n_ H=4x10^4 cm^-3 (median values). They
are confined by the external pressure of the shell, P_ext/k~10^7 cm^-3 K, and
are likely magnetically supported. They are either transient objects formed by
instabilities or have detached from pre-existing molecular structures, sculpted
by the passing shock associated with the expanding shell and by UV radiation
from the Trapezium. Some represent the first stages in the formation of small
pillars, others of isolated small globules. Although their masses do not
suggest they will form stars, one globule matches the position of a known YSO.
The lack of extended CO in the ""Veil shell'' demonstrates that feedback from
massive stars expels, agitates, and reprocesses most of the disrupted molecular
cloud gas, thereby limiting the star-formation rate in the region. The presence
of globules is a result of this feedback.

Logic (BGL). Construing formula trees as the cotrees of cographs, we may state
semantic notions such as evaluation and entailment in purely graph-theoretic
terms, whence we recover the definition of BGL. Naturally, it is conservative
over usual Boolean logic.
  Our contributions are the following:
  (1) We give a natural semantics of BGL based on Boolean relations, i.e. it is
a multivalued semantics, and show adequacy of this semantics for the
corresponding notions of entailment. (2) We show that the complexity of
evaluation is NP-complete for arbitrary graphs (as opposed to ALOGTIME-complete
for formulas), while entailment is $\Pi^p_2$-complete (as opposed to
coNP-complete for formulas). (3) We give a 'recursive' algorithm for evaluation
by induction on the modular decomposition of graphs. (Though this is not
polynomial-time, cf. point (2) above). (4) We characterise evaluation in a
game-theoretic setting, in terms of both static and sequentical strategies,
extending the classical notion of positional game forms beyond cographs. (5) We
give an axiomatisation of BGL, inspired by deep-inference proof theory, and
show soundness and completeness for the corresponding notions of entailment.
  One particular feature of the graph-theoretic setting is that it escapes
certain no-go theorems such as a recent result of Das and Strassburger, that
there is no linear axiomatisation of the linear fragment of Boolean logic
(equivalently the multiplicative fragment of Japaridze's Computability Logic or
Blass' game semantics for Mutliplicative Linear Logic).

optimizing for cross-modal discrimination, rather than within-modal

competitive performance when finetuned on action recognition tasks.
Furthermore, while recent work in contrastive learning defines positive and
negative samples as individual instances, we generalize this definition by
exploring cross-modal agreement. We group together multiple instances as
positives by measuring their similarity in both the video and audio feature
spaces. Cross-modal agreement creates better positive and negative sets, which
allows us to calibrate visual similarities by seeking within-modal
discrimination of positive instances, and achieve significant gains on
downstream tasks.

the fractional rms and time lag before and after MJD 58257, suggesting a
transition occurred at around this point. The observed time lags between the
soft photons in the 1-5 keV band and the hard photons in higher energy bands,
up to 150 keV, are frequency-dependent: the time lags in the low-frequency
range, 2-10 mHz, are both soft and hard lags with a timescale of dozens of
seconds but without a clear trend along the outburst; the time lags in the
high-frequency range, 1-10 Hz, are only hard lags with a timescale of tens of
milliseconds; first increase until around MJD 58257 and decrease after this
date. The high-frequency time lags are significantly correlated to the photon
index derived from the fit to the quasi-simultaneous NICER spectrum in the 1-10

high-frequency time lags are produced by Comptonization in a jet.

the stellar evolution and the formation. Thanks to these systems, the
fundamental stellar parameters (mass, radius) can be obtained very precisely.
The existence of metallic-line (Am) stars in binaries is noticeably common.
However, the known number of Am stars in eclipsing binaries is less. The Am
stars in eclipsing binaries are extremely useful to deeply investigate the
properties of Am stars, as the eclipsing binaries are the only tool to directly
derive the fundamental stellar parameters. Additionally, the atmospheric
parameters and the metallicities of the binary components could be obtained by
a detailed spectroscopic study. Therefore, in this study, we present a
comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the eclipsing binary
system DV\,Boo which has a possible Am component. The fundamental stellar
parameters were determined by the analysis of radial velocity and photometric
light curves. The atmospheric parameters of both binary components of DV\,Boo
were derived using the disentangled spectra. The chemical abundance analysis
was carried out as well. As a result, we showed that the primary component
illustrates a typical Am star chemical abundance distribution. The fundamental
stellar parameters of the binary components were also obtained with an accuracy
of <1\% for masses and $<$3\% for radii. The evolutionary status of DV\,Boo was
examined using the precisely obtained stellar parameters. The age of the system

sample complexity for a mini-batch AC to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate
stationary point improves the best known sample complexity of AC by an order of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log(1/\epsilon))$, and the overall sample complexity
for a mini-batch NAC to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate globally optimal point
improves the existing sample complexity of NAC by an order of

wireless communication channels into smart reconfigurable propagation
environments. To realize this new paradigm, the passive IRSs have to be large,
especially for communication in far-field scenarios, so that they can
compensate for the large end-to-end path-loss, which is caused by the
multiplication of the individual path-losses of the transmitter-to-IRS and
IRS-to-receiver channels. However, optimizing a large number of sub-wavelength
IRS elements imposes a significant challenge for online transmission. To
address this issue, in this paper, we develop a physics-based model and a
scalable optimization framework for large IRSs. The basic idea is to partition
the IRS unit cells into several subsets, referred to as tiles, model the impact
of each tile on the wireless channel, and then optimize each tile in two
stages, namely an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. For
physics-based modeling, we borrow concepts from the radar literature, model
each tile as an anomalous reflector, and derive its impact on the wireless
channel for a given phase shift by solving the corresponding integral equations
for the electric and magnetic vector fields. In the offline design stage, the
IRS unit cells of each tile are jointly designed for the support of different
transmission modes, where each transmission mode effectively corresponds to a
given configuration of the phase shifts that the unit cells of the tile apply
to an impinging electromagnetic wave. In the online optimization stage, the
best transmission mode of each tile is selected such that a desired
quality-of-service (QoS) criterion is maximized. We show that the proposed
modeling and optimization framework can be used to efficiently optimize large
IRSs comprising thousands of unit cells.

that allows for incorporating historical data or real-world evidence into

""skeleton"" approach, combined with the concept of prior effective sample size,
thus it is easy to understand and use. More importantly, our approach maintains
the hallmark of model-assisted designs: simplicity---the dose
escalation/de-escalation rule can be tabulated prior to the trial conduct.
Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed method can effectively
incorporate prior information to improve the operating characteristics of
model-assisted designs, similarly to model-based designs.

decoding performance and can be elegantly decoded with a Windowed Decoder (WD).
We determine an efficient WD configuration with low control overhead. For fair
comparisons, we normalize all configurations to the same maximal computational
complexity, which is an important measure of the decoding effort in
packet-based data communication systems. We determine an optimized
configuration from a joint evaluation of the window size, the window update
strategy, and parity check-based Early Termination (ET). Firstly, we use a
variable node-centered update strategy, which omits updates of messages in some
parts of the decoding window. With the complexity normalization, the window
size can be increased compared to a check node-centered update strategy, which
uniformly updates all messages in the decoding window. Secondly, we only
require the satisfaction of the top-most parity-check equations in each window
to move to the next position more quickly. Using a surprisingly large window
size, the resulting WD halves the average decoding complexity of the block
decoder while maintaining a rather small gap in the decoding performance.

skills while minimizing engineering effort. However, most reinforcement
learning algorithms assume that a well-designed reward function is provided,
and learn a single behavior for that single reward function. Such reward
functions can be difficult to design in practice. Can we instead develop
efficient reinforcement learning methods that acquire diverse skills without
any reward function, and then repurpose these skills for downstream tasks? In
this paper, we demonstrate that a recently proposed unsupervised skill
discovery algorithm can be extended into an efficient off-policy method, making
it suitable for performing unsupervised reinforcement learning in the real
world. Firstly, we show that our proposed algorithm provides substantial
improvement in learning efficiency, making reward-free real-world training
feasible. Secondly, we move beyond the simulation environments and evaluate the
algorithm on real physical hardware. On quadrupeds, we observe that locomotion
skills with diverse gaits and different orientations emerge without any rewards
or demonstrations. We also demonstrate that the learned skills can be composed
using model predictive control for goal-oriented navigation, without any
additional training.

hole geometries. Using the thin shell formalism, this constraint sets a bound
on the minimal allowed radius of the time-like surface of the collapsing star
at the bounce. It follows from this bound that the shell always bounces in an
untrapped region or precisely on a trapping horizon. This constraint is of
purely kinematical origin as it descends from the continuity of the metric
between the geometries describing the interior and exterior of the collapsing
object so that it is completely model-independent. The second part of this work
investigates the conditions under which an effective extension of the
Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse can describe consistent bouncing black hole
solutions. We show that on top of the previous kinematical constraint, an
additional dynamical condition has to be satisfied in order for the model to
admit well-defined black-to-white hole solutions. As expected, this second
condition turns out to be model-dependent. The resulting class of models
describing bouncing compact objects are characterized by three parameters for
the star (mass, initial radius and density) and two quantum parameters
descending from the UV-completion of the exterior and interior geometries. The
solution space contains (1) bouncing stars and (2) bouncing black holes and (3)
a new class of astrophysical objects which alternate between a bouncing star
and a bouncing black hole. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of a
black-to-white hole bounce using the techniques of spatially closed LQC and
discuss the novel properties induced by the presence of the inner horizon in
this new framework. This generic framework lays down the foundation for
interesting phenomenological investigations concerning the astrophysical
properties of these objects, as well as a novel platform for further

in our algorithm computes a point in $C_{A,r}$ that is either within
$\varepsilon$ distance to $b$, or acts as a certificate proving $b \not \in
C_{A,r}$. Each iteration takes $O(mn)$ operations and when $b$ is well-situated
in $C_{A,r}$, the number of iterations is proportional to
$\log{(1/\varepsilon)}$. If $Ax=b$ is solvable the algorithm computes an
approximate solution or the minimum-norm solution. Otherwise, it computes a
certificate to unsolvability, or the minimum-norm least-squares solution. It is
also applicable to complex input. In a computational comparison with the

Triangle Algorithm is robust, simple to implement, and requires no
preconditioner, making it attractive to practitioners, as well as researchers

measures in brain injury prediction, given that the majority of brain injury

using fast approaches, such as machine learning, to approximate brain
deformation in real-time for early brain injury diagnosis. However, those
requires large number of kinematic measurements, and therefore data
augmentation is required given the limited on-field measured data available. In
this study we present a principal component analysis-based method that emulates
an empirical low-rank substitution for head impact kinematics, while requiring
low computational cost. In characterizing our existing data set of 537 head
impacts, consisting of 6 degrees of freedom measurements, we found that only a
few modes, e.g. 15 in the case of angular velocity, is sufficient for accurate
reconstruction of the entire data set. Furthermore, these modes are
predominantly low frequency since over 70% to 90% of the angular velocity
response can be captured by modes that have frequencies under 40Hz. We compared
our proposed method against existing impact parametrization methods and showed
significantly better performance in injury prediction using a range of
kinematic-based metrics -- such as head injury criterion and rotational injury
criterion (RIC) -- and brain tissue deformation-metrics -- such as brain angle
metric, maximum principal strain (MPS) and axonal fiber strains (FS). In all
cases, our approach reproduced injury metrics similar to the ground truth
measurements with no significant difference, whereas the existing methods
obtained significantly different (p<0.01) values as well as poor injury
classification sensitivity and specificity. This emulator will enable us to
provide the necessary data augmentation to build a head impact kinematic data
set of any size.

These phenomena are at the heart of the acoustofluidics technology, where

We present a theoretical model considering a generic acoustic beam interacting
with a subwavelength spheroidal particle in a nonviscous fluid. Concise
analytical expressions of the radiation force and torque are obtained in the
scattering dipole approximation. The radiation force is given in terms of a
gradient and scattering force; while the radiation torque has two fundamental
contributions, namely, the momentum arm and acoustic spin (spin-torque effect).
As a practical example, we use the theory to describe the interaction of two
crossed plane waves and a prolate spheroidal particle. The results reveal the
particle is transversely trapped in a pressure node and is axially pushed by
the radiation force. Also, the momentum arm aligns the particle in the axial
direction. At certain specific positions, only the spin-torque occurs. Our
findings are remarkably consistent with finite-element simulations. The success
of our model enables its use as an investigation tool for the manipulation of
anisotropic microparticles in acoustofluidics.

number counts of galaxies. We confirm previous results for photometric surveys,
showing that lensing cannot be neglected in a survey like LSST since it would
infer a significant shift of cosmological parameters. For a spectroscopic
survey like SKA2, we find that neglecting lensing in the monopole, quadrupole
and hexadecapole of the correlation function also induces an important shift of
parameters. For ${\Lambda}$CDM parameters, the shift is moderate, of the order
of 0.6${\sigma}$ or less. However, for a model-independent analysis, that
measures the growth rate of structure in each redshift bin, neglecting lensing
introduces a shift of up to 2.3${\sigma}$ at high redshift. Since the growth
rate is directly used to test the theory of gravity, such a strong shift would
wrongly be interpreted as the breakdown of General Relativity. This shows the
importance of including lensing in the analysis of future surveys. On the other
hand, for a survey like DESI, we find that lensing is not important, mainly due
to the value of the magnification bias parameter of DESI, $s(z)$, which
strongly reduces the lensing contribution at high redshift. We also propose a
way of improving the analysis of spectroscopic surveys, by including the
cross-correlations between different redshift bins (which is neglected in
spectroscopic surveys) from the spectroscopic survey or from a different
photometric sample. We show that including the cross-correlations in the SKA2
analysis does not improve the constraints. On the other hand replacing the
cross-correlations from SKA2 by cross-correlations measured with LSST improves
the constraints by 10 to 20 %. Interestingly, for ${\Lambda}$CDM parameters, we
find that LSST and SKA2 are highly complementary, since they are affected
differently by degeneracies between parameters.

fixed processing time is consumed at the receiver for decoding and sending
feedback to the transmitter. Decoded messages are used to construct a minimum
mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the process as a function of time. This is
shown to be an increasing functional of the age-of-information, defined as the
time elapsed since the sampling time pertaining to the latest successfully
decoded message. Such (age-penalty) functional depends on the quantization
bits, codeword lengths and receiver processing time. The goal, for each coding
scheme, is to optimize sampling times such that the long term average MMSE is
minimized. This is then characterized in the setting of general increasing
age-penalty functionals, not necessarily corresponding to MMSE, which may be of

elections has appeared in the social choice literature for over a century, and
is typically understood as avoiding the underrepresentation of minorities.
However, we argue that the security of some distributed systems is directly
linked to the opposite goal of avoiding the overrepresentation of any minority,
a goal not previously formalized that leads us to an optimization objective
known as maximin support. After providing a thorough analysis of the
computational complexity of this objective, we propose a new efficient election
rule that simultaneously achieves a) a constant-factor approximation guarantee
for it, and b) the property of proportional justified representation (PJR) -
one of the strongest forms of proportional representation. However, the most
striking feature of the new rule is that one can verify in linear time that the
winning committee satisfies the two aforementioned guarantees, even when the
algorithm is executed by an untrusted party who only communicates the output.
As a result, the rule can be adapted into a verifiable computing scheme.
Moreover, its verification procedure easily admits parallel processing for
further efficiency.
  Our work is motivated by an application on blockchain networks that implement
Nominated Proof-of-Stake, where the community elects a committee of validators

global unitary operations in manifesting quantum discord from a general two
qubit zero discord state. Apart from the emergence of some obvious concepts
such as absolute classical-quantum, absolute quantum-classical states, more
interestingly, it is observed that set of states characterized by absoluteness
contains only maximally mixed state. Consequently this marks the peak of
effectiveness of global unitary operations in purview of manifesting
nonclassicality from arbitrary two qubit state when other standard methods fail

similar composition. The color homogeneity of binary pairs contrasts with the
overall diversity of colors in the Kuiper belt, which was interpreted as
evidence that Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) formed from a locally homogeneous

must have formed early, before the dynamically hot TNOs were scattered out from
their formation location. The latter inferences, however, relied on the
assumption that the matching colors of the binary components imply matching
composition. Here, we test this assumption by examining the component-resolved

for the binary pairs suggestive of similar reflectance spectra and hence
surface composition. This advocates for gravitational collapse of pebble clouds
as a possible TNO formation route. We however stress that several similarly

substantial spectral variability in the near-infrared, implying color equality

attention due to its capability to accommodate massive connectivity and reduce

schemes, this new scheme can ensure that admitting the grant-free users is
completely transparent to the grant-based users, i.e., the grant-based users'
quality-of-service experience is guaranteed to be the same as for orthogonal
multiple access. In addition, compared to existing SGF schemes, the proposed
SGF scheme can significantly improve the robustness of the grant-free users'
transmissions and effectively avoid outage probability error floors. To
facilitate the performance evaluation of the proposed SGF transmission scheme,
an exact expression for the outage probability is obtained and an asymptotic
analysis is conducted to show that the achievable multi-user diversity gain is
proportional to the number of participating grant-free users. Computer
simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed SGF transmission

If the DTD of a population is long, most of the mergers take place at low
redshifts and the background would be rather quiet compared to a scenario in
which the DTD is short leading to few individual detections at low redshift but
a rather loud background. We show that different DTDs predict a factor of 5

other factors such as the mass function of the primary BH mass, $p(m_1)$, the
maximum considered BH mass ($M_{\rm max}$), and the effective spin of the black
hole ($\chi_{\rm eff}$). A non-detection of such a background can rule out the

supernovae (SNe) should produce late-time synchrotron radio emission as the
ejecta shocks into the surrounding ambient medium. Models for such radio flares
typically assume the ejecta expands into an unperturbed interstellar medium
(ISM). However, it is also well-known that binary NS mergers and broad-lined Ic
SNe can harbor relativistic jetted outflows. In this work, we show that such
jets shock the ambient ISM ahead of the ejecta, thus evacuating the medium into
which the ejecta subsequently collides. Using an idealized
spherically-symmetric model, we illustrate that this inhibits the ejecta radio
flare at early times $t < t_{\rm col} \approx 12 \, {\rm yr} \, (E_{\rm

implications for radio observations of GW170817 and future binary NS mergers,
gamma-ray burst (GRB) SNe, decade-long radio transients such as FIRST J1419,

around the supermassive black hole (BH), where $r_{\rm g}$ is the gravitational
radius. However, because the hotspot traversed the loop in a short time, models
in which the hotspot tracks the motion of some fluid element tend to produce a
best-fit trajectory smaller than the observed loop. This is true for a circular
Keplerian orbit, even when BH spin is accounted for, and for motion along a
RIAF streamline. A marginally bound geodesic suffers from the same problem; in
addition, it is not clear what the origin of an object following the geodesic
would be. The observed hotspot motion is more likely a pattern motion. Circular
motion with $r\simeq12.5\,r_{\rm g}$ and a super-Keplerian speed $\simeq0.8\,c$

explained by physical forces. The pattern speed is compatible with
magnetohydrodynamic perturbations, provided that the magnetic field is
sufficiently strong. Circular pattern motion of radius $\sim20\, r_{\rm g}$ on
a plane above the BH is an equally good alternative; in this case, the hotspot
may be caused by a precessing outflow interacting with a surrounding disk. As
all our fits have relatively large radii, we cannot constrain the BH spin using

synthesis models suggest that the redshift evolution of $L_{\mathrm{X}}$/SFR is
driven by the metallicity ($Z$) dependence of HMXBs, and the first direct
evidence of this connection was recently presented using galaxies at $z\sim2$.
To confirm this result with more robust measurements and better constrain the

stacked \textit{Chandra} data from the COSMOS Legacy survey to measure the
average $L_{\mathrm{X}}$/SFR as a function of $Z$ in three redshift ranges:
$z=0.1-0.25$, $0.25-0.4$, and $0.5-0.9$. We find no significant variation of
the $L_{\mathrm{X}}$-SFR-$Z$ relation with redshift. Our results provide
further evidence that the $Z$ dependence of HMXBs is responsible for the

responds with a period larger than that of the modulation for an exponentially

of the underlying dynamics is enabled by a self-correcting mechanism of the
long-ranged interactions which compensates noise-induced imperfections. Our

precision of present-day stellar evolution models is typically about two orders
of magnitude lower than the measurement errors. Using the Akaike Information

\times 10^{14} \lesssim M_{200}|_{z=0} \lesssim 7 \times 10^{14}\, M_\odot$,
which have already proven to produce realistic BCG masses. We compute the BCG
alignment with both the distribution of cluster galaxies and the dark matter
(DM) halo. At redshift $z=0$, the major axes of the simulated BCGs and their
host cluster galaxy distributions are aligned on average within 20$^\circ$. The
BCG alignment with the DM halo is even tighter. The alignment persists up to
$z\lesssim2$ with no evident evolution. This result continues, although with a
weaker signal, when considering the projected alignment. The cluster alignment
with the surrounding distribution of matter ($3R_{200}$) is already in place at
$z\sim4$ with a typical angle of $35^\circ$, before the BCG-Cluster alignment
develops. The BCG turns out to be also aligned with the same matter
distribution, albeit always to a lesser extent. These results taken together
might imply that the BCG-Cluster alignment occurs in an outside-in fashion.
Depending on their frequency and geometry, mergers can promote, destroy or
weaken the alignments. Clusters that do not experience recent major mergers are
typically more relaxed and aligned with their BCG. In turn, accretions closer
to the cluster elongation axis tend to improve the alignment as opposed to
accretions closer to the cluster minor axis.

in the halos of FRs increases outwards and with stellar mass. Simulated SRs
have relatively constant triaxiality profiles. Simulated stellar halos show a

close an SO(5) algebra can develop local expectation values by splitting the
zero modes in five and ten different ways by lifting its SO(4) and SU(2) chiral

broken by three distinct copies of chiral-triplet mass orders, giving rise to
the notion of the color or flavor degeneracy among the competing orders. By
contrast, a skyrmion of three anticommuting masses supports additional six
masses in its core, and possesses an SU(2) isospin quantum number, besides the
usual generalized U(1) charge. Consequently, charge $4e$ Kekule
pair-density-waves can develop in the skyrmion core of N\'eel layer
antiferromagnet, while a skyrmion of quantum spin Hall insulator in addition
supports a mundane $s$-wave pairing. We also analyze the internal algebra of

segmented relationships, whereby median gradients of galaxies with$\log

far out of equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated electron systems.
Understanding and utilizing these interactions is crucial to photo-control of
quantum many-body states. One of the most surprising examples of strong mode
coupling is the interaction between apical oxygen phonons and Josephson
plasmons in bilayer YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ superconductors. Experiments by Hu
et al (2014). and Kaiser et al. (2014) showed that below Tc, photo-excitation
of phonons leads to enhancement and frequency shifts of Josephson plasmon
edges, while aboveTc, photo-excited phonons induce plasmon edges even when
there are no discernible features in the equilibrium reflectivity spectrum.
Recent experiments by Van Hoegen et al. (2019) also observed parametric
generation of Josephson plasmons from photo-excited phonons both below Tc and
in the pseudogap phase. In this paper we present a theoretical model of
phonon-plasmon three wave interaction arising from coupling between the oxygen
motion and the in-plane superfluid stiffness. Analysis of the parametric
instability of plasmons based on this model gives frequencies of the most
unstable plasmons that are in agreement with experimental observations. We also
discuss how strong parametric excitation of Josephson plasmons can explain pump
induced changes in the TeraHertz reflectivity of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ in the
superconducting state, including frequency shifts and sharpening of Josephson
plasmon edges, as well as appearance of a new peak around 2THz. An interesting
feature of this model is that overdamped Josephson plasmons do not give any
discernible features in reflectivity in equilibrium, but can develop plasmon
edges when parametrically excited. We suggest that this mechanism explains
photo-induced plasmon edges in the pseudogap phase of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$.

molecular disc is found to vary between $50-300$ pc, which is higher than what
is found in a single-component disc. We find that this scale height can vary
significantly depending on the assumed thick disc molecular gas fraction. We
also find that the molecular gas flares as a function of the radius and follows
a tight exponential law with a scale length of $\left(0.48 \pm 0.01 \right)
r_{25}$. We used the density solutions to produce the column density maps and
spectral cubes to examine the ideal observing conditions to identify a thick
molecular disc in galaxies. We find that unless the molecular disc is an
edge-on system and imaged with a high spatial resolution ($\lesssim 100$ pc),
it is extremely hard to identify a thick molecular disc in a column density
map. The spectral analysis further reveals that at moderate to high inclination
($i \gtrsim 40^o$), spectral broadening can fictitiously introduce the
signatures of a two-component disc into the spectral cube of a single-component
disc. Hence, we conclude that a low inclination molecular disc imaged with high
spatial resolution would serve as the ideal site for identifying the thick
molecular disc in galaxies.

demonstrate that optimal interpolation techniques display near optimal

encodes when a four-dimensional symplectic ellipsoid can be embedded into a
four-dimensional ball has a remarkable structure: the function has infinitely
many corners, determined by the odd-index Fibonacci numbers, that fit together
to form an infinite staircase.
  This work has recently led to considerable interest in understanding when the
ellipsoid embedding function for other symplectic 4-manifolds is partly
described by an infinite staircase. We provide a general framework for
analyzing this question for a large family of targets, called finite type
convex toric domains, which we prove generalizes the class of closed toric
symplectic 4-manifolds. When the target is of finite type, we prove that any
infinite staircase must have a unique accumulation point a_0, given as the
solution to an explicit quadratic equation. Moreover, we prove that the
embedding function at a_0 must be equal to the classical volume lower bound. In
particular, our result gives an obstruction to the existence of infinite
staircases that we show is strong.
  In the special case of rational convex toric domains, we can say more. We
conjecture a complete answer to the question of existence of infinite
staircases, in terms of six families that are distinguished by the fact that
their moment polygon is reflexive. We then provide a uniform proof of the
existence of infinite staircases for our six families, using two tools. For the
first, we use recursive families of almost toric fibrations to find symplectic
embeddings. For the second tool, we find recursive families of convex lattice
paths that provide obstructions to embeddings. We conclude by reducing our
conjecture that these are the only infinite staircases among rational convex
toric domains to a question in number theory related to a classic work of Hardy
and Littlewood.

their size distribution, which depends on the primary ionising sources, and the
relationship between reionisation and galaxy evolution. We demonstrate that
spectrally resolved $z\gtrsim6$ Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission can constrain
properties of reionised regions. Specifically, the distant from a source to a
neutral region sets the minimum observable Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset from
systemic. Detection of flux on the blue side of the Ly$\alpha$ resonance
implies the source resides in a large, sufficiently ionised region that photons
can escape without significant resonant absorption, and thus constrains both
the sizes of and the residual neutral fractions within ionised bubbles. We
estimate the extent of the region around galaxies which is optically thin to
blue Ly$\alpha$ photons, analogous to quasar proximity zones, as a function of
the source's ionising photon output and surrounding gas density. This optically
thin region is typically $\lesssim 0.3$ pMpc in radius (allowing transmission
of flux $\gtrsim -250$ km s$^{-1}$), $\lesssim 20$% of the distance to the
neutral region. In a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the $z\approx6.6$ galaxy
COLA1 -- with a blue Ly$\alpha$ peak -- likely resides in an ionised region
$>0.7$ pMpc, with residual neutral fraction $<10^{-5.5}$. To ionise its own
proximity zone we infer COLA1 has a high ionising photon escape fraction
($f_{\mathrm{esc}}>0.50$), relatively steep UV slope ($\beta < -1.79$), and low
line-of-sight gas density ($\sim0.5\times$ the cosmic mean), suggesting it is a
rare, underdense line-of-sight.

use limited information to make diagnostic and treatment decisions as patient
acuity evolves. However, it is common that the time series vital sign

poses a significant challenge for machine / deep learning techniques to analyze
and facilitate the clinicians to improve the human health outcome. To deal with
this problem, We propose a novel deep interpolation network to extract latent
representations from sparse and irregularly sampled time-series vital signs
measured within six hours of hospital admission. Methods: We created a
single-center longitudinal dataset of electronic health record data for all
(n=75,762) adult patient admissions to a tertiary care center lasting six hours
or longer, using 55% of the dataset for training, 23% for validation, and 22%
for testing. All raw time series within six hours of hospital admission were
extracted for six vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood
pressure, heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen saturation, and respiratory
rate). A deep interpolation network is proposed to learn from such irregular
and sparse multivariate time series data to extract the fixed low-dimensional
latent patterns. We use k-means clustering algorithm to clusters the patient
admissions resulting into 7 clusters. Findings: Training, validation, and
testing cohorts had similar age (55-57 years), sex (55% female), and admission
vital signs. Seven distinct clusters were identified. M Interpretation: In a
heterogeneous cohort of hospitalized patients, a deep interpolation network
extracted representations from vital sign data measured within six hours of
hospital admission. This approach may have important implications for clinical
decision-support under time constraints and uncertainty.

peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical
compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the
effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. The
importance of social structure, such as the age dependence that proved
essential in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, must be considered, and in addition,
the available data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of
uncertainty must be incorporated into the model from the beginning. In this
work we address these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of a
socially structured epidemic model in presence of uncertain data. After the
introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous
approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled
compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The
need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the
social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global
strategy. The timing and intensity of interventions, however, is particularly
relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected
people. Simulations related to data from the first wave of the recent COVID-19

two-dimensional topological superconductivity (TSC). Two reasons for the
excitement are the high $T_c$ of the system and the fact that the Majorana zero
modes (MZMs) inside the vortex cores live on the exposed surface rather than at
the interface of a heterostructure as in the proximitized topological
insulators. However, the recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy data have shown
that, contrary to the theoretical expectation, the MZM does not exist inside
every vortex core. Hence there are ``full'' vortices with MZMs and ``empty''
vortices without MZMs. Moreover the fraction of ``empty'' vortices increase
with an increase in the magnetic field. We propose the possibility of two
distinct gapped states competing for the topological surface states in FeSeTe:
the TSC and half quantum anomalous Hall (hQAH). The latter is promoted by
magnetic field through the alignment of magnetic impurities such as Fe
interstitials. When hQAH takes over the topological surface state, the surface
will become transparent to scanning tunneling microscopy and the nature of the
vortex in such region will appear identical to what is expected of the vortices
in the bulk, i.e., empty. Unmistakable signature of the proposed mechanism for
empty vortices will be the existance of chiral Majorana modes(CMM) at the
domain wall between a hQAH region and a TSC region. Such CMM should be
observable by observing local density of states along a line connecting an
empty vortex to a nearby full vortex.

instrumental systematics and provides light curves in a stable and
well-understood photometric system. Having the same host galaxy also eliminates
systematics due to distance and peculiar velocity, providing an opportunity to
directly test the relative precision of SNe Ia as standard candles. The two SNe
have nearly identical decline rates, negligible reddening, and remarkably
similar spectra and, at a distance of $\sim 20$ Mpc, are ideal as potential
calibrators for the absolute distance using primary indicators such as Cepheid
variables. We discuss to what extent these two SNe can be considered twins and
compare them with other supernova ""siblings"" in the literature and their likely

that when using SNe~Ia, and after accounting for all sources of observational
error, one gets consistency in distance to 3 percent.

semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) heterostructures in the so-called
quasi-Majorana regime $-$ the topologically-trivial regime due to
partially-separated Andreev bound states (ps-ABSs). These low energy ABSs
consist of component Majorana bound states (quasi-Majorana modes) that are
spatially separated by a length scale smaller than the length of the system, in
contrast with the Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which are separated by the length
of the wire. In the quasi-Majorana regime, the ZBCPs appear to be robust to
various perturbations as long as the energy splitting of the ps-ABS is less
than the typical width $\e_w$ of the low-energy conductance peaks $\e_w$.
However, the feasibility of measurement-based braiding depends on a different
energy scale $\e_m$. In this paper we show that it is possible to prepare the
SM-SC system in the quasi-Majorana regime with energy splittings below the
$\e_m$ threshold, so that measurement-based braiding is possible in principle.
Starting with ps-ABSs with energy below $\e_m$, we identify the maximum
amplitudes of different types of perturbations that are consistent with
perturbation-induced energy splittings not exceeding the $\e_m$ limit. We argue
that measurements generating perturbations larger than the threshold amplitudes
appropriate for $\e_m$ cannot realize measurement-based braiding in SM-SC
heterostructures in the quasi-Majorana regime. We find that, if possible at
all, quantum computation using measurement-based braiding in the quasi-Majorana
regime would be plagued with errors introduced by the measurement processes
themselves, while such errors are significantly less likely in a scheme
involving topological MZMs.

particles (bosons or fermions, charged or uncharged), with a particular
emphasis on the subtleties that arise when the phase is due to the coupling to
an abelian gauge field. In that case, we show that the measurable quantities
are spacetime loop integrals of the 4-vector potential, enclosed by two
identical particles or by a particle-antiparticle pair. Furthermore, we
generalize our considerations to scenarios involving an arbitrary number of
parties performing local measurements on a general charged fermionic state.
Finally, as a concrete application, we analyse a recent proposal by Marletto
and Vedral (arXiv:1906.03440) involving the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm
effect.

subsystems of a boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) or of a CFT in a state
constructed using a Euclidean BCFT path integral. Holographic calculations
suggest that these entropies undergo phase transitions as a function of time or
parameters describing the subsystem; these arise from a change in topology of
the RT surface. In recent applications to black hole physics, such transitions
have been seen to govern whether or not the bulk entanglement wedge of a (B)CFT
region includes a portion of the black hole interior and have played a crucial
role in understanding the semiclassical origin of the Page curve for
evaporating black holes.
  In this paper, we reproduce these holographic results via direct (B)CFT
calculations. Using the replica method, the entropies are related to
correlation functions of twist operators in a Euclidean BCFT. These
correlations functions can be expanded in various channels involving
intermediate bulk or boundary operators. Under certain sparseness conditions on
the spectrum and OPE coefficients of bulk and boundary operators, we show that
the twist correlators are dominated by the vacuum block in a single channel,
with the relevant channel depending on the position of the twists. These
transitions between channels lead to the holographically observed phase
transitions in entropies.

industries - Shelf segmentation. Shelf segmentation can be interpreted as a
pixel-wise classification problem, i.e., each pixel is classified as to whether
they belong to visible shelf edges or not. The aim is not just to segment shelf
edges, but also to deploy the model on mobile devices. As there is no standard

semantic segmentation architectures which can be deployed on edge. We modify
low-footprint semantic segmentation architectures to perform shelf

significant drop in accuracy and also with 15X fewer parameters. In this paper,

making an implicit assumption that the AI system will function autonomously.
However, in practice, AI systems often are used to provide advice to people in
domains ranging from criminal justice and finance to healthcare. In such
AI-advised decision making, humans and machines form a team, where the human is
responsible for making final decisions. But is the most accurate AI the best
teammate? We argue ""No"" -- predictable performance may be worth a slight
sacrifice in AI accuracy. Instead, we argue that AI systems should be trained
in a human-centered manner, directly optimized for team performance. We study
this proposal for a specific type of human-AI teaming, where the human overseer
chooses to either accept the AI recommendation or solve the task themselves. To
optimize the team performance for this setting we maximize the team's expected
utility, expressed in terms of the quality of the final decision, cost of
verifying, and individual accuracies of people and machines. Our experiments
with linear and non-linear models on real-world, high-stakes datasets show that
the most accuracy AI may not lead to highest team performance and show the
benefit of modeling teamwork during training through improvements in expected
team utility across datasets, considering parameters such as human skill and
the cost of mistakes. We discuss the shortcoming of current optimization

reactor using a superconducting solenoid magnet. To extend this investigation,
we designed, constructed, and evaluated a permanent magnet Penning trap. The
device consists of a solenoid formed from an annular array of neodymium bar
magnets between two iron pole pieces designed to give a uniform magnetic field
in the central volume of the device. Critical to achieving the uniform
solenoidal field is an iron equatorial ring supported within the annular array
of magnets. A nonmagnetic titanium Penning trap with hyperbolic surfaces
designed to produce a spherical potential well was mounted inside the permanent
magnet assembly. The trap was fitted with a nonmagnetic hairpin filament
electron source and demonstrated to produce electron trapping at the
theoretically predicted magnetic fields and trap potentials. Trap potentials
achievable were limited by electrical breakdown within the trap operating in
constant potential mode. Efforts were made to extend the trap potentials using
pulsed anode voltages, but nuclear fusion in a Penning trap has not yet been
demonstrated. The design and construction of the permanent magnet solenoid and
nonmagnetic trap are presented here as potentially useful also in other
studies.

spatial and temporal scales cannot be fully discretized or underlying physics

model (LIM), has been widely used for regional climate predictability studies -
typically focusing more on tropical or mid-latitude studies. However, most LIM
fitting techniques rely on point estimation techniques deriving from
fluctuation-dissipation theory. In this methodological study we explore the use
of Bayesian inference techniques for LIM parameter estimation of sea surface
temperature (SST), to quantify the skillful decadal predictability of Bayesian
LIM models at high latitudes. We show that Bayesian methods, when compared to
traditional point estimation methods for LIM-type models, provide better
calibrated probabilistic skill, while simultaneously providing better point
estimates due to the regularization effect of the prior distribution in
high-dimensional problems. We compare the effect of several priors, as well as
maximum likelihood estimates, on (1) estimating parameter values on a perfect
model experiment and (2) producing calibrated 1-year SST anomaly forecast
distributions using a pre-industrial control run of the Community Earth System
Model (CESM). Finally, we employ a host of probabilistic skill metrics to
determine the extent to which a LIM can forecast SST anomalies at high
latitudes. We find that the choice of prior distribution has an appreciable
impact on estimation outcomes, and priors that emphasize physically relevant
properties enhance the model's ability to capture variability of SST anomalies.

faces problems in explaining the observed equivalent widths (EWs). We examine
the optical Fe II and near-infrared Ca II triplet (CaT) emission strengths
using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Using an incident continuum for I Zw 1 -
a prototypical Type-1 narrow-line Seyfert galaxy, we can recover the line
ratios for the optical Fe II (i.e. R$_{\rm{Fe II}}$) and the NIR CaT (i.e.
R$_{\rm{CaT}}$) in agreement to the observed estimates. Although, the pairs of
(U,$\rm{n_{H}}$) that reproduce the conforming line ratios, unfortunately, do
not relate to agreeable line EWs. We thus propose that the LIL region of the
BLR cloud doesn't see the same continuum seen by a distant observer that is
emanated from the accretion disk, rather it sees a filtered version of the
original continuum. The assumption of the filtered continuum as the source of
BLR irradiation recovers realistic EWs for LIL species. However, our study
finds that to account for the adequate R$_{\rm{Fe II}}$ (Fe II/H$\beta$ flux
ratio) emission, the BLR needs to be selectively overabundant in iron. On the
other hand, the R$_{\rm{CaT}}$ (CaT/H$\beta$ flux ratio) emission spans a
broader range from solar to super-solar metallicities. In all these models the
BLR cloud density is found to be consistent with our conclusions from prior
works, i.e. $\rm{n_{H}} \sim 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. An interesting result obtained
here is the reduction in the value of the metallicity by up to a factor 10 for
the R$_{\rm{Fe II}}$ cases when the microturbulence is invoked, suggesting that
microturbulence can act as an apparent metallicity controller for the Fe II. On
the contrary, the R$_{\rm{CaT}}$ cases are rather unaffected by the effect of
microturbulence.

variable by modeling its data generating mechanism. As a result, using the
reference model predictions in the model selection procedure reduces the
variability and improves stability leading to improved model selection
performance. Assuming that a Bayesian reference model describes the true
distribution of future data well, the theoretically preferred usage of the
reference model is to project its predictive distribution to a reduced model
leading to projection predictive variable selection approach. Alternatively,
reference models may also be used in an ad-hoc manner in combination with
common variable selection methods. In several numerical experiments, we
investigate the performance of the projective prediction approach as well as
alternative variable selection methods with and without reference models. Our
results indicate that the use of reference models generally translates into
better and more stable variable selection. Additionally, we demonstrate that
the projection predictive approach shows superior performance as compared to
alternative variable selection methods independently of whether or not they use

superconducting phase and impurity scattering. Here, for the overdoped region,
we report the results of a combined dynamic cluster approximation (DCA) and a

that a decrease in the $d$-wave pairing strength of the two-particle scattering

the magnetic spin fluctuations as the system is overdoped. Treating the
impurity scattering within a disordered BCS $d$-wave approximation, we see how

  We present some key aspects of its new architecture, and describe some of its
major applications, including Real-time orbit determination and ephemeris

supporting User Range Error (URE) of $<$ 5 cm RMS; precision post-processing
GNSS orbit determination, including JPL's contributions to the International

disassortative mixing (negative degree correlation). First, we analyzed the
variability in the assortativity coefficients of different groups of the same
platform by using three different subreddits in Reddit. Our data analysis
results showed that Reddit is disassortative, and assortativity coefficients of
the aforementioned subreddits are computed as -0.0384, -0.0588 and -0.1107,
respectively. Motivated by the variability in the results even in the same
platform, we decided to investigate the sensitivity of dynamics of consensus
formation to the assortativity of the network. We concluded that the system is
more likely to reach a consensus when the network is disassortatively mixed or
neutral; however, the likelihood of the consensus significantly decreases when
the network is assortatively mixed. Surprisingly, the time elapsed until all
nodes fix their opinions is slightly lower when the network is neutral compared
to either assortative or disassortative networks. These results are more
pronounced when the thresholds of agents are more heterogeneously distributed.

hand, it has been shown recently that FeSe displays a negligible effect of
nematicity on superconductivity near the superconducting transition, and actual
cooperation between the two orders when the system is doped with S. Recently it
has also been proposed that LiFeAs undergoes a nematic transition in the

anisotropic when it coexists with nematic order, but it is not clear under what
circumstances the two orders compete or cooperate, nor how the anisotropy of
the superconducting state correlates with that in the nematic state. To address
this, we study a simple mean field model of a $d$-wave Pomeranchuk instability

SGD dynamics under linear regression and two-layer linear networks, with an
easy extension to deeper linear networks, by focusing on the variance of the
gradients, which is the first study of this nature. In the linear regression
case, we show that in each iteration the norm of the gradient is a decreasing
function of the mini-batch size $b$ and thus the variance of the stochastic
gradient estimator is a decreasing function of $b$. For deep neural networks
with $L_2$ loss we show that the variance of the gradient is a polynomial in
$1/b$. The results back the important intuition that smaller batch sizes yield
lower loss function values which is a common believe among the researchers. The
proof techniques exhibit a relationship between stochastic gradient estimators
and initial weights, which is useful for further research on the dynamics of

$2H$-MoS$_2$ using transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy. For K
concentrations up to approximately 0.4, the crystals appear to be inhomogeneous
with a mix of structural phases and irregular potassium distribution. Above
this intercalation level, MoS$_2$ exhibits a $2a \times 2a$ superstructure in
the $ab$ plane and unit cell parameters of a = 3.20 $\unicode{x212B}$ and c =

$1T''$ polytypes. The diffraction patterns also show a $\sqrt{3}a \times
\sqrt{3}a$ and a much weaker $2\sqrt{3}a \times 2\sqrt{3}a$ superstructure that
is very likely associated with the ordering of the potassium ions. A
semiconductor-to-metal transition occurs signified by the disappearance of the
excitonic features from the electron energy-loss spectra and the emergence of a
charge carrier plasmon with an unscreened plasmon frequency of 2.78 eV. The
plasmon has a positive, quadratic dispersion and appears to be superimposed
with an excitation arising from interband transitions. The behavior of the
plasmon peak energy positions as a function of potassium concentration shows
that potassium stoichiometries of less than $\sim 0.3$ are thermodynamically
unstable while higher stoichiometries up to $\sim 0.5$ are thermodynamically
stable. Potassium concentrations greater than $\sim 0.5$ lead to the
decomposition of MoS$_2$ and the formation of K$_2$S. The real part of the
dielectric function and the optical conductivity of K$_{0.41}$MoS$_2$ were
derived from the loss spectra via Kramers-Kronig analysis.

computational problem from a huge class of the constraint satisfaction problems
(CSP): an $\mathcal{H}$-coloring of a graph $\mathcal{G}$ is just a
homomorphism from $\mathcal{G}$ to $\mathcal{H}$ and the problem is to decide
for fixed $\mathcal{H}$, given $\mathcal{G}$, if a homomorphism exists or not.
The dichotomy theorem for the $\mathcal{H}$-coloring problem was proved by Hell
and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il in 1990 (an analogous theorem for all CSPs was recently
proved by Zhuk and Bulatov) and it says that for each $\mathcal{H}$ the problem
is either $p$-time decidable or $NP$-complete. Since negations of unsatisfiable
instances of CSP can be expressed as propositional tautologies, it seems to be
natural to investigate the proof complexity of CSP. We show that the decision
algorithm in the $p$-time case of the $\mathcal{H}$-coloring problem can be
formalized in a relatively weak theory and that the tautologies expressing the
negative instances for such $\mathcal{H}$ have short proofs in propositional
proof system $R^*(log)$, a mild extension of resolution. In fact, when the
formulas are expressed as unsatisfiable sets of clauses they have $p$-size
resolution proofs. To establish this we use a well-known connection between
theories of bounded arithmetic and propositional proof systems. We complement
this result by a lower bound result that holds for many weak proof systems for
a special example of $NP$-complete case of the $\mathcal{H}$-coloring problem,
using the known results about proof complexity of the Pigeonhole Principle.

active learning which is able to select atomic configurations on which a

optimal for latent layers to improve their robustness, attributing meaning to

formulate interpretation as a translation of hidden representations onto
semantic concepts that are comprehensible to the user. The mapping between both
domains has to be bijective so that semantic modifications in the target domain
correctly alter the original representation. The proposed invertible
interpretation network can be transparently applied on top of existing
architectures with no need to modify or retrain them. Consequently, we
translate an original representation to an equivalent yet interpretable one and
backwards without affecting the expressiveness and performance of the original.
The invertible interpretation network disentangles the hidden representation
into separate, semantically meaningful concepts. Moreover, we present an
efficient approach to define semantic concepts by only sketching two images and
also an unsupervised strategy. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the wide

model, we benchmark on the rotamer recovery task, the problem of predicting the
conformation of a side chain from its context within a protein structure, which
has been used to evaluate energy functions for protein design. The model
achieves performance close to that of the Rosetta energy function, a
state-of-the-art method widely used in protein structure prediction and design.
An investigation of the model's outputs and hidden representations finds that
it captures physicochemical properties relevant to protein energy.

small private launching companies with limited access to global observations
around the Earth and/or for orbital maneuvers around other planets for which
the orbital observations are limited to the in situ equipment. An appropriate
cost function is introduced for the sake of minimizing the total
control/impulse effort as well as the orbital uncertainty. It is subsequently
proved that for a circle-to-circle maneuver, the optimization problem is
quasi-convex with respect to the design variables. For near circular
trajectories the same cost function is minimized via a gradient based
optimization algorithm in order to provide a sub-optimal solution that is
efficient both with respect to energy effort and orbital uncertainty. As a
relevant case study, a four-impulse orbital maneuver between circular orbits
under Mars gravitation is simulated and analyzed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

two major drawbacks: (1) the high-precision real-valued sensing patterns

we proposed a recursive network structure for low-resolution image sampling and
high-resolution reconstruction scheme. It reduces both the required number of

to employ the frequency space as an additional degree of freedom which allows
for investigating and exploiting higher-dimensional phenomena in a priori
low-dimensional systems. However, the influence of nonlinear effects on the
synthetic frequency dimensions was studied only under significant restrictions.
In the present paper, we develop a generalized mean-field model for the optical
field envelope inside a single driven-dissipative resonator with quadratic and
cubic nonlinearities, whose frequencies are coupled via an electro-optical
resonant temporal modulation. The leading order equation takes the form of
driven Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a cosine potential. We numerically
investigate the nonlinear dynamics in such microring resonator with a synthetic
frequency dimension in the regime where parametric frequency conversion occurs.
In the case of anomalous dispersion, we find that the presence of
electro-optical mode coupling confines and stabilizes the chaotic modulation
instability region. This leads to the appearance of a novel type of stable
coherent structures which emerge in the synthetic space with restored
translational symmetry, in a region of parameters where conventionally only
chaotic modulation instability states exist. This structure appears in the
center of the synthetic band and, therefore, is referred to as Band Soliton.
Finally, we extend our results to the case of multiple modulation frequencies
with controllable relative phases creating synthetic lattices with nontrivial
geometry. We show that an asymmetric synthetic band leads to the coexistence of
chaotic and coherent states of the electromagnetic field inside the cavity i.e.
dynamics that can be interpreted as chimera-like states. Recently developed
$\chi^{(2)}$ microresonators can open the way to experimentally explore our
findings.

states in communication over quantum networks. Unfortunately, the entanglement
shared over the network deteriorates due to its unavoidable interaction with

obtain a maximally entangled hybrid Omega-type state from the corresponding

concentration protocol is that it is feasible to implement this protocol with
linear optical components and present technology. The corresponding linear
optical quantum circuit is provided for experimental realizations, while the
success probability of the concentration protocol is also reported. Thereafter,

using Omega-type state, which is also the first hierarchical quantum
communication scheme in the hybrid domain so far. The present hybrid entangled
state has advantage in circumventing Pauli operations on the coherent state by
polarization rotation of single qubit, which can be performed with lesser

reported at the end of 2019. As a consequence of its highly infectious nature,
countries all over the world have imposed extremely strict measures to control
its spread. Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics have
done a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, develop
medication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, a
great deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parameters
in the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predict
the course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the course
of the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, the
determination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of the
infectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemic
wave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and daily
fatalities for ten countries over the period January 22, 2020 - April 18, 2020
are evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each
country, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error
are analysed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean
duration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the
spread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case).
Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the
inflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly
estimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates by
comparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions were
realised for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures were

the EM stress distribution in those wire segments at the given aging time.
Based on this observation, we train conditional GAN model using the images of

time (as conditions) against the COMSOL simulation results. Different
hyperparameters of GAN were studied and compared. The proposed algorithm,

full-chip fast EM failure assessment. Our experimental results show that the

cost, siting and infrastructure requirements. This precludes MRI diagnostics,
the reference standard for neurological assessment, in patients who cannot be
transported to specialized scanner suites. This includes patients who are
critically ill and unstable, and patients located in low-resource settings. The
scanner design presented here aims to extend the reach of MRI by substantially
reducing these limitations. Our goal is to shift the cost-benefit calculation
for MRI toward more frequent and varied use, including improved accessibility
worldwide and point of care operation. Here, we describe a portable brain MRI
scanner using a compact, lightweight permanent magnet, with a built-in readout
field gradient. Our low-field (80 mT) Halbach cylinder design of rare-earth
permanent magnets results in a 122 kg magnet with minimal stray-field,
requiring neither cryogenics nor external power. The built-in magnetic field
gradient reduces reliance on high-power gradient drivers, which not only lowers
overall system power and cooling requirements, but also reduces acoustic noise.
Imperfections in the encoding fields are mitigated with a generalized iterative
image reconstruction technique, that uses prior characterization of the field
patterns. Our system was validated using T1, T2 and proton density weighted in
vivo brain images with a spatial resolution of 2.2 x 1.3 x 6.8 mm$^3$.

  In terms of efficiency, Astro executes a payment by merely broadcasting a
message. The distinguishing feature of Astro is that it can maintain
performance robustly, i.e., remain unaffected by a fraction of replicas being
compromised or slowed down by an adversary. Our experiments on a public cloud

simulating the dynamics of the particles and fluids in such a mixture has been
a challenge due to the fact that such simulations are computationally expensive

of a multi dimensional relativistic Monte Carlo code to explore of the
thermalization process in a relativistic multicomponent environment in a
computationally inexpensive way. As an illustration we simulate the fully
relativistic three dimensional Brownian-motion-like solution to the
thermalization of a high mass particle (proton) in a bath of relativistic
low-mass particles (electrons). We follow the thermalization and ultimate
equilibrium distribution of the Brownian-like particle as can happen in the
cosmic plasma during big bang nucleosynthesis. We also simulate the
thermalization of energetic particles injected into the plasma as can occur,
for example, by the decay of massive unstable particles during the big bang.

theoretical factorization frameworks are the most frequently used approaches to
describing spin dependent hard cross sections weighted by and integrated over
transverse momentum. Of particular interest is the contribution from small
transverse momentum associated with the target bound state. In phenomenological
applications, this contribution is often investigated using transverse momentum
weighted integrals that sharply regulate the large transverse momentum
contribution, for example with Gaussian parametrizations. Since the result is a
kind of hybrid of TMD and collinear (inclusive) treatments, it is important to
establish if and how the formalisms are related in applications to weighted
integral observables. The suppression of a large transverse momentum tail, for
example, can potentially affect the type of evolution that is applicable. We
find that a naive version of a widely used identity relating the
$k_T^2$-weighted and integrated Sivers TMD function to a renormalized twist-3
function has strongly ambiguous ultraviolet contributions, and that corrections
to it are not necessarily perturbatively suppressed. We discuss the
implications for applications, arguing in particular that the relevant
evolution for transverse momentum weighted and integrated cross sections with
sharp effective large transverse momentum cutoffs is of the TMD form rather
than the standard renormalization group evolution of collinear correlation
functions.

outputs the result of the comparison. Problems like sorting and searching have
been studied in this model, and it has been generalized to include the concept
of priced information, where different pairs of items (say database records)
have different comparison costs. These comparison costs can be arbitrary (in
which case no algorithm can be close to optimal (Charikar et al. STOC 2000)),
structured (for example, the comparison cost may depend on the length of the
databases (Gupta et al. FOCS 2001)), or stochastic (Angelov et al. LATIN 2008).
Motivated by the database setting where the cost depends on the sizes of the
items, we consider the problems of sorting and batched predecessor where two
non-uniform sets of items $A$ and $B$ are given as input.
  (1) In the RAM setting, we consider the scenario where both sets have $n$
keys each. The cost to compare two items in $A$ is $a$, to compare an item of
$A$ to an item of $B$ is $b$, and to compare two items in $B$ is $c$. We give
upper and lower bounds for the case $a \le b \le c$. Notice that the case $b=1,
a=c=\infty$ is the famous ``nuts and bolts'' problem.
  (2) In the Disk-Access Model (DAM), where transferring elements between disk
and internal memory is the main bottleneck, we consider the scenario where
elements in $B$ are larger than elements in $A$. The larger items take more
I/Os to be brought into memory, consume more space in internal memory, and are
required in their entirety for comparisons.
  We first give output-sensitive lower and upper bounds on the batched
predecessor problem, and use these to derive bounds on the complexity of
sorting in the two models. Our bounds are tight in most cases, and require
novel generalizations of the classical lower bound techniques in external
memory to accommodate the non-uniformity of keys.

set of measurements of the inner gas coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
These measurements have been used by different groups to determine the
distribution of the gas sources at the nucleus surface. The solutions that have
been found differ from each other substantially and illustrate the degeneracy
of this issue. It is the aim of this work to explore the limitations that
current gas models have in linking the coma measurements to the surface. In
particular, we discuss the sensitivity of Rosetta's ROSINA/COPS, VIRTIS, and
MIRO instruments to differentiate between vastly different spatial
distributions of the gas emission from the surface. We have applied a state of
the art 3D DSMC gas dynamics code to simulate the inner gas coma of different
models that vary in the fraction of the surface that contains ice and in
different sizes of active patches. These different distributions result in jet
interactions that differ in their dynamical behaviour. We have found that
ROSINA/COPS measurements by themselves cannot detect the differences in our
models. While ROSINA/COPS measurements are important to constrain the regional
inhomogeneities of the gas emission, they can by themselves not determine the
surface emission distribution of the gas sources to a spatial accuracy of
better than a few hundred metres (400 m). Any solutions fitting the ROSINA/COPS
measurements is hence fundamentally degenerate, be it through a forward or
inverse model. Only other instruments with complementary measurements can
potentially lift this degeneracy as we show here for VIRTIS and MIRO. Finally,
as a by-product, we have explored the effect of our activity distributions on
lateral flow at the surface that may be responsible for some of the observed
aeolian features.

we found that the work and efficiency of the classical engine is always greater

substance is always in thermodynamic equilibrium at each point of the cycle,
maximizing the energy extracted in the adiabatic paths. We apply this analysis
to the case of a two-level system, finding that the work and efficiency in
Otto's quantum and classical cycle are identical, regardless of the working

we knew of just one planetary system (the Solar system), we now know of
thousands, with new systems being announced on a weekly basis. Of the thousands
of planetary systems we have found to date, however, there is only one that we
can study up-close and personal - the Solar system.
  In this review, we describe our current understanding of the Solar system for
the exoplanetary science community - with a focus on the processes thought to
have shaped the system we see today. In section one, we introduce the Solar
system as a single well studied example of the many planetary systems now
observed. In section two, we describe the Solar system's small body populations
as we know them today - from the two hundred and five known planetary
satellites to the various populations of small bodies that serve as a reminder
of the system's formation and early evolution. In section three, we consider
our current knowledge of the Solar system's planets, as physical bodies. In
section four, we discuss the research that has been carried out into the Solar
system's formation and evolution, with a focus on the information gleaned as a
result of detailed studies of the system's small body populations. In section
five, we discuss our current knowledge of planetary systems beyond our own -
both in terms of the planets they host, and in terms of the debris that we
observe orbiting their host stars.
  As we learn ever more about the diversity and ubiquity of other planetary
systems, our Solar system will remain the key touchstone that facilitates our
understanding and modelling of those newly found systems, and we finish section
five with a discussion of the future surveys that will further expand that
knowledge.

(XXZ-like) long-range spin chain that enjoys quantum-affine (really:
quantum-loop) symmetries at finite size.
  We derive the pairwise form of the Hamiltonian, found by one of us building
on work of Uglov, via 'freezing' from the affine Hecke algebra. We obtain
explicit expressions for the spin-analogue of Macdonald operators. Through
freezing these yield the higher Hamiltonians of the spin chain, including a
Hamiltonian of the opposite chirality. The sum of the two chiral Hamiltonians
has a real spectrum also for $q$ a root of unity.
  We clarify the relation between patterns labelling the eigenspaces, known as
'motifs', and the corresponding degeneracies in the crystal limit $q\to\infty$.
For each motif we obtain an explicit expression for the exact eigenvector,
valid for generic $q$, that has ('pseudo' or 'l-') highest weight in the sense
that, in terms of the operators from the monodromy matrix, it is an eigenvector
of $A$ and $D$ and annihilated by $C$. It has a simple component featuring the
'symmetric square' of the $q$-Vandermonde times a Macdonald polynomial - or
more precisely its quantum spherical zonal special case. Its other components
are obtained through the action of the Hecke algebra, followed by 'evaluation'
of the variables to roots of unity. We prove that our vectors have highest
weight upon evaluation. Our description of the spectrum is complete.
  The model, including the quantum-loop action, can be reformulated in terms of
polynomials. Our main tools are the $Y$-operators of the affine Hecke algebra.
The key step in our diagonalisation is that on a subspace of suitable
polynomials the first $M$ 'classical' (i.e. no difference part) $Y$-operators
in $N$ variables reduce, upon evaluation as above, to $Y$-operators in $M$
variables with parameters at the quantum zonal spherical point.

societal response. Non-pharmacological mitigation strategies such as social
distancing and the adoption of protective equipment aim precisely at reducing
transmission rates by reducing infectious contacts. To investigate the effects
of mitigation strategies on the evolution of epidemics, nonlinear transmission
rates that are influenced by the levels of infections, deaths or recoveries
have been included in many variants of the classical SIR model. This class of
models is particularly relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the
population behavior has been affected by the unprecedented abundance and rapid
distribution of global infection and death data through online platforms. This
manuscript revisits a SIR model in which the reduction of transmission rate is
due to knowledge of infections. Through a mean field approach that assumes
individuals behave like molecules in a well-mixed solution, one derives a
time-varying reproduction number that depends on infection information through
a negative feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in
ecology and Michaelis-Menten functions in chemistry and molecular biology. A
step-by-step derivation of the model is provided, together with an overview of
methods for its qualitative analysis, showing that negative feedback
structurally reduces the peak of infections. At the same time, feedback may
substantially extend the duration of an epidemic. Computational simulations
agree with the analytical predictions, and further suggest that infection peak
reduction persists even in the presence of information delays. If the
mitigation strategy is linearly proportional to infections, a single parameter
is added to the SIR model, making it useful to illustrate the effects of
infection-dependent social distancing.

existing works that either predict long-range complex activities as unordered
sets of atomic actions, or retrieve videos using natural language sentences.
Instead, the proposed approach allows recognizing complex fine-grained
activities using only pretrained action classifiers, without requiring any
additional data, annotations or neural network training. To evaluate the
potential of our approach, we provide experiments on synthetic datasets and
challenging real action recognition datasets, such as MultiTHUMOS and Charades.
We conclude that the proposed approach can extend state-of-the-art primitive
action classifiers to vastly more complex activities without large performance
degradation.

From the perspective of a service provider (SP), how to jointly optimize the
service placement, sizing, and workload allocation decisions is an important
and challenging problem, which becomes even more complicated when considering
demand uncertainty. To this end, we propose a novel two-stage adaptive robust
optimization framework to help the SP optimally determine the locations for

to purchase from each location (i.e., sizing). The service placement and sizing
solution of the proposed model can hedge against any possible realization
within the uncertainty set of traffic demand. Given the first-stage robust
solution, the optimal resource and workload allocation decisions are computed
in the second-stage after the uncertainty is revealed. To solve the two-stage

column-and-constraint generation method that decomposes the underlying problem
into a master problem and a max-min subproblem associated with the second
stage. Extensive numerical results are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of

the competition between non-Fermi liquid and pairing can be analyzed within an
effective model with dynamical electron-electron interaction $V(\Omega_m)\sim
1/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$ (the $\gamma$-model). In this paper, the first in the
series, we consider the case $T=0$ and $0<\gamma <1$. We argue that tendency to
pairing is stronger, and the ground state is a superconductor. We argue,
however, that superconducting state is highly non-trivial as there exists a
discrete set of topologically distinct solutions for the pairing gap $\Delta_n
(\omega_m)$ ($n = 0, 1, 2..., \infty$). All solutions have the same spatial
pairing symmetry, but differ in the time domain: $\Delta_n (\omega_m)$ changes
sign $n$ times as a function of Matsubara frequency $\omega_m$. The $n =0$
solution $\Delta_0 (\omega_m)$ is sign-preserving and tends to a finite value
at $\omega_m =0$, like in BCS theory. The $n = \infty$ solution corresponds to
an infinitesimally small $\Delta (\omega_m)$. As a proof, we obtain the exact
solution of the linearized gap equation at $T=0$ on the entire frequency axis
for all $0<\gamma <1$, and an approximate solution of the non-linear gap
equation.We argue that the presence of an infinite set of solutions opens up a
new channel of gap fluctuations. We extend the analysis to the case where the
pairing component of the interaction has additional factor $1/N$ and show that
there exists a critical $N_{cr} >1$, above which superconductivity disappears,
and the ground state becomes a non-Fermi liquid.We show that all solutions
develop simultaneously once $N$ gets smaller than $N_{cr}$.

mixed mimetic spectral element advection operator, the upwinded mass flux
advection operator is conservative, however unlike the original advection
operator, which is purely hyperbolic, the upwinded advection operator adds
dissipation which is biased towards high wave numbers. The upwinded advection
operator also removes the spectral gaps present in the dispersion relation for
the original advection operator. As for the original advection operator, a
material form advection operator may be constructed by similarly downwinding
the trial functions of the tracer gradients. Both methods allow for the
recovery of exact energy conservation for an incompressible flow field via
skew-symmetric formulations. However these skew-symmetric formulations are once
again purely hyperbolic operators which do not suppress oscillations. The

a previously unencountered palpation task, to a different set of force values
under teleoperation without force feedback. Compared to the teleoperation
groups, the manual group had higher force error in the tension task outside the
range of forces they had trained on, but showed better speed-accuracy functions
in the palpation task at low force levels. This suggests that the dynamics of
the training modality affect force estimation ability during teleoperation,
with the prior haptic experience accessible if formed under the same dynamics
as the task.

characterized the convergence of the stochastic subgradient method for the

hole captures and accretes gas from the strong stellar wind emitted by its
supergiant O9.7 companion star. The irradiation of the supergiant star
essentially determines the flow properties of the stellar wind and the X-ray
luminosity from the system. The results of three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations of wind-fed X-ray binary systems reported in recent work reveal
that the ionizing feedback of the X-ray irradiation leads to the existence of
two stable states with either a soft or a hard spectrum. Aims: We discuss the
observed radiation of Cygnus X-1 in the soft and hard state in the context of
mass flow in the corona and disk, as predicted by the recent application of a
condensation model. Methods: The rates of gas condensation from the corona to
the disk for Cygnus X-1 are determined, and the spectra of the hard and soft
radiation are computed. The theoretical results are compared with the MAXI
observations of Cygnus X-1 from 2009 to 2018. In particular, we evaluate the
hardness-intensity diagrams (HIDs) for its ten episodes of soft and hard states
which show that Cygnus X-1 is distinct in its spectral changes as compared to
those found in the HIDs of low-mass X-ray binaries. Results: The theoretically
derived values of photon counts and hardness are in approximate agreement with
the observed data in the HID. However, the scatter in the diagram is not
reproduced. Improved agreement could result from variations in the viscosity
associated with clumping in the stellar wind and corresponding changes of the
magnetic fields in the disk. The observed dipping events in the hard state may
also contribute to the scatter and to a harder spectrum than predicted by the
model.

work, we show how to overcome this limitation by discovering macro-actions that
make the goal-count heuristic more accurate. Our approach searches for
macro-actions with focused effects (i.e. macros that modify only a small number
of state variables), which align well with the assumptions made by the
goal-count heuristic. Focused macros dramatically improve black-box planning
efficiency across a wide range of planning domains, sometimes beating even
state-of-the-art planners with access to a full domain model.

if, for every code in the family, the number of codewords in any Hamming ball
of fractional radius $p$ is less than some integer $L$ that is independent of
the code length. It is said to be list-recoverable for input list size $\ell$
if for every sufficiently large subset of codewords (of size $L$ or more),
there is a coordinate where the codewords take more than $\ell$ values. The
parameter $L$ is said to be the ""list size"" in either case. The capacity, i.e.,
the largest possible rate for these notions as the list size $L \to \infty$, is
known to be $1-h_q(p)$ for list-decoding, and $1-\log_q \ell$ for
list-recovery, where $q$ is the alphabet size of the code family.
  In this work, we study the list size of random linear codes for both
list-decoding and list-recovery as the rate approaches capacity. We show the
following claims hold with high probability over the choice of the code (below,
$\epsilon > 0$ is the gap to capacity).
  (1) A random linear code of rate $1 - \log_q(\ell) - \epsilon$ requires list
size $L \ge \ell^{\Omega(1/\epsilon)}$ for list-recovery from input list size
$\ell$. This is surprisingly in contrast to completely random codes, where $L =
O(\ell/\epsilon)$ suffices w.h.p.
  (2) A random linear code of rate $1 - h_q(p) - \epsilon$ requires list size
$L \ge \lfloor h_q(p)/\epsilon+0.99 \rfloor$ for list-decoding from error
fraction $p$, when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small.
  (3) A random binary linear code of rate $1 - h_2(p) - \epsilon$ is
list-decodable from average error fraction $p$ with list size with $L \leq
\lfloor h_2(p)/\epsilon \rfloor + 2$.
  The second and third results together precisely pin down the list sizes for
binary random linear codes for both list-decoding and average-radius
list-decoding to three possible values.

for most of its total energy metabolism. Independent of any overt function,
this immense ongoing activity likely creates or maintains a potential
functional brain reserve to facilitate normal brain function. An important
property of spontaneous brain activity is the long-range temporal coherence,
which can be characterized by resting state fMRI-based brain entropy mapping
(BEN), a relatively new method that has gained increasing research interest.
The purpose of this study was to leverage the large resting state fMRI and
behavioral data publicly available from the human connectome project to address
three important but still unknown questions: temporal stability of
rsfMRI-derived BEN; the relationship of resting BEN to latent functional
reserve; associations of resting BEN to neurocognition. Our results showed that
rsfMRI-derived BEN was highly stable across time; resting BEN in the default
mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN) was related to brain
reserve in a negative correlation to education years; and lower DMN/ECN BEN
corresponds to higher fluid intelligence and better task performance. These
results suggest that resting BEN is a temporally stable brain trait; BEN in
DMN/ECN may provide a means to measure the latent functional reserve that
bestows better brain functionality and may be enhanced by education.

show that it does not model energy transfer well. Nevertheless, we find that
the energy transferred from the streamwise-constant streaks can be predicted
reasonably well by a Cess eddy viscosity profile. As such, eddy viscosity is an
effective model for the nonlinear terms in resolvent analysis and explains good
predictions for the most energetic streamwise-constant streaks. It also
improves resolvent modes as a basis for structures whose streamwise lengths are
greater than their spanwise widths by counteracting non-normality of the
resolvent operator. Eddy viscosity does not respect the conservative nature of
the nonlinear energy transfer which must sum to zero over all scales. It is
less effective, consequently, for scales which receive energy from the
nonlinear terms.

decision making, giving rise to the need for ethical guarantees such as
fairness. Fairness is typically defined by asking that some statistic of a
classifier be approximately equal over protected groups within a population. In
this paper, current approaches to fairness are discussed and used to motivate
algorithmic proposals that incorporate fairness into genetic programming for
classification. We propose two ideas. The first is to incorporate a fairness
objective into multi-objective optimization. The second is to adapt lexicase
selection to define cases dynamically over intersections of protected groups.
We describe why lexicase selection is well suited to pressure models to perform
well across the potentially infinitely many subgroups over which fairness is
desired. We use a recent genetic programming approach to construct models on
four datasets for which fairness constraints are necessary, and empirically
compare performance to prior methods utilizing game-theoretic solutions.
Methods are assessed based on their ability to generate trade-offs of subgroup
fairness and accuracy that are Pareto optimal. The result show that genetic
programming methods in general, and random search in particular, are well
suited to this task.

model that defines a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). This formalism has
high expressive power, yet it remains readable because its graphical
representation stays close to standard fault trees. The size of a BDMP is
roughly speaking proportional to the size of the system it models, whereas the
size of the CTMC specified by this BDMP suffers from exponential growth. Thus
quantifying large BDMPs can be a challenging task. The most general method to
quantify them is Monte Carlo simulation, but this may be intractable for highly
reliable systems. On the other hand, some subcategories of BDMPs can be
processed with much more efficient methods. For example, BDMPs without repairs
can be translated into dynamic fault trees, a formalism accepted as an input of
the STORM model checker, that performs numerical calculations on sparse
matrices, or they can be processed with the tool FIGSEQ that explores paths
going to a failure state and calculates their probabilities. BDMPs with repairs
can be quantified by FIGSEQ (BDMPs capturing quickly and completely repairable
behaviors are solved by a different algorithm), and by the I&AB (Initiator and
All Barriers) method, recently published and implemented in a prototype version
of RISKSPECTRUM PSA. This tool, based exclusively on Boolean representations
looks for and quantifies minimal cut sets of the system, i.e., minimal
combinations of component failures that induce the loss of the system. This
allows a quick quantification of large models with repairable components,
standby redundancies and some other types of dependencies between omponents.
All these quantification methods have been tried on a benchmark whose
definition was published at the MARS 2017 workshop: the model of emergency
power supplies of a nuclear power plant. In this paper, after a recall of the
theoretical principles of the various quantification methods, we compare their

detail (level of abstraction). From the more abstract model we then generate

automatically generated models from real-world systems, family models might
even be not constructible due to bad variable orders. In this paper we describe
a technique, called iterative variable reordering, that can enable the

targets or to take tissue samples from the inside of an organ. Current clinical
practice is to insert needles under image guidance or haptic feedback, although
that may involve reinsertions and adjustments since the needle and its
interaction with the tissue during insertion cannot be completely controlled.
(Automated) needle steering could in theory improve the accuracy with which a
target is reached and thus reduce surgical traumata especially for minimally
invasive procedures, e.g., brachytherapy or biopsy. Yet, flexible needles and
needle-tissue interaction are both complex and expensive to model and can often
be computed approximatively only. In this paper we propose to employ timed
games to navigate flexible needles with a bevel tip to reach a fixed target in
tissue. We use a simple non-holonomic model of needle-tissue interaction, which
abstracts in particular from the various physical forces involved and appears
to be simplistic compared to related models from medical robotics. Based on the
model, we synthesize strategies from which we can derive sufficiently precise
motion plans to steer the needle in soft tissue. However, applying those
strategies in practice, one is faced with the problem of an unpredictable
behavior of the needle at the initial insertion point. Our proposal is to
implement a preprocessing step to initialize the model based on data from the
real system, once the needle is inserted. Taking into account the actual needle
tip angle and position, we generate strategies to reach the desired target. We
have implemented the model in Uppaal Stratego and evaluated it on steering a
flexible needle in gelatin phantoms; gelatin phantoms are commonly used in
medical technology to simulate the behavior of soft tissue. The experiments
show that strategies can be synthesized for both generated and measured needle
motions with a maximum deviation of 1.84mm.

as COVID-19. Many countries and research groups have launched or announced
mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users
with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random
tokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users'
phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to
learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been
diagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end
privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular, these
approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token
metadata, linkage attacks by the server, or false reporting by users.
  In this work, we introduce Epione, a lightweight system for contact tracing
with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their
contacts have been diagnosed with the disease, while protecting the privacy of
users' contacts from both central services and other users, and provides
protection against false reporting. As a key building block, we present a new
cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality

intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items. We
specifically tailor it to the case of large-scale contact tracing where clients

gland has been surgically removed, so the clinical target volume (CTV) to be
irradiated encompasses the microscopic spread of tumor cells, which cannot be
visualized in typical clinical images such as computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging. In current clinical practice, physicians segment CTVs
manually based on their relationship with nearby organs and other clinical
information, per clinical guidelines. Automating post-operative prostate CTV
segmentation with traditional image segmentation methods has been a major
challenge. Here, we propose a deep learning model to overcome this problem by
segmenting nearby organs first, then using their relationship with the CTV to
assist CTV segmentation. The model proposed is trained using labels clinically
approved and used for patient treatment, which are subject to relatively large
inter-physician variations due to the absence of a visual ground truth. The
model achieves an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.87 on a
holdout dataset of 50 patients, much better than established methods, such as
atlas-based methods (DSC<0.7). The uncertainties associated with automatically
segmented CTV contours are also estimated to help physicians inspect and revise
the contours, especially in areas with large inter-physician variations. We
also use a 4-point grading system to show that the clinical quality of the
automatically segmented CTV contours is equal to that of approved clinical
contours manually drawn by physicians.

governing the system are imperfectly known. The challenge is to find the
optimal balance between probing, i.e. exciting the system to understand it
more, and caution, i.e. selecting conservative controls based on current
knowledge to achieve the control objective. Dynamic programming techniques can
achieve this optimal trade-off. However, while dynamic programming performs
well with discrete state and time, it is not well-suited to problems with
continuous time-frames or continuous or unbounded state spaces. Another
limitation is that multidimensional states often cause the dynamic programming
approaches to be intractable. In this paper, we investigate whether
continuous-time optimal control tools could help circumvent these caveats
whilst still achieving the probing-caution balance. We introduce a stylized
problem where the state is governed by one of two differential equations. It is
initially unknown which differential equation governs the system, so we must
simultaneously determine the true differential equation and control the system
to the desired state. We show how this problem can be transformed to apply
optimal control tools, and compare the performance of this approach to a
dynamic programming approach. Our results suggest that the optimal control
algorithm rivals dynamic programming on small problems, achieving the right
balance between aggressive and smoothly varying controls. In contrast to
dynamic programming, the optimal control approach remains tractable when
several states are to be controlled simultaneously.

The evolutions of HGBs such as disappearance of single ringed intensity pattern
and appearance of patterns with a central bright spot are achievable with less

hand, metamaterials with low values of k can preserve single ring intensity

high-performance systems for forecasting such events. Although in the

lack of consensus concerning the techniques used for designing these systems.
Seeking to establish some standardization while designing flare predictors, in
this study we propose a novel methodology for designing such predictors,
further validated with extreme gradient boosting tree classifiers and time
series. This methodology relies on the following well-defined machine learning
based pipeline: (i) univariate feature selection; (ii) randomized
hyper-parameter optimization; (iii) imbalanced data treatment; (iv) adjustment
of cut-off point of classifiers; and (v) evaluation under operational settings.
To verify our methodology effectiveness, we designed and evaluated three
proof-of-concept models for forecasting $\geq C$ class flares up to 72 hours
ahead. Compared to baseline models, those models were able to significantly
increase their scores of true skill statistics (TSS) under operational
forecasting scenarios by 0.37 (predicting flares in the next 24 hours), 0.13

48-72 hours). Besides increasing TSS, the methodology also led to significant
increases in the area under the ROC curve, corroborating that we improved the

colored copy of $G$. The complexity of this problem is tied to parameterized

$\mathit{NL}$, among other questions. An overarching goal is to understand the
complexity of $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$, under different computational models, in terms
of natural invariants of the pattern graph $G$.
  In this paper, we establish a close relationship between the $\textit{formula

(denoted $\mathrm{td}(G)$). $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$ is known to be solvable by
monotone $\mathit{AC^0}$ formulas of size $O(n^{\mathrm{td}(G)})$. Our main
result is an $n^{\tilde\Omega(\mathrm{td}(G)^{1/3})}$ lower bound for formulas
that are monotone $\textit{or}$ have sub-logarithmic depth. This complements a
lower bound of Li, Razborov and Rossman (SICOMP 2017) relating tree-width and
$\mathit{AC^0}$ circuit size. As a corollary, it implies a stronger
homomorphism preservation theorem for first-order logic on finite structures
(Rossman, ITCS 2017).
  The technical core of this result is an $n^{\Omega(k)}$ lower bound in the
special case where $G$ is a complete binary tree of height $k$, which we
establish using the $\textit{pathset framework}$ introduced in (Rossman, SICOMP
2018). (The lower bound for general patterns follows via a recent
excluded-minor characterization of tree-depth (Czerwi\'nski et al,
arXiv:1904.13077).) Additional results of this paper extend the pathset
framework and improve upon both, the best known upper and lower bounds on the
average-case formula size of $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$ when $G$ is a path.

taggers are commonly only evaluated on languages that are very different from
truly low-resource languages, and the taggers use sources of information, like
high-coverage and almost error-free dictionaries, which are likely not
available for resource-poor languages. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art
weakly supervised POS taggers for a typologically diverse set of 15 truly
low-resource languages. On these languages, given a realistic amount of
resources, even our best model gets only less than half of the words right. Our
results highlight the need for new and different approaches to POS tagging for
truly low-resource languages.

Because of these subtleties, a number of unsound arguments in such proofs have

how AMQs encoded in our framework guarantee the absence of false negatives by

performance optimization for various IRS-aided wireless systems, it still
remains an open problem whether the large-scale deployment of IRSs in wireless

well as other pertinent key performance metrics averaged over both channel
fading and random locations of the deployed BSs/IRSs therein based on
stochastic geometry. Compared to prior works on characterizing the performance
of wireless networks with active BSs only, our analysis needs to derive the
power distributions of both the signal and interference reflected by
distributed IRSs in the network under spatially correlated channels, which
exhibit channel hardening effects when the number of IRS elements becomes
large. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our analysis and
demonstrate the effectiveness of deploying distributed IRSs in enhancing the
hybrid network throughput against the conventional network without IRS, which
significantly boosts the signal power but results in only marginally increased
interference in the network. Moreover, it is unveiled that there exists an
optimal IRS/BS density ratio that maximizes the hybrid network throughput
subject to a total deployment cost given their individual costs, while the
conventional network without IRS is generally suboptimal in terms of throughput

Different than the existing stochastic computing works, where the accuracy

design can change accuracy or bit-width of the data in the run-time so that it
can accommodate the long-term aging effects by slowing the system clock
frequency at the cost of accuracy while maintaining the throughput of the
computing. We validate the ARSC concept on a discrete cosine transformation
(DCT) and inverse DCT designs for image compressing/decompressing applications,
which are implemented on Xilinx Spartan-6 family XC6SLX45 platform.
Experimental results shows that the new design can easily mitigate the
long-term aging induced effects by accuracy trade-off while maintaining the
throughput of the whole computing process using simple frequency scaling. We
further show that one-bit precision loss for input data, which translated to
3.44dB of the accuracy loss in term of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio for images,
we can sufficiently compensate the NBTI induced aging effects in 10 years while
maintaining the pre-aging computing throughput of 7.19 frames per second. At
the same time, we can save 74\% power consumption by 10.67dB of accuracy loss.
The proposed ARSC computing framework also allows much aggressive frequency
scaling, which can lead to order of magnitude power savings compared to the
traditional dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) techniques.

derived from conventional T1-weighted MRI are very scarce. To fill this gap, we
leverage crowdsourcing by organizing a Kaggle competition to build a pool of
machine learning pipelines for neurological disorder diagnosis with application
to ASD diagnosis using cortical morphological networks derived from T1-weighted
MRI. During the competition, participants were provided with a training dataset
and only allowed to check their performance on a public test data. The final
evaluation was performed on both public and hidden test datasets based on

fluoroscopic navigation, reducing radiation exposure in a hybrid setting. Due
to the susceptibility to external distortions, systematic error in EMT needs to
be compensated algorithmically. Compensation algorithms for EMT in guidewire
procedures are only practical in an online setting.
  Methods: We collect positional data and train a symmetric Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) architecture for compensating navigation error. The results are
evaluated in both online and offline scenarios and are compared to polynomial
fits. We assess spatial uncertainty of the compensation proposed by the ANN.
Simulations based on real data show how this uncertainty measure can be
utilized to improve accuracy and limit radiation exposure in hybrid navigation.
  Results: ANNs compensate unseen distortions by more than 70%, outperforming
polynomial regression. Working on known distortions, ANNs outperform
polynomials as well. We empirically demonstrate a linear relationship between
tracking accuracy and model uncertainty. The effectiveness of hybrid tracking
is shown in a simulation experiment.
  Conclusion: ANNs are suitable for EMT error compensation and can generalize
across unseen distortions. Model uncertainty needs to be assessed when spatial
error compensation algorithms are developed, so that training data collection
can be optimized. Finally, we find that error compensation in EMT reduces the
need for x-ray images in hybrid navigation.

propose a two-level deep reinforcement learning approach to learn dynamic tax
policies, based on economic simulations in which both agents and a government
learn and adapt. Our data-driven approach does not make use of economic
modeling assumptions, and learns from observational data alone. We make four
main contributions. First, we present an economic simulation environment that
features competitive pressures and market dynamics. We validate the simulation
by showing that baseline tax systems perform in a way that is consistent with
economic theory, including in regard to learned agent behaviors and
specializations. Second, we show that AI-driven tax policies improve the
trade-off between equality and productivity by 16% over baseline policies,
including the prominent Saez tax framework. Third, we showcase several emergent
features: AI-driven tax policies are qualitatively different from baselines,
setting a higher top tax rate and higher net subsidies for low incomes.
Moreover, AI-driven tax policies perform strongly in the face of emergent
tax-gaming strategies learned by AI agents. Lastly, AI-driven tax policies are
also effective when used in experiments with human participants. In experiments
conducted on MTurk, an AI tax policy provides an equality-productivity
trade-off that is similar to that provided by the Saez framework along with
higher inverse-income weighted social welfare.

However, the simulation of HH neurons involves complex computation, which makes
the implementation of large-scale brain networks difficult. In this paper, we
propose a hardware architecture that efficiently computes a large-scale network
of HH neurons. This architecture is based on the neuron machine hardware
architecture, which has the limitation of speed as it has only one computation
node. The proposed architecture is essentially a non-Von Neumann synchronous
system with multiple computation nodes, called hardware neurons, to achieve
linear speedup. In this paper, the design of a digital circuit that computes
large-scale networks of HH neurons is presented as an example to provide a
detailed description of the proposed architecture. This design supports axonal
conduction delay of spikes and short- and long-term plasticity synapses, along
with floating-point precision HH neurons. The design is implemented on a
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and computes a network of one million
HH neurons in near real time. The implemented system can compute a network with
up to 12 million HH neurons and 600 million synapses. The proposed design
method can facilitate the design of systems supporting complex neuron models

the size and quality of the available training data. In particular, the test
data deviation from the training data model, for example, due to noise
contamination, can cause severe performance degradation. Moreover, these
methods commit further to the Gaussian assumption (upon which LDA is
established) to tune their regularization parameters, which may compromise
accuracy when dealing with real data. To address these issues, we propose a
doubly regularized LDA classifier that we denote as R2LDA. In the proposed
R2LDA approach, the RLDA score function is converted into an inner product of
two vectors. By substituting the expressions of the regularized estimators of
these vectors, we obtain the R2LDA score function that involves two
regularization parameters. To set the values of these parameters, we adopt
three existing regularization techniques; the constrained perturbation
regularization approach (COPRA), the bounded perturbation regularization (BPR)
algorithm, and the generalized cross-validation (GCV) method. These methods are
used to tune the regularization parameters based on linear estimation models,
with the sample covariance matrix's square root being the linear operator.
Results obtained from both synthetic and real data demonstrate the consistency

involving test data contaminated with noise that is not observed during the

orders. Compared with the filters designed only with real orders, complex order
filters can reveal more details of input signals, and this can benefit a large
number of tasks. The tremendous effect of the proposed complex-order filters,
has been verified by several image processing examples. Especially, for the
challenging problem indicating the diseased regions in prostate TRUS images,
the proposed complex order filters look very promising. It is very astonishing
that, indicating the diseased regions is fulfilled by complex-order integral,

aim to improve the generalization capability of GANs by promoting the local
robustness within the small neighborhood of the training samples. We also prove
that the robustness in small neighborhood of training sets can lead to better
generalization. Particularly, we design a robust optimization framework where
the generator and discriminator compete with each other in a
\textit{worst-case} setting within a small Wasserstein ball. The generator
tries to map \textit{the worst input distribution} (rather than a Gaussian
distribution used in most GANs) to the real data distribution, while the
discriminator attempts to distinguish the real and fake distribution
\textit{with the worst perturbation}. We have proved that our robust method can
obtain a tighter generalization upper bound than traditional GANs under mild
assumptions, ensuring a theoretical superiority of RGAN over GANs. A series of
experiments on CIFAR-10, STL-10 and CelebA datasets indicate that our proposed

approach based on the micromagnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation of
motion parametrised using atomistic calculations. The LLB formalism describes
the magnetisation dynamics at finite temperature and allows to efficiently
simulate large system sizes and long time scales. Atomistic simulations provide
the required temperature dependent input quantities for the LLB equation, such
as the equilibrium magnetisation and the anisotropy, and can be used to capture
the detailed magnetisation dynamics. The multiscale approach makes possible to
overcome the computational limitations of atomistic models in dealing with
large systems, such as a recording track, while incorporating the basic physics
of the HAMR process. We investigate the magnetisation dynamics of a single FePt
grain as function of the properties of the temperature profile and applied
field and test the micromagnetic results against atomistic calculations. Our
results prove the appropriateness and potential of the approach proposed here

matrix model corresponds to a two-dimensional type IIA superstring theory on a
Ramond-Ramond background at the level of correlation functions. This was
confirmed by agreement between their planar correlation functions. The
supersymmetry in the matrix model corresponds to the target space supersymmetry
and it is shown to be spontaneously broken by nonperturbative effect.
Furthermore, in the matrix model we computed one-point functions of
single-trace operators to all order of genus expansion in its double scaling
limit. We found that this expansion is stringy and not Borel summable and hence
there arises an ambiguity in applying the Borel resummation technique. We
confirmed that resurgence works here, namely this ambiguity in perturbative
series in a zero-instanton sector is exactly canceled by another ambiguity in a
one-instanton sector obtained by instanton calculation. In this paper we extend
this analysis and study resurgence structure of the two-point functions of the
single trace operators. By using results in the random matrix theory, we derive
two-point functions at arbitrary genus and see that the perturbative series in
the zero-instanton sector again has an ambiguity. We find that the two-point
functions inevitably have logarithmic singularity even at higher genus. In this
derivation we obtain a new result of the two-point function expressed by the
one-point function at the leading order in the soft-edge scaling limit of the
random matrix theory. We also compute an ambiguity in the one-instanton sector
by using the Airy kernel, and confirm that ambiguities in both sectors cancel
each other at the leading order in the double scaling limit. We thus clarify
resurgence structure of the two-point functions in the supersymmetric

spun from liquid crystalline solutions, with high modulus and strength, and
spun from aerogels of ultra long-nanotubes, combining high strength and
fracture energy. The fabrication of large unidirectional fabrics with similar
properties as the fibres is presently a challenge, which CNT alignment
remaining a key factor. A promising approach is to produce fabrics directly
from aerogel filaments without having to densify and handle individual CNT
fibres. Structural composites of CNT fibres have reached high longitudinal
properties, however, on relatively small samples. In general, there is need to
demonstrate fabrication of large CNT fibre laminate composites using standard
fabrication routes and to study longitudinal and transverse mechanical
properties in tension and compression. Complementary areas of development are
interlaminar reinforcement with CNT fabric interleaves, and multifunctional
structural composites with energy storage or harvesting functions.

data can be decomposed into individual appliance load signatures via
Nonintrusive Appliance Load Monitoring techniques to expose appliance usage
profiles. Various methods ranging from load shaping to noise addition and data
aggregation have been proposed to mitigate this problem. However, with the
growing scarcity of natural resources, utilities other than electricity (such
as water and natural gas) have also begun to be subject to HTG metering, which
creates privacy issues similar to that of electricity. Therefore, employing
privacy protection countermeasures for only electricity usage is ineffective
for appliances that utilize additional/other metered resources. As such,
existing privacy countermeasures and metrics need to be reevaluated to address
not only electricity, but also any other resource that is metered. Furthermore,
a holistic privacy protection approach for all metered resources must be
adopted as the information leak from any of the resources has a potential to
render the privacy preserving countermeasures for all the other resources
futile. This paper introduces the privacy preservation problem for multiple HTG
metered resources and explores potential solutions for its mitigation.

in a group of relevant images. In this paper, inspired by human behavior, we
propose a gradient-induced co-saliency detection (GICD) method. We first
abstract a consensus representation for the grouped images in the embedding
space; then, by comparing the single image with consensus representation, we
utilize the feedback gradient information to induce more attention to the
discriminative co-salient features. In addition, due to the lack of Co-SOD
training data, we design a jigsaw training strategy, with which Co-SOD networks
can be trained on general saliency datasets without extra pixel-level
annotations. To evaluate the performance of Co-SOD methods on discovering the
co-salient object among multiple foregrounds, we construct a challenging CoCA
dataset, where each image contains at least one extraneous foreground along
with the co-salient object. Experiments demonstrate that our GICD achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Our codes and dataset are available at

consistent with human perception than the traditional mean squared error
$D_\text{MSE}$. To achieve better video quality, many studies on optimal bit
allocation (OBA) and rate-distortion optimization (RDO) used $D_\text{SSIM}$ as
the distortion metric. However, many of them failed to optimize OBA and RDO
jointly based on SSIM, thus causing a non-optimal R-$D_\text{SSIM}$
performance. This problem is due to the lack of an accurate R-$D_\text{SSIM}$
model that can be used uniformly in both OBA and RDO. To solve this problem, we
propose a $D_\text{SSIM}$-$D_\text{MSE}$ model first. Based on this model, the
complex R-$D_\text{SSIM}$ cost in RDO can be calculated as simpler
R-$D_\text{MSE}$ cost with a new SSIM-related Lagrange multiplier. This not
only reduces the computation burden of SSIM-based RDO, but also enables the
R-$D_\text{SSIM}$ model to be uniformly used in OBA and RDO. Moreover, with the
new SSIM-related Lagrange multiplier in hand, the joint relationship of
R-$D_\text{SSIM}$-$\lambda_\text{SSIM}$ (the negative derivative of
R-$D_\text{SSIM}$) can be built, based on which the R-$D_\text{SSIM}$ model
parameters can be calculated accurately. With accurate and unified
R-$D_\text{SSIM}$ model, SSIM-based OBA and SSIM-based RDO are unified together

SOSR saves 4%, 10%, and 14% bitrate under the same SSIM in all-intra,

observed that the controlled system may exhibit an oscillatory motion around
the equilibrium point in the presence of a bounded constant input disturbance

the baseline Lyapunov stability notion, currently widely used in the LPV

shown why the quadratic Lyapunov concept is insufficient to always guarantee
asymptotic stability under reference tracking and disturbance rejection
scenarios, and why an equilibrium independent stability notion is required for
LPV stability analysis and synthesis of controllers. The introduced concepts
and the apparent pitfalls are demonstrated via a simulation example.

the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Other strategies achieve this
invariance using Laplacian of Gaussian or steerable wavelets for instance,
preventing the introduction of sampling errors during the discretization of the

the image on the spherical harmonics basis, followed by the computation of the
bispectrum, which shares and extends the invariance properties of the spectrum.
We investigate the benefits of using the bispectrum over the spectrum in the
design of a LRI layer embedded in a shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
for 3D image analysis. The performance of each design is evaluated on two
datasets and compared against a standard 3D CNN. The first dataset is made of

significantly better characterization of 3D textures than both the spectral and

examples and trainable parameters when compared to a standard convolutional

naturally be produced by an external gravitational field that comes from a

ubiquitous in dynamical systems and the simplest and most widely studied class

Recently, it was shown, by Li et al. (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 147(5): 2045-2055,

subshift of finite type property is dense in the parameter space $\Delta$.
Here, they proposed the following question. Given a fixed $\beta \in (1, 2)$
which is the $n$-th root of a Perron number, does there exists a dense set of
$\alpha$ in the fiber $\{\beta\} \times (0, 2- \beta)$, so that $T_{\beta,

  We answer this question in the positive for a class of Pisot numbers.
Further, we investigate if this question holds true when replacing the subshift
of finite type property by the property of beginning sofic (that is a factor of
a subshift of finite). In doing so we generalise, a classical result of Schmidt
(Bull. London Math. Soc., 12(4): 269-278, 1980) from the case when $\alpha = 0$

that satisfies all the known constraints that a meta-GGA functional can, but it
also exhibits a great degree of sensitivity to numerical grids. Its numerical
complexities are amplified when used in Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction
correction (SIC) which requires evaluating energies and potentials using
orbital densities that vary far more rapidly than spin densities. Recent
regularization of the SCAN functional (rSCAN) simplifies numerical complexities
of SCAN at the expense of violation of some exact constraints. To develop a
good understanding of the performance of rSCAN and the effect of loss of an
exact constraint at the limit of slowly varying density, we have compared its
performance against SCAN for vibrational frequencies, infra-red and Raman
intensities of water clusters, electric dipole moments, spin magnetic moments
of a few molecular magnets, weak interaction energies of dimers, barrier
heights of reactions, and atomization energies for benchmark sets of molecules.
Likewise, we examined the performance of SIC-rSCAN using the PZ-SIC method by
studying atomic total energies, ionization potentials and electron affinities,
molecular atomization energies, barrier heights, and dissociation and reaction
energies. We find that rSCAN requires a much less dense numerical grid and
gives very similar results as SCAN for all properties examined with the
exception of atomization energies which are somewhat worse in rSCAN. On the
other hand, SIC-rSCAN gives marginally better performance than SIC-SCAN for
almost all properties studied in this work.

in hot-dip galvanizing) and is characterized by an unstable interaction between
the gas jet and the liquid film that results in wavy final coating films. To
understand the dynamics of the wave formation, we extend classic laminar
boundary layer models for falling films to the jet wiping problem, including
the self-similar integral boundary layer (IBL) and the weighted integral

increase the network training time, resulting in the difficulty in being
deployed on industrial-scale recommender systems. In this paper, we present a
novel general Chunk framework to accelerate MNR significantly. Specifically,
our framework divides proximal information units into chunks, and performs
memory access at certain time steps, whereby the number of memory operations
can be greatly reduced. We investigate two ways to implement effective
chunking, i.e., PEriodic Chunk (PEC) and Time-Sensitive Chunk (TSC), to
preserve and recover important recurrent signals in the sequence. Since
chunk-accelerated MNR models take into account more proximal information units
than that from a single timestep, it can remove the influence of noise in the
item sequence to a large extent, and thus improve the stability of MNR. In this
way, the proposed chunk mechanism can lead to not only faster training and
prediction, but even slightly better results. The experimental results on three
real-world datasets (weishi, ml-10M and ml-latest) show that our chunk
framework notably reduces the running time (e.g., with up to 7x for training &
10x for inference on ml-latest) of MNR, and meantime achieves competitive
performance.

advances cannot support free and mobile charging like Wi-Fi communications. To
this end, the concept of mobile energy transfer (MET) is proposed, which relies
critically on an resonant beam charging (RBC) technology. The adaptive (A) RBC
technology builds on RBC, but aims at improving the charging efficiency by
charging devices at device preferred current and voltage levels adaptively. A
mobile ARBC scheme is developed relying on an adaptive source power control.
Extensive numerical simulations using a 1,000mAh Li-ion battery show that the
mobile ARBC outperforms simple charging schemes such as the constant power
charging, the profile-adaptive charging, and the distance-adaptive charging in

acyclic graphs (DAGs) have appeared on the market. Similar to blockchain
technologies, DAG-based systems aim to build an immutable ledger and are faced
with security concerns regarding the irreversibility of the ledger state.
However, due to their more complex nature and recent popularity, the study of
adversarial actions has received little attention so far. In this paper we are
concerned with a particular type of attack on the IOTA cryptocurrency, more
specifically a Parasite Chain attack that attempts to revert the history stored
in the DAG structure, also called the Tangle.
  In order to improve the security of the Tangle, we present a detection
mechanism for this type of attack. In this mechanism, we embrace the complexity
of the DAG structure by sampling certain aspects of it, more particularly the
distribution of the number of approvers. We initially describe models that
predict the distribution that should be expected for a Tangle without any
malicious actors. We then introduce metrics that compare this reference
distribution with the measured distribution. Upon detection, measures can then
be taken to render the attack unsuccessful. We show that due to a form of the
Parasite Chain that is different from the main Tangle it is possible to detect
certain types of malicious chains. We also show that although the attacker may
change the structure of the Parasite Chain to avoid detection, this is done so
at a significant cost since the attack is rendered less efficient.

case in electric conduction, where Joule heating is proportional to the square

nonequilibrium thermodynamics of small fluctuating systems, and quite recently,
microscopic derivations and universal understanding of the trade-off relation
between the current and dissipation have been put forward. Here we establish a
universal framework clarifying how quantum coherence affects the trade-off
between the current and dissipation: a proper use of coherence enhances the
heat current without increasing dissipation, i.e. coherence can reduce
friction. If the amount of coherence is large enough, this friction becomes
virtually zero, realizing a superconducting-like ``dissipation-less'' heat
current. Since our framework clarifies a general relation among coherence,
energy flow, and dissipation, it can be applied to many branches of science. As
an application to energy science, we construct a quantum heat engine cycle that
exceeds the power-efficiency bound on classical engines, and effectively
attains the Carnot efficiency with finite power in fast cycles. We discuss
important implications of our findings with regard to the field of quantum

differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier

diffraction patterns showed dual crystalline structure of the films with
collagen-type bundles of triple helices, intercalated inside clay platelets,
increasing interlayer distances. Depending on the renaturation of
triple-helices and Laponite content, the glass transition temperatures
substantially decreased. The amount of helices decreased with Lap

massive and luminous perturber travelling through a gaseous and opaque medium
can have same direction as the perturber's motion (an effect sometimes called
negative dynamical friction). Analytic results were obtained using a linear
analysis and were later confirmed by means of non-linear numerical simulations
which did not resolve the flow within the Bondi sphere of the perturber, hence
effectively restricted to weakly perturbed regions of the flow (paper~I). Here
we present high resolution simulations, using either 3D Cartesian or 2D
cylindrical meshes that resolve the flow within the Bondi sphere. We perform a
systematic study of the force as a function of the perturber's mass and
luminosity, in the subsonic regime. We find that perturbers with mass $M$
smaller than a few $M_c\sim \chi c_s/G$ are subjected to a thermal force with a
magnitude in good agreement with linear theory ($\chi$ being the thermal
diffusivity of the medium, $c_s$ the adiabatic sound speed and $G$ the
gravitational constant), while for larger masses, the thermal forces are only a
fraction of the linear estimate that decays as $M^{-1}$. Our analysis confirms
the possibility of negative friction (hence a propulsion) on sufficiently
luminous, low-mass embryos embedded in protoplanetary discs. Finally, we give
an approximate expression of the total force at low Mach number, valid both for
sub-critical ($M<M_c$) and super-critical ($M>M_c$) perturbers.

airborne laser scanning (ALS), Sentinel-2, and existing public map data. We
performed model validation on an independent data set consisting of 63 spruce
stands with known age. The best modelling strategy was to fit independent
linear regression models to each observed site index (SI) level and using a SI
prediction map in the application of the models. The most important predictor
variable was an upper percentile of the ALS heights, and
root-mean-squared-errors (RMSE) ranged between 3 and 31 years (6% to 26%) for
SI-specific models, and 21 years (25%) on average. Mean deviance (MD) ranged
between -1 and 3 years. The models improved with increasing SI and the RMSE
were largest for low SI stands older than 100 years. Using a mapped SI, which
is required for practical applications, RMSE and MD on plot-level ranged from
19 to 56 years (29% to 53%), and 5 to 37 years (5% to 31%), respectively. For
the validation stands, the RMSE and MD were 12 (22%) and 2 years (3%). Tree
height estimated from airborne laser scanning and predicted site index were the

any lens ellipticity, the constraints $\sigma_\gamma$ for two image systems are
well described by the results of Paper I, transformed to elliptical

of two to eight better, depending on source size, than for two-image systems,

$\gamma$ in these systems derive from the complementary positional information
of the images alone, without using flux. The complementarity improves as the
offset of the source from the axis increases, such that the best constraints
$\sigma_\gamma<0.01$, for $S=100$, occur when the source approaches the

on the correlation function multipoles and the error on the inferred baryon

spins from a finite set. The interactions between neighbouring spins give rise

several orders of magnitude. We also subdivide $\mathcal P$ into a family
$\mathcal P^{+}$ of intervals which we call stochastic intervals and a family
$\mathcal P^{-}$ of intervals which we call regular intervals. We numerically
prove that each interval $\omega \in \mathcal P^{+}$ has an escape time, which
roughly means that some iterate of the critical point taken over all the
parameters in $\omega$ has considerable width in the phase space. This
suggests, in turn, that most parameters belonging to the intervals in $\mathcal

directed towards fully-supervised methods that require large amounts of labeled

however, is costly, tedious, and error-prone. To overcome this challenge we
present a method to leverage photometric consistency across time when
annotations are only available for a sparse subset of frames in a video. Our
model is trained end-to-end on color images to jointly reconstruct hands and
objects in 3D by inferring their poses. Given our estimated reconstructions, we
differentiably render the optical flow between pairs of adjacent images and use
it within the network to warp one frame to another. We then apply a
self-supervised photometric loss that relies on the visual consistency between
nearby images. We achieve state-of-the-art results on 3D hand-object
reconstruction benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach allows us to
improve the pose estimation accuracy by leveraging information from neighboring

inter-particle contacts until a force-equilibrated state is reached. For
different particle aspect ratios $\alpha=10\ldots 40$, we calculate contacts
$z$, pressure as well as bulk and shear modulus. Most important is the fraction
$f_0$ of spherocylinders with contacts at both ends as it governs the jamming
threshold $z_c(f_0)=8+2f_0$. These results highlight the important role of the
axial ""sliding"" degree of freedom of a spherocylinder, which is a zero-energy

reviewing still remains unknown. Aimed at a systemic understanding of how
online consumers post negative reviews, using 1, 450, 000 negative reviews from
JD.com, the largest B2C platform in China, the behavioral patterns from
temporal, perceptional and emotional perspectives are comprehensively explored
in the present study. Massive consumers behind these reviews across four
sectors in the most recent 10 years are further split into five levels to
reveal group discriminations at a fine resolution. Circadian rhythms of
negative reviewing after making purchases were found, and the periodic
intervals suggest stable habits in online consumption and that consumers tend
to negatively review at the same hour of the purchase. Consumers from lower
levels express more intensive negative feelings, especially on product pricing
and seller attitudes, while those from upper levels demonstrate a stronger
momentum of negative emotion. The value of negative reviews from higher-level
consumers is thus unexpectedly highlighted because of less emotionalization and
less biased narration, while the longer-lasting characteristic of these
consumers' negative responses also stresses the need for more attention from
sellers. Our results shed light on implementing distinguished proactive
strategies in different buyer groups to help mitigate the negative impact due

treatment effects, by combining prognosis research and network meta-analysis
methods when individual patient data is available. In a first stage, we develop
a prognostic model and we predict the baseline risk of the outcome. In the
second stage, we use this baseline risk score from the first stage as a single
prognostic factor and effect modifier in a network meta-regression model. We
apply the approach to a network meta-analysis of three randomized clinical
trials comparing the relapse rate in Natalizumab, Glatiramer Acetate and
Dimethyl Fumarate including 3590 patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting
multiple sclerosis. We find that the baseline risk score modifies the relative
and absolute treatment effects. Several patient characteristics such as age and
disability status impact on the baseline risk of relapse, and this in turn
moderates the benefit that may be expected for each of the treatments. For
high-risk patients, the treatment that minimizes the risk to relapse in two
years is Natalizumab, whereas for low-risk patients Dimethyl Fumarate Fumarate
might be a better option. Our approach can be easily extended to all outcomes
of interest and has the potential to inform a personalised treatment approach.

identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2
virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of one
of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2
(ACE2). Thus, spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and
antiviral drugs. A novel method has been recently described by some of the
authors to pharmacologically downregulate the expression of target proteins at
the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational
advancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block
protein expression by targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering the
folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulations of the entire
sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data revealed
the existence of a folding intermediate showing two druggable pockets hidden in
the native conformation. Both pockets were targeted by a virtual screening
repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying drugs capable to decrease the
expression of ACE2. We identified four compounds capable of lowering ACE2
expression in Vero cells in a dose-dependent fashion. All these molecules were
found to inhibit the entry into cells of a pseudotyped retrovirus exposing the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly, the antiviral activity has been tested
against live SARS-CoV-2 (MEX-BC2/2020 strain). One of the selected drugs
(Artefenomel) could completely prevent cytopathic effects induced by the
presence of the virus, thus showing antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.
Ongoing studies are further evaluating the possibility of repurposing these
drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

the fabrication of complex geometry quickly and cheaply. High stiffness parts
are produced by filling the 2D polygons of consecutive layers with
contour-parallel extrusion toolpaths. Uniform width toolpaths consisting of
inward offsets from the outline polygons produce over- and underfill regions in
the center of the shape, which are especially detrimental to the mechanical
performance of thin parts. In order to fill shapes with arbitrary diameter
densely the toolpaths require adaptive width. Existing approaches for
generating toolpaths with adaptive width result in a large variation in widths,
which for some hardware systems is difficult to realize accurately. In this
paper we present a framework which supports multiple schemes to generate
toolpaths with adaptive width, by employing a function to decide the number of
beads and their widths. Furthermore, we propose a novel scheme which reduces
extreme bead widths, while limiting the number of altered toolpaths. We
statistically validate the effectiveness of our framework and this novel scheme
on a data set of representative 3D models, and physically validate it by
developing a technique, called back pressure compensation, for off-the-shelf
FDM systems to effectively realize adaptive width.

to understand how the micro-porosity of cloud particles affects the cloud

spectroscopic effects of micro-porous particles, the particle size
distribution, and non-spherical cloud particles. We expanded our kinetic
non-equilibrium cloud formation model and use a grid of prescribed 1D

and the Mie theory to model the spectroscopic properties of cloud particles
with micro-porosity and a derived particle size distribution. We used a
statistical distribution of hollow spheres to represent the effects of
non-spherical cloud particles. Highly micro-porous cloud particles (90% vacuum)
have a larger surface area, enabling efficient bulk growth higher in the
atmosphere than for compact particles. Increases in single-scattering albedo
and cross-sectional area for these mineral snowflakes cause the cloud deck to
become optically thin only at a wavelength of ~100 ${\rm \mu m}$ instead of at
the ~20 ${\rm \mu m}$ for compact cloud particles. A significant enhancement in
albedo is also seen when cloud particles occur with a locally changing Gaussian
size distribution. Non-spherical particles increase the opacity of silicate
spectral features, which further increases the wavelength at which the clouds
become optically thin. JWST MIRI will be sensitive to signatures of
micro-porous and non-spherical cloud particles based on the wavelength at which
clouds are optically thin.

the NC and GB term corrected black hole, the thermodynamic quantities have also
been altered. The phase transitions for the local thermodynamic stability, in
the theory, is outlined by a discontinuity of specific heat $C_{+}$ at a
critical radius $r_+=r_C$, and $C_{+}$ changes from infinitely negative to
infinitely positive and then down to a finite positive for the smaller $r_+$.
The thermal evaporation process leads to a thermodynamic stable extremal black

the planet harbours an extended region in its deep interior that is enriched in
heavy elements, a so-called dilute/fuzzy core. This finding raises the question
of what possible formation pathways would lead to such a structure. We model
Jupiter's formation and long-term evolution, starting at late-stage formation
before runaway gas accretion. The formation scenarios we consider include both
primordial composition gradients, as well as gradients that are built as
proto-Jupiter rapidly acquires its gaseous envelope. We then follow Jupiter's
evolution as it cools down and contracts, with a particular focus on the energy
and material transport in the interior. We find that none of the scenarios we
consider lead to a fuzzy core that is compatible with interior structure
models. In all the cases, most of Jupiter's envelope becomes convective and
fully mixed after at most a few million years. This is true even when we
consider a case where the gas accretion leads to a cold planet, and large
amounts of heavy elements are accreted. It is therefore concluded that it is
very challenging to explain Jupiter's dilute core from standard formation

The simultaneity of the amplitudes of the two time-series is considered as the
edges in the network. The frequency of occurrences forms the weighted edges. In
order to extract information, we need to measure that to what extent the
coupling deviates from the coupling of two uncoupled series. Also, we need to
measure that to what extent the couplings inherit their characteristics from a
Gaussian distribution or a non-Gaussian distribution. We mapped the network
from two surrogate time-series. The results show that the couplings of markets
possess some features which diverge from the same features of the network
mapped from white noise, and from the network mapped from two surrogate
time-series. These deviations prove that there exist joint information and
cross-correlation therein. By applying the network's topological and
statistical measures and the deformation ratio in the joint probability
distribution, we distinguished basic structures of cross-correlation and
coupling of cross-markets. It was discovered that even two possibly known
uncorrelated markets may possess some joint patterns with each other. Thereby,
those markets should be examined as coupled and \textit{weakly} coupled
markets.

until time $t_{\star}$ they are grown together (i.e., $G_1 = G_2$), after which
they grow independently according to the underlying growth model.
  We show that whenever the seed graph has an influence in the underlying graph
growth model---this has been shown for PA and UA trees and is conjectured to
hold broadly---then correlation can be detected in this model, even if the

sufficient condition (which holds for PA and UA trees) under which detection is

on the performance of top employees. With the rise of participatory culture and
developments in communications technology, management practices require greater
conceptual awareness about possible outcomes of increased organizational
interconnectivity. While there exists a sound theoretical basis for possible
burdens brought by collaborative overload, the literature never really manage
to measure and empirically test this phenomenon. We address this gap by
developing a methodological framework for the identification of organizational
actors at risk of operational capacity overload. Drawing on social network
analysis as the widely applied approach for the estimation of employees'
involvement in the information exchange networks, this paper describes
potential personal and organizational causes leading to the emergence of
collaborative overload. Relying on primary data gathered through a survey
conducted among employees in a large insurance company, we present a testable
model for overload detection. A second merit of the paper consists in finding a
novel identification strategy for empirical works on cross-sectional network
data, which often face the issue of endogeneity. This research suggests that
active collaborative activity does not cause a decrease throughout every aspect
of performance. We found that expertise sharing depends on a few key players
who take core knowledge assets upon themselves and thus run higher risks of
exposure to overload.

Therefore, we present a novel framework to measure and calibrate biased (or

method to estimate the effect of the near-surface layers on oscillation
frequencies. In the proposed method we numerically estimate eigenfunctions in
3D hydrodynamic simulations. We match those to the eigenfunctions calculated
from the classic equations applied to the horizontal averages of the structure
variables. We use this procedure to calculate the frequency perturbation
resulting from the dynamical part of the interaction of the oscillations with
near-surface convection. As the last step we scale the numbers to the Sun. To
provide a qualitative test of our method we performed a series of simulations,
calculated the perturbations using our procedure, and compared them to
previously reported residuals relative to solar models. We find that we can
largely reproduce the observed frequency residuals without resorting to poorly
justified theoretical models. We find that, while the calculations of Houdek et

algorithms use traditional distance/density-based outlier scores to rank
subspaces. Because these distance/density-based scores depend on the
dimensionality of subspaces, they cannot be compared directly between subspaces
of different dimensionality. $Z$-score normalisation has been used to make them
comparable. It requires to compute outlier scores of all instances in each
subspace. This adds significant computational overhead on top of already
expensive density estimation---making OAM algorithms infeasible to run in large
and/or high-dimensional datasets. We also discover that $Z$-score normalisation
is inappropriate for OAM in some cases. In this paper, we introduce a new score
called SiNNE, which is independent of the dimensionality of subspaces. This
enables the scores in subspaces with different dimensionalities to be compared
directly without any additional normalisation. Our experimental results
revealed that SiNNE produces better or at least the same results as existing
scores; and it significantly improves the runtime of an existing OAM algorithm

seven new disk candidates, and several protostars. The overall detection rate
of disks is $32 \pm 4\%$. Few of the disks are resolved, with the exception of
a giant (R = 300 AU) transition disk. Serendipitously, we observe a millimeter
flare from an X-ray bright young stellar object (YSO), and resolve continuum
emission from a Class 0 YSO in the FIR 3 core. Two distinct disk populations
are present: a more massive one in the east, along the dense molecular ridge
hosting the FIR 1-5 YSOs, with a detection rate of $45 \pm 7\%$. In the western
population, towards IRS 1, only $15 \pm 4\%$ of disks are detected. NGC 2024
hosts two distinct disk populations. Disks along the dense molecular ridge are
young (0.2 - 0.5 Myr) and partly shielded from the far ultraviolet radiation of
IRS 2b; their masses are similar to isolated 1 - 3 Myr old SFRs. The western
population is older and at lower extinctions, and may be affected by external
photoevaporation from both IRS 1 and IRS 2b. However, it is possible these
disks had lower masses to begin with.

The cylinder is surrounded by an axial magnetic field and by a plasma of
different density. Considering flow inside and viscosity outside the flux tube,
we derive dispersion relations, and obtain analytical solutions for the phase
speed and growth rate (increment) of the waves. It is found that the critical
speed shear for the occurrence of the dissipative instability associated with
negative energy waves (NEWs) and the threshold of Kelvin--Helmholtz instability
(KHI) depend on the axial wavelength. The critical shear for the appearance of
sausage NEW is lowest for the longest axial wavelengths, while for kink waves
the minimum value of the critical shear is reached for the axial wavelength
comparable to the diameter of the cylinder. The range between the critical
speed of the dissipative instability and the KHI threshold is shown to depend
on the difference of the Alfv\'{e}n speeds inside and outside of the cylinder.
For all axial wavenumbers, NEW appears for the shear flow speeds lower than the
KHI threshold. It is easier to excite NEW in an underdense cylinder than in an
overdense one. The negative energy surface waves can be effectively generated
for azimuthal number $m=0$ with a large axial wave number and for higher modes

different approaches to computing the thermal structure determined by various
cooling and heating processes in the disk and its surroundings. Methods:
Numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit were complemented
with three thermal evolution schemes: a simplified $\beta$-cooling approach
with and without irradiation, in which the rate of disk cooling is proportional
to the local dynamical time, a fiducial model with equal dust and gas
temperatures calculated taking viscous heating, irradiation, and radiative
cooling into account, and also a more sophisticated approach allowing decoupled
dust and gas temperatures. Results: We found that the gas temperature may
significantly exceed that of dust in the outer regions of young disks thanks to
additional compressional heating caused by the infalling envelope material in
the early stages of disk evolution and slow collisional exchange of energy
between gas and dust in low-density disk regions. The outer envelope however
shows an inverse trend with the gas temperatures dropping below that of dust.
The global disk evolution is only weakly sensitive to temperature decoupling.
Nevertheless, separate dust and gas temperatures may affect the chemical
composition, dust evolution, and disk mass estimates. Constant-$\beta$ models
without stellar and background irradiation fail to reproduce the disk evolution
with more sophisticated thermal schemes because of intrinsically variable
nature of the $\beta$-parameter. Constant-$\beta$ models with irradiation can
better match the dynamical and thermal evolution, but the agreement is still
incomplete. Conclusions: Models allowing separate dust and gas temperatures are
needed when emphasis is placed on the chemical or dust evolution in
protoplanetary disks, particularly in sub-solar metallicity environments.

solid-state physics and nano-photonics. Using confocal microscopes allows
performing resonant fluorescence experiments, where the emitted light has the
same wavelength as the excitation laser. Theses challenging experiments are
carried out under linear cross-polarization conditions, rejecting laser light
from the detector. In this work we uncover the physical mechanisms that are at
the origin of the yet unexplained high polarization rejection ratio which makes
these measurements possible. We show in both experiment and theory that the use
of a reflecting surface (i.e. the beam-splitter and mirrors) placed between the
polarizer and analyzer in combination with a confocal arrangement explains the
giant cross-polarization extinction ratio of 10^8 and beyond. We map the modal
transformation of the polarized optical Gaussian beam. We find an intensity
'hole' in the reflected beam under cross-polarization conditions. We interpret
this as a manifestation of the Imbert-Fedorov effect, which deviates the beam
depending on its polarization helicity. This implies that this topological
effect is amplified here from the usually observed nanometer to the micrometer
scale due to our cross-polarization dark field methods. We confirm these
experimental findings for a large variety of commercially available mirrors and
polarization components, allowing their practical implementation in many
experiments.

indicators for maternal and fetal health monitoring during pregnancy. 3D
ultrasound (US) has unique advantages over 2D scan in covering the whole fetal
head and may promote the diagnoses. However, automatically segmenting the whole
fetal head in US volumes still pends as an emerging and unsolved problem. The
challenges that automated solutions need to tackle include the poor image
quality, boundary ambiguity, long-span occlusion, and the appearance
variability across different fetal poses and gestational ages. In this paper,
we propose the first fully-automated solution to segment the whole fetal head
in US volumes.
  Methods: The segmentation task is firstly formulated as an end-to-end
volumetric mapping under an encoder-decoder deep architecture. We then combine
the segmentor with a proposed hybrid attention scheme (HAS) to select
discriminative features and suppress the non-informative volumetric features in
a composite and hierarchical way. With little computation overhead, HAS proves
to be effective in addressing boundary ambiguity and deficiency. To enhance the
spatial consistency in segmentation, we further organize multiple segmentors in
a cascaded fashion to refine the results by revisiting context in the
prediction of predecessors.
  Results: Validated on a large dataset collected from 100 healthy volunteers,
our method presents superior segmentation performance (DSC (Dice Similarity
Coefficient), 96.05%), remarkable agreements with experts. With another 156
volumes collected from 52 volunteers, we ahieve high reproducibilities (mean
standard deviation 11.524 mL) against scan variations.
  Conclusion: This is the first investigation about whole fetal head
segmentation in 3D US. Our method is promising to be a feasible solution in
assisting the volumetric US-based prenatal studies.

are computed using finite element-based periodic homogenization, which is
implemented in Abaqus utilizing an open-source plugin (EasyPBC). Several
optimization problems are solved using a particle swarm-based optimization
method from the pyOpt package. A series of constrained optimization problems
are used to construct a design envelop of potential properties. The design
envelope more fully captures the potential of the metamaterial, compared with
the current practice of using parametric studies. This is because the optimizer
can change all parameters simultaneously to find the optimal design. This
demonstrates the potential of using an optimization-based approach for
designing and exploring multifunctional metamaterial properties. This proposed
approach is general and can be applied to any metamaterial design, assuming an
accurate numerical model exists to evaluate its properties.

studies on unbiased learning algorithms with logged data, namely the
\textit{offline} unbiased learning, and the studies on unbiased parameters
estimation with real-time user interactions, namely the \textit{online}
learning to rank. While their definitions of \textit{unbiasness} are different,
these two types of ULTR algorithms share the same goal -- to find the best
models that rank documents based on their intrinsic relevance or utility.
However, most studies on offline and online unbiased learning to rank are
carried in parallel without detailed comparisons on their background theories
and empirical performance. In this paper, we formalize the task of unbiased
learning to rank and show that existing algorithms for offline unbiased

recommendation systems to provide online personalised recommendations. A
recurrent assumption is the stationarity of the reward function, which is
rather unrealistic in most of the real-world applications. In the music
recommendation scenario for instance, people's music taste can abruptly change
during certain events, such as Halloween or Christmas, and revert to the
previous music taste soon after.
  We would therefore need an algorithm which can promptly react to these
changes. Moreover, we would like to leverage already observed rewards collected
during different stationary periods which can potentially reoccur, without the
need of restarting the learning process from scratch. A growing literature has
addressed the problem of reward's non-stationarity, providing algorithms that
could quickly adapt to the changing environment. However, up to our knowledge,
there is no algorithm which deals with seasonal changes of the reward function.
Here we present a contextual bandit algorithm which detects and adapts to
abrupt changes of the reward function and leverages previous estimations
whenever the environment falls back to a previously observed state. We show

challenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual
perception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the
neural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by
unifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal
medical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly
employs deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting
abnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial
graph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a
generative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge,
achieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and
variability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that
realizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of
abnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these
discoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving
a comprehensive medical report generation. When it employed in a real-world
clinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on
spinal medical report generation as well as show that our algorithm remarkably
exceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate
its potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis.

replacing the learned fully connected output layer with a fixed layer has been
proposed as a way to achieve better efficiency. In this paper we examine this
idea further and demonstrate that fixed classifiers offer no additional benefit
compared to simply removing the output layer along with its parameters. We
further demonstrate that the typical approach of having a fully connected final

circular dichroism spectra in a temperature range from 10 to 300 K. Besides the
antiferromagnetic Ni$_3^+$ cations which are naturally part of the NdNiO$_3$
layer, Ni$_2^+$ ions are formed at the interface due to a charge transfer
mechanism involving the Mn element of the adjacent layer. They exhibit a
ferromagnetic behavior due to the exchange coupling to the Mn$_4^+$ ions in the
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ layer. This can be seen as detrimental to the
strength of the unidirectional anisotropy since a significant part of the
interface does not contribute to the pinning of the ferromagnetic layer. By
analyzing the line shape changes of the x-ray absorption at the Ni L$_{2,3}$
edges, the metal-insulator transition of the NdNiO$_3$ layer is resolved in an
element specific manner. This phase transition is initiated at about 120 K, way
above the paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition of NdNiO$_3$ layer which
measured to be 50 K. Exchange bias and enhanced coercive fields were observed
after field cooling the sample through the Neel temperature of the NdNiO$_3$
layer. Different from La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$/LaNiO$_3$, the exchange bias
observed in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$/NdNiO$_3$ is due to the
antiferromagnetism of NdNiO$_3$ and the frustration at the interface. These
results suggest that reducing the interfacial orbital hybridization may be used
as a tunable parameter for the strength of the exchange bias effect in
all-oxide heterostructures which exhibit a charge transfer mechanism.

This approach is intensive in time and resources, and ignores many relevant

particular interest. To this end, we study the real-time dynamics of pure
states featuring a sharp initial non-equilibrium density profile. Relying on
the concept of dynamical quantum typicality, the resulting non-equilibrium
dynamics can be related to equilibrium correlation functions. Summarizing our
main results, we observe that diffusive transport occurs for moderate values of
the mass imbalance, and manifests itself in a Gaussian spreading of real-space
density profiles and an exponential decay of density modes in momentum space.
For stronger imbalances, we provide evidence that transport becomes anomalous
on intermediate time scales and, in particular, our results are consistent with
the absence of strict localization in the long-time limit for any ${\eta > 0}$.
Based on our numerical analysis, we provide an estimate for the ""lifetime"" of
the effective localization as a function of $\eta$.

tensorial response and transition properties, in which atomic coordinate
vectors are multiplied with scalar NN outputs or their derivatives to preserve
the rotationally covariant symmetry. This strategy keeps structural descriptors
symmetry invariant so that the resulting tensorial NN models are as efficient
as their scalar counterparts. We validate the performance and universality of
this approach by learning response properties of water oligomers and liquid
water, and transition dipole moment of a model structural unit of proteins.
Machine learned tensorial models have enabled efficient simulations of
vibrational spectra of liquid water and ultraviolet spectra of realistic

utterance and others' perception of that utterance. The misalignment between
these perspectives can lead to undesirable outcomes, such as misunderstandings,
low productivity and even overt strife. In this work, we present a
computational framework for exploring and comparing both perspectives in online
public discussions.
  We combine logged data about public comments on Facebook with a survey of
over 16,000 people about their intentions in writing these comments or about
their perceptions of comments that others had written. Unlike previous studies
of online discussions that have largely relied on third-party labels to
quantify properties such as sentiment and subjectivity, our approach also
directly captures what the speakers actually intended when writing their
comments. In particular, our analysis focuses on judgments of whether a comment
is stating a fact or an opinion, since these concepts were shown to be often
confused.
  We show that intentions and perceptions diverge in consequential ways. People
are more likely to perceive opinions than to intend them, and linguistic cues
that signal how an utterance is intended can differ from those that signal how
it will be perceived. Further, this misalignment between intentions and
perceptions can be linked to the future health of a conversation: when a
comment whose author intended to share a fact is misperceived as sharing an
opinion, the subsequent conversation is more likely to derail into uncivil
behavior than when the comment is perceived as intended. Altogether, these
findings may inform the design of discussion platforms that better promote
positive interactions.

potentially hampering the regulatory approval of safe and efficacious
therapies. A novel solution to this problem is proposed. A list of baseline
covariates that have the potential to be prognostic for survival under either
treatment is pre-specified in the analysis plan. At the analysis stage, using
all observed survival times but blinded to patient-level treatment assignment,
'noise' covariates are removed with elastic net Cox regression. The shortened

heterogeneous trial population into subpopulations of prognostically
homogeneous patients (risk strata). After patient-level treatment unblinding, a
treatment comparison is done within each formed risk stratum and stratum-level

power-boosting performance of our proposed 5-step stratified testing and

nitrogen oxides concentrations observed by satellites and ground-based

have little impacts (less than 0.13ppm by April 30, 2020) on the overserved

settings, via the lens of Rademacher complexity. We give upper and lower bounds
for the adversarial empirical Rademacher complexity of linear hypotheses with
adversarial perturbations measured in $l_r$-norm for an arbitrary $r \geq 1$.
This generalizes the recent result of [Yin et al.'19] that studies the case of
$r = \infty$, and provides a finer analysis of the dependence on the input
dimensionality as compared to the recent work of [Khim and Loh'19] on linear
hypothesis classes.

bounds for a single ReLU unit. Finally, we give adversarial Rademacher
complexity bounds for feed-forward neural networks with one hidden layer.
Unlike previous works we directly provide bounds on the adversarial Rademacher
complexity of the given network, as opposed to a bound on a surrogate. A
by-product of our analysis also leads to tighter bounds for the Rademacher
complexity of linear hypotheses, for which we give a detailed analysis and

the performance of a UAV-based communication system operating in a shadowed

it models various fading/shadowing conditions, while it is in terms of

players to the forefront. In this game, coordinated groups of players can
leverage pre-established conventions to great effect, but playing in an ad-hoc
setting requires agents to adapt to its partner's strategies with no previous
coordination. Evaluating an agent in this setting requires a diverse population
of potential partners, but so far, the behavioral diversity of agents has not
been considered in a systematic way. This paper proposes Quality Diversity
algorithms as a promising class of algorithms to generate diverse populations
for this purpose, and generates a population of diverse Hanabi agents using
MAP-Elites. We also postulate that agents can benefit from a diverse population
during training and implement a simple ""meta-strategy"" for adapting to an
agent's perceived behavioral niche. We show this meta-strategy can work better
than generalist strategies even outside the population it was trained with if
its partner's behavioral niche can be correctly inferred, but in practice a
partner's behavior depends and interferes with the meta-agent's own behavior,
suggesting an avenue for future research in characterizing another agent's
behavior during gameplay.

decoding thresholds, minimum distance properties, and their bit error rate
(BER) performance at small to moderate frame length. Here, we consider a
sliding window decoder in the context of large frame length or one that
continuously outputs blocks in a streaming fashion. In this case, decoder error
propagation, due to the feedback inherent in BCCs, can be a serious problem.In
order to mitigate the effects of error propagation, we propose several schemes:
a \emph{window extension algorithm} where the decoder window size can be
extended adaptively, a resynchronization mechanism where we reset the encoder
to the initial state, and a retransmission strategy where erroneously decoded
blocks are retransmitted. In addition, we introduce a soft BER stopping rule to
reduce computational complexity, and the tradeoff between performance and
complexity is examined. Simulation results show that, using the proposed window
extension algorithm, resynchronization mechanism, and retransmission strategy,
the BER performance of BCCs can be improved by up to four orders of magnitude
in the signal-to-noise ratio operating range of interest, and in addition the
soft BER stopping rule can be employed to reduce computational complexity.

non-contact and noninvasive manipulation of small individual particles. The
following question arises: What is the impact of these forces on the ensemble
of thousand particles in continuous media? The aim of this work is to find
analytical expression of the radiation force and potential densities creating
from laser pulse propagating in dielectric media. This allows us to find an
effective averaged longitudinal real force at the level of the laser pulse
spot. The obtained force is proportional to initial pulse energy and inversely
proportional to its time duration. In the femtosecond region the force becomes
strong enough to confine the neutral particles into the pulse envelope and
translate them with group velocity. In silica for example, the longitudinal
force of a femtosecond pulse is significantly greater than the molecular
forces. Thus, the fine ablation in silica with short pulses may be due to this
longitudinal force, which breaks down the molecular bonds. Additionally, after
confinement into the pulse envelope, the moving particles produce new linear
and nonlinear effects. The dipole interaction with the electromagnetic field of
the particles captured into the pulse generate at carrier-to-envelope
frequency, instead of at the carrying ones. This oscillation is in sub-THz
range in gases and in THz in solids. In nonlinear regime instead of third
harmonics, the ensemble of moving particles generates at frequency proportional
to three times the frequency of the envelope-carrier.

constitutes an important problem. Our focus is the computational analysis of

represented by a vector of Relative Information Gain (RIG) about the subject
categories that the text belongs to, which can be obtained from observing the
word in the text. This new approach is applied to construct the Meaning Space
based on Leicester Scientific Corpus (LSC) and Leicester Scientific
Dictionary-Core (LScDC). The LSC is a scientific corpus of 1,673,350 abstracts
and the LScDC is a scientific dictionary which words are extracted from the
LSC. Each text in the LSC belongs to at least one of 252 subject categories of
Web of Science (WoS). These categories are used in construction of vectors of
information gains. The Meaning Space is described and statistically analysed
for the LSC with the LScDC. The usefulness of the proposed representation model
is evaluated through top-ranked words in each category. The most informative n
words are ordered. We demonstrated that RIG-based word ranking is much more
useful than ranking based on raw word frequency in determining the
science-specific meaning and importance of a word. The proposed model based on
RIG is shown to have ability to stand out topic-specific words in categories.
The most informative words are presented for 252 categories. The new scientific
dictionary and the 103,998 x 252 Word-Category RIG Matrix are available online.
Analysis of the Meaning Space provides us with a tool to further explore

the spin period--orbital period diagram of HMXBs. An interesting secondary
relationship discovered in this work is the apparent connection between

unpublished theses of Page (1950) and Ashkin (1952), Page's letter (1951) and
the APW paper reveals no credible evidence of multiple scattering at 0.61 MeV;
if anything, the evidence rules against multiple scattering. If multiple
scattering is ruled out, the observations may indicate a departure from quantum
electrodynamics. This departure may be due to a non-Coulomb central force, a
weakening of the spin-statistics connection, or both. Only experiment can tell
which of these possibilities holds true, and therefore we suggest the new
electron-electron scattering experiments be carried out at different energies
(at 0.4-1.0 MeV) and different scattering angles, as well as specific tests for
multiple scattering. We consider a non-Coulomb central force to be very
unlikely, and advance the hypothesis that a fraction of the electron pairs
scatter as spin-zero fermions (which would lower the observed cross-section).
Numerical calculations show that the hypothesis may be tested quantitatively in
a Page-type experiment, even with little improvement in the accuracy he
achieved in 1950.

Due to the high cost of expert annotations, crowdsourcing, where non-experts

Although many promising results are reported, the quality of diagnostic
crowdsourced labels is still unclear. We propose to address this by instead
asking the crowd about visual features of the images, which can be provided
more intuitively, and by using these features in a multi-task learning
framework through ensemble strategies. We compare our proposed approach to a
baseline model with a set of 2000 skin lesions from the ISIC 2017 challenge

image, while our multi-task model also predicts one of the following features:
asymmetry of the lesion, border irregularity and color. We show that multi-task
models with individual crowdsourced features have limited effect on the model,
but when combined in an ensembles, leads to improved generalisation. The area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.794 for the baseline
model and 0.811 and 0.808 for multi-task ensembles respectively. Finally, we
discuss the findings, identify some limitations and recommend directions for

outcome is a dendrogram exhibiting the connections of those entities. Through
the introduction of a 'susceptibility' measure we can provide an 'optimal'
choice for the clustering as well as quantify its quality. The dendrogram
reveals further useful structural information though -- like the existence of
sub-clusters within clusters or of nodes that do not fit in any cluster. We
illustrate the algorithm by applying it first to a set of synthetic networks,
and then to a selection of examples. We also illustrate how to transform our
algorithm into a valid alternative for one-mode networks as well, and show that
it performs at least as well as the standard, modularity-based algorithms --
with a higher numerical performance. We provide an implementation of the

approaches that rely on low-level simulations with fault injection cannot
evaluate full applications because of their slow speeds, while

decomposes application failure rate estimation into (1) identifying how
particle strikes in low-level unprotected state manifest at the
architecture-level, and (2) measuring how such architecture-level

effectiveness of this approach on GPU architectures. We also show that using

estimate and interpolate poly-rigid/affine transformations for which the
invertibility is guaranteed. This powerful and flexible mathematical framework
is currently being used to track the human joint dynamics by first imposing
bone rigidity constraints in order to synthetize the spatio-temporal joint
deformations later. However, since no closed-form exists, then a
computationally expensive integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
is required to perform image registration using this framework. To tackle this
problem, the exponential map for solving these ODEs is computed using the
scaling and squaring method in the literature. In this paper, we propose an
algorithm using a matrix diagonalization based method for smooth interpolation
of homogeneous polyrigid transformations of human joints during motion. The use
of this alternative computational approach to integrate ODEs is well motivated
by the fact that bone rigid transformations satisfy the mechanical constraints
of human joint motion, which provide conditions that guarantee the
diagonalizability of local bone transformations and consequently of the
resulting joint transformations. In a comparison with the scaling and squaring
method, we discuss the usefulness of the matrix eigendecomposition technique
which reduces significantly the computational burden associated with the
computation of matrix exponential over a dense regular grid. Finally, we have
applied the method to enhance the temporal resolution of dynamic MRI sequences
of the ankle joint. To conclude, numerical experiments show that the
eigendecomposition method is more capable of balancing the trade-off between
accuracy, computation time, and memory requirements.

risk to human health globally. Given the limitations of observations of extreme

globally, from which one can derive quantities like return values to summarize
the magnitude of a low probability event for an arbitrary geographic location.
However, while these derived quantities are useful on their own, it is also
often important to apply a spatial statistical model to such data in order to,
e.g., understand how the spatial dependence properties of the return values
vary over space and emulate the climate model for generating additional spatial
fields with corresponding statistical properties. For these objectives, when
modeling global data it is critical to use a nonstationary covariance function.
Furthermore, given that the output of modern global climate models can be on
the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$, it is important to utilize approximate
Gaussian process methods to enable inference. In this paper, we demonstrate the

interpret the fundamental limit values as a factor determining the physical

minimum lengths. The goal of this review is to demonstrate the effectiveness of
limit values as a tool for describing the physics of the Planck scale.
Moreover, by virtue of their universality, the limit values allow us to
establish relationships between, on first glance, distant fields of physics. We

to intensive care units (ICU), with costs exceeding $82 billion. Although close
monitoring and dynamic assessment of patient acuity are key aspects of ICU
care, both are limited by the time constraints imposed on healthcare providers.
Methods: Using the University of Florida Health (UFH) Integrated Data
Repository as Honest Broker, we created a database with electronic health
records data from a retrospective study cohort of 38,749 adult patients
admitted to ICU at UF Health between 06/01/2014 and 08/22/2019. This repository
includes demographic information, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory
values, medications with date and timestamps, and diagnoses and procedure codes
for all index admission encounters as well as encounters within 12 months prior
to index admission and 12 months follow-up. We developed algorithms to identify
acuity status of the patient every four hours during each ICU stay. Results: We
had 383,193 encounters (121,800 unique patients) admitted to the hospital, and
51,073 encounters (38,749 unique patients) with at least one ICU stay that
lasted more than four hours. These patients requiring ICU admission had longer
median hospital stay (7 days vs. 1 day) and higher in-hospital mortality (9.6%
vs. 0.4%) compared with those not admitted to the ICU. Among patients who were
admitted to the ICU and expired during hospital admission, more deaths occurred
in the ICU than on general hospital wards (7.4% vs. 0.8%, respectively).
Conclusions: We developed phenotyping algorithms that determined patient acuity
status every four hours while admitted to the ICU. This approach may be useful
in developing prognostic and clinical decision-support tools to aid patients,
caregivers, and providers in shared decision-making processes regarding
resource use and escalation of care.

analytic in business, sports analysis, etc. In regression analysis,
optimization algorithms play a significant role in search the coefficients in
the regression model. In this paper, nonlinear regression analysis using a
recently developed meta-heuristic Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO) is proposed. The
proposed method is applied to 10 well-known benchmark nonlinear regression
problems. A comparative study has been conducted with Particle Swarm Optimizer
(PSO). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
statistically outperforms PSO algorithm.
