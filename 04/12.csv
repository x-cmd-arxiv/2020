the angular momentum and transverse flow in the central region of colliding
nuclei are studied based on refined estimate of the global polarization.
Simulations of Au+Au collisions at collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 6-40 GeV
are performed within the model of the three-fluid dynamics. Within the
crossover and first-order-phase-transition scenarios this refined estimate
quite satisfactorily reproduces the experimental STAR data. Hadronic scenario
fails at high collision energies, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}>$ 10 GeV, and even predicts
opposite sign of the global polarization. It is found that the global
polarization correlates with neither the angular momentum accumulated in the
central region nor with directed and elliptic flow. At the same time we
observed correlation between the angular momentum and directed flow in both
their time and collision-energy dependence. These results suggest that,
although initially the angular momentum is the driving force for the vortex
generation, later the angular momentum and vortex motion become decorrelated in
the midrapidity region. Then the midrapidity angular momentum is determined by
the pattern of the directed flow and even becomes negative when the antiflow
occurs. At the freeze-out stage, the dominant part of the participant angular
momentum is accumulated in the fragmentation regions.

may not itself be individually fair. In this work, we investigate individual
fairness under pipeline composition. Pipelines differ from ordinary sequential
or repeated composition in that individuals may drop out at any stage, and
classification in subsequent stages may depend on the remaining ""cohort"" of
individuals. As an example, a company might hire a team for a new project and
at a later point promote the highest performer on the team. Unlike other
repeated classification settings, where the degree of unfairness degrades
gracefully over multiple fair steps, the degree of unfairness in pipelines can
be arbitrary, even in a pipeline with just two stages.
  Guided by a panoply of real-world examples, we provide a rigorous framework
for evaluating different types of fairness guarantees for pipelines. We show
that na\""{i}ve auditing is unable to uncover systematic unfairness and that, in
order to ensure fairness, some form of dependence must exist between the design
of algorithms at different stages in the pipeline. Finally, we provide
constructions that permit flexibility at later stages, meaning that there is no
need to lock in the entire pipeline at the time that the early stage is

integrated data processing engine that performs analytics on fresh data, which
are ingested from a transactional engine. HTAP systems typically consider data
freshness at design time, and are optimized for a fixed range of freshness
requirements, addressed at a performance cost for either OLTP or OLAP. The data
freshness and the performance requirements of both engines, however, may vary
with the workload.
  We approach HTAP as a scheduling problem, addressed at runtime through
elastic resource management. We model an HTAP system as a set of three
individual engines: an OLTP, an OLAP and a Resource and Data Exchange (RDE)
engine. We devise a scheduling algorithm which traverses the HTAP design
spectrum through elastic resource management, to meet the data freshness
requirements of the workload. We propose an in-memory system design which is
non-intrusive to the current state-of-art OLTP and OLAP engines, and we use it
to evaluate the performance of our approach. Our evaluation shows that the
performance benefit of our system for OLAP queries increases over time,
reaching up to 50% compared to static schedules for 100 query sequences, while
maintaining a small, and controlled, drop in the OLTP throughput.

Navier-Stokes equations. In this work, we propose a framework for nonlinear
stability analysis that exploits the fact that nonlinear flow interactions are
constrained by the physics encoded in the nonlinearity. In particular, we show
that nonlinear stability analysis problems can be posed as convex feasibility
and optimization problems based on Lyapunov matrix inequalities, and a set of
quadratic constraints that represent the nonlinear flow physics. The proposed
framework can be used to conduct global stability, local stability, and
transient energy growth analysis. The approach is demonstrated on the
low-dimensional Waleffe-Kim-Hamilton model of transition and sustained
turbulence. Our analysis correctly determines the critical Reynolds number for
global instability. For local stability analysis, we show that the framework
can estimate the size of the region of attraction as well as the amplitude of
the largest permissible perturbation such that all trajectories converge back
to the equilibrium point. Additionally, we show that the framework can predict
bounds on the maximum transient energy growth. Finally, we show that careful
analysis of the multipliers used to enforce the quadratic constraints can be

optimally classify a candidate's ability into one of several categories or

parameter, which, together with the difficulty of the question asked,
determines the likelihood with which s/he is able to answer a question
correctly. The learning algorithm is only able to observe these noisy responses
to its queries. We consider this problem from a fixed confidence-based
$\delta$-correct framework, that in our setting seeks to arrive at the correct
ability discrimination at the fastest possible rate while guaranteeing that the
probability of error is less than a pre-specified and small $\delta$. In this
setting we develop lower bounds on any sequential questioning strategy and
develop geometrical insights into the problem structure both from primal and
dual formulation. In addition, we arrive at algorithms that essentially match
these lower bounds. Our key conclusions are that, asymptotically, any candidate
needs to be asked questions at most at two (candidate ability-specific) levels,
although, in a reasonably general framework, questions need to be asked only at
a single level. Further, and interestingly, the problem structure facilitates
endogenous exploration, so there is no need for a separately designed

to obtain low-rank (LR) structure of the data prior to spatial prediction.
Recently developed predictive PCA modifies the traditional algorithm to improve
the overall predictive performance by leveraging both LR and spatial structures
within the data. However, predictive PCA requires complete data or an initial
imputation step. Nonparametric imputation techniques without accounting for
spatial information may distort the underlying structure of the data, and thus
further reduce the predictive performance. We propose a convex optimization

white-light images of the solar corona and inner heliosphere. Thanks to the
uniqueness of Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) orbit, WISPR is able to image
``locally'' coronal structures at high spatial and time resolutions. The
observed plane of sky, however, rapidly changes because of the PSP's high
orbital speed. Therefore, the interpretation of the dynamics of the coronal
structures recorded by WISPR is not straightforward. A first study, undertaken
by \citet{Liewer2019}, shows how different coronal features (e.g., streamers,
flux ropes) appear in the field of view of WISPR by means of raytracing
simulations. In particular, they analyze the effects of the spatial resolution
changes on both the images and the associated height-time maps, and introduce
the fundamentals for geometric triangulation. In this follow-up paper, we focus
on the study of the total brightness of a simple, spherical, plasma density
structure, to understand how the analysis of Thomson-scattered emission by the
electrons in a coronal feature can shed light into the determination of its
kinematic properties. We investigate two cases: {\it (a)} a density sphere at a
constant distance from the Sun for different heliographic longitudes; {\it (b)}
a density sphere moving outwardly with constant speed. The study allows us to
characterize the effects of the varying heliocentric distance of the observer
and scattering angle on the total brightness observed, which we exploit to
contribute to a better determination of the position and speed of the coronal
features observed by WISPR.

has recently observed rapid, Alfvenic, HMF inversions in the inner heliosphere,
known as 'switchbacks', which have been interpreted as the possible remnants of
coronal jets. It has also been suggested that inverted HMF may be produced by
near-Sun interchange reconnection; a key process in mechanisms proposed for
slow solar wind release. These cases suggest that the source of inverted HMF is
near the Sun, and it follows that these inversions would gradually decay and
straighten as they propagate out through the heliosphere. Alternatively, HMF
inversions could form during solar wind transit, through phenomena such
velocity shears, draping over ejecta, or waves and turbulence. Such processes
are expected to lead to a qualitatively radial evolution of inverted HMF
structures. Using Helios measurements spanning 0.3-1 AU, we examine the
occurrence rate of inverted HMF, as well as other magnetic field morphologies,
as a function of radial distance A, and find that it continually increases.
This trend may be explained by inverted HMF observed between 0.3-1 AU being
primarily driven by one or more of the above in-transit processes, rather than
created at the Sun. We make suggestions as to the relative importance of these
different processes based on the evolution of the magnetic field properties
associated with inverted HMF. We also explore alternative explanations outside

wind-accretion channel, which can be consistently modelled in binary population

SySts are sufficiently long (${\gtrsim10^3}$ d) so that, for very dense GC
models, dynamical interactions play an important role in destroying their
progenitors before the present day (${\sim11-12}$ Gyr). In less dense GC
models, some SySts are still predicted to exist. However, these systems tend to
be located far from the central parts (${\gtrsim70}$ per cent are far beyond
the half-light radius) and are sufficiently rare (${\lesssim1}$ per GC per
Myr), which makes their identification rather difficult in observational
campaigns. We propose that future searches for SySts in GCs should be performed
in the outskirts of nearby low-density GCs with sufficiently long half-mass
relaxation times and relatively large Galactocentric distances. Finally, we
obtained spectra of the candidate proposed in $\omega$ Cen (SOPS IV e-94) and

baseline subtraction for quantitative polymerase chain-reaction (qPCR)
measurements. In particular, we present an algorithm that leverages information
obtained from non-template and/or DNA extraction-control experiments to remove
systematic bias from amplification curves. We recast this problem in terms of
mathematical optimization, i.e. by finding the amount of control signal that,
when subtracted from an amplification curve, minimizes background noise. We
demonstrate that this approach can yield a decade improvement in sensitivity
relative to standard approaches, especially for data exhibiting late-cycle
amplification. Critically, this increased sensitivity and accuracy promises
more effective screening of viral DNA and a reduction in the rate of
false-negatives in diagnostic settings.

coexistence was pointed out long ago and, in recent years, has received
considerable attention. Analyses have focused on variations in the

Here, we present a synthesis of stochasticity-induced stabilization (SIS)

its variance $g$. When the diffusion approximation holds, explicit formulas for
invasion probabilities and persistence times are single valued, monotonic
functions of $\mu/g$. The storage effect in the lottery model, together with
other well-known examples drawn from population genetics, microbiology and
ecology (including discrete and continuous dynamics, with overlapping and

within this new, transparent theoretical framework. We also clarify the
relationships between life-history strategies and SIS, and study the dynamics
of extinction when SIS fails.

This enables us to study the three-body lifetime distribution in more detail by
decomposing it into the individual distributions from the different kinds of

distribution similar to that of radioactive decay. Meanwhile, L\'evy flight
interactions follow a power-law distribution. L\'evy flights in fact dominate
the tail of the general three-body lifetime distribution, providing conclusive

roughly uniformly spread throughout the sky) in the survey. We find that the

recently by the ALICE collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at the center-of-mass
collision energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.76$ TeV there arose a highly non-trivial
question about the excluded volume of composite particles. Surprisingly, the
hadron resonance gas model (HRGM) is able to perfectly describe the light
(anti)nuclei multiplicities under various assumptions. Thus, one can consider
the (anti)nuclei with a vanishing hard-core radius (as the point-like
particles) or with the hard-core radius of proton, but the fit quality is the
same for these assumptions. It is clear, however, that such assumptions are
unphysical. Hence we obtain a formula for the classical excluded volume of
loosely bound light nuclei consisting of A baryons. To implement a new formula
into the HRGM we have to modify the induced surface tension concept to treat
the hadrons and (anti)nuclei on the same footing. We perform a simultaneous
analysis of hadronic and (anti)nuclei multiplicities measured by the ALICE
collaboration. The HRGM with the induced surface tension allows us to verify
different assumptions on the values of hard-core radii and different scenarios
of chemical freeze-out of light (anti)nuclei. It is shown that the

momentum-space Berry curvature physics. Our theory does not invoke the boundary
current, the thermodynamic approach to magnetization or any mechanical
counterpart of statistical forces. By introducing a fictitious inhomogeneity,
it applies to homogeneous samples as well, promoting the inhomogeneity to be a
basic trick in semiclassical transport theories. Such a trick works regardless
of the driving force of transport, e.g., temperature gradient, in contrast to
the trick of fictitious gravitational field in quantum transport theories. We
thus include more general mechanical driving forces and establish the Mott

active area of research. In this paper, we present a novel method to structure
the latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to encode different
continuous-valued attributes explicitly. This is accomplished by using an
attribute regularization loss which enforces a monotonic relationship between
the attribute values and the latent code of the dimension along which the
attribute is to be encoded. Consequently, post-training, the model can be used
to manipulate the attribute by simply changing the latent code of the
corresponding regularized dimension. The results obtained from several
quantitative and qualitative experiments show that the proposed method leads to
disentangled and interpretable latent spaces that can be used to effectively
manipulate a wide range of data attributes spanning image and symbolic music
domains.

suppressing viral load for people with HIV (PWH), many ART agents may
exacerbate central nervous system (CNS)-related adverse effects including
depression. Therefore, understanding the effects of ART drugs on the CNS
function, especially mental health, can help clinicians personalize medicine
with less adverse effects for PWH and prevent them from discontinuing their ART
to avoid undesirable health outcomes and increased likelihood of HIV
transmission. The emergence of electronic health records offers researchers
unprecedented access to HIV data including individuals' mental health records,
drug prescriptions, and clinical information over time. However, modeling such
data is very challenging due to high-dimensionality of the drug combination
space, the individual heterogeneity, and sparseness of the observed drug
combinations. We develop a Bayesian nonparametric approach to learn drug
combination effect on mental health in PWH adjusting for socio-demographic,
behavioral, and clinical factors. The proposed method is built upon the
subset-tree kernel method that represents drug combinations in a way that
synthesizes known regimen structure into a single mathematical representation.
It also utilizes a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process to cluster
heterogeneous population while taking into account individuals' treatment
histories. We evaluate the proposed approach through simulation studies, and
apply the method to a dataset from the Women's Interagency HIV Study, yielding
interpretable and promising results. Our method has clinical utility in guiding
clinicians to prescribe more informed and effective personalized treatment

sensory modalities, like sight, sound and touch, the brain arrives at the same
concepts (convergence). Moreover, biological observations show that one
modality can activate the internal representation of another modality when both
are correlated (divergence). In this work, we propose the Reentrant
Self-Organizing Map (ReSOM), a brain-inspired neural system based on the
reentry theory using Self-Organizing Maps and Hebbian-like learning. We propose
and compare different computational methods for unsupervised learning and
inference, then quantify the gain of the ReSOM in a multimodal classification
task. The divergence mechanism is used to label one modality based on the
other, while the convergence mechanism is used to improve the overall accuracy
of the system. We perform our experiments on a constructed written/spoken

implemented on a cellular neuromorphic architecture that enables distributed

neural networks (DCNNs) for no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA).
Despite of the notable success achieved, there is a broad consensus that
training DCNNs heavily relies on massive annotated data. Unfortunately, IQA is
a typical small sample problem. Therefore, most of the existing DCNN-based IQA
metrics operate based on pre-trained networks. However, these pre-trained
networks are not designed for IQA task, leading to generalization problem when
evaluating different types of distortions. With this motivation, this paper
presents a no-reference IQA metric based on deep meta-learning. The underlying
idea is to learn the meta-knowledge shared by human when evaluating the quality
of images with various distortions, which can then be adapted to unknown
distortions easily. Specifically, we first collect a number of NR-IQA tasks for
different distortions. Then meta-learning is adopted to learn the prior
knowledge shared by diversified distortions. Finally, the quality prior model
is fine-tuned on a target NR-IQA task for quickly obtaining the quality model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed metric outperforms the
state-of-the-arts by a large margin. Furthermore, the meta-model learned from
synthetic distortions can also be easily generalized to authentic distortions,
which is highly desired in real-world applications of IQA metrics.

  In this paper, we describe a set-based framework that successfully deals with
real-world CNNs, such as VGG16 and VGG19, that have high accuracy on ImageNet.
Our approach is based on a new set representation called the ImageStar, which
enables efficient exact and over-approximative analysis of CNNs. ImageStars
perform efficient set-based analysis by combining operations on concrete images

spin energy from a black hole results in the steeply declining X-ray flux when
the magnetar collapses into a black hole (BH). A fraction of the envelope

produces the X-ray rebrightening bump at late times. During this process, a
centrifugally driven baryon-rich quasi-isotropic Blandford \& Payne outflow
from the revived accretion disk deposits its kinetic energy on the SN ejecta,
which powers luminous SN 2011kl. Finally, we place a limitation on the

power and drains the battery faster. Further, DRAM scaling trends make further
growth of DRAMin the mobile space prohibitive due to cost. Emerging
non-volatile memory (NVM) has the potential to alleviate these issues due to
its higher capacity per cost than DRAM and mini-mal static power. Recently, a
wide spectrum of NVM technologies, including phase-change memories (PCM),
memristor, and 3D XPoint have emerged. Despite the mentioned advantages, NVM
has longer access latency compared to DRAMand NVM writes can incur higher
latencies and wear costs. Therefore integration of these new memory

Network (DMNet), which is inspired from the observation that the object density
map of an image presents how objects distribute in terms of the pixel intensity
of the map. As pixel intensity varies, it is able to tell whether a region has
objects or not, which in turn provides guidance for cropping images
statistically. DMNet has three key components: a density map generation module,
an image cropping module and an object detector. DMNet generates a density map

propose pFSCK, a tool that redesigns C/R to enable fine-grained parallelism at
the granularity of inodes without impacting the correctness of C/R's

identifying functional operations in each stage of the checker and isolating
dependent operation and their shared data structures. However, fully isolating
shared structures is infeasible, consequently requiring serialization that
limits scalability. To reduce the impact of synchronization bottlenecks and
exploit CPU parallelism, pFSCK designs pipeline parallelism allowing multiple
stages of C/R to run simultaneously without impacting correctness. To realize
efficient pipeline parallelism for different file system data configurations,
pFSCK provides techniques for ordering updates to global data structures,
efficient per-thread I/O cache management, and dynamic thread placement across
different passes of a C/R. Finally, pFSCK designs a resource-aware scheduler

considerable research attention because it can be linked to specific
protein-protein interactions. An extensive study of the drying evolution and
the final crack patterns are presented, highlighting the concentration
dependence (from 1 to 13 wt%) on two globular proteins, lysozyme (Lys) and
bovine serum albumin (BSA), in de-ionized water. The drying evolution starts
with a constant contact radius mode and shifts to a mixed mode where both fluid
front and contact angle changes. The contact angle monotonically decreases,
whereas, the fluid front exhibits two regimes: an initial linear regime and a
later nonlinear regime. Unlike the linear regime, the non-linear regime is
faster for Lys droplets. This results in the formation of a ""mound""-like
structure in the central region. A new feature, a ""dimple"" is observed in this
mound which is found to be dependent on the initial concentration. The
different crack morphology of BSA and Lys depends strongly on the initial state
of the solution and can be interpreted using a simple mechanical model. In
fact, when dried under uniform conditions (surface, humidity, temperature,

incrementally estimate the parameters from coarse to fine. First, the extrinsic
rotation, gyroscope bias, and time offset are estimated by minimizing the
rotation difference between the camera and IMU. Second, the metric scale,
gravity, and extrinsic translation are approximately estimated by using the
compensated camera poses and ignoring the accelerometer bias. Third, these

gravitational magnitude. For further optimizing the system states, a nonlinear
optimization algorithm, which considers the time offset, is introduced for

category-specifically discriminative descriptor when the visual features
extracted from support images are marginalized in embedding space. To address
this issue, this paper presents an adaptive tuning framework, in which the

adjusted based on a self-segmentation scheme, augmenting category-specific

inner-loop is firstly devised as the base learner to extract the underlying
semantic features from the support image. Then, gradient maps are calculated by
back-propagating self-supervised loss through the obtained features, and
leveraged as guidance for augmenting the corresponding elements in embedding

an optimization-based meta-learner is adopted as outer loop of our proposed
framework to gradually refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments
on benchmark PASCAL-$5^{i}$ and COCO-$20^{i}$ datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art.

fluid dynamics (CFD) problem, the conventional, exact Bayesian approach such as
Markov chain Monte Carlo is intractable. To this end, the ensemble-based
Bayesian methods have been used for CFD applications. However, their
applicability for UQ has not been fully analyzed and understood thus far. Here,
we evaluate the performance of three widely used iterative ensemble-based data
assimilation methods, namely ensemble Kalman filter, ensemble randomized
maximum likelihood method, and ensemble Kalman filter with multiple data
assimilation for UQ problems. We present the derivations of the three ensemble
methods from an optimization viewpoint. Further, a scalar case is used to
demonstrate the performance of the three different approaches with emphasis on
the effects of small ensemble sizes. Finally, we assess the three ensemble
methods for quantifying uncertainties in steady-state CFD problems involving
turbulent mean flows. Specifically, the Reynolds averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS)
equation is considered the forward model, and the uncertainties in the
propagated velocity are quantified and reduced by incorporating observation
data. The results show that the ensemble methods cannot accurately capture the
true posterior distribution, but they can provide a good estimation of the
uncertainties even when very limited ensemble sizes are used. Based on the
overall performance and efficiency from the comparison, the ensemble randomized
maximum likelihood method is identified as the best choice of approximate

propose a point-wise tooth localization neural network by introducing a spatial

point regression for all the anatomical teeth (i.e., 32 points), which
automatically identifies each tooth. A novel distance regularization penalty is
employed on the 32 points by considering $L_2$ regularization loss of Laplacian
on spatial distances. Subsequently, teeth boxes are individually localized
using a cascaded neural network on a patch basis. A multitask offset training
is employed on the final output to improve the localization accuracy. Our
method successfully localizes not only the existing teeth but also missing
teeth; consequently, highly accurate detection and identification are achieved.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches by increasing the average precision of teeth
detection by 15.71% compared to the best performing method. The accuracy of
identification achieved a precision of 0.997 and recall value of 0.972.
Moreover, the proposed network does not require any additional identification

studies mainly focused on monofractal networks, while complex systems are of
multifractal structure. This paper is devoted to exploring the general
regularities of multifractal scaling processes in the street network of 12
Chinese cities. The city clustering algorithm is employed to identify urban
boundaries for defining comparable study areas; box-counting method and the
direct determination method are utilized to extract spatial data; the least
squares calculation is employed to estimate the global and local multifractal
parameters. The results showed multifractal structure of urban street networks.
The global multifractal dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped curves, while
the local singularity spectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves. If the moment
order q approaches negative infinity, the generalized correlation dimension
will seriously exceed the embedding space dimension 2, and the local fractal
dimension curve displays an abnormal decrease for most cities. The scaling
relation of local fractal dimension gradually breaks if the q value is too
high, but the different levels of the network always keep the scaling
reflecting singularity exponent. The main conclusions are as follows. First,
urban street networks follow multifractal scaling law, and scaling precedes
local fractal structure. Second, the patterns of traffic networks take on
characteristics of spatial concentration, but they also show the implied trend
of spatial deconcentration. Third, the development space of central area and
network intensive areas is limited, while the fringe zone and network sparse
areas show the phenomenon of disordered evolution. This work may be revealing
for understanding and further research on complex spatial networks by using

marketing in online social networks, which balances between the cost and the
profit from influence spread. We extend PM to that under the general marketing
strategy, and form continuous profit maximization (CPM-MS) problem, whose
domain is on integer lattices. The objective function of our CPM-MS is
dr-submodular, but non-monotone. It is a typical case of unconstrained
dr-submodular maximization (UDSM) problem, and take it as a starting point, we
study UDSM systematically in this paper, which is very different from those
existing researcher. First, we introduce the lattice-based double greedy
algorithm, which can obtain a constant approximation guarantee. However, there
is a strict and unrealistic condition that requiring the objective value is
non-negative on the whole domain, or else no theoretical bounds. Thus, we
propose a technique, called lattice-based iterative pruning. It can shrink the
search space effectively, thereby greatly increasing the possibility of
satisfying the non-negative objective function on this smaller domain without
losing approximation ratio. Then, to overcome the difficulty to estimate the
objective value of CPM-MS, we adopt reverse sampling strategies, and combine it
with lattice-based double greedy, including pruning, without losing its
performance but reducing its running time. The entire process can be considered
as a general framework to solve the UDSM problem, especially for applying to
social networks. Finally, we conduct experiments on several real datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

equation of state (EoS) dependence of the directed and the elliptic flow of

It is found that the directed flow depends strongly on the optical potential at
high energies,$\sqrt{s_{NN}} > 3 $ GeV, where no information is available
experimentally. The correlation between effective mass at saturation density
and the optical potential is found: smaller values of effective mass require
smaller strengths of the optical potential to describe the directed flow
data.This correlation can also be seen in the beam energy dependence of the
elliptic flow at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}>3$ GeV, although its effect is rather weak. On
the other hand, stiff EoS is required to describe the elliptic flow at lower
energies.Experimental constraints on the optical potential from $pA$ collisions
will provide important information on the EoS at high energies.The proton
directed and the elliptic flow are well described in the RQMD.RMF model from
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.3$ to 8.8 GeV. In contrast,to reproduce the collapse of the
directed flow above 10 GeV, pressure has to be reduced, which indicates a
softening of the EoS around $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =10 $ GeV.

  Categories in An Open World",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering new classes in unlabeled
visual data given labeled data from disjoint classes. Existing methods
typically first pre-train a model with labeled data, and then identify new
classes in unlabeled data via unsupervised clustering. However, the labeled
data that provide essential knowledge are often underexplored in the second
step. The challenge is that the labeled and unlabeled examples are from
non-overlapping classes, which makes it difficult to build the learning
relationship between them. In this work, we introduce OpenMix to mix the
unlabeled examples from an open set and the labeled examples from known
classes, where their non-overlapping labels and pseudo-labels are
simultaneously mixed into a joint label distribution. OpenMix dynamically
compounds examples in two ways. First, we produce mixed training images by
incorporating labeled examples with unlabeled examples. With the benefits of
unique prior knowledge in novel class discovery, the generated pseudo-labels
will be more credible than the original unlabeled predictions. As a result,
OpenMix helps to prevent the model from overfitting on unlabeled samples that
may be assigned with wrong pseudo-labels. Second, the first way encourages the
unlabeled examples with high class-probabilities to have considerable accuracy.
We introduce these examples as reliable anchors and further integrate them with
unlabeled samples. This enables us to generate more combinations in unlabeled
examples and exploit finer object relations among the new classes. Experiments
on three classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
OpenMix, which is superior to state-of-the-art methods in novel class
discovery.

KGC models are usually trained using margin, soft-margin or cross-entropy loss
function that promotes assigning a higher score or probability for true fact
triplets. Minibatch gradient descent is used to optimize these loss functions
for training the KGC models. But, as each minibatch consists of only a few
randomly sampled triplets from a large knowledge graph, any entity that occurs
in a minibatch, occurs only once in most cases. Because of this, these loss
functions ignore all other neighbors of any entity, whose embedding is being
updated at some minibatch step. In this paper, we propose a new random-walk

loss incurred by a minibatch of closely connected subgraph of triplets instead

current methods still suffer from a) imprecise object-level depth inference and
b) uncertain scale factor. The former problem would cause texture copy or
provide inaccurate object boundary, and the latter would require current
methods to have an additional sensor like LiDAR to provide depth ground-truth
or stereo camera as additional training inputs, which makes them difficult to
implement. In this work, we propose to address these two problems together by
introducing DNet. Our contributions are twofold: a) a novel dense connected
prediction (DCP) layer is proposed to provide better object-level depth
estimation and b) specifically for autonomous driving scenarios, dense
geometrical constrains (DGC) is introduced so that precise scale factor can be
recovered without additional cost for autonomous vehicles. Extensive
experiments have been conducted and, both DCP layer and DGC module are proved
to be effectively solving the aforementioned problems respectively. Thanks to
DCP layer, object boundary can now be better distinguished in the depth map and
the depth is more continues on object level. It is also demonstrated that the
performance of using DGC to perform scale recovery is comparable to that using
ground-truth information, when the camera height is given and the ground point
takes up more than 1.03\% of the pixels. Code is available at

white dwarf stars in interacting binary systems (Bode & Evans 2008). It has
long been thought that the luminosity of classical novae is powered by
continued nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf after the initial
runaway (Gallaher & Starrfield 1978). However, recent observations of GeV
$\gamma$-rays from classical novae have hinted that shocks internal to the nova
ejecta may dominate the nova emission. Shocks have also been suggested to power
the luminosity of events as diverse as stellar mergers (Metzger & Pejcha 2017),
supernovae (Moriya et al. 2018), and tidal disruption events (Roth et al.
2016), but observational confirmation has been lacking. Here we report
simultaneous space-based optical and $\gamma$-ray observations of the 2018 nova
V906 Carinae (ASASSN-18fv), revealing a remarkable series of distinct
correlated flares in both bands. The optical and $\gamma$-ray flares occur
simultaneously, implying a common origin in shocks. During the flares, the nova
luminosity doubles, implying that the bulk of the luminosity is shock-powered.
Furthermore, we detect concurrent but weak X-ray emission from deeply embedded
shocks, confirming that the shock power does not appear in the X-ray band and
supporting its emergence at longer wavelengths. Our data, spanning the spectrum
from radio to $\gamma$-ray, provide direct evidence that shocks can power
substantial luminosity in classical novae and other optical transients.

interpolative factorization offers an efficient and accurate approximate
inverse of the linear system. As a result, the preconditioned conjugate
gradient iteration converges in a small number of iterations. Compared to other
classical exact and approximate factorizations such as Cholesky or incomplete
Cholesky, the hierarchical interpolative factorization can be computed in
linear time and the application of its inverse has linear complexity. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the performance of the method and the reduction of
conjugate gradient iterations.

a proxy objective, such as the negative log likelihood of language modeling. In
this work, we introduce a learning algorithm which directly optimizes model's
ability to learn text representations for effective learning of downstream

pre-training and model-agnostic meta-learning with a sequence of meta-train
steps. The standard multi-task learning objective adopted in BERT is a special
case of our learning algorithm where the depth of meta-train is zero. We study
the problem in two settings: unsupervised pre-training and supervised
pre-training with different pre-training objects to verify the generality of
our approach.Experimental results show that our algorithm brings improvements

prior knowledge about the object. Therefore, we resort to the idea of object
co-skeletonization, hoping that the commonness prior that exists across the

co-segmentation. We observe that the skeleton can provide good scribbles for
segmentation, and skeletonization, in turn, needs good segmentation. Therefore,
we propose a coupled framework for co-skeletonization and co-segmentation tasks

synergistically. Since it is a new problem, we also construct a benchmark

neural network based regression approach, trained on image-level (weak) labels
indicating volume.
  In this article, we compared networks optimized with weak and strong labels,
and study their ability to generalize to other datasets. We experimented with
white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume prediction in brain MRI scans. Neural
networks were trained on a large local dataset and their performance was
evaluated on four independent public datasets. We showed that networks
optimized using only weak labels reflecting WMH volume generalized better for
WMH volume prediction than networks optimized with voxel-wise segmentations of
WMH. The attention maps of networks trained with weak labels did not seem to
delineate WMHs, but highlighted instead areas with smooth contours around or
near WMHs. By correcting for possible confounders we showed that networks
trained on weak labels may have learnt other meaningful features that are more
suited to generalization to unseen data. Our results suggest that for imaging
biomarkers that can be derived from segmentations, training networks to predict
the biomarker directly may provide more robust results than solving an

derive the general dispersion relation for magneto-acoustic waves in a magnetic
slab of homogeneous plasma, which was enclosed in an asymmetric magnetic
environment. In the present study, we focus on the analysis of wave propagation
in various limiting cases applicable to solar and space plasma or astrophysics.
The thin- and wide-slab approximations, as well as the limits of low and high
plasma-beta values are considered. Utilising the fact that in a weakly
asymmetric slab, the dispersion relation can be decoupled, the behaviour of
quasi-sausage and quasi-kink modes is studied in further analytical and
numerical detail, and their avoided crossings are described. The results
highlight how the asymmetry influences the wave properties, e.g. the phase
speed of eigenmodes, depending on the ratios of external-to-internal densities
and magnetic fields on the two sides. Notably, the phase speeds of surface
modes will converge to different values for quasi-sausage and quasi-kink modes
in the wide-slab limit, and cut-off frequencies are introduced with respect to
both surface and body modes, in thin as well as wide slabs, beyond which the
solutions become leaky. These obtained properties of MHD wave behaviour could
be measured with suitable high-resolution instruments in the future.

simultaneously implies the crucial role of online user influence in determining
content popularity. In particular, understanding behavior variations between
the influential elites and the mass grassroots is an important issue in
communication. However, how their behavior varies across user categories and
content domains, and how these differences influence content popularity are
rarely addressed. From a novel view of seven content-domains, a detailed
picture of behavior variations among five user groups, from both views of
elites and mass, is drawn in Weibo, one of the most popular Twitter-like
services in China. Interestingly, elites post more diverse contents with video
links while the mass possess retweeters of higher loyalty. According to these
variations, user-oriented actions of enhancing content popularity are discussed
and testified. The most surprising finding is that the diversity of contents do
not always bring more retweets, and the mass and elites should promote content
popularity by increasing their retweeter counts and loyalty, respectively. Our
results for the first time demonstrate the possibility of highly individualized
strategies of popularity promotions in social media, instead of a universal

answers of human annotators. In contrast, we analyze the difficulty of visual
questions based on the behavior of multiple different VQA models. We propose to
cluster the entropy values of the predicted answer distributions obtained by
three different models: a baseline method that takes as input images and
questions, and two variants that take as input images only and questions only.
We use a simple k-means to cluster the visual questions of the VQA v2
validation set. Then we use state-of-the-art methods to determine the accuracy
and the entropy of the answer distributions for each cluster. A benefit of the
proposed method is that no annotation of the difficulty is required, because
the accuracy of each cluster reflects the difficulty of visual questions that
belong to it. Our approach can identify clusters of difficult visual questions
that are not answered correctly by state-of-the-art methods. Detailed analysis
on the VQA v2 dataset reveals that 1) all methods show poor performances on the
most difficult cluster (about 10\% accuracy), 2) as the cluster difficulty
increases, the answers predicted by the different methods begin to differ, and
3) the values of cluster entropy are highly correlated with the cluster
accuracy. We show that our approach has the advantage of being able to assess
the difficulty of visual questions without ground-truth (\ie, the test set of
VQA v2) by assigning them to one of the clusters. We expect that this can
stimulate the development of novel directions of research and new algorithms.

have recently been proposed, aimed specifically at wireless sensor networks.
The schemes enable any subset of a predefined set of sensor nodes to establish
a shared secret key without any communications overhead. It is claimed that
these schemes are both secure and lightweight, i.e. making them particularly
appropriate for network scenarios where nodes have limited computational and
storage capabilities. Further papers have built on these schemes, e.g. to
propose secure routing protocols for wireless sensor networks. Unfortunately,
as we show in this paper, all three schemes are completely insecure; whilst the
details of their operation varies, they share common weaknesses. In every case
we show that an attacker equipped with the information built into at most two
sensor nodes can compute group keys for all possible groups of which the
attacked nodes are not a member, which breaks a fundamental design objective.
The attacks can also be achieved by an attacker armed with the information from
a single node together with a single group key to which this sensor node is not
entitled. Repairing the schemes appears difficult, if not impossible. The
existence of major flaws is not surprising given the complete absence of any
rigorous proofs of security for the proposed schemes. A further recent paper
proposes a group membership authentication and key establishment scheme based
on one of the three key pre-distribution schemes analysed here; as we
demonstrate, this scheme is also insecure, as the attack we describe on the
corresponding pre-distribution scheme enables the authentication process to be
compromised.

accretes during repeated and large bursts of accretion. Since outbursts on

outbursts requires converting this change in flux to a change in total
luminosity. The Class I young stellar object EC 53 in the Serpens Main cloud
has undergone repeated increases in brightness at 850 $\mu$m that are likely
caused by bursts of accretion. In this study, we perform two- and
three-dimensional continuum radiative transfer modeling to quantify the
internal luminosity rise in EC 53 that corresponds to the factor of $\sim$1.5
enhancement in flux at 850 $\mu$m. We model the spectral energy distribution
and radial intensity profile in both the quiescent and outburst phases. The
internal luminosity in the outburst phase is $\sim 3.3$ times brighter than the
luminosity in the quiescent phase. The radial intensity profile analysis
demonstrates that the detected sub-mm flux variation of EC 53 comes from the
heated envelope by the accretion burst. We also find that the role of external
heating of the EC 53 envelope by the interstellar radiation field is
insignificant.

members. The calculator uses seven different emission factors and methods
differing by up to a factor of ~5 for the same flying distance. The observed
differences illustrate the lack of standards and regulations for computing the
footprint of flight travels and are explained primarily, though partly, by
different accountings of non-CO2 effects. The calculator enables us to compute
the travel footprint of a large set of travels and can help identify a meeting
place that minimizes the overall travel footprint for a large set of possible
city hosts, e.g. cities with large airports. The calculator also includes the
option for a minimum distance above which flying is considered the most
suitable transport option ; below that chosen distance, the emission of train
journeys are considered. To demonstrate its full capabilities, the calculator
is first run on one of the largest scientific meetings; the fall meeting of the

would minimize the travel footprint. Then the travel footprint of X-IFU is

role in the formation and evolution of filaments that host star formation.
However, the properties of filaments that interact with H regions are still
poorly known. To investigate the impact of HII regions on the formation of
filaments, we imaged the Galactic HII region RCW 120 and its surroundings where
active star formation takes place and where the role of ionization feedback on
the star formation process has already been studied. We used the ArT\'eMiS
camera on the APEX telescope and combined the ArT\'eMiS data at 350 and 450
microns with Herschel-SPIRE/HOBYS. We studied the dense gas distribution around
RCW 120 with a resolution of 8 arcsec (0.05 pc at a distance of 1.34 kpc). Our
study allows us to trace the median radial intensity profile of the dense shell
of RCW 120. This profile is asymmetric, indicating a clear compression from the
HII region on the inner part of the shell. The profile is observed to be
similarly asymmetric on both lateral sides of the shell, indicating a
homogeneous compression over the surface. On the contrary, the profile analysis
of a radial filament associated with the shell, but located outside of it,
reveals a symmetric profile, suggesting that the compression from the ionized
region is limited to the dense shell. The mean intensity profile of the
internal part of the shell is well fitted by a Plummer like profile with a
deconvolved Gaussian FWHM of 0.09 pc, as observed for filaments in low-mass
star-forming regions. This study suggests that compression exerted by HII
regions may play a key role in the formation of filaments and may further act
on their hosted star formation. ArT\'eMiS data also suggest that RCW 120 might
be a 3D ring, rather than a spherical structure

research community as well as industry. While the paradigm shift from a game
execution on clients to streaming games from the cloud offers a variety of
benefits, the new services also require a highly reliable and low latency
network to achieve a satisfying Quality of Experience (QoE) for its users.
Using a cloud gaming service with high latency would harm the interaction of
the user with the game, leading to a decrease in playing performance and thus
frustration of players. However, the negative effect of delay on gaming QoE
depends strongly on the game content. At a certain level of delay, a slow-paced
card game is typically not as delay sensitive as a shooting game. For optimal
resource allocation and quality estimation, it is highly important for cloud
providers, game developers, and network planners to consider the impact of the
game content. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the delay
impact on QoE for cloud gaming applications by identifying game characteristics
influencing the delay perception of users. In addition, an expert evaluation
methodology to quantify these characteristics, as well as a delay sensitivity
classification based on a decision tree is presented. The ratings of 14 experts
for the quantification indicated an excellent level of agreement which
demonstrates the reliability of the proposed method. Additionally, the decision

their vapor above a flat hot surface can exhibit symmetry-breaking spontaneous

by these observations, we theoretically investigate the translational and
rotational dynamics of Leidenfrost drops on the basis of a simplified
two-dimensional model, focusing on near-circular drops small relative to the
capillary length. The model couples the equations of motion of the drop, which
flows as a rigid wheel, and thin-film equations governing the vapor flow, the
profile of the deformable vapor-liquid interface and thus the hydrodynamic
forces and torques on the drop. In contrast to previous analytical models of
Leidenfrost drops levitating above a flat surface, which predict only symmetric
solutions, we find that the symmetric Leidenfrost state is unstable above a
critical drop radius: $R_1$ for a free drop and $R_2>R_1$ for an immobilized
drop. In these respective cases, symmetry breaking is manifested in
supercritical-pitchfork bifurcations into steady states of pure rolling and
constant angular velocity. In further qualitative agreement with the
experiments, when a symmetry-broken immobilized drop is suddenly released it
initially moves at an acceleration $\alpha g$, where $\alpha$ is an angle
characterizing the slope of the liquid-vapor profile and $g$ is the
gravitational acceleration; moreover, $\alpha$ exhibits a maximum with respect
to the drop radius, at a radius increasing with the temperature difference
between the surface and the drop.

follow horizontal fluid motions and line-of-sight magnetograms to follow the
flux emergence. Changes in vertical vorticity and horizontal divergence are
used to derive signatures of evolving twists in the magnetic field. Our
analysis reveals that the two polarities of the magnetic flux swirl in opposite
directions in early stages of flux emergence indicating an unwinding of the
pre-emergence twists in the magnetic field. We further find that during the
emergence, there is an increase in swirly motions in the neighbouring
non-magnetic regions. We estimate the magnetic and kinetic energies and find
that magnetic energy is about a factor of ten larger than the kinetic energy.
During the evolution, when the magnetic energy decreases, an increase in the
kinetic energy is observed indicating transfer of energy from the unwinding of
magnetic flux tube to the surrounding fluid motions. Our results thus
demonstrate the presence of pre-emergence twists in emerging magnetic field

fluctuations in source and sky background photon arrivals dominate the noise
budget and are readily estimated. Another component of noise, however, is the
signal from the undetected population of stars and galaxies. Using injection of
artificial galaxies into images, we demonstrate that the measured variance of
galaxy moments (used for weak gravitational lensing measurements) in Dark
Energy Survey (DES) images is significantly in excess of the Poisson
predictions, by up to 30\%, and that the background sky levels are
overestimated by current software. By cross-correlating distinct images of
""empty"" sky regions, we establish that there is a significant image noise
contribution from undetected static sources (US), which on average are mildly
resolved at DES resolution. Treating these US as a stationary noise source, we
compute a correction to the moment covariance matrix expected from Poisson
noise. The corrected covariance matrix matches the moment variances measured on
the injected DES images to within 5\%. Thus we have an empirical method to
statistically account for US in weak lensing measurements, rather than
requiring extremely deep sky simulations. We also find that local sky
determinations can remove the bias in flux measurements, at a small penalty in
additional, but quantifiable, noise.

isolated globular clusters in the Local Group (LG) were observed with the Wide
Field Camera (WFC). The main aims of this survey are to identify the most
evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants at the
end-point of their evolution based on their pulsational instability, use their
distribution over luminosity to reconstruct the star formation history,
quantify the dust production and mass loss from modelling the multi-wavelength
spectral energy distributions, and relate this to luminosity and radius
variations. In this first of a series of papers, we present the methodology of
the variability survey and describe the photometric catalogue of Andromeda I
(And I) dwarf galaxy as an example of the survey, and discuss the identified
long period variable (LPV) stars. We detected 5581 stars and identified 59 LPV
candidates within two half-light radii of the centre of And I. The amplitudes
of these candidates range from 0.2 to 3 mag in the $i$-band. 75 % of detected
sources and 98 % of LPV candidates are detected at mid-infrared wavelengths. We
show evidence for the presence of dust-producing AGB stars in this galaxy
including five extreme AGB (x-AGB) stars, and model some of their spectral
energy distributions. A distance modulus of 24.41 mag for And I was determined

$T^{2n}_{J=T}:=\mathbb{C}^n/2\pi(\mathbb{Z}^n \oplus T\mathbb{Z}^n)$. Here, $T$
is a complex matrix of order $n$ whose imaginary part is positive definite. In
particular, when we consider the case $n=1$, the complexified symplectic form
of a mirror partner of $T^2_{J=T}$ is defined by using $-\frac{1}{T}$ or $T$.
However, if we assume $n \geq 2$ and that $T$ is a singular matrix, we can not
define a mirror partner of $T^{2n}_{J=T}$ as a natural generalization of the
case $n=1$ to the higher dimensional case. In this paper, we propose a way to
avoid this problem, and discuss the homological mirror symmetry.

Exotic magnetic fluctuations with fractional, topological or multipolar

arises from anisotropic exchange interactions that hybridize overlapping modes
carrying fundamentally different quantum numbers. Remarkably, a generalization
of spin-wave theory to local SU(3) degrees of freedom accounts for all details
of the low-energy dynamical response of FeI2 without going beyond quadratic

transfer of atomically thin crystals has been essential for the rapid expansion
of research into van der Waals heterostructures. An inherent issue of these
techniques is the deformation of the polymer carrier film during the transfer,
which can lead to highly non-uniform strain induced in the transferred
two-dimensional material. Here, using a combination of optical spectroscopy,
atomic force and Kelvin probe force microscopy, we show that the presence of
nanometer scale wrinkles formed due to transfer-induced stress relaxation can
lead to strong changes in the optical properties of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$
heterostructures and the emergence of the linearly polarized interlayer exciton
photoluminescence. We attribute these changes to the local breaking of crystal
symmetry in the nanowrinkles, which act as efficient accumulation centers for
the interlayer excitons due to the strain-induced interlayer band gap
reduction. The surface potential images of the rippled heterobilayer samples
acquired using Kelvin probe force microscopy reveal the variation of the local
work function consistent with the strain-induced band gap modulation, while the
potential offset observed at the ridges of the wrinkles shows a clear
correlation with the value of the tensile strain estimated from the wrinkle

mathematical structure that lies at the interface of algebra and statistics.
The starting point is a passage from classical probability theory to quantum
probability theory. The quantum version of a probability distribution is a
density operator, the quantum version of marginalizing is an operation called
the partial trace, and the quantum version of a marginal probability
distribution is a reduced density operator. Every joint probability
distribution on a finite set can be modeled as a rank one density operator. By
applying the partial trace, we obtain reduced density operators whose diagonals
recover classical marginal probabilities. In general, these reduced densities
will have rank higher than one, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors will
contain extra information that encodes subsystem interactions governed by
statistics. We decode this information, and show it is akin to conditional
probability, and then investigate the extent to which the eigenvectors capture
""concepts"" inherent in the original joint distribution. The theory is then
illustrated with an experiment that exploits these ideas. Turning to a more
theoretical application, we also discuss a preliminary framework for modeling
entailment and concept hierarchy in natural language, namely, by representing
expressions in the language as densities. Finally, initial inspiration for this
thesis comes from formal concept analysis, which finds many striking parallels
with the linear algebra. The parallels are not coincidental, and a common
blueprint is found in category theory. We close with an exposition on free
(co)completions and how the free-forgetful adjunctions in which they arise
strongly suggest that in certain categorical contexts, the ""fixed points"" of a
morphism with its adjoint encode interesting information.

perturbative branch consists of complex quasinormal frequencies that
approximate to the quasinormal frequencies of the Schwarzschild AdS black hole
in the limit of a null coupling constant. On the other hand, the
nonperturbative branch consists of purely imaginary frequencies and is
characterized by the growth of the imaginary part when $\alpha$ decreases,
diverging in the limit of null coupling constant, therefore they do not exist

the propagation of scalar fields is stable in this background.

To further improve its practical performance, we incorporate SpiderSQN with
different momentum schemes. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are generalized
to the online setting, and the corresponding SFO complexity of

realm of mathematic are conducted to predict the occurrence of the disease and
to support the eradication process. Basically, the modeling methodology is
predominantly deterministic and differential equation based while selecting
clinical and biological features that seem to be important. Yet, if the
individual characteristics matter when modeling the disease, the overall
estimation of the malaria is not done based on the health status of each
individual but in a non-specified percentage of the global population. The goal
of this paper is to propose a model that relies on a daily evolution of the
individual's state, which depends on their mobility and the characteristics of
the area they visit. Thus, the mobility data of a single person moving from one
area to another, gathered thanks to mobile networks, is the essential building
block to predict the outcome of the disease. We implement our solution and
demonstrate its effectiveness through empirical experiments. The results show
how promising the model is in providing possible insights into the failure of
the disease control in the Kedougou region.

robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains
dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations
to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to
change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous
vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous
algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial
inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates.
This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an
online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The
proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during
execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst-case deviation
in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting
policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state

approach is demonstrated on a Deep Q-Network policy and is shown to increase
robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios
and a classic control task. This work extends one of our prior works with new
performance guarantees, extensions to other RL algorithms, expanded results
aggregated across more scenarios, an extension into scenarios with adversarial

the insufficient data for applying classic time-series approaches, the analysis
builds on the visibility graph algorithm to study the Greek COVID-19
infection-curve as a complex network. By using the modularity optimization
algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided into communities defining
periods of different connectivity in the time-series body. These periods reveal
a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting
with a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern
intermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending
up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek
COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also
illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes,
implying a low probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and
high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average. The
overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel
method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which
allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better

elliptically symmetric distributions competes quite favorably with the QDA
classifier when it is optimal and performs much better when QDA fails under
non-Normal underlying distributions, e.g. Cauchy distribution. However, the
classification rule in GQDA is based on the sample mean vector and the sample
dispersion matrix of a training sample, which are extremely non-robust under

vulnerable to outliers, the lack of robustness of the classical estimators of
the mean vector and the dispersion matrix reduces the efficiency of the GQDA
classifier significantly, increasing the misclassification errors. The present
paper investigates the performance of the GQDA classifier when the classical

applied to these magnitudes yields simple expressions leading to concepts like
displacement current, continuity and gauge or retarded time, with a clear
geometric meaning. As the geometric vector derivative is invertible, we
introduce simple Green's functions and, with this, it is possible to obtain
retarded Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials propagating naturally at the speed of
light. In two dimensions, these magnitudes become more complex, and a magnetic
field B appears as a pseudoscalar which was absent in the one-dimensional

science and engineering. Typically, a dynamical system model is based on some
prior knowledge about the underlying dynamics of interest in which
probabilistic features are used to quantify and propagate uncertainties
associated with the initial conditions, external excitations, etc. From a
probabilistic modeling standing point, two broad classes of methods exist, i.e.
macro-scale methods and micro-scale methods. Classically, macro-scale methods
such as statistical moments-based strategies are usually too coarse to capture
the multi-mode shape or tails of a non-Gaussian distribution. Micro-scale
methods such as random samples-based approaches, on the other hand, become
computationally very challenging in dealing with high-dimensional stochastic
systems. In view of these potential limitations, a meso-scale scheme is
proposed here that utilizes a meso-scale statistical structure to describe the
dynamical evolution from a probabilistic perspective. The significance of this
statistical structure is two-fold. First, it can be tailored to any arbitrary
random space. Second, it not only maintains the probability evolution around
sample trajectories but also requires fewer meso-scale components than the
micro-scale samples. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed meso-scale
scheme, a set of examples of increasing complexity are provided. Connections to
the benchmark stochastic models as conservative and Markov models along with
practical implementation guidelines are presented.

social concepts such as social practices, norms and conventions to model the
way the interactions between the agents are regulated. However, in the
literature most papers concentrate on only one of these aspects at the time.
Therefore there is hardly any research on how these social concepts relate and
when each of them emerges or evolves from another concept. In this paper we
will investigate some of the relations between these concepts and also whether
they are fundamentally stemming from a single social object or should be seen
as different types of objects altogether.

  (Iguana iguana)",,,,,"q-bio.TO","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In reptiles, especially during their early stage of life when reared under
captive conditions, nutritional deficiencies are the most common problems
reported in them affecting the spinal cord and the musculoskeletal system. More
often green iguanas and snakes are very much vulnerable to it. Case
description: A three and a half months old green iguana (Iguana iguana) was
brought to the Avian and Exotic Pet Unit, Madras Veterinary College with the
history of dragging hind limbs and not passed faeces for the past four days.
Findings, treatment and outcome: On examination of hind limbs, it was found
that perching reflex was absent and the abdomen was distended. It was
tentatively diagnosed for hind limb paralysis but the radiological examination
revealed that the iguana was suffering from Sacro-coccygeal compression. The
condition could have been aggravated due to poor nutritional management also.
In order to reduce the pain, the iguana was treated with Meloxicam orally @ 0.1
mg/kg for a week. In addition, it was successfully treated orally with
multivitamin syrup and calcium syrup simultaneously for a month. The iguana was
subjected to infrared therapy of 3 minutes for a period of one week. The
reptile showed complete recovery without dragging its hind limb after 2 months.
Conclusion: It could be concluded that prompt intervention and dietary
management may be necessary for musculo-skeletal disorders in Iguana. .

  Network Infrastructure","2020 SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the major restrictions on the practical applications of unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAV) is their incomplete self-sufficiency, which makes
continuous operations infeasible without human oversights. The more oversight
UAVs require, the less likely they are going to be commercially advantageous
when compared to their alternatives. As an autonomous system, how much human
interaction is needed to function is one of the best indicators evaluating the
limitations and inefficiencies of the UAVs. Popular UAV related research areas,
such as path planning and computer vision, have enabled substantial advances in
the ability of drones to act on their own. This research is dedicated to
in-flight operations, in which there is not much reported effort to tackle the
problem from the aspect of the supportive infrastructure. In this paper, an
Autonomous Service network infrastructure (AutoServe) is proposed. Aiming at
increasing the future autonomy of UAVs, the AutoServe system includes a
service-oriented landing platform and a customized communication protocol. This
supportive AutoServe infrastructure will autonomize many tasks currently done
manually by human operators, such as battery replacement. A proof-of-concept
prototype has been built and the simulation experimental study validated the
design.

training shared machine learning models in a distributed manner while
respecting data privacy. However, implementing FL in wireless networks may
significantly reduce the lifetime of energy-constrained mobile devices due to
their involvement in the construction of the shared learning models. To handle
this issue, we propose a novel approach at the physical layer based on the
application of lightwave power transfer in the FL-based wireless network and a
resource allocation scheme to manage the network's power efficiency. Hence, we
formulate the corresponding optimization problem and then propose a method to
obtain the optimal solution. Numerical results reveal that, the proposed scheme
can provide sufficient energy to a mobile device for performing FL tasks
without using any power from its own battery. Hence, the proposed approach can
support the FL-based wireless network to overcome the issue of limited energy
in mobile devices.

data growth rate. Data are amalgamated to generate revenue, which results a
large data silo. Data are the oils of modern IT industries. Therefore, the data
are growing at an exponential pace. The access mechanism of these data silos
are defined by metadata. The metadata are decoupled from data server for
various beneficial reasons. For instance, ease of maintenance. The metadata are
stored in metadata server (MDS). Therefore, the study on the MDS is mandatory
in designing of a large scale storage system. The MDS requires many parameters
to augment with its architecture. The architecture of MDS depends on the demand
of the storage system's requirements. Thus, MDS is categorized in various ways
depending on the underlying architecture and design methodology. The article
surveys on the various kinds of MDS architecture, designs, and methodologies.
This article emphasizes on clustered MDS (cMDS) and the reports are prepared
based on a) Bloom filter$-$based MDS, b) Client$-$funded MDS, c) Geo$-$aware
MDS, d) Cache$-$aware MDS, e) Load$-$aware MDS, f) Hash$-$based MDS, and g)

the quality of meat. We find that intramuscular fat (IMF) absorbs infrared
light about nine times stronger than muscle, which enables us to estimate fat
content in intact meat samples. The method is made very efficient by extracting
relevant information from the three-dimensional high-resolution images
generated by OCT using principal component analysis (PCA). The principal
components are then used as regressors into a support vector regression (SVR)
prediction model. The SVR model is found to predict IMF content stably and
accurately, with an R^2 value of 0.94. Our study paves the way for automated,
contact-less, non-destructive, real time classification of the quality of meat
samples.

areal capacitance relies on the use of elevated mass loadings of highly porous
active materials. Herein, we demonstrate a high-throughput manufacturing of
graphene/nanotubes hybrid EDLCs. Wet-jet milling (WJM) method is exploited to
exfoliate the graphite into single/few-layer graphene flakes (WJM-G) in
industrial volume (production rate ~0.5 kg/day). Commercial single/double
walled carbon nanotubes (SDWCNTs) are mixed with graphene flakes in order to
act as spacers between the graphene flakes during their film formation. The
latter is obtained by one-step vacuum filtration, resulting in self-standing,
metal- and binder-free flexible EDLC electrodes with high active material mass
loadings up to 30 mg cm-2. The corresponding symmetric WJM-G/SDWCNTs EDLCs
exhibit electrode energy densities of 539 uWh cm-2 at 1.3 mW cm-2 and operating
power densities up to 532 mW cm-2 (outperforming most of the EDLC
technologies). The EDCLs show excellent cycling stability and outstanding
flexibility even under highly folded states (up to 180 degrees). The
combination of industrial-like production of active materials, simplified
manufacturing of EDLC electrodes, and ultrahigh areal performance of the
as-produced EDLCs are promising for novel advanced EDLC designs.
