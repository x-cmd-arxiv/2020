attention recently because of its connections with the theory of D-modules. In
this work we are interested on divisors of expected Jacobian type, that is,
divisors whose gradient ideal is of linear type and the relation type of its
Jacobian ideal coincides with the reduction number with respect to the gradient
ideal plus one. We provide conditions in order to be able to describe precisely
the equations of the Rees algebra of the Jacobian ideal. We also relate the
relation type of the Jacobian ideal to some D-module theoretic invariant given
by the degree of the Kashiwara operator.

physically proximate and accidental daily human contacts in a city, and
simulate outcomes for two kinds of agents - poor and non-poor. Under
non-intervention, peak caseload is maximised, but no differences are observed
in infection rates across poor and non-poor. Introducing interventions to
control spread, peak caseloads are reduced, but both cumulative infection rates
and current infection rates are systematically higher for the poor than for
non-poor, across all scenarios. Larger populations, higher fractions of poor,
and longer durations of intervention are found to progressively worsen outcomes
for the poor; and these are of particular concern for economically vulnerable
populations in cities of the developing world. Addressing these challenges
requires a deeper, more rigorous understanding of the relationships between
structural poverty and epidemy, as well as effective utilization of extant

improving iniquitous outcomes for the poor creates better outcomes for the

Under an additional assumption of energy equality, we also derive a lower bound
if the energy rate given by the random force dominates the deterministic
behavior of the flow in the sense that $G^2 > 2 F U$, where $F$ is the

performance for prohibited items detection in X-ray images. In the literature,
there have been rare studies and datasets touching this important topic. In
this work, we contribute the first high-quality object detection dataset for
security inspection, named Occluded Prohibited Items X-ray (OPIXray) image
benchmark. OPIXray focused on the widely-occurred prohibited item ""cutter"",
annotated manually by professional inspectors from the international airport.
The test set is further divided into three occlusion levels to better
understand the performance of detectors. Furthermore, to deal with the
occlusion in X-ray images detection, we propose the De-occlusion Attention
Module (DOAM), a plug-and-play module that can be easily inserted into and thus
promote most popular detectors. Despite the heavy occlusion in X-ray imaging,
shape appearance of objects can be preserved well, and meanwhile different
materials visually appear with different colors and textures. Motivated by
these observations, our DOAM simultaneously leverages the different appearance
information of the prohibited item to generate the attention map, which helps
refine feature maps for the general detectors. We comprehensively evaluate our
module on the OPIXray dataset, and demonstrate that our module can consistently
improve the performance of the state-of-the-art detection methods such as SSD,
FCOS, etc, and significantly outperforms several widely-used attention
mechanisms. In particular, the advantages of DOAM are more significant in the
scenarios with higher levels of occlusion, which demonstrates its potential
application in real-world inspections. The OPIXray benchmark and our model are

spontaneous TC genesis requires either radiative or surface-flux feedbacks. To
test this hypothesis, we perform mechanism-denial experiments, in which we
switch off both feedback processes in numerical simulations. We find that TCs
can self-emerge even without radiative and surface-flux feedbacks. Although
these feedbacks accelerate the genesis and impact the size of the TCs, TCs in
the experiments without them can reach similar intensities as those in the
control experiment. We show that TC genesis is associated with an increase in
the Available Potential Energy (APE); and that convective heating dominates the
APE production. Our result suggests that spontaneous TC genesis may result from
a cooperative interaction between convection and circulation, and that
radiative and surface-flux feedbacks accelerate the process. Furthermore, we
find that increasing the planetary rotation favors spontaneous TC genesis.

declarative languages and reasoning algorithms well support representing and
reasoning with commonsense knowledge. But these algorithms are not good at
planning actions toward maximizing cumulative reward over a long, unspecified

planning to achieve long-term goals under uncertainty. But they are
ill-equipped to represent or reason about knowledge that is not directly
related to actions.

problems are decomposed into two interdependent (smaller) subproblems that
focus on reasoning to ""understand the world"" and planning to ""achieve the goal""

about entities of interest and their associated aspects. Aspect-Based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) aims to automatically compute the sentiment towards these
aspects from opinionated text. In this paper we extend the state-of-the-art
Hybrid Approach for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (HAABSA) method in two
directions. First we replace the non-contextual word embeddings with deep
contextual word embeddings in order to better cope with the word semantics in a
given text. Second, we use hierarchical attention by adding an extra attention
layer to the HAABSA high-level representations in order to increase the method
flexibility in modeling the input data. Using two standard datasets (SemEval
2015 and SemEval 2016) we show that the proposed extensions improve the
accuracy of the built model for ABSA.

two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) that are clean enough to probe exotic
interaction-driven phenomena. In heterostructures it is common practice to
utilize modulation doping, where the ionized dopants are physically separated
from the 2DES channel. The doping-well structure augments modulation doping by
providing additional screening for all types of charged impurities in the
vicinity of the 2DES, which is necessary to achieve record-breaking samples.
Despite its prevalence in the design of ultra-high-mobility 2DESs, the working
principles of the doping-well structure have not been reported. Here we
elaborate on the mechanics of electron transfer from doping wells to the 2DES,
focusing on GaAs/AlGaAs samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Based on this
understanding we demonstrate how structural parameters in the doping well can
be varied to tune the properties of the 2DES.

novel Truncated CWY (or T-CWY) approach for Stiefel manifold parametrization

as an operational Chow class on the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ of
$n$-pointed genus $g$ curves carrying a degree $d$ line bundle. The method of

ramification cycle with canonical twists on the moduli space of curves
[arXiv:1707.02261, arXiv:1711.10341, arXiv:1708.04471].
  Our main result is a calculation of $\mathsf{DR}^{\mathsf{op}}_{g,A}$ on the
Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ via an appropriate interpretation of
Pixton's formula in the tautological ring. The basic new tool used in the proof
is the theory of double ramification cycles for target varieties
[arXiv:1812.10136]. The formula on the Picard stack is obtained from
[arXiv:1812.10136] for target varieties $\mathbb{CP}^n$ in the limit $n

Abel-Jacobi theory.
  As a consequence of the calculation of $\mathsf{DR}^{\mathsf{op}}_{g,A}$ on
the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$, we prove that the fundamental
classes of the moduli spaces of twisted meromorphic differentials in

conjectured in the appendix to [arXiv:1508.07940] and in [arXiv:1607.08429]).
The comparison result of fundamental classes proven in [arXiv:1909.11981] plays
a crucial role in our argument. We also prove the set of relations in the

a classical algorithm to efficiently sample from the effective subspace of a

exploit graph isomorphism to study the automorphisms of $G$ and arrive at an
algorithm quasi-polynomial in $\lvert V\rvert$ for producing samples from the
effective subspace eigenstates of $H$. Our results rule out exponential
separations between stoquastic AQC and classical computation that arise from
hidden symmetries in $k$-local Hamiltonians. Furthermore, our graph

determined by universal functions which, at high temperature, are governed by
universal virial coefficients $b_n$ that capture the effects of the $n$-body

the imaginary-time evolution operator, using progressively finer temporal
lattice spacings. Implementing these factorizations and automated algebra
codes, we obtain the interaction-induced change $\Delta b_n$ from weak coupling

considering shorter forecast horizons reaching a stationary and often
implausible state quickly. Recent studies show that implicit temporal
representations in the frequency domain are also effective in making
predictions for a predetermined horizon. Our focus lies on learning
spatio-temporal representations autoregressively and hence generation of
plausible future developments over both short and long term. The proposed model
learns high dimensional embeddings for skeletal joints and how to compose a
temporally coherent pose via a decoupled temporal and spatial self-attention
mechanism. Our dual attention concept allows the model to access current and
past information directly and to capture both the structural and the temporal
dependencies explicitly. We show empirically that this effectively learns the
underlying motion dynamics and reduces error accumulation over time observed in
auto-regressive models. Our model is able to make accurate short-term

We implement this observation by developing SynQG, a set of transparent
syntactic rules leveraging universal dependencies, shallow semantic parsing,
lexical resources, and custom rules which transform declarative sentences into
question-answer pairs. We utilize PropBank argument descriptions and VerbNet
state predicates to incorporate shallow semantic content, which helps generate
questions of a descriptive nature and produce inferential and semantically
richer questions than existing systems. In order to improve syntactic fluency
and eliminate grammatically incorrect questions, we employ back-translation
over the output of these syntactic rules. A set of crowd-sourced evaluations
shows that our system can generate a larger number of highly grammatical and
relevant questions than previous QG systems and that back-translation
drastically improves grammaticality at a slight cost of generating irrelevant
questions.

spectral combs that shift independently with temperature to create a spectral
pattern that is unique at every temperature. Following an initial calibration,
the ring temperature can be determined by recognizing the spectral resonance
pattern, and as a consequence the wavelength of every resonance is also known.
Two methods of pattern based temperature retrieval are presented. In the first
method, the ring is locked to a previously determined temperature set-point
defined by the coincidence of only two specific TE and TM cavity modes. Based
on a prior calibration at the set-point, the ring temperature and hence all
resonance wavelengths are then known and the resulting comb can be used as a
wavelength calibration reference. In this configuration, all reference comb
wavelengths have been reproduced within a 5 pm accuracy across an 80 nm range
by using an on-chip micro-heater to tune the ring. For more general photonic
thermometry, a spectral correlation algorithm is developed to recognize a
resonance pattern across a 30 nm wide spectral window and thereby determine
ring temperature continuously to 50 mK accuracy. The correlation method is
extended to simultaneously determine temperature and to identify and correct
for wavelength calibration errors in the interrogating light source. The
temperature and comb wavelength accuracy is limited primarily by the linewidth
of the ring resonances, with accuracy and resolution scaling with the ring

there might be an underlying causal structure which renders these factors

endogenous ones that correspond to causally related concepts in data. We
further analyze the model identifiabitily, showing that the proposed model

Tolerant Network (VDTN) where the network faces communication disruption due to

selfish behavior to preserve their resources like memory, and energy level and
become non-cooperative. In this article, an Honesty based Democratic Scheme
(HBDS) is introduced where vehicles with higher honesty level are elected as
heads -- during the process. Vehicles involved in the process would maximize
their rewards (reputation) through active participation in the network
activities whereas nodes with non-cooperative selfish behavior are punished.
The honesty level of the heads is analyzed using Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves

transmission expansion planning (TEP) formulations uses bus voltage angles as
auxiliary optimization variables to describe Kirchhoff's voltage law. As well
as introducing a large number of auxiliary variables, the angle-based
formulation has the disadvantage that it is not well-suited to considering the
connection of multiple disconnected networks, It is, however, possible to
circumvent these auxiliary variables and reduce the required number of
constraints by expressing Kirchhoff's voltage law directly in terms of the
power flows, based on a cycle decomposition of the network graph. In
computationally challenging benchmarks such as generation capacity expansion
with multi-period LOPF, this equivalent reformulation was shown in previous
work to reduce solving times for LOPF problems by an order of magnitude.
Allowing line capacity to be co-optimized in a discrete TEP problem makes it a
non-convex mixed-integer problem. This paper develops a novel cycle-based
reformulation for the TEP problem with LOPF and compares it to the standard
angle-based formulation. The combinatorics of the connection of multiple
disconnected networks is formalized for both formulations, a topic which has
not received attention in the literature. The cycle-based formulation is shown
to conveniently accommodate synchronization options. Since both formulations
use the big-$M$ disjunctive relaxation, useful derivations for suitable big-$M$
values are provided. The competing formulations are benchmarked on a realistic
generation and transmission expansion model of the European transmission system
at varying spatial and temporal resolutions. The cycle-based formulation solves
up to 31 times faster for particular cases, while averaging at a speed-up of
factor 4.

  In this paper, we prove that for any desirably small $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$,
every graph $G$ has a subgraph $Q$ that guarantees a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximation and has maximum degree only $O_{\epsilon, p}(1)$.
That is, the maximum degree of $Q$ depends only on $\epsilon$ and $p$ (both of

and interaction of arbitrary distributions of cracks and voids with evolving

motion' for crack-tips, primarily as a kinematical consequence coupled with
thermodynamics. Fundamental kinematics endows the crack-tip with a topological
charge. This allows the association of a kinematical conservation law for the
charge, resulting in a fundamental evolution equation for the crack-tip field,
and in turn the crack field. The vectorial crack field degrades the elastic
modulus in a physically justified anisotropic manner. The mathematical
structure of this conservation law allows an additive 'free' gradient of a
scalar field in the evolution of the crack field. We associate this naturally
emerging scalar field with the porosity that arises in the modeling of ductile
failure. Thus, porosity-rate gradients affect the evolution of the crack-field
which, then, naturally degrades the elastic modulus, and it is through this
fundamental mechanism that spatial gradients in porosity growth affects the
strain-energy density and stress carrying capacity of the material - and, as a
dimensional consequence related to fundamental kinematics, introduces a
length-scale in the model. The key hypothesis of this work is that brittle
fracture is energy-driven while ductile fracture is stress-driven; under
overall shear loadings where mean stress vanishes or is compressive, shear
strain energy can still drive shear fracture in ductile materials.

50{\mu}m-0.5mm particles size. A mathematical model expressing microplastic
concentration in soil and water as a linear function of the measured S11
resonance frequency shift and relative permittivity contrast is developed and
is found to be in a very good agreement with the experimental data. Next, this
model is applied to find the best achievable theoretical resolution of
microplastic concentration in the natural environment using microwave sensing
technology which is shown to be at around 100ppm (parts-per-million) level in
the linear signal detection regime. It is demonstrated that the best achievable
level of microplastic contaminant resolution depends on the sensor probe
Q-factor and sensitivity of the microwave receiver. The bound for the
achievable contaminant concentration resolution is found in the analytical form
for high-Q resonance microwave sensors of arbitrary geometry. Even though
several well-established protocols based on optical, infrared and X-ray
spectroscopy are currently being used for microplastic detection in the natural
environment, microwave spectroscopy could offer additional possibilities,
especially for low-cost, real-time in-situ microplastic detection in diverse
environmental conditions outside of the laboratory space.

owing to the fact, that, the botnet developers each day, keep changing the
propagation and attack techniques. Currently, most of these attacks have been
centered on stealing computing energy, theft of personal information and
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, the authors
propose a novel technique that uses the Non-Deterministic Polynomial-Time
Hardness (NP-Hard Problem) based on the Traveling Salesperson Person (TSP) that
depicts that a given bot, bj, is able to visit each host on a network
environment, NE, and then it returns to the botmaster, in form of
instruction(command), through optimal minimization of the hosts that are (may)
be attacked. Given that bj represents a piece of malicious code and TSP-NP Hard
Problem, which forms part of combinatorial optimization, the authors present
this as an effective approach for the detection of the botnet. It is worth
noting that the concentration of this study is basically on the centralized
botnet architecture. This holistic approach shows that botnet detection
accuracy can be increased with a degree of certainty and potentially decrease
the chances of false positives. Nevertheless, a discussion on the possible
applicability and implementation has also been given in this paper.

QCD phase of quark matter, in which the gamma-rays are produced from decaying
axions. The axions would be produced from a quark-antiquark pair $u\bar{u}$ or
$d\bar{d}$. The chiral anomaly of QCD and the spontaneously broken symmetry are
invoked to explain the non-conservation of the axion current. The axion
quark-antiquark coupling can be computed via the Goldberger-Treiman relation,
relying on the two-loop coupling form factors from the QCD axion current. From
the coupling form factors, the axion emissivities $\epsilon_a$ can be derived,
from which fluxes can be determined. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to
compute the emissivity for axions from said neutron stars, from which the
predicted gamma-ray signal from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT) can
be computed. We predict a photon flux which may be detectable by Fermi LAT, and
limits on the QCD mass $m_a$. A signal from LIGO GWS 170817 could be produced
from the neutron star merger as well, which is compared to the expected signal
from the Fermi LAT. An upper bound $m_a\lesssim 10^{-10}$eV is thereby placed.
Very stringent limits on the axion mass of nearly $m_a \simeq 10^{-14}$eV could
be placed using this model with the closest neutron stars near 100 kpc. Axions
could thus be detectable in gamma-rays for neutron stars as distant as 1 Mpc.

this article we introduce a new and highly flexible class of nonstationary and

modeling the simpler and more familiar stationary and symmetric multivariate
covariances on a warped domain. Inspired by recent developments in the
univariate case, we propose modeling the warping function as a composition of a

Importantly, covariance-model validity is guaranteed by construction. We
establish the types of warpings that allow for cross-covariance symmetry and
asymmetry, and we use likelihood-based methods for inference that are
computationally efficient. The utility of this new class of models is shown
through two data illustrations: a simulation study on nonstationary data and an
application on ocean temperatures at two different depths.

2500 atoms in tens of minutes. Applying this to a realistic example of 22

which any five vertices span at least one edge, prove that $|\mathcal{F}| \ge
(1/4 -o(1))\binom{n}{3}$. The construction showing that this bound would be

for authenticating IoT devices with wireless interface by exploiting their
radio frequency (RF) signatures. The proposed DAC is based on RF
fingerprinting, information theoretic method, feature learning, and
discriminatory power of deep learning. Specifically, an autoencoder is used to
automatically extract features from the RF traces, and the reconstruction error
is used as the DAC and this DAC is unique to the device and the particular
message of interest. Then Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is used to match the
distribution of the reconstruction error generated by the autoencoder and the
received message, and the result will determine whether the device of interest
belongs to an authorized user. We validate this concept on two experimentally
collected RF traces from six ZigBee and five universal software defined radio
peripheral (USRP) devices, respectively. The traces span a range of Signalto-
Noise Ratio by varying locations and mobility of the devices and channel
interference and noise to ensure robustness of the model. Experimental results
demonstrate that DAC is able to prevent device impersonation by extracting
salient features that are unique to any wireless device of interest and can be
used to identify RF devices. Furthermore, the proposed method does not need the
RF traces of the intruder during model training yet be able to identify devices
not seen during training, which makes it practical.

a domain closer to the downstream task (e.g., VQA v2) is a better choice for
pretraining than ""natural"" data but of a slightly different domain (e.g.,
Conceptual Captions). On the other hand, some seemingly reasonable choices of
pretraining datasets were found to be entirely ineffective for some downstream
tasks. This suggests that despite the numerous recent efforts, vision &

help us achieve close to state-of-art results on downstream tasks without any

The downside of these metrics is that, at worst, they penalize all incorrect
detections equally without conditioning on the task or scene, and at best,
heuristics need to be chosen to ensure that different mistakes count
differently. In this paper, we propose a principled metric for 3D object

metric is to isolate the task of object detection and measure the impact the
produced detections would induce on the downstream task of driving. Without
hand-designing it to, we find that our metric penalizes many of the mistakes
that other metrics penalize by design. In addition, our metric downweighs
detections based on additional factors such as distance from a detection to the

correctness of the patches, and many tools compromise other aspects of repair
performance such as recall for an acceptable precision.
  In this paper we ask a question: can a repair tool with a low precision be
still useful? To explore this question, we propose an interactive filtering
approach to patch review, which filters out incorrect patches by asking
questions to the developers. Our intuition is that incorrect patches can still
help understand the bug. With proper tool support, the benefit outweighs the
cost even if there are many incorrect patches.
  We implemented the approach as an Eclipse plugin tool, InPaFer, and evaluated
it with a simulated experiment and a user study with 30 developers. The results
show that our approach improve the repair performance of developers, with 62.5%
more successfully repaired bugs and 25.3% less debugging time in average. In
particular, even if the generated patches are all incorrect, the performance of
the developers would not be significantly reduced, and could be improved when
some patches provide useful information for repairing, such as the faulty
location and a partial fix.

information on the phases of the material at any given thermodynamic condition.
Conventional phase diagram generation involves experimentation to provide an
initial estimate of thermodynamically accessible phases, followed by use of
phenomenological models to interpolate between the available experimental data
points and extrapolate to inaccessible regions. Such an approach, combined with
first-principles calculations and data-mining techniques, has led to exhaustive
thermodynamic databases albeit at distinct thermodynamic equilibria. In
contrast, materials during their synthesis, operation, or processing, may not
reach their thermodynamic equilibrium state but, instead, remain trapped in a
local free energy minimum, that may exhibit desirable properties. Mapping these
metastable phases and their thermodynamic behavior is highly desirable but
currently lacking. Here, we introduce an automated workflow that integrates
first principles physics and atomistic simulations with machine learning (ML),
and high-performance computing to allow rapid exploration of the metastable
phases of a given elemental composition. Using a representative material,
carbon, with a vast number of metastable phases without parent in equilibrium,
we demonstrate automatic mapping of hundreds of metastable states ranging from
near equilibrium to those far-from-equilibrium. Moreover, we incorporate the
free energy calculations into a neural-network-based learning of the equations
of state that allows for construction of metastable phase diagrams. High
temperature high pressure experiments using a diamond anvil cell on graphite

to validate our metastable phase predictions. Our introduced approach is

\left(\sqrt{\alpha_k^2- \beta_k^2\ell_0(x)}+\alpha_k\right) , & x\ge 0 , \\
-x\frac{\sqrt{1+\ell_0(x)}+1}{2} +\frac 12\sum\limits_{k=1}^{d}
\left(\sqrt{\alpha_k^2- \beta_k^2\ell_0(x)}+\alpha_k\right) , &x<0, \end{array}
\right. \end{equation*} where $\alpha_{k}\pm {\rm i} \beta_{k}$ are the
eigenvalues of $A$, and $\ell_0(x)$ is the unique solution of the equation:
\begin{align*} |x|={\sqrt{1+\ell}} \times \sum_{k=1}^{d}
\frac{\beta_k^2}{\sqrt{\alpha_k^2 -\ell\beta_k^2} },\qquad -1 \le \ell<
\min_{k=1,...,d}\{\frac{\alpha_k^2}{\beta_k^2}\}. \end{align*} Simple closed
form formulas for rate functions are rare and our work identifies an important
class of large deviation problems where such formulas are available. The
logarithmic moment generating function (the fluctuation function) $\Lambda$
associated with the LDP has a closed form (see it in the paper). The functions
$\Lambda(\lambda)$ and $ I(x)$ satisfy the Cohen-Gallavotti symmetry
properties.
  In particular, the functions $I$ and $\Lambda$ do not depend on the diffusion
matrix $Q$, and are determined completely by the real and imaginary parts of
the eigenvalues of $A$. Formally, the deterministic system with $Q=0$ has zero
EPR and thus the model exhibits a phase transition in that the EPR changes
discontinuously at $Q = 0$.

This paper uses the daily closing price data of the 28 level-1 sectors from

transmission between different sectors. We construct information flow networks
with the sectors as the nodes and the transfer entropy between them as the

\textit{non-bank financial} sector is the information sink. We also find that

surge on the popularity of sensing applications. As a result, people
increasingly rely on information obtained from sensors to make decisions in
their daily life. Unfortunately, in most sensing applications, sensors are
known to be error-prone and their measurements can become misleading at any
unexpected time. Therefore, in order to enhance the reliability of sensing
applications, apart from the physical phenomena/processes of interest, we
believe it is also highly important to monitor the reliability of sensors and
clean the sensor data before analysis on them being conducted. Existing studies
often regard sensor reliability monitoring and sensor data cleaning as separate
problems. In this work, we propose RelSen, a novel optimization-based framework
to address the two problems simultaneously via utilizing the mutual dependence
between them. Furthermore, RelSen is not application-specific as its
implementation assumes a minimal prior knowledge of the process dynamics under
monitoring. This significantly improves its generality and applicability in
practice. In our experiments, we apply RelSen on an outdoor air pollution
monitoring system and a condition monitoring system for a cement rotary kiln.
Experimental results show that our framework can timely identify unreliable
sensors and remove sensor measurement errors caused by three types of most
commonly observed sensor faults.

reinforcement learning with learned dynamics and reward models have resorted to
population-based optimization methods, such as the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM),
for planning a sequence of actions. To decide on an action to take, CEM
conducts a search for the action sequence with the highest return according to
the dynamics model and reward. Action sequences are typically randomly sampled
from an unconditional Gaussian distribution and evaluated on the environment.
This distribution is iteratively updated towards action sequences with higher
returns. However, this planning method can be very inefficient, especially for
high-dimensional action spaces. An alternative line of approaches optimize
action sequences directly via gradient descent, but are prone to local optima.
We propose a method to solve this planning problem by interleaving CEM and
gradient descent steps in optimizing the action sequence. Our experiments show
faster convergence of the proposed hybrid approach, even for high-dimensional
action spaces, avoidance of local minima, and better or equal performance to
CEM. Code accompanying the paper is available here

where $\mathbf{a}_j \in \mathbb{C}^d$ are known measurement vectors and
$\eta=(\eta_1,\ldots,\eta_m)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a noise vector. A
commonly used model for estimating $\mathbf{x}_0$ is the intensity-based model
$\widehat{\mathbf{x}}:=\mbox{argmin}_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{C}^d} \sum_{j=1}^m
\big(\left\lvert \langle \mathbf{a}_j,\mathbf{x} \rangle \right\rvert^2-b_j

the intensity-based model, there are very few results about its estimation
performance. In this paper, we focus on the estimation performance of the
intensity-based model and prove that the error bound satisfies $\min_{\theta\in

\min\Big\{\frac{\sqrt{\|\eta\|_2}}{{m}^{1/4}}, \frac{\|\eta\|_2}{\|

that the error bound is sharp. For the case where $\mathbf{x}_0$ is a
$s$-sparse signal, we present a similar result under the assumption of $m
\gtrsim s \log (ed/s)$. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first
theoretical guarantees for the intensity-based model and its sparse version.
Our proofs employ Mendelson's small ball method which can deliver an effective

relativistic Boltzmann equation under the relaxation time approximation. In an
isotropic QGP, the influences of magnetic field ($B$) and quark chemical
potential ($\mu_{q}$) on these thermoelectric transport coefficients are
investigated. In the presence (absence) of weak magnetic field, we find
$S_{xx}$ for a fixed $\mu_{q}$ is negative (positive) in sign, indicating that
the dominant carriers for converting heat gradient to electric field are
negatively (positively) charged quarks. The absolute value of $S_{xx}$
decreases with increasing temperature. Unlike $S_{xx}$, the sign of $N$ is
independent of charge carrier type, and its thermal behavior displays a peak
structure. In the presence of strong magnetic field, due to the Landau
quantization of transverse motion of (anti-)quarks perpendicular to magnetic
field, only the longitudinal Seebeck coefficient ($S_{zz}$) exists. Our results
show that the value of $S_{zz}$ at a fixed $\mu_{q}$ in the lowest Landau level
(LLL) approximation always remains positive. Within the effect of high Landau
levels, $S_{zz}$ exhibits a thermal structure similar to that in the LLL
approximation. As the Landau level increases further, $S_{zz}$ decreases and
even its sign changes from positive to negative. The computations of these
thermoelectric transport coefficients are also extended to a medium with

indispensable considering the positive outcomes it generates. However, it is
not an individual activity and requires substantial interaction among
stakeholders, deliverance, and acceptance of feedback, timely actions upon
feedback as well as the ability to agree on a solution in the wake of diverse
viewpoints. Young developers in a classroom setting provide a clear picture of
the potential favourable and problematic areas of the code review process.
Their feedback suggests that the process has been well received with some
points to better the process. This paper can be used as guidelines to perform
code reviews in the classroom.

QCD and may constitute a significant fraction of the dark matter in the
Universe. Axions are expected to be produced in neutron stars and subsequently
decay, producing gamma-rays detectable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope
(Fermi-LAT). Considering that light QCD axions, as opposed to axions $>1$eV,
may travel a long range before they decay into gamma rays, neutron stars may
appear as a spatially-extended source of gamma rays. We extend our previous
search for gamma rays from axions, based on a point source model, to consider
the neutron star as an extended source of gamma rays. The extended
consideration of neutron stars' leads to higher sensitivity to searches for
axions, as it will be shown.
  We investigate the spatial emission of gamma rays using phenomenological
models of neutron star axion emission. We present models including the
fundamental astrophysics and relativistic, extended gamma-ray emission from
axions around neutron stars. A Monte Carlo simulation of the LAT gives us an
expectation for the extended angular profile and spectrum. For a source of
$\simeq$ 100 pc, we predict a mean angular spread of $\simeq 2^\circ$ with
gamma-ray energies in the range 10-200 MeV. We demonstrate the feasibility of
setting more stringent limits for axions in this mass range, excluding a range
not probed by observations before. We consider projected sensitivities for mass
limits on axions from J0108-1431. Based on the extended angular profile of the
source, the expected sensitivity of the 95\% CL upper limit on the axion mass
from J0108-1431 is $\lesssim$10 meV. The limit based on 7.9 years of Fermi-LAT
data is 0.76 meV for an inner temperature of the neutron star of 20 MeV.

Combining multi-scale features is one of important factors for accurate
segmentation. UNet++ was developed as a modified Unet by designing an

explore sufficient information from full scales and there is still a large room
for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel UNet 3+, which takes
advantage of full-scale skip connections and deep supervisions. The full-scale
skip connections incorporate low-level details with high-level semantics from
feature maps in different scales; while the deep supervision learns
hierarchical representations from the full-scale aggregated feature maps. The
proposed method is especially benefiting for organs that appear at varying

the network parameters to improve the computation efficiency. We further
propose a hybrid loss function and devise a classification-guided module to
enhance the organ boundary and reduce the over-segmentation in a non-organ

weighting each map by its Tutte polynomial, or to solving the $q$-state Potts
model on random planar maps. The associated generating function, obtained by
Olivier Bernardi and the author, is differentially algebraic. That is, it
satisfies a (non-linear) differential equation. The starting point of this
result is a functional equation written by Tutte in 1971, which translates into
enumerative terms a simple recursive description of planar maps. The proof
follows and adapts Tutte's solution of properly $q$-coloured triangulations
(1973-1984).
  We put this work in perspective with the much better understood enumeration
of families of uncoloured planar maps, for which the recursive approach almost
systematically yields algebraic generating functions. In the past 15 years,
these algebraicity properties have been explained combinatorially by
illuminating bijections between maps and families of plane trees. We survey
both approaches, recursive and bijective.
  Comparing the coloured and uncoloured results raises the question of
designing bijections for coloured maps. No complete bijective solution exists
at the moment, but we present bijections for certain specialisations of the
general problem. We also show that for these specialisations, Tutte's
functional equation is much easier to solve that in the general case.

extractive summarization systems. Instead of following the commonly used
framework of extracting sentences individually and modeling the relationship
between sentences, we formulate the extractive summarization task as a semantic
text matching problem, in which a source document and candidate summaries will
be (extracted from the original text) matched in a semantic space. Notably,
this paradigm shift to semantic matching framework is well-grounded in our
comprehensive analysis of the inherent gap between sentence-level and
summary-level extractors based on the property of the dataset.
  Besides, even instantiating the framework with a simple form of a matching
model, we have driven the state-of-the-art extractive result on CNN/DailyMail
to a new level (44.41 in ROUGE-1). Experiments on the other five datasets also
show the effectiveness of the matching framework. We believe the power of this
matching-based summarization framework has not been fully exploited. To
encourage more instantiations in the future, we have released our codes,
processed dataset, as well as generated summaries in
https://github.com/maszhongming/MatchSum.

  Aggregation of Deep Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Various architectures (such as GoogLeNets, ResNets, and DenseNets) have been
proposed. However, the existing networks usually suffer from either redundancy
of convolutional layers or insufficient utilization of parameters. To handle
these challenging issues, we propose Micro-Dense Nets, a novel architecture
with global residual learning and local micro-dense aggregations. Specifically,
residual learning aims to efficiently retrieve features from different
convolutional blocks, while the micro-dense aggregation is able to enhance each
block and avoid redundancy of convolutional layers by lessening residual
aggregations. Moreover, the proposed micro-dense architecture has two
characteristics: pyramidal multi-level feature learning which can widen the
deeper layer in a block progressively, and dimension cardinality adaptive
convolution which can balance each layer using linearly increasing dimension
cardinality. The experimental results over three datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K) demonstrate that the proposed Micro-Dense Net with
only 4M parameters can achieve higher classification accuracy than
state-of-the-art networks, while being 12.1$\times$ smaller depends on the
number of parameters. In addition, our micro-dense block can be integrated with
neural architecture search based models to boost their performance, validating
the advantage of our architecture. We believe our design and findings will be
beneficial to the DNN community.

learning general features from a limited number of knowledge graphs, which can
also quickly adapt to dialogue generation with unseen knowledge triplets.

conforming types within the seed formulas to generate well-typed mutant
formulas. These mutant formulas are then used as the test cases for SMT
solvers. We realized type-aware operator mutation within the OpFuzz tool and
used it to stress-test Z3 and CVC4, two state-of-the-art SMT solvers.
Type-aware operator mutations are unusually effective: During one year of
extensive testing with OpFuzz, we reported 1,092 bugs on Z3's and CVC4's
respective GitHub issue trackers, out of which 819 unique bugs were confirmed
and 685 of the confirmed bugs were fixed by the developers. The detected bugs
are highly diverse -- we found bugs of many different types (soundness bugs,
invalid model bugs, crashes, etc.), logics and solver configurations. We have
further conducted an in-depth study of the bugs found by OpFuzz. The study
results show that the bugs found by OpFuzz are of high quality. Many of them
affect core components of the SMT solvers' codebases, and some required major
changes for the developers to fix. Among the 819 confirmed bugs found by
OpFuzz, 184 were soundness bugs, the most critical bugs in SMT solvers, and 489
were in the default modes of the solvers. Notably, OpFuzz found 27 critical
soundness bugs in CVC4, which has proved to be a very stable SMT solver.

outflows, which are suggested to trace magneto-centrifugal disk winds (MHD
DWs). However, their impact on disk accretion is not yet well quantified. Here
we identify systematic biases in retrieving the true launch zone, magnetic
lever arm, and angular momentum flux of an MHD DW from apparent rotation
signatures. Synthetic position-velocity cuts are constructed from self-similar
MHD DWs over a broad range of parameters, and three different methods are
applied for estimating the specific angular momentum. We find that the launch
radius inferred using the well-known relation from Anderson et al. (2006) can
markedly differ from the true outermost launch radius $r_{out}$ of the DW. The
""double-peak separation"" and ""flow width"" methods provide only a strict lower
limit to $r_{out}$. This bias is independent of angular resolution and can
reach a factor ten. In contrast, the ""rotation curve"" method gives a good
estimate of $r_{out}$ when the flow is well resolved, and an upper limit
otherwise. The magnetic lever arm is always underestimated. Only comparison
with synthetic predictions can take into account properly all observational
effects. As an application, we present a comparison with ALMA observations of
HH212 at resolutions from 250 au to 16 au, which represents the most stringent
observational test of MHD DW to date. This comparison confirms our predicted
biases for the double-peak separation method, and the large $r_{out}\sim40~$au
and small magnetic lever arm first suggested by Tabone et al. (2017). We also
derive the first accurate analytical expression for the fraction of disk
angular momentum extracted by an MHD disk wind of given radial extent, magnetic
lever arm, and mass flux. Application to HH212 confirms that MHD DWs are
serious candidates for the steady angular momentum extraction process in young
disks.

confidential connections are combined (XOR-ed) with other signals at different

signals through NC significantly increases the security of confidential

traversing different links, in order to decrypt the combined signal. A novel
heuristic approach is proposed, that solves the combined network coding and
routing and spectrum allocation (NC-RSA) problem, that also takes into account
additional NC constraints that are required in order to consider a confidential

proposed, aiming to maximize the level of security provided for the

interpreted as generalized alternating birth-death process in a non-autonomous
random environment. Depending on the status of the environment the process
either increases until the environment changes and the process starts to
decrease until the environment changes again, and the process restarts to
increase, and so on, or its starts decreasing, reversing its direction due to
environmental changes, et cetera. The birth and death rates depend on the state
(height, population size) of the birth-death process and the environment's
transition rates depend on the state of the birth-death process as well.
Moreover, a birth or death event may trigger an immediate change of the
environment. Our main result is an explicit expression for the stationary
distribution if the system is ergodic, providing ergodicity conditions as well.
Removing the reflecting boundary at zero we obtain a two-sided version on
$\mathbb{Z}$ of this alternating birth-death process, which for suitable
parameter constellations is ergodic as well. We determine the stationary
distribution. This two-sided version is a locally inhomogeneous discrete space
version of the classical telegraph process. We demonstrate that alternating
birth-death processes in a random environment provide a versatile class of
models from different areas of applications. Examples from the literature are
discussed.

this problem asks whether there is a subset of at most $k$ vertices whose
removal ensures the resulting graph does not contain a graph from $\Pi$ as

Wheel-free Deletion, and Interval Deletion fit into this framework. We
introduce the concept of characterizing a graph property $\Pi$ by low-rank

for $\Pi$-Free Deletion parameterized by the size of a vertex cover. The
resulting framework captures problems such as AT-Free Deletion, Wheel-free

vertex-deletion problem to perfect graphs has a polynomial kernel when
parameterized by vertex cover, thereby resolving an open question by Fomin et

from a large difference between the local conductivities in the intra- and

low-energy electronic states that sets in already well above $T_c$. There is
also no clear sign of an onset of precursor superconducting pairing
correlations well above $T_c \simeq$ 30~K. This highlights that the pseudogap

the best acceptance is achieved if we produce LLPs at collision points at the

Therefore, we propose DeepCFD: a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model

two standard formalisms in system analysis. Their main associated quantitative
objectives are hitting probabilities, discounted sum, and mean payoff. Although
there are many techniques for computing these objectives in general MCs/MDPs,
they have not been thoroughly studied in terms of parameterized algorithms,
particularly when treewidth is used as the parameter. This is in sharp contrast
to qualitative objectives for MCs, MDPs and graph games, for which
treewidth-based algorithms yield significant complexity improvements.
  In this work, we show that treewidth can also be used to obtain faster
algorithms for the quantitative problems. For an MC with $n$ states and $m$
transitions, we show that each of the classical quantitative objectives can be
computed in $O((n+m)\cdot t^2)$ time, given a tree decomposition of the MC that
has width $t$. Our results also imply a bound of $O(\kappa\cdot (n+m)\cdot
t^2)$ for each objective on MDPs, where $\kappa$ is the number of
strategy-iteration refinements required for the given input and objective.
Finally, we make an experimental evaluation of our new algorithms on
low-treewidth MCs and MDPs obtained from the DaCapo benchmark suite. Our
experimental results show that on MCs and MDPs with small treewidth, our
algorithms outperform existing well-established methods by one or more orders

the local pressure fluctuation, i.e. $w=-\beta p'/\rho, +\beta p'/\rho$
(Jim\'enez et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 442, 2001, pp. 89-117), and the
property of the permeable wall is given by the permeability parameter $\beta U$
normalised with the buoyancy-induced terminal velocity $U={(g\alpha\Delta

to gravity and volumetric thermal expansivity, respectively. A zero net mass
flux through the wall is instantaneously ensured, and thermal convection is
driven only by buoyancy without any additional energy inputs. The critical
transition of heat transfer in convective turbulence has been found between the
two $Ra$ regimes for fixed $\beta U=3$ and fixed Prandtl number $Pr=1$. In the
subcritical regime at lower $Ra$ the Nusselt number $Nu$ scales with $Ra$ as
$Nu\sim Ra^{1/3}$, as commonly observed in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection. In the supercritical regime at higher $Ra$, on the other hand, the
ultimate scaling $Nu\sim Ra^{1/2}$ is achieved, meaning that the wall-to-wall
heat flux scales with $U\Delta T$ independent of the thermal diffusivity,
although the heat transfer on the wall is dominated by thermal conduction. The
physical mechanisms of the achievement of the ultimate heat transfer are
presented.

scanned over the plane ($m_{\phi^0},\sqrt{s}$), where $\phi^0$ is $h^0$ for
low-$m_{H^0}$ scenario and $H^0$ for other two scenarios. The regions of the
parameter space in which the production rates are sufficiently large are
highlighted for each scenario. The production rates in different polarization
collision modes of initial beams are also discussed. It can be enhanced up to
two-times by oppositely polarized photons at high energies and right-handed
polarized photons at low energies. Furthermore, decay channels of the charged
Higgs boson are examined for each scenario. It is observed that the one-loop EW
corrections, i.e., the virtual plus real radiation corrections, reduce the
tree-level cross sections and the relative correction is typically in the range
of $-10\%$ to $-30\%$, depending on model parameters.

of the variability-selected AGNs are individually identified with the X-ray
sources detected in the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey. We investigate their
properties in variability by using structure function analysis and find that
the structure function for low-luminosity AGNs
($L_{\mathrm{bol}}\lesssim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) shows a positive correlation
with luminosity, which is the opposite trend for the luminous quasars. This
trend is likely to be caused by larger contribution of the host galaxy light
for lower-luminosity AGNs. Using the model templates of galaxy spectra, we
evaluate the amount of host galaxy contribution to the structure function
analysis and find that dominance of the young stellar population is needed to
explain the observed luminosity dependence. This suggests that low-luminosity
AGNs at $0.8\lesssim z\lesssim1.8$ are predominantly hosted in star-forming
galaxies. The X-ray stacking analysis reveals the significant emission from the
individually X-ray undetected AGNs in our variability-selected sample. The
stacked samples show very large hardness ratios in their stacked X-ray
spectrum, which suggests that these optically variable sources have large soft
X-ray absorption by dust-free gas.

protoplanetary disks that evolve by viscous accretion and magnetically driven
disk winds (MDWs). We solved an approximate coagulation equation of dust grains
with time-evolving disks that consist of both gas and solid components by a
one-dimensional model. With the grain growth, all solid particles initially
drift inward toward the central star by the gas drag force. However, the radial
profile of gas pressure, $P$, is modified by the MDW that disperses the gas in
an inside-out manner. Consequently, a local concentration of solid particles is
created by the converging radial flux of drifting dust grains at the location
with the convex upward profile of $P$. When the dimensionless stopping time,
${\rm St}$, there exceeds unity, the solid particles spontaneously reach the
growth dominated state because of the positive feedback between the suppressed
radial drift and the enhanced accumulation of dust particles that drift from
the outer part. Once the solid particles are in the drift limited state, the
above-mentioned condition of ${\rm St} \gtrsim 1$ for the dust growth is
equivalent with \begin{equation}
  \Sigma_{\rm d}/\Sigma_{\rm g}\gtrsim \eta, \nonumber \end{equation} where
$\Sigma_{\rm d}/\Sigma_{\rm g}$ is the dust-to-gas surface-density ratio and
$\eta$ is dimensionless radial pressure-gradient force. As a consequence of the
successful growth of dust grains, a ring-like structure containing
planetesimal-sized bodies is formed at the inner part of the protoplanetary
disks. Such a ring-shaped concentration of planetesimals is expected to play a
vital role in the subsequent planet formation.

regime. There is a short horizon for reliable prediction, followed by a
dispersion of the possible trajectories that grows extremely fast. The
impossibility to predict in the mid-term is not due to wrong or incomplete

IoV simulates a large variety of crowdsourcing applications such as Waze, Uber,
and Amazon Mechanical Turk, etc. Users of these applications report the
real-time traffic information to the cloud server which trains a machine
learning model based on traffic information reported by users for intelligent
traffic management. However, crowdsourcing application owners can easily infer
users' location information, which raises severe location privacy concerns of
the users. In addition, as the number of vehicles increases, the frequent
communication between vehicles and the cloud server incurs unexpected amount of
communication cost. To avoid the privacy threat and reduce the communication
cost, in this paper, we propose to integrate federated learning and local
differential privacy (LDP) to facilitate the crowdsourcing applications to
achieve the machine learning model. Specifically, we propose four LDP
mechanisms to perturb gradients generated by vehicles. The Three-Outputs
mechanism is proposed which introduces three different output possibilities to
deliver a high accuracy when the privacy budget is small. The output
possibilities of Three-Outputs can be encoded with two bits to reduce the
communication cost. Besides, to maximize the performance when the privacy
budget is large, an optimal piecewise mechanism (PM-OPT) is proposed. We
further propose a suboptimal mechanism (PM-SUB) with a simple formula and
comparable utility to PM-OPT. Then, we build a novel hybrid mechanism by
combining Three-Outputs and PM-SUB.

dominated by the rotation of black hole. In the non-rotating case, we find that
the black hole shadow is independent of the polarization of light. However, the
status is changed in the rotating case, in which the black hole shadow depends
on the light's polarization and the coupling between bumblebee vector field and
electromagnetic field. These features of black hole shadow casted by polarized
lights could help us to understand the bumblebee vector field with Lorentz

``knowledge'' learned by one machine learning model (the \textit{teacher}) into
another model (the \textit{student}), where typically, the teacher has a
greater capacity (e.g., more parameters or higher bit-widths). To our
knowledge, existing methods overlook the fact that although the student absorbs
extra knowledge from the teacher, both models share the same input data -- and
this data is the only medium by which the teacher's knowledge can be
demonstrated. Due to the difference in model capacities, the student may not
benefit fully from the same data points on which the teacher is trained. On the
other hand, a human teacher may demonstrate a piece of knowledge with
individualized examples adapted to a particular student, for instance, in terms
of her cultural background and interests. Inspired by this behavior, we design
data augmentation agents with distinct roles to facilitate knowledge
distillation. Our data augmentation agents generate distinct training data for
the teacher and student, respectively. We find empirically that specially
tailored data points enable the teacher's knowledge to be demonstrated more
effectively to the student. We compare our approach with existing KD methods on
training popular neural architectures and demonstrate that role-wise data

coherent structures in a wall-bounded turbulent flow, that span the entire
domain in wall-normal direction and significantly contribute to the global
energy and momentum transport. Recent investigations in channel and Couette
flow, suggest that these large-scale motions are self-sustained, implying they
are not driven by small-scale motions at the wall. Whether large-scale motions
are self-sustained has however not yet been answered for open boundary layers,
which are relevant for many applications. Here, using the asymptotic suction
boundary layer flow at the friction Reynolds number $Re_\tau = 1\,168$ as a
testbed, we show that large-scale motions are self-sustained also in boundary
layers. Together with the previous investigations in confined flows, this
observation provides strong evidence of the robust and general nature of
coherent self-sustained processes in turbulent wall-bounded flows. The dynamics
of the large-scale self-sustained process involving the growth, breakdown and
regeneration of quasi-streamwise coherent streaks and vortices within the
boundary layer shows temporal phase relations reminiscent of bursting as
observed in buffer layer structures. The dynamics however differs from the
quasi-periodic large-scale streak-vortex regeneration cycle observed in
confined flows. Based on the similarity of the dynamics of large-scale motions
in boundary layers and of small-scale buffer layer structures, we conjecture
that the bursting behaviour is associated with the dynamical relevance of only
one wall, while two confining walls lead to the quasi-periodic cycle.

  Closure",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite their well-known limitations, RANS models remain the most commonly
employed tool for modeling turbulent flows in engineering practice. RANS models
are predicated on the solution of the RANS equations, but these equations
involve an unclosed term, the Reynolds stress tensor, which must be modeled.
The Reynolds stress tensor is often modeled as an algebraic function of mean
flow field variables and turbulence variables. This introduces a discrepancy
between the Reynolds stress tensor predicted by the model and the exact
Reynolds stress tensor. This discrepancy can result in inaccurate mean flow
field predictions. In this paper, we introduce a data-informed approach for
arriving at Reynolds stress models with improved predictive performance. Our
approach relies on learning the components of the Reynolds stress discrepancy
tensor associated with a given Reynolds stress model in the mean strain-rate
tensor eigenframe. These components are typically smooth and hence simple to
learn using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies and regression
techniques. Our approach automatically yields Reynolds stress models that are
symmetric, and it yields Reynolds stress models that are both Galilean and
frame invariant provided the inputs are themselves Galilean and frame
invariant. To arrive at computable models of the discrepancy tensor, we employ
feed-forward neural networks and an input space spanning the integrity basis of
the mean strain-rate tensor, the mean rotation-rate tensor, the mean pressure
gradient, and the turbulent kinetic energy gradient, and we introduce a
framework for dimensional reduction of the input space to further reduce
computational cost. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach for data-informed Reynolds stress closure for a suite of
turbulent flow problems of increasing complexity.

anisotropic interaction in heavy quark ($Q$) and antiquark ($\bar Q$) bound
states through the perturbative thermal QCD in real-time formalism. So we
thermalize Schwinger propagator for quarks in LLL and the Feynman propagator
for gluons to calculate the gluon self-energy. For the quark-loop contribution
to the self-energy, the medium does not have any temperature correction and the
vacuum term gives rise an anisotropic term whereas the gluon-loop yields
temperature correction. This finding in quark-loop contribution corroborates
the equivalence of a massless QED in (1+1)-dimension with the massless thermal
QCD in strong B, which (quark sector) is reduced to (1+1)-dimension
(longitudinal). Thus the permittivity of the medium behaves like as a tensor.
Thus the permittivity of medium makes the $Q \bar Q$ potential anisotropic,
which resembles with a contemporary results found in lattice studies. As a
result, potential for $Q \bar Q$-pairs aligned transverse to B is more
attractive than parallel alignment. However, potential is always more
attractive compared to B=0 due to softening of screening mass. However, the
imaginary-part of potential becomes smaller compared to B=0. We have next
investigated the effects of strong ${\bf B}$ on binding energies (B.E.) and
thermal widths ($\Gamma$) of ground states of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ in a
time-independent perturbation theory, where binding energies gets increased and
widths gets decreased, compared to $B =0$. Finally we have studied the
quasi-free dissociation of bound states in a strong B. The dissociation
temperatures estimated for $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ states are obtained as $1.59
\rm{T_c} $ and $2.22 \rm{T_c}$, respectively, which are higher than the

propagation is rigorously imposed via an inequality constraint. The
minimization is enriched with an anisotropic mesh adaptation driven by an a

extending the low-rank approximation pursuit (LRAP) method for matrix
completions to tensor completions. The method performs a tensor factorization
using the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) which extends the
standard matrix SVD to tensors. The t-SVD leads to a notion of rank, called
tubal-rank here. We want to recreate the data in tensors from low resolution
samples as best we can here. To complete a low resolution tensor successfully
we assume that the given tensor data has low tubal-rank. For tensors of low
tubal-rank, we establish convergence results for our method that are based on
the tensor restricted isometry property (TRIP). Our result with the TRIP
condition for tensors is similar to low-rank matrix completions under the RIP
condition. The TRIP condition uses the t-SVD for low tubal-rank tensors, while
RIP uses the SVD for matrices. We show that a subgaussian measurement map
satisfies the TRIP condition with high probability and gives an almost optimal
bound on the number of required measurements. We compare the numerical

of Wigner functions and of more general Weyl symbols that represent the density
matrix of arbitrary mixed states. A formal solution to Moyal's equation is
given by Marinov's path integral. In this paper we demonstrate that this path
integral can be regarded as the natural link between several conceptual,
geometric, and dynamical issues in quantum mechanics. A unifying perspective is
achieved by highlighting the pivotal role which the response field, one of the
integration variables in Marinov's integral, plays for pure states even. The
discussion focuses on how the integral's semiclassical approximation relates to
its strictly classical limit; unlike for Feynman type path integrals, the
latter is well defined in the Marinov case. The topics covered include a random
force representation of Marinov's integral based upon the concept of ""Airy
averaging"", a related discussion of positivity-violating Wigner functions
describing tunneling processes, and the role of the response field in
maintaining quantum coherence and enabling interference phenomena. The double
slit experiment for electrons and the Bohm-Aharonov effect are analyzed as
illustrative examples. Furthermore, a surprising relationship between the
instantons of the Marinov path integral over an analytically continued (""Wick
rotated"") response field, and the complex instantons of Feynman-type integrals
is found. The latter play a prominent role in recent work towards a
Picard-Lefschetz theory applicable to oscillatory path integrals and the
resurgence program.

source domain to a new target domain with only unlabeled data. Most existing
methods suffer from noticeable negative transfer resulting from either the
error-prone discriminator network or the unreasonable teacher model. Besides,
the local regional consistency in UDA has been largely neglected, and only
extracting the global-level pattern information is not powerful enough for
feature alignment due to the abuse use of contexts. To this end, we propose an
uncertainty-aware consistency regularization method for cross-domain semantic
segmentation. Firstly, we introduce an uncertainty-guided consistency loss with
a dynamic weighting scheme by exploiting the latent uncertainty information of
the target samples. As such, more meaningful and reliable knowledge from the
teacher model can be transferred to the student model. We further reveal the
reason why the current consistency regularization is often unstable in
minimizing the domain discrepancy. Besides, we design a ClassDrop mask
generation algorithm to produce strong class-wise perturbations. Guided by this
mask, we propose a ClassOut strategy to realize effective regional consistency
in a fine-grained manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms

solve it using appropriate initial conditions, and we critically examine the

effect of the higher order scalar field kinetic terms on the late-time dynamics
is radical, since the dark energy oscillations are absent, and in addition, the
cosmological physical quantities are compatible with the latest Planck data and
also the model is almost indistinguishable from the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter

oscillations are present. Furthermore, by choosing a different set of values of

enhanced interpretable feature block extracts the low-level spectral features
associated with the biophysical and biochemical attributes of target entities;
and in the second stage, an interpretable capsule block extracts and
encapsulates the high-level joint spectral-spatial features representing the

process-centric systems. Process mining receives so-called process logs which
are collections of partially-ordered events. An event has to possess at least
three attributes, case ID, task ID and a timestamp for mining approaches to
work. When a case ID is unknown, the event is called unlabeled. Traditionally,
process mining is an offline task, where events are collected from different
sources are usually manually correlated. That is, events belonging to the same
instance are assigned the same case ID. With today's high-volume/high-speed
nature of, e.g., IoT applications, process mining shifts to be an online task.
For this, event correlation has to be automated and has to occur as the data is
generated. In this paper, we introduce an approach that correlates unlabeled
events at runtime. Given a process model, a stream of unlabeled events and
other information about task duration, our approach can induce a case
identifier to a set of unlabeled events with a trust percentage. It can also
check the conformance of the identified cases with the process model. A
prototype of the proposed approach was implemented and evaluated against
real-life and synthetic logs.

demonstrate that the optimized policy can adapt to parasitic effects including
seeker angle measurement lag, thruster control lag, the parasitic attitude loop
resulting from scale factor errors and Gaussian noise on angle and rotational
velocity measurements, and a time varying center of mass caused by fuel
consumption and slosh. Importantly, the optimized policy gives good performance
over a wide range of challenging target maneuvers. Unlike previous work that
enhances range observability by inducing line of sight oscillations, our system
is optimized to use only measurements available from the seeker and rate gyros.
Through extensive Monte Carlo simulation of randomized exoatmospheric
interception scenarios, we demonstrate that the optimized policy gives
performance close to that of augmented proportional navigation with perfect
knowledge of the full engagement state. The optimized system is computationally
efficient and requires minimal memory, and should be compatible with today's

quasars (QSOs) in the redshift range $0.036 \leq z \leq 5.1003$, part of which,
$z \sim 2.4 - 5.1$, is largely cosmologically unprobed. In this paper we use
these QSO measurements, alone and in conjunction with baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) and Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, to constrain
cosmological parameters in six different cosmological models, each with two
different Hubble constant priors. In most of these models, given the larger
uncertainties, the QSO cosmological parameter constraints are mostly consistent
with those from the $H(z)$ + BAO data. A somewhat significant exception is the
non-relativistic matter density parameter $\Omega_{m0}$ where the QSO data
favors $\Omega_{m0} \sim 0.5 - 0.6$ in most models. Consequently in joint
analyses of QSO data with $H(z)$ + BAO data the one-dimensional $\Omega_{m0}$
distributions shift slightly toward larger values. A joint analysis of the QSO
+ $H(z)$ + BAO data is consistent with the current standard model,
spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM, but mildly favors closed spatial hypersurfaces and
dynamical dark energy. Since the higher $\Omega_{m0}$ values favored by the QSO
data appear to be associated with the $z \sim 2 - 5$ part of these data, and
conflict somewhat with strong indications for $\Omega_{m0} \sim 0.3$ from most
$z < 2.5$ data as well as from the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data
at $z \sim 1100$, in most models, the larger QSO data $\Omega_{m0}$ is possibly
more indicative of an issue with the $z \sim 2 - 5$ QSO data than of an
inadequacy of the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model.

designing an effective communication protocol. However, the communication

a novel systems-aware optimization method, ATTack on Federated Learning

block-fading wiretap channels with limited channel knowledge at the
transmitter. More particularly, we analyze the effect of having a finite rate
feedback on the throughput of multi-user broadcast wiretap channels. We
consider that the transmitter is only provided by a $b$-bits feedback of the
main channel state information (CSI) sent by each legitimate receiver, at the
beginning of each fading block, over error-free public links with limited
capacity. Also, we assume that the transmitter is aware of the statistics of
the eavesdropper's CSI but not of its channel's realizations. Under these
assumptions of CSI uncertainty, we characterize the ergodic secrecy capacity of
the system when a common message is broadcasted to all legitimate receivers,
the ergodic secrecy sum-capacity when multiple independent messages are
transmitted, and the ergodic secrecy capacity region for the broadcast channel
with confidential messages (BCCM). In all three scenarios, we show that as long
as the transmitter has some knowledge of the main CSI, obtained even through a
1-bit CSI feedback, a non-zero secrecy rate can still be achieved. The impact
of having the feedback sent over a binary erasure channel (BEC) is also
investigated for the BCCM case. Here again, and even with the possibility of
having the feedback bits erased, a positive secrecy rate can still be achieved
as long as the erasure event is not a probability-one event. An asymptotic
analysis of the obtained results is provided for the high SNR regime, and the
scaling law of the system, when the number of legitimate receivers is large, is
also presented.

outperformed the accuracy from previous machine learning and deep learning
research work, two out of four models outperformed accuracy from previous deep
learning study on Quora's question pair dataset, and our best model achieved
accuracy of 85.82% which is close to Quora state of the art accuracy.

the United States, the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a growing public
health crisis. Many of these children struggle to make eye contact, recognize
facial expressions, and engage in social interactions. Today the standard for
treatment of the core autism-related deficits focuses on a form of behavior
training known as Applied Behavioral Analysis. To address perceived deficits in
expression recognition, ABA approaches routinely involve the use of prompts
such as flash cards for repetitive emotion recognition training via
memorization. These techniques must be administered by trained practitioners
and often at clinical centers that are far outnumbered by and out of reach from
the many children and families in need of attention. Waitlists for access are
up to 18 months long, and this wait may lead to children regressing down a path
of isolation that worsens their long-term prognosis. There is an urgent need to
innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers
of children at risk or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on
mobile tools and wearable devices for use outside of clinical settings.

triangulation among a set of points in 3D space. We present PointTriNet, a
differentiable and scalable approach enabling point set triangulation as a
layer in 3D learning pipelines. The method iteratively applies two neural
networks: a classification network predicts whether a candidate triangle should
appear in the triangulation, while a proposal network suggests additional
candidates. Both networks are structured as PointNets over nearby points and
triangles, using a novel triangle-relative input encoding. Since these learning
problems operate on local geometric data, our method is efficient and scalable,
and generalizes to unseen shape categories. Our networks are trained in an
unsupervised manner from a collection of shapes represented as point clouds. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for classical meshing tasks,
robustness to outliers, and as a component in end-to-end learning systems.

  overlap with arXiv:2005.06960",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consonant gemination in Italian affricates and fricatives was investigated,
completing the overall study of gemination of Italian consonants. Results of
the analysis of other consonant categories, i.e. stops, nasals, and liquids,
showed that closure duration for stops and consonant duration for nasals and
liquids, form the most salient acoustic cues to gemination. Frequency and
energy domain parameters were not significantly affected by gemination in a
systematic way for all consonant classes. Results on fricatives and affricates
confirmed the above findings, i.e., that the primary acoustic correlate of
gemination is durational in nature and corresponds to a lengthened consonant
duration for fricative geminates and a lengthened closure duration for
affricate geminates. An inverse correlation between consonant and pre-consonant
vowel durations was present for both consonant categories, and also for both
singleton and geminate word sets when considered separately. This effect was
reinforced for combined sets, confirming the hypothesis that a durational
compensation between different phonemes may serve to preserve rhythmical
structures. Classification tests of single vs. geminate consonants using the
durational acoustic cues as classification parameters confirmed their validity,
and highlighted peculiarities of the two consonant classes. In particular, a
relatively poor classification performance was observed for affricates, which
led to refining the analysis by considering dental vs. non-dental affricates in
two different sets. Results support the hypothesis that dental affricates, in
Italian, may not appear in intervocalic position as singletons but only in
their geminate form.

  overlap with arXiv:2005.06959",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  All Italian consonants affected by gemination, that is affricates,
fricatives, liquids, nasals, and stops, were analyzed within a project named
GEMMA that lasted over a span of about 25 years. Results of the analysis on
stops, as published in (Esposito, A., and Di Benedetto, M. G. (1999). ""Acoustic
and Perceptual Study of Gemination in Italian Stops,"" The Journal of the
Acoustical Society of America, ASA, Vol. 30, pp. 175-185) showed that the main
acoustic cue to gemination in Italian was closure duration, while frequency and
energy domain parameters were not significantly affected by gemination. This
paper - the first of a set of two covering all remaining consonants - addresses
nasals and liquids; its companion paper addresses affricates and fricatives.
Results on nasals and liquids confirm the findings on stops, in particular that
the primary acoustic cue to gemination in Italian is durational in nature and
corresponds to a lengthened consonant duration. Results also show an inverse
correlation between consonant and pre-consonant vowel durations which is,
however, also present when considering singleton vs. geminate word sets
separately, indicating a sort of duration compensation between these segments
to eventually preserve rhythmical structures; this inverse correlation is
reinforced when considering singleton and geminate sets combined.
Classification tests of singleton vs. geminate consonants show that, for both
nasals and liquids, best classification scores are obtained when consonant
duration is used as a classification parameter. Although slightly less
performing, the ratio between consonant and pre-consonant vowel durations is
also a potential good candidate for automatic classification of geminate vs
singleton nasals and liquids in Italian.
