Inspired by IM and classical OFDM-NOMA, users utilize flexibility by adjusting

unphysical hardenings at distance-dependent energies in deabsorbed spectra of

directions of BL Lac type objects. In both cases, directions to the anomalous
sources follow the projected local distribution of galaxies: all the distant
sources, contributing to the anomalies, are seen through the local filament.
This matches the prediction of the proposed earlier explanation of the
anomalies based on mixing of photons with axion-like particles in the
filament's magnetic field. For ultra-high energies, this axion interpretation
may be tested by the search of primary gamma rays.

hitting (topological) minors and subgraphs on bounded treewidth graphs, we are

$f_H(t) = 2^{\Theta(t^{h-2})}$. We also show that $f_H(t) = 2^{\Omega(t^{h})}$

extracting a target speaker's voice from a multi-talker environment. It is
common to perform the extraction in frequency-domain, and reconstruct the
time-domain signal from the extracted magnitude and estimated phase spectra.
However, such an approach is adversely affected by the inherent difficulty of
phase estimation. Inspired by Conv-TasNet, we propose a time-domain speaker
extraction network (SpEx) that converts the mixture speech into multi-scale
embedding coefficients instead of decomposing the speech signal into magnitude
and phase spectra. In this way, we avoid phase estimation. The SpEx network
consists of four network components, namely speaker encoder, speech encoder,
speaker extractor, and speech decoder. Specifically, the speech encoder
converts the mixture speech into multi-scale embedding coefficients, the
speaker encoder learns to represent the target speaker with a speaker
embedding. The speaker extractor takes the multi-scale embedding coefficients
and target speaker embedding as input and estimates a receptive mask. Finally,
the speech decoder reconstructs the target speaker's speech from the masked
embedding coefficients. We also propose a multi-task learning framework and a
multi-scale embedding implementation. Experimental results show that the
proposed SpEx achieves 37.3%, 37.7% and 15.0% relative improvements over the
best baseline in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), scale-invariant SDR
(SI-SDR), and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) under an open

integrates the long-term dynamical evolution of multiple systems with any

previously averaged over all orbits in the system. This approximation
significantly speeds up numerical integration of the equations of motion,
making large population synthesis studies possible. However, the orbit
averaging approximation can break down when the secular evolution timescale of
the system is comparable to or shorter than any of the orbital periods in the
system. Here, we present an update to SecularMultiple in which we incorporate
hybrid integration techniques, and orbit-averaging corrections. With this
update, the user can specify which orbits should be integrated directly
(without averaging), or assuming averaged orbits. For orbits that are
integrated directly, we implemented two integration techniques, one which is
based on the regularised Kustaanheimo-Stiefel equations of motion in element
form. We also implemented analytical orbit-averaging corrections for pairwise
interactions to quadrupole order. The updates presented here provide more
flexibility for integrating the long-term dynamical evolution of hierarchical
multiple systems. By effectively combining direct integration and orbit
averaging the long-term evolution can be accurately computed, but with
significantly lower computational cost compared to existing direct N-body
codes. We give a number of examples in which the new features are beneficial.

been estimated as a prominent timescale of solar magnetic activity at high

fluctuating hydrodynamics formulation for multicomponent charged species. The
low Mach number approach eliminates sound waves from the fully compressible
equations leading to a computationally efficient incompressible formulation.
The model uses a Gibbs free energy functional that includes enthalpy of mixing,
interfacial energy, and electrostatic contributions. These lead to a new
fourth-order term in the mass equations and a reversible stress in the momentum
equations. We calibrate our model using parameters for [DMPI+][F6P-], an
extensively-studied room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), and numerically
demonstrate the formation of mesoscopic structuring at equilibrium in two and
three dimensions. In simulations with electrode boundaries the measured double
layer capacitance decreases with voltage, in agreement with theoretical
predictions and experimental measurements for RTILs. Finally, we present a
shear electroosmosis example to demonstrate that the methodology can be used to
model electrokinetic flows.

state sequence for a finite state and finite emission alphabet hidden Markov
model (HMM) in the Bayesian setup, where both emission and transition matrices
have Dirichlet priors. We study a training set consisting of thousands of
protein alignment pairs. The training data is used to set the prior
hyperparameters for Bayesian MAP segmentation. Since the Viterbi algorithm is
not applicable any more, there is no simple procedure to find the MAP path, and
several iterative algorithms are considered and compared. The main goal of the
paper is to test the Bayesian setup against the frequentist one, where the
parameters of HMM are estimated using the training data.

quantum mechanics but also important resources for quantum information and
computation applications. Exploiting the quantitative relationship between the
two different resources is of both theoretical and practical significance. The
common choice for quantifying the nonlocality of a two-qubit state is the
maximal violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. That for
entanglement is entanglement of formation, which is a function of the
concurrence. In this paper, we systematically investigate the quantitative
relationship between the entanglement and nonlocality of a general two-qubit
system. We rederive a known upper bound on the nonlocality of a general
two-qubit state, which depends on the state's entanglement. We investigate the
condition that the nonlocality of two different two-qubit states can be
optimally stimulated by the same nonlocality test setting and find the class of
two-qubit state pairs that have this property. Finally, we obtain the necessary
and sufficient condition that the upper bound can be reached.

Here, the formula is assessed for simple potentials, recovering the theoretical

eigenvalue--eigenvector relation is that it does not require knowing any of the
entries of the working matrix. However, it requires the knowledge of the
eigenvalues of the minor matrices (in which a row and a column have been

simulations on large urban areas with high spatial resolution for efficient and
systematic flooding analyses and risk assessments. To address this issue of
long computational time, this paper proposes that the prediction of maximum
water depth rasters can be considered as an image-to-image translation problem
where the results are generated from input elevation rasters using the
information learned from data rather than by conducting simulations, which can
significantly accelerate the prediction process. The proposed approach was
implemented by a deep convolutional neural network trained on flood simulation
data of 18 designed hyetographs on three selected catchments. Multiple tests
with both designed and real rainfall events were performed and the results show
that the flood predictions by neural network uses only 0.5 % of time comparing
with physically-based approaches, with promising accuracy and ability of
generalizations. The proposed neural network can also potentially be applied to
different but relevant problems including flood predictions for urban layout
planning.

A 102, 023515 (2020)","10.1103/PhysRevA.102.023515",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multistate stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a process which
allows for adiabatic population transfer between the two ends of a
chainwise-connected quantum system. The process requires large temporal areas
of the driving pulsed fields (pump and Stokes) in order to suppress the
nonadiabatic couplings and thereby to make adiabatic evolution possible. To
this end, in the present paper a variation of multistate STIRAP, which
accelerates and improves the population transfer, is presented. In addition to
the usual pump and Stokes fields it uses shortcut fields applied between the
states, which form the dark state of the system. The shortcuts cancel the
couplings between the dark state and the other adiabatic states thereby
resulting (in the ideal case) in a unit transition probability between the two
end states of the chain. Specific examples of five-state systems formed of the
magnetic sublevels of the transitions between two degenerate levels with
angular momenta $J_g=2$ and $J_e=1$ or $J_e=2$ are considered in detail, for
which the shortcut fields are derived analytically. The proposed method is
simpler than the usual ""shortcuts to adiabaticity"" recipe, which prescribes
shortcut fields between all states of the system, while the present proposal
uses shortcut fields between the sublevels forming the dark state only. The
results are of potential interest in applications where high-fidelity quantum
control is essential, e.g. quantum information, atom optics, formation of
ultracold molecules, cavity QED, etc.

coalescence during the first two weeks of LIGO's and Virgo's third observing
run. The signal was recorded on April 12, 2019 at 05:30:44 UTC with a network
signal-to-noise ratio of 19. The binary is different from observations during
the first two observing runs most notably due to its asymmetric masses: a ~30
solar mass black hole merged with a ~8 solar mass black hole companion. The
more massive black hole rotated with a dimensionless spin magnitude between
0.22 and 0.60 (90% probability). Asymmetric systems are predicted to emit
gravitational waves with stronger contributions from higher multipoles, and
indeed we find strong evidence for gravitational radiation beyond the leading
quadrupolar order in the observed signal. A suite of tests performed on
GW190412 indicates consistency with Einstein's general theory of relativity.
While the mass ratio of this system differs from all previous detections, we
show that it is consistent with the population model of stellar binary black
holes inferred from the first two observing runs.

conditions that generalise those in the literature by using a method based on
Harris's theorem, a result coming from the study of equilibration of Markov
processes. The difficulty posed by the non-conservativeness of the equation is
overcome by performing an $h$-transform, after solving the dual Perron
eigenvalue problem. The existence of the direct Perron eigenvector is then a
consequence of our methods, which prove exponential contraction of the
evolution equation. Moreover the rate of convergence is explicitly quantifiable
in terms of the dual eigenfunction and the coefficients of the equation.

source are untrusted, but a bound on the energy of the prepared states is
assumed. Our implementation exploits heterodyne detection, which offers
increased generation rate and improved long-term stability compared to
alternative measurement strategies. In particular, due to the tomographic
properties of heterodyne measurement, we can compensate for fast phase
fluctuations via post-processing, avoiding complex active phase stabilization
systems. As a result, our scheme combines high security and speed with a simple
setup featuring only commercial-off-the-shelf components, making it an
attractive solution in many practical scenarios.

black-box functions. The next location to be evaluated is selected via
maximising an acquisition function that balances exploitation and exploration.
Gaussian processes, the surrogate models of choice in Bayesian optimisation,
are often used with a constant prior mean function equal to the arithmetic mean
of the observed function values. We show that the rate of convergence can
depend sensitively on the choice of mean function. We empirically investigate 8
mean functions (constant functions equal to the arithmetic mean, minimum,
median and maximum of the observed function evaluations, linear, quadratic
polynomials, random forests and RBF networks), using 10 synthetic test problems
and two real-world problems, and using the Expected Improvement and Upper
Confidence Bound acquisition functions. We find that for design dimensions
$\ge5$ using a constant mean function equal to the worst observed quality value
is consistently the best choice on the synthetic problems considered. We argue
that this worst-observed-quality function promotes exploitation leading to more
rapid convergence. However, for the real-world tasks the more complex mean
functions capable of modelling the fitness landscape may be effective, although
there is no clearly optimum choice.

strings: Given a text $T$, a pattern $P$, and a threshold $k$, find (the
starting positions of) all substrings of $T$ that are at distance at most $k$
from $P$. We consider the two most fundamental string metrics: the Hamming
distance and the edit distance. Under the Hamming distance, we search for
substrings of $T$ that have at most $k$ mismatches with $P$, while under the
edit distance, we search for substrings of $T$ that can be transformed to $P$
with at most $k$ edits.
  Exact occurrences of $P$ in $T$ have a very simple structure: If we assume
for simplicity that $|T| \le 3|P|/2$ and trim $T$ so that $P$ occurs both as a
prefix and as a suffix of $T$, then both $P$ and $T$ are periodic with a common
period. However, an analogous characterization for the structure of occurrences
with up to $k$ mismatches was proved only recently by Bringmann et al.
[SODA'19]: Either there are $O(k^2)$ $k$-mismatch occurrences of $P$ in $T$, or
both $P$ and $T$ are at Hamming distance $O(k)$ from strings with a common
period $O(m/k)$. We tighten this characterization by showing that there are
$O(k)$ $k$-mismatch occurrences in the case when the pattern is not
(approximately) periodic, and we lift it to the edit distance setting, where we
tightly bound the number of $k$-edit occurrences by $O(k^2)$ in the
non-periodic case. Our proofs are constructive and let us obtain a unified
framework for approximate pattern matching for both considered distances. We
showcase the generality of our framework with results for the fully-compressed
setting (where $T$ and $P$ are given as a straight-line program) and for the
dynamic setting (where we extend a data structure of Gawrychowski et al.
[SODA'18]).

  https://github.com/aditimavalankar/gc-batch-rl-locomotion",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel approach to learn goal-conditioned policies for locomotion
in a batch RL setting. The batch data is collected by a policy that is not
goal-conditioned. For the locomotion task, this translates to data collection
using a policy learnt by the agent for walking straight in one direction, and
using that data to learn a goal-conditioned policy that enables the agent to
walk in any direction. The data collection policy used should be invariant to
the direction the agent is facing i.e. regardless of its initial orientation,
the agent should take the same actions to walk forward. We exploit this
property to learn a goal-conditioned policy using two key ideas: (1) augmenting
data by generating trajectories with the same actions in different directions,
and (2) learning an encoder that enforces invariance between these rotated
trajectories with a Siamese framework. We show that our approach outperforms
existing RL algorithms on 3-D locomotion agents like Ant, Humanoid and
Minitaur.

Evaluating the distance between a given configuration to the closest singular

the singularity distance as the global minimizer of an optimization problem. In

equation of state parameter $w$, in accordance with the approximate effective
linear equation $H_0 + 30.93\; w - 36.47 = 0$ ($H_0$ in $km \; sec^{-1} \;

CMB spectrum) and equal to their best fit Planck/$\Lambda$CDM values as $H_0$,
$\Omega_{0 \rm m}$ and $w$ vary. For $w=-1$, this linear degeneracy equation
leads to the best fit $H_0=67.4 \; km \; sec^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}$ as expected. For

above $H_0-w$ degeneracy equation by fitting a $w$CDM model with fixed values
of $w$ to the Planck TT spectrum showing also that the quality of fit
($\chi^2$) is similar to that of $\Lambda$CDM. However, when including SnIa,
BAO or growth data the quality of fit becomes worse than $\Lambda$CDM when $w<
-1$. Finally, we generalize the $H_0-w(z)$ degeneracy equation for
$w(z)=w_0+w_1\; z/(1+z)$ and identify analytically the full $w_0-w_1$ parameter
region that leads to a best fit $H_0=74\; km \; sec^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}$ in the

Specifically, we achieve this by decoupling a model's content from its form to

handle model growth, we propose a new neuron model, called DynamicCell, drawing
inspiration from from the free energy principle [15] to introduce the concept
of reaction to discharge non-digestive energy, which also subsumes gradient
descent based approaches as its special cases. We implement DynamicCell by
introducing a new server into TensorFlow to take over most of the work
involving model growth. Consequently, it enables any existing deep learning
models to efficiently handle arbitrary number of distinct sparse features
(e.g., search queries), and grow incessantly without redefining the model. Most
notably, one of our models, which has been reliably running in production for

principles, may be viewed as known, it is often too expensive to numerically
simulate all the interactions they describe. Therefore researchers often seek
simpler descriptions that describe complex phenomena without numerically
resolving all the interacting components. Stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) arise naturally as models in this context. The growth in data
acquisition, both through experiment and through simulations, provides an
opportunity for the systematic derivation of SDE models in many disciplines.
However, inconsistencies between SDEs and real data at short time scales often
cause problems, when standard statistical methodology is applied to parameter
estimation. The incompatibility between SDEs and real data can be addressed by
deriving sufficient statistics from the time-series data and learning
parameters of SDEs based on these. Following this approach, we formulate the
fitting of SDEs to sufficient statistics from real data as an inverse problem
and demonstrate that this inverse problem can be solved by using ensemble
Kalman inversion (EKI). Furthermore, we create a framework for non-parametric
learning of drift and diffusion terms by introducing hierarchical, refinable
parameterizations of unknown functions, using Gaussian process regression. We
demonstrate the proposed methodology for the fitting of SDE models, first in a
simulation study with a noisy Lorenz '63 model, and then in other applications,
including dimension reduction in deterministic chaotic systems arising in the
atmospheric sciences, large-scale pattern modeling in climate dynamics, and
simplified models for key observables arising in molecular dynamics. The
results confirm that the proposed methodology provides a robust and systematic

misaligned by a supernova kick imparted to the newborn black hole. The model
inputs are the kick velocity distribution, which we measure customized to V4641

the corresponding pre-supernova configurations by using standard prescriptions
for common envelope evolution. Using each of these potential progenitor system

origin of the V4641 Sgr spin-orbit misalignment. Consequently, we conclude that
evolutionary pathways involving a standard common envelope phase followed by a
supernova kick are highly unlikely for V4641 Sgr. An alternative interpretation
is that the jet axis does not reliably trace the black hole spin axis. Our

have been the subject of numerous observational and theoretical investigations.
It is of particular interest to determine the dominant power sources for the
copious luminosity, as direct emission from HII regions, cooling gas, and
fluorescence due to the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can all
contribute significantly. In this paper, we present the first theoretical model
to consider all of these physical processes in an attempt to develop an
evolutionary model for the origin of high-z LABs. This is achieved by combining
a series of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations with ionization
and Lyman-alpha (Lya) radiative transfer models. We find that massive galaxies
display a range of Lya luminosities and spatial extents (which strongly depend
on the limiting surface brightness used) over the course of their lives, though
regularly exhibit luminosities and sizes consistent with observed LABs. The
model LABs are typically powered from a combination of recombination in
star-forming galaxies, as well as cooling emission from gas associated with
accretion. When AGN are included in the model, the fluorescence caused by
AGN-driven ionization can be a significant contributor to the total Lya
luminosity as well. We propose that the presence of an AGN may be predicted
from the Gini coefficient of the blob's surface brightness. Within our modeled
mass range, there are no obvious threshold physical properties that predict
appearance of LABs, and only weak correlations of the luminosity with the
physical properties of the host galaxy. This is because the emergent Lya
luminosity from a system is a complex function of the gas temperature,
ionization state, and Lya escape fraction.

star formation in galaxies with $M_h<10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$ upon local

immediate radiative feedback cases during reionization. For this reason, the
ionization topologies of different radiative feedback scenarios differ only on
scales smaller than $1-2$Mpc, and significant deviations are only found when
physical parameters (e.g. the escape fraction of ionizing photons) are altered
based on galactic properties. Finally, we find observables (the ultra-violet

ABACUS, and compare results obtained with two halo finders: friends-of-friends
(FOF) and ROCKSTAR. The FOF mass functions show a systematic deviation from
self-similarity which is explained by resolution dependence of the FOF mass
assignment previously reported in the literature. Weak evidence for convergence
is observed only starting from halos of several thousand particles, and mass
functions are overestimated by at least as much as 20-25 percent for halos of
50 particles. The mass function of the default ROCKSTAR halo catalog (with
bound virial spherical overdensity mass), on the other hand, shows good
convergence from of order 50 to 100 particles per halo, with no detectable
evidence at the few percent level of any systematic dependence for larger
particle number. Tests show that the mass unbinding procedure in ROCKSTAR is
the key factor in obtaining this much improved resolution. Applying the same
analysis to the halo-halo two point correlation function, we find again strong
evidence for convergence only for ROCKSTAR halos, at separations sufficiently
large so that halos do not overlap. At these separations we can exclude
dependence on resolution at the 5-10 percent level once halos have of order 50
to 100 particles. At smaller separations results are not converged even at
significantly larger particle number, and bigger simulations would be required
to establish the resolution required for convergence.

angular momentum exceeds that associated with solid-body co-rotation with the
underlying planet. In this paper, we discuss the dependence of global
super-rotation in terrestrial atmospheres on planetary rotation rate. This
dependence is revealed through analysis of global super-rotation in idealised
General Circulation Model experiments with time-independent axisymmetric
forcing, compared with estimates for global super-rotation in Solar System
atmospheres. Axisymmetric and three-dimensional experiments are conducted. We
find that the degree of global super-rotation in the three-dimensional
experiments is closely related to that of the axisymmetric experiments, with
some differences in detail. A scaling theory for global super-rotation in an
axisymmetric atmosphere is derived from the Held-Hou model. At high rotation
rate, our numerical experiments inhabit a regime where global super-rotation
scales geostrophically, and we suggest that the Earth and Mars occupy this
regime. At low rotation rate, our experiments occupy a regime determined by
angular momentum conservation, where global super-rotation is independent of
rotation rate. Global super-rotation in our experiments saturates at a value
significantly lower than that achieved in the atmospheres of Venus and Titan,
which instead occupy a regime where global super-rotation scales
cyclostrophically. This regime can only be accessed when eddy induced
up-gradient angular momentum transport is sufficiently large, which is not the
case in our idealised numerical experiments. We suggest that the 'default'
regime for a slowly rotating planet is the angular momentum conserving regime,
characterised by mild global (and local) superrotation.

point patterns, point process-based modelling approaches presented in the

locations of the calls (within the four northernmost regions of Sweden) and the
associated days of occurrence of the calls (January 1, 2014, to December 31,
2018). Motivated by the nature of the data, we here employ log-Gaussian Cox
processes (LGCPs) for the spatio-temporal modelling and forecasting of the
calls. To this end, we propose a K-means clustering based bandwidth selection
method for the kernel estimation of the spatial component of the separable
spatio-temporal intensity function. The temporal component of the intensity
function is modelled using Poisson regression, using different calendar
covariates, and the spatio-temporal random field component of the random
intensity of the LGCP is fitted using the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin
algorithm. Spatial hot-spots have been found in the south-eastern part of the
study region, where most people in the region live and our fitted
model/forecasts manage to capture this behavior quite well. Also, there is a
significant association between the expected number of calls and the
day-of-the-week and the season-of-the-year. A non-parametric second-order
analysis indicates that LGCPs seem to be reasonable models for the data.
Finally, we find that the fitted forecasts generate simulated future spatial

numerous input parameters in a BEM are uncertain. To ensure that the building
simulation is sufficiently accurate, and to better understand the impact of
imprecisions in the input parameters and calculation methods, it is desirable
to quantify uncertainty in the BEM throughout the modeling process. Uncertainty
quantification (UQ) typically requires a large number of simulations to produce
meaningful data, which, due to the vast number of input parameters and the
dynamic nature of building simulation, is computationally expensive.
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in BEM domain is thus intractable due to the

It promises
to dramatically speed-up many chemical, financial, and machine-learning
applications. However, to capitalize on those promises, complex design flows
composed of steps such as compilation, decomposition, or mapping need to be
employed before being able to execute a conceptual quantum algorithm on an
actual device. This results in descriptions at various levels of abstraction
which may significantly differ from each other. The complexity of the
underlying design problems necessitates to not only provide efficient solutions
for the single steps, but also to verify that the originally intended
functionality is preserved throughout all levels of abstraction. This motivates
methods for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. However, most existing
methods are inspired by the classical realm and have merely been extended to
support quantum circuits (i.e., circuits which do not only rely on 0's and 1's,
but also employ superposition and entanglement). In this work, we propose an
advanced methodology which takes the different paradigms of quantum circuits
not only as a burden, but as an opportunity. In fact, the proposed methodology
explicitly utilizes characteristics unique to quantum computing in order to
overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches. We show that, by exploiting
the reversibility of quantum circuits, complexity can be kept feasible in many
cases. Moreover, we show that, in contrast to the classical realm, simulation
is very powerful in verifying quantum circuits. Experimental evaluations
confirm that the resulting methodology allows one to conduct equivalence
checking dramatically faster than ever before--in many cases just a single
simulation run is sufficient. An implementation of the proposed methodology is

cancer, where inconsistencies across radiation oncologists and prohibitive
labor costs motivate automated approaches. However, leading methods using
standard fully convolutional network workflows that are challenged when the
number of OARs becomes large, e.g. > 40. For such scenarios, insights can be
gained from the stratification approaches seen in manual clinical OAR
delineation. This is the goal of our work, where we introduce stratified organ
at risk segmentation (SOARS), an approach that stratifies OARs into anchor,
mid-level, and small & hard (S&H) categories. SOARS stratifies across two
dimensions. The first dimension is that distinct processing pipelines are used
for each OAR category. In particular, inspired by clinical practices, anchor
OARs are used to guide the mid-level and S&H categories. The second dimension
is that distinct network architectures are used to manage the significant
contrast, size, and anatomy variations between different OARs. We use
differentiable neural architecture search (NAS), allowing the network to choose
among 2D, 3D or Pseudo-3D convolutions. Extensive 4-fold cross-validation on
142 H&N cancer patients with 42 manually labeled OARs, the most comprehensive
OAR dataset to date, demonstrates that both pipeline- and NAS-stratification
significantly improves quantitative performance over the state-of-the-art (from
69.52% to 73.68% in absolute Dice scores). Thus, SOARS provides a powerful and
principled means to manage the highly complex segmentation space of OARs.

been reported to vary from being negative to a value as large as 0.46, and
effective thickness, $q$, whose value varies between 0.75 \AA to 3.41 \AA. Such
a large scatter arises due to inconsistent evaluation of these properties and
making assumptions that may not be valid at atomistic scales. Our methodology
combines three separate methods -- uniaxial tension, equibiaxial tension, and
flexural out-of-plane free vibrations of simply supported sheets, which, when
used in tandem in MD, can provide consistent values of $E, \nu$ and $q$. The
only assumption made in the present study is the validity of the continuum

historical comparison is more than fodder for casual discussion among sports
fans, as it is also an issue of critical importance to the multi-billion dollar
professional sport industry and the institutions (e.g. Hall of Fame) charged
with preserving sports history and the legacy of outstanding players and
achievements. To address this cultural heritage management issue, we report an
objective statistical method for renormalizing career achievement metrics, one
that is particularly tailored for common seasonal performance metrics, which
are often aggregated into summary career metrics -- despite the fact that many
player careers span different eras. Remarkably, we find that the method applied
to comprehensive Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association
player data preserves the overall functional form of the distribution of career
achievement, both at the season and career level. As such, subsequent
re-ranking of the top-50 all-time records in MLB and the NBA using renormalized
metrics indicates reordering at the local rank level, as opposed to bulk
reordering by era. This local order refinement signals time-independent
mechanisms underlying annual and career achievement in professional sports,
meaning that appropriately renormalized achievement metrics can be used to
compare players from eras with different season lengths, team strategies, rules
-- and possibly even different sports.

goal in the field of dynamic graph algorithms. While a few such algorithms are
known for spanning trees, matchings, and single-source shortest paths, very
little was known for an important primitive like graph sparsifiers. The
challenge is how to approximately preserve so much information about the graph
(e.g., all-pairs distances and all cuts) without revealing the algorithms'
underlying randomness to the adaptive adversary.
  In this paper we present the first non-trivial efficient adaptive algorithms
for maintaining spanners and cut sparisifers. These algorithms in turn imply
improvements over existing algorithms for other problems. Our first algorithm
maintains a polylog$(n)$-spanner of size $\tilde O(n)$ in polylog$(n)$
amortized update time. The second algorithm maintains an $O(k)$-approximate cut
sparsifier of size $\tilde O(n)$ in $\tilde O(n^{1/k})$ amortized update time,
for any $k\ge1$, which is polylog$(n)$ time when $k=\log(n)$. The third
algorithm maintains a polylog$(n)$-approximate spectral sparsifier in
polylog$(n)$ amortized update time. The amortized update time of both
algorithms can be made worst-case by paying some sub-polynomial factors. Prior
to our result, there were near-optimal algorithms against oblivious adversaries
(e.g. Baswana et al. [TALG'12] and Abraham et al. [FOCS'16]), but the only
non-trivial adaptive dynamic algorithm requires $O(n)$ amortized update time to
maintain $3$- and $5$-spanner of size $O(n^{1+1/2})$ and $O(n^{1+1/3})$,
respectively [Ausiello et al. ESA'05].
  Our results are based on two novel techniques. The first technique, is a
generic black-box reduction that allows us to assume that the graph undergoes
only edge deletions and, more importantly, remains an expander with
almost-uniform degree. The second technique we call proactive resampling. [...]

spinon and holon excitations, resulting in the formation of a spin-polaron,
where a ferromagnetic spin polarization cloud dresses the doped carrier. The
spin-polaron manifests itself as additional spectral weight in the dynamical
correlation functions, which appear simultaneously in the spin- and

structure for ANNS can give an alternative treatment of the approximate
subtrajectory range searching problem studied by de Berg et al. [8]. We also
revisit the time-window data structure for spatial density maps in [6]. Given
$\theta>0$, and $n$ time-stamped points spread over $m$ regions in a map, for

finite volume direct numerical simulation in the fluid domain. In the solid
domain, we solve the dynamic linear elasticity equations using a time-domain
finite element method. The obtained plate averaged displacement spectra
collapse in the low frequency region in outer scaling. However, the high
frequency spectral levels do not collapse in inner units. This spectral
behavior is reasoned using theoretical arguments. We further study the sources
of plate excitation using a novel formulation. This formulation expresses the
average displacement spectra of the plate as an integrated contribution from
the fluid sources within the channel. Analysis of the net displacement source
reveals that at the plate natural frequencies, the contribution of the fluid
sources to the plate excitation peaks in the buffer layer. The corresponding
wall-normal width is found to be $\approx 0.75\delta$. We analyze the
decorrelated features of the sources using spectral Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) of the net displacement source. We enforce the
orthogonality of the modes in an inner product with a symmetric positive
definite kernel. The dominant spectral POD mode contributes to the entire plate
excitation. The contribution of the remaining modes from the different
wall-normal regions undergo destructive interference resulting in zero net
contribution. The envelope of the dominant mode further shows that the location

the database community. In recent years commutativity has been shown to be a
key ingredient to enabling multicore concurrency in contexts such as
parallelizing compilers, transactional memory, speculative execution and, more
broadly, software scalability. Despite this interest, it remains an open
question as to how a data structure's commutativity specification can be
verified automatically from its implementation.
  In this paper, we describe techniques to automatically prove the correctness
of method commutativity conditions from data structure implementations. We
introduce a new kind of abstraction that characterizes the ways in which the
effects of two methods differ depending on the order in which the methods are
applied, and abstracts away effects of methods that would be the same
regardless of the order. We then describe a novel algorithm that reduces the
problem to reachability, so that off-the-shelf program analysis tools can
perform the reasoning necessary for proving commutativity. Finally, we describe
a proof-of-concept implementation and experimental results, showing that our
tool can verify commutativity of data structures such as a memory cell,
counter, two-place Set, array-based stack, queue, and a rudimentary hash table.
We conclude with a discussion of what makes a data structure's commutativity
provable with today's tools and what needs to be done to prove more in the

gravitational waves in the milli-Hertz frequency band. Of the tens of millions
of galactic binaries with periods shorter than an hour, it is estimated that a
few tens of thousand will be resolved by the future Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA). The unresolved remainder will be the main source of ``noise''
between 1-3 milli-Hertz. Typical galactic binaries are millions of years from
merger, and consequently their signals will persist for the the duration of the
LISA mission. Extracting tens of thousands of overlapping galactic signals and
characterizing the unresolved component is a central challenge in LISA data
analysis, and a key contribution to arriving at a global solution that
simultaneously fits for all signals in the band. Here we present an end-to-end
analysis pipeline for galactic binaries that uses trans-dimensional Bayesian
inference to develop a time-evolving catalog of sources as data arrive from the
LISA constellation.

direction of arrival (DOA) of the impinging signals. For linear crossed-dipole
arrays, as shown by our analysis, due to inherent limitation of the structure,
it can only track one DOA parameter and two polarisation parameters. For full
four-dimensional (4-D, 2 DOA and 2 polarization parameters) estimation, we
could extend the linear crossed-dipole array to the planar case. In this paper,
instead of extending the array geometry, we replace the crossed-dipoles by
tripoles and construct a linear tripole array. It is proved that such a
structure can estimate the 2-D DOA and 2-D polarisation information effectively
in general and a dimension-reduction based MUSIC algorithm is developed so that
the 4-D estimation problem can be simplified into two separate 2-D estimation
problems, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the solution.
The Cramr-Rao Bound (CRB) is also derived as a reference for algorithm
performance. A brief comparison between the planar crossed-dipole array and the
linear tripole array is performed at last, showing that although the planar
structure has a better performance, it is achieved at the cost of increased
physical size.

applications. However, the high cost of computations has so far impeded a
complete analysis of the uncertainty budget of such calculations. Purpose:
Starting from NN potentials up to fifth order (N4LO) combined with
leading-order 3N forces, we study how the order-by-order convergence of the
chiral expansion and confidence intervals for the 3N contact and
contact-plus-one-pion-exchange low-energy constants (cE and cD) contribute to
the overall uncertainty budget of many-body calculations of neutron-He elastic
scattering. Methods: We compute structure and reaction observables for three-,
four- and five-nucleon systems within the ab initio frameworks of the no-core
shell model an no-core shell model with continuum. Using a small set of design
runs, we construct a Gaussian process model (GPM) that acts as a statistical
emulator for the theory. With this, we gain insight into how uncertainties in
the 3N low-energy constants propagate throughout the calculation and determine
the Bayesian posterior distribution of these parameters with Markov-Chain
Monte-Carlo.

assembly of Milky Way-mass ( $M_{\mathrm{vir}} \approx 7 \times 10^{11}$
$M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$) galaxies in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting
dark matter (SIDM) models. Our SIDM model adopts a constant cross-section of 1
cm$^2$/g. We find that SMBH formation is suppressed in the early universe due
to SIDM coring. SMBH-SMBH mergers are also suppressed in SIDM as a consequence
of the lower number of SMBHs formed. Lack of initial merger-driven SMBH growth
in turn delays SMBH growth by billions of years in SIDM compared to CDM.
Further, we find that this delayed growth suppresses SMBH accretion in the
largest progenitors of the main SIDM galaxies during the first 5 Gyrs of their
evolution. Nonetheless, by $z = 0.8$ the CDM and SIDM SMBH masses differ only
by around 0.2 dex, so that both remain compatible with the $M_{BH}-M_{*}$
relation. We show that the reduced accretion causes the SIDM SMBHs to less
aggressively regulate star formation in their host galaxies than their CDM
counterparts, resulting in a factor of 3 or more stars being produced over the
lifetime of the SIDM galaxies compared to the CDM galaxies. Our results
highlight a new way in which SIDM can affect the growth and merger history of
SMBHs and ultimately give rise to very different galaxy evolution compared to
the classic CDM model.

the dispersed and fluid phases are two-way coupled. The drag force which
couples fluid and particle momentum depends on the undisturbed fluid velocity
at the particle location, and this latter quantity requires modelling. We
demonstrate that the undisturbed fluid velocity, in the low particle Reynolds
number limit, can be related exactly to the discrete Green's function of the
discrete Stokes equations. The method is general in that it can be extended to
other partial differential equations which may be associated with
particle-laden flows, such as the thermal energy equation or Maxwell's
equations. In this work, we demonstrate the method of discrete Green's
functions by obtaining these functions for the Navier-Stokes equations at low
particle Reynolds number in a two-plane channel geometry. We perform
verification at low and finite particle Reynolds number for the case of a
point-particle settling under gravity parallel to a plane wall, for different
wall normal separations. In comparing to other point-particle schemes the
discrete Green's function approach is the most robust at low particle Reynolds
number, accurate at all wall-normal separations and is the most accurate in the
near wall region at finite Reynolds number. We discuss how the accuracy away
from the wall at finite Reynolds number could be improved by appealing to
Oseen-like discrete Green's functions. Finally we demonstrate that the discrete

Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) by distinguishing between trajectories of
different dark matter species. We further adapt LPT to include the effects of a
quantum pressure, which is necessary to generate correct initial conditions for
ultralight axion simulations. Based on LPT, our modified scheme is extremely
efficient on large scales and it can be extended to an arbitrary number of
particle species at very little computational cost. This allows for computation
of self-consistent initial conditions in mixed dark matter models.

introduce a novel global-local attention mechanism between global tokens and
regular input tokens. We also show that combining global-local attention with
relative position encodings and a Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)
pre-training objective allows ETC to encode structured inputs. We achieve
state-of-the-art results on four natural language datasets requiring long

amounts of data by distributing processing across connected devices. Two key
challenges to achieving this goal are heterogeneity in devices compute
resources and topology constraints on which devices can communicate with each
other. We address these challenges by developing the first network-aware
distributed learning optimization methodology where devices optimally share
local data processing and send their learnt parameters to a server for
aggregation at certain time intervals. Unlike traditional federated learning
frameworks, our method enables devices to offload their data processing tasks
to each other, with these decisions determined through a convex data transfer
optimization problem that trades off costs associated with devices processing,
offloading, and discarding data points. We analytically characterize the
optimal data transfer solution for different fog network topologies, showing
for example that the value of offloading is approximately linear in the range
of computing costs in the network. Our subsequent experiments on testbed
datasets we collect confirm that our algorithms are able to improve network
resource utilization substantially without sacrificing the accuracy of the
learned model. In these experiments, we also study the effect of network
dynamics, quantifying the impact of nodes entering or exiting the network on

decision-dependent and the uncertain parameters only become observable after an
often costly investment. Yet, most of the literature assumes that uncertain
parameters can be observed for free and that the sequence in which they are
revealed is independent of the decision-maker's actions. To fill this gap. we
consider two- and multi-stage robust optimization problems in which part of the
decision variables control the time of information discovery. Thus, information
can be discovered (at least in part) by making strategic exploratory
investments in previous stages. We propose a novel dynamic formulation of the
problem and prove its correctness. We leverage our model to provide a solution
method inspired from the K-adaptability approximation. We reformulate the

epidemiological models suggest this may be unavoidable for months at a time,
despite the heavy social and human cost of physically isolating people.
Alternatively, people could retreat into socially or economically defined
defensive zones, with more interactions inside their zone than across zones.
Starting from a complete lockdown, zones could facilitate responsible reopening
of education, government, and firms, as a well-implemented structure can
dramatically slow the diffusion of the disease. This paper provides a framework
for understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of zones for social
distancing.

""terathanasia"", a defected fetus is more likely to be spontaneously aborted.
Other complications in the data included left truncation, right censoring,

stratified on live birth against spontaneous abortion, which was itself a
post-exposure variable and hence did not lead to a causal interpretation of the
stratified results. In this paper we aim to estimate and provide inference for
the causal parameters of scientific interest, including the principal effects,
making use of the missing data mechanism informed by ""terathanasia"". The rare
events with missing outcomes led to multiple sensitivity analyses where the

a set of keyphrases. A new setting is recently introduced into this problem, in
which, given a document, the model needs to predict a set of keyphrases and
simultaneously determine the appropriate number of keyphrases to produce.
Previous work in this setting employs a sequential decoding process to generate
keyphrases. However, such a decoding method ignores the intrinsic hierarchical
compositionality existing in the keyphrase set of a document. Moreover,
previous work tends to generate duplicated keyphrases, which wastes time and
computing resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose an exclusive
hierarchical decoding framework that includes a hierarchical decoding process
and either a soft or a hard exclusion mechanism. The hierarchical decoding
process is to explicitly model the hierarchical compositionality of a keyphrase
set. Both the soft and the hard exclusion mechanisms keep track of
previously-predicted keyphrases within a window size to enhance the diversity
of the generated keyphrases. Extensive experiments on multiple KG benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to generate less
duplicated and more accurate keyphrases.

a subject of growing interest in the domain of photogrammetry and remote

as snake model, has been studied to extract buildings from aerial and satellite
imagery. However, this task is still very challenging due to the complexity of
building size, shape, and its surrounding environment. This complexity leads to
a major obstacle for carrying out a reliable large-scale building extraction,
since the involved prior information and assumptions on building such as shape,
size, and color cannot be generalized over large areas. This paper presents an
efficient snake model to overcome such challenge, called Super-Resolution-based
Snake Model (SRSM). The SRSM operates on high-resolution LiDAR-based elevation
images -- called z-images -- generated by a super-resolution process applied to
LiDAR data. The involved balloon force model is also improved to shrink or
inflate adaptively, instead of inflating the snake continuously. This method is
applicable for a large scale such as city scale and even larger, while having a
high level of automation and not requiring any prior knowledge nor training
data from the urban scenes (hence unsupervised). It achieves high overall
accuracy when tested on various datasets. For instance, the proposed SRSM
yields an average area-based Quality of 86.57% and object-based Quality of
81.60% on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark datasets. Compared to other methods
using this benchmark dataset, this level of accuracy is highly desirable even

color in understanding the meanings of words, especially in identifying
synonyms and antonyms. First, we quantify the color distribution of words from
the book cover images and analyze the correlation between the color and meaning
of the word. Second, we try to retrain word embeddings with the color
distribution of words as a constraint. By observing the changes in the word
embeddings of synonyms and antonyms before and after re-training, we aim to
understand the kind of words that have positive or negative effects in their
word embeddings when incorporating text color information.

conducting electrons would screen out static internal electric fields. In 1965,
Anderson and Blount proposed the concept of 'ferroelectric metal', however, it
is only until recently that very rare ferroelectric metals were reported. Here,
by combining high-throughput ab initio calculations and data-driven machine
learning method with new electronic orbital based descriptors, we
systematically investigated a large family (2,964) of two-dimensional (2D)
bimetal phosphates, and discovered 60 stable ferroelectrics with out-of-plane
polarization, including 16 ferroelectric metals and 44 ferroelectric
semiconductors that contain seven multiferroics. The ferroelectricity origins
from spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the opposite displacements of
bimetal atoms, and the full-d-orbital coinage metal elements cause larger
displacements and polarization than other elements. For 2D ferroelectric
metals, the odd electrons per unit cell without spin polarization may lead to a
half-filled energy band around Fermi level and is responsible for the
metallicity. It is revealed that the conducting electrons mainly move on a
single-side surface of the 2D layer, while both the ionic and electric
contributions to polarization come from the other side and are vertical to the
above layer, thereby causing the coexistence of metallicity and
ferroelectricity. Van der Waals heterostructures based on ferroelectric metals
may enable the change of Schottky barrier height or the Schottky-Ohmic contact
type and induce a dramatic change of their vertical transport properties. Our
work greatly expands the family of 2D ferroelectric metals and will spur
further exploration of 2D ferroelectric metals.

propagation for low-latency sliding window decoding (SWD) of spatially coupled
low density parity check (SC-LDPC) codes. Building on the recently introduced
idea of \emph{check node (CN) doping} of regular SC-LDPC codes, here we employ
variable node (VN) doping to fix (set to a known value) a subset of variable
nodes in the coupling chain. Both of these doping methods have the effect of
allowing SWD to recover from error propagation, at a cost of a slight rate
loss. Experimental results show that, similar to CN doping, VN doping improves
performance by up to two orders of magnitude compared to undoped SC-LDPC codes
in the typical signal-to-noise ratio operating range. Further, compared to CN
doping, VN doping has the advantage of not requiring any changes to the
decoding process.In addition, a log-likelihood-ratio based window extension
algorithm is proposed to reduce the effect of error propagation. Using this
approach, we show that decoding latency can be reduced by up to a significant
fraction without suffering any loss in performance.

from Cyg X-3, the other three sources have large accretion disks, and there is
evidence of a high orbital inclination. Therefore, any large scale geometrical
change in the accretion disk can cause local obscuration events. On the other
hand, Cyg X-3 orbits its Wolf-Rayet companion star inside the heavy stellar
wind obscuring the X-ray source. We study here whether the peculiar X-ray
spectra observed from all four sources can be explained by local obscuration
events. We fit the source spectra with two physically motivated models
describing either a scenario where all the intrinsic emission is reprocessed in
the surrounding matter or where the emitter is surrounded by a thick torus with
variable opening angle. We show that the X-ray spectra during specific times
are similar in all four sources likely arising from the high-density
environments where they are embedded. The fitted models suggest that a
low-luminosity phase preceding an intense flaring episode in the 2015 outburst
of V404 Cyg is heavily obscured, but intrinsically very bright
(super-Eddington) accretion state. Similar spectral evolution to that of V404
Cyg is observed from the recent, unusually low-luminosity state of GRS
1915+105. The modeling results point to a geometry change in the (outflowing)
obscuring matter in V404 Cyg and GRS 1915+105, which is also linked to the
radio (jet) evolution. All sources display obscured X-ray emission but with
different intrinsic luminosities which points towards different factors causing
the obscuration. This work highlights the importance of taking into account the
reprocessing of the X-ray emission in the surrounding medium in the modeling of
the X-ray spectra that may well take place in other sources as well.

convection zone can provide information about the future solar cycles. We
consider two types of dynamo models: models with regular variations of the
alpha-effect, and models with stochastic fluctuations, simulating `long'- and
'short-memory' types of magnetic activity variations. It is found that
torsional oscillation parameters, such the zonal acceleration, show a
considerable correlation with the magnitude of the subsequent cycles with a
time lag of 11-20 yr. The sign of the correlation and the time-lag parameters
can depend on the depth and latitude of the torsional oscillations as well as
on the properties of long-term (`centennial') variations of the dynamo cycles.
The strongest correlations are found for the zonal acceleration at high
latitudes at the base of the convection zone. The model results demonstrate
that helioseismic observations of the torsional oscillations can be useful for
advanced prediction of the solar cycles, one-two sunspot cycles ahead.

improves the average success rate of NISQ applications by 1.47X. Surprisingly,
the additional gates for uncomputation create ancilla with better locality, and
result in substantially fewer swap gates and less gate noise overall. SQUARE

objective diagnostic to ophthalmologists. At first, feature extraction is a
fundamental step. One of these retinal features is the fovea. The fovea is a
small fossa on the fundus. The main vessels diverge from the optic nerve head
and follow a specific course that can be geometrically modeled as a parabola,
with a common vertex inside the optic nerve head and the fovea located along
the apex of this parabola curve. Therefore, based on this assumption, the main
retinal blood vessels are segmented and fitted to a parabolic model. With
respect to the core vascular structure, we can thus detect fovea in the fundus
images. For the vessel segmentation, our algorithm addresses the image locally
where homogeneity of features is more likely to occur. The algorithm is
composed of 4 steps: multi-overlapping windows, local Radon transform, vessel
validation, and parabolic fitting. In order to extract blood vessels,
sub-vessels should be extracted in local windows. The high contrast between
blood vessels and image background in the images cause the vessels to be
associated with peaks in the Radon space. The largest vessels, using a high
threshold of the Radon transform, determine the main course or overall
configuration of the blood vessels which when fitted to a parabola, leads to
the future localization of the fovea. In effect, with an accurate fit, the
fovea normally lies along the slope joining the vertex and the focus. The
darkest region along this line is indicative of the fovea. To evaluate our
method, we used 220 fundus images from a rural database (MUMS-DB) and one
public one (DRIVE). The results show that among 20 images of the first public
database (DRIVE) we detected fovea in 85\% of them. Also for the MUMS-DB

non-minimal coupling $F=1+\delta F$ as $H\propto\sqrt{F}$. Deviations from
Einstein gravity $\delta F$ induce a corresponding deviations of the potential
$\delta V$ from a constant value and modify the dynamics from pure de Sitter
exponential expansion. We analyze the models with exponential power-law
evolution of the scale factor and we find the equations of influence of
non-minimal coupling, choosing it in the special form, on the potential and
kinetic energies. Such consideration allows us to substitute the physical
potential into obtained equations and then to calculate the non-minimal
coupling function and kinetic term that are define GSTG parameters. With this
method, we reconstruct GSTG for polynomial, exponential, Higgs,
Higgs-Starobinsky and Coleman-Weinberg potentials. Special attention we pay to
parameters of cosmological perturbations and prove correspondence obtained
solutions to observational data from Planck.

simple reason that there is no kernel designed to represent them and their
unique characteristics in full generality. Existing sequential kernels ignore
the time indices, with many assuming that the series must be regularly-spaced;
some such kernels are not even psd. In this manuscript, we show that a ""series
kernel"" that is general enough to represent irregularly-spaced multivariate
time series may be built out of well-known ""vector kernels"". We also show that
all series kernels constructed using our methodology are psd, and are thus
widely applicable. We demonstrate this point by formulating a Gaussian
process-based strategy - with our series kernel at its heart - to make
predictions about test series when given a training set. We validate the
strategy experimentally by estimating its generalisation error on multiple
datasets and comparing it to relevant baselines. We also demonstrate that our
series kernel may be used for the more traditional setting of time series
classification, where its performance is broadly in line with alternative

Satisfactory visual segments cannot be obtained using FCM. Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms and has good
convergence speed and fewer parameters compared to Genetic Algorithms (GAs). An
optimized version of PSO can be combined with FCM to act as a proper

which improves in the calculation of various hyper parameters like inertia
weight, learning factors over standard PSO, using insights from swarm

presents a new image segmentation algorithm called Adaptive Particle Swarm

Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) and Fuzzy C-means clustering.
Experimental results show that APSOF algorithm has edge over FCM in correctly

This paper aims to search for overdensities of 850-$\mu$m sources in order to
select the fields that are most likely to be genuine protoclusters. Of the 46
candidate protoclusters, 25 have significant overdensities ($>$5 times the
field counts), 11 have intermediate overdensities (3--5 times the field counts)
and 10 have no overdensity ($<$3 times the field counts) of 850-$\mu$m sources.
We find that the enhanced number densities are unlikely to be the result of
sample variance. Compared with the number counts of another sample selected
from Planck's compact source catalogues, this [PHz+PCCS]-selected sample has a
higher fraction of candidate protoclusters with significant overdensities,
though both samples show overdensities of 850-$\mu$m sources above intermediate
level. Based on the estimated star-formation rate densities (SFRDs), we suggest
that both samples can efficiently select protoclusters with starbursting
galaxies near the redshift at which the global field SFRD peaks ($2 < z < 3$).
Based on the confirmation of overdensities found here, future follow-up

theory (DFT) calculations. For samples grown at or below substrate temperatures
of 265 K, the resulting ultrathin Tc films are dominated by almost
upright-standing molecules. The molecular arrangement is very similar to the Tc
bulk phase, with only slightly higher average angle between the conjugated

Judging from carbon K-edge X-ray absorption spectra, the orientation of the Tc

well as for (sub)mono- to several-monolayer coverages. Annealing to room

transition is correlated with a lower packing density and requires a
well-chosen amount of thermal energy. Therefore, we attribute the resulting

solution provided herein is a deterministic algorithm, and is not a Monte Carlo
based technique. As a result, simulations show that when compared to
alternative approaches, a more likely set of system parameters can be found
within a fixed computation time, which better explain the observations of the

flashes are determined by both the medium density distribution index $k$ and
the electron spectral index $p$, we apply the RS model of the thin shell case

Lyapunov function for the combined system-optimizer dynamics, which shows that
asymptotic stability can be obtained if the sampling time is sufficiently
short. The results constitute an extension to existing attractivity results
which hold in the simplified setting where inequality constraints are either
not present or inactive in the region of attraction considered. Moreover, with
respect to the established results on robust asymptotic stability of suboptimal
model predictive control, we develop a framework that takes into account the
optimizer's dynamics and does not require decrease of the objective function
across iterates. By extending these results, the gap between theory and
practice of the standard real-time iteration strategy is bridged and asymptotic

heritability that varies with the trait value. When applied to birth weight

high birth weight are less heritable traits than medium birth weight. On the

synchronization between two multi-longitudinal-mode Fabry-Perot lasers commonly
driven by a super-luminescent diode. Legitimate users dynamically select one of
the longitudinal modes according to private control codes to achieve mode-shift
keying chaos synchronization. The two remote chaotic light waveforms are
quantized to generate two raw random bit streams, and then those bits
corresponding to chaos synchronization are sifted as shared keys by comparing
the control codes. In this method, the transition time, i.e., the chaos
synchronization recovery time is determined by the rising time of the control
codes rather than the laser transition response time, so the key distribution
rate is improved greatly. Our experiment achieved 0.75-Gbit/s key distribution
rate with a bit error rate of 3.8*10-3 over 160-km fiber transmission with
dispersion compensation. The entropy rate of the laser chaos is evaluated as 16

their celebrated rate theories, but there are still elusive aspects in the
temperature-dependent phase transition kinetics of molecular systems. Here I
present a theory based on microcanonical thermostatistics that establishes a
simple and direct temperature dependence for all rate constants, including the
forward and the reverse rate constants, the equilibrium constant, and the
nucleation rate. By considering a generic model that mimic the microcanonical
temperature of molecular systems in a region close to a first-order phase
transition, I obtain shape-free relations between kinetics and thermodynamics
physical quantities which are validated through stochastic simulations.
Additionally, the rate theory is applied to results obtained from protein
folding and ice nucleation experiments, demonstrating that the expressions
derived here can be used to describe the experimental data of a wide range of
molecular systems.

is widely used. We find that the energy of a potential magnetic field in a
rectangular domain with periodic lateral boundary conditions is less than that
of the field with a fixed normal component on all six boundaries. To make use
of this lower energy potential field in the analysis of relative magnetic
helicity, we introducing a new definition for magnetic helicity for the
magnetic field, which involves the periodic potential field. We apply this
definition to a sequence of analytic solutions and a numerical simulation. The
results show that our new gauge-invariant helicity is very close to the
current-carrying part of the relative magnetic helicity of the original
magnetic field. We find also that the ratio between the current-carrying
helicity and the relative magnetic helicity for the original and our defined
relative helicity show different behavior. It seems that the new helicity is
more sensitive to the component of the field due to the electric current in the

3D semantic labeling has been a challenging task. It has three problems: (1)
the difficulty of classifying point clouds around boundaries of objects from
different classes, (2) the diversity of shapes within the same class, and (3)
the scale differences between classes. In this study, we propose a novel double
self-attention convolutional network called the DAPnet. The double
self-attention includes the point attention module (PAM) and the group
attention module (GAM). For problem (1), the PAM can effectively assign
different weights based on the relevance of point clouds in adjacent areas.
Meanwhile, for the problem (2), the GAM enhances the correlation between
groups, i.e., grouped features within the same classes. To solve the problem
(3), we adopt a multiscale radius to construct the groups and concatenate
extracted hierarchical features with the output of the corresponding upsampling
process. Under the ISPRS 3D Semantic Labeling Contest dataset, the DAPnet
outperforms the benchmark by 85.2\% with an overall accuracy of 90.7\%. By
conducting ablation comparisons, we find that the PAM effectively improves the
model than the GAM. The incorporation of the double self-attention module has
an average of 7\% improvement on the pre-class accuracy. Plus, the DAPnet
consumes a similar training time to those without the attention modules for
model convergence. The DAPnet can assign different weights to features based on
the relevance between point clouds and their neighbors, which effectively
improves classification performance. The source codes are available at:

when the random walker is biased by a velocity field in a uniformly growing
domain. Concrete examples for such domains include growing biological cells or
lipid vesicles, biofilms and tissues, but also macroscopic systems such as
expanding aquifers during rainy periods, or the expanding universe. The
considered CTRW can be subdiffusive, normal diffusive or superdiffusive,
including the particular case of a L\'evy flight. We first consider the case of
zero velocity field. In the subdiffusive case, we reveal an interesting time
dependence of the kurtosis of the particle probability density function. In
particular, for a suitable parameter choice, we find that the propagator, which
is fat tailed at short times, may cross over to a Gaussian-like propagator. We
subsequently incorporate the effect of the velocity field and derive a
bi-fractional diffusion-advection equation encoding the time evolution of the
particle distribution. We apply this equation to study the mixing kinetics of
two diffusing pulses, whose peaks move towards each other under the action of
velocity fields acting in opposite directions. This deterministic motion of the
peaks, together with the diffusive spreading of each pulse, tends to increase
particle mixing, thereby counteracting the peak separation induced by the
domain growth. As a result of this competition, different regimes of mixing
arise. In the case of L\'evy flights, apart from the non-mixing regime, one has
two different mixing regimes in the long-time limit, depending on the exact
parameter choice: In one of these regimes, mixing is mainly driven by diffusive
spreading, while in the other mixing is controlled by the velocity fields
acting on each pulse. Possible implications for encounter-controlled reactions
in real systems are discussed.

that it combines multiple bets into a wager that can generate a total payout
given by the multiplication of the individual odds of its parts. These
potentially important returns come however at an increased risk of a loss.
Indeed, the presence of a single incorrect bet in this selection would make the
whole accumulator lose. The complexity of selecting a set of matches to place
an accumulator bet on, as well as the number of opportunities to identify
winning combinations have both dramatically increased with the easier access to
online and offline bookmakers that bettors have nowadays. We address this
relatively under-studied combinatorial aspect of sports betting, and propose a
binary optimization model for the problem of selecting the most promising
combinations of matches, in terms of their total potential payout and
probability of a win, to form an accumulator bet. The results of an ongoing
computational experiment, in which our model is applied to real data pertaining
to the four main football leagues in the world over a complete season, are
presented and compared to those of single bet selection methods.

collisions at high collision energies effectively decouples from the thermal
physics of the fireball. With full decoupling at LHC energies the chiral
condensate relaxes to its vacuum expectation value on a much shorter time scale
than the typical evolution time of the fluid dynamical fields and their
fluctuations. In particular, the net-baryon density remains coupled to the bulk
evolution at all collision energies. As the mass scales of the hadrons are
controlled by the chiral condensate, it is reasonable to employ vacuum masses
in the statistical description of the hadron production at the chemical
freeze-out for high collision energies. We predict that at lower collision
energies the coupling of the chiral condensate to the thermal medium gradually
increases with consequences for the related hadronic masses. A new estimate for
the location of the freeze-out curve takes these effects into account.

mitigate this problem, functionalization of 2D MoS2 using thiols has emerged as
one of the key strategies for engineering defects. Herein, we demonstrate an
approach to controllably engineer the SVs of chemically exfoliated MoS2

to minimize the cost for imbalance satisfaction in real-time by proposing a set
of optimal personalized prices to the prosumers. On the other hand, the
prosumers, as price taker and self-interested agents, want to maximize their
profit by changing their supplies or demands and providing flexibility based on
the proposed personalized prices. We model this problem as a bilevel
optimization problem. We first show that the optimal solution of this bilevel
optimization problem can be found by solving an equivalent convex problem. In
contrast to the state-of-the-art Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)-based approach
to solve bilevel problems, this convex equivalent has very low computation time

prove that, under the personalized pricing scheme, more prosumers contribute to

determined by non-covalent interactions that arise from an interplay between
chemical composition and molecular microstructural organization. The reversible
nature of non-covalent interactions gives supramolecular materials responsive
properties that are otherwise difficult to obtain, such as becoming rigid as a
response to mechanical stress. How exactly non-covalent interactions emerge
from microstructure, how they might change in response to applied force or
deformation is not understood. Here we combine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
and rheology to directly probe the role of chain proximity in polymer
complexes. We observe an increase in chain proximity in response to imposed
flow, which we hypothesize to originate from enhanced hydrogen bonding. The
chain proximity is directly correlated to rod climbing and shear banding. Flow
persists only when applied stresses are low, suggesting a stress-induced
thickening mechanism. We verify that hydrogen bond disruptors can turn off both
the non-trivial flow behavior and the spectroscopic evidence of chain
proximity. The combined rheo-NMR approach shows that it is possible to directly
observe the molecular origins behind supramolecular mechanics, paving the way

On the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps

to equations G[z]=0 in Banach spaces, using k-transversality concepts, which
may geometrically be interpreted as generalized cones spanned by submanifolds,
each characterized by a certain expansion rate. The number of manifolds in the
cone, as well as their expansion rates, are recursively increased until an
appropriate desingularization of the cone is build up with linearization
expressed by first k+1 derivatives of the singular operator at the base point.
Along these lines, a well-defined submersion is constructed in the cone with
uniformly bounded inverse when approaching the singularity. The techniques are
restricted to curves, possibly touching by high order the singular locus of G,
but ultimately traversing it, in this way defining an isolated singularity of
the operator family given by the linearization along the curve. The fine
resolution of the cone by the manifolds represents an improvement compared to
measuring the variation of the nonlinear operator exclusively by the overall
behaviour of the determinant. In case of finite dimensions, each half-cone is
characterized by a constant topological degree that can be used to investigate
a solution curve in general position with respect to secondary bifurcation. The
core of all considerations is given by some characteristic patterns, valid in
the system of undetermined coefficients that allow for detailed analysis of the
power series resulting from plugging the power series of the ansatz into the

can be considered semi-infinite relative to that of the film. As the relative
thickness of the substrate is decreased, the bending stiffness of the film
dominates, causing the bilayer to transition to either local wrinkling or a
global buckling instability. In this work optical microscopy was used to study
the critical parameters that determine the emergence of local wrinkling or
global buckling of freestanding bilayer films consisting of a thin rigid

used to create a buckling phase diagram which describes the behaviour of the

the MRI microstructure community. While some progress has been made in
overcoming this challenge using models, signal representations and tractography
algorithms, these approaches are ultimately limited by their key assumptions or
by the lack of specificity of the diffusion signal alone. In order to alleviate
these limitations, we combine diffusion-relaxation MR acquisitions
incorporating tensor-valued diffusion encoding, Monte-Carlo signal inversions
that extract non-parametric intra-voxel distributions of diffusion tensors and
relaxation rates, and density-based clustering techniques. This new approach,
called ""Monte-Carlo density-peak clustering"" (MC-DPC), first delineates
clusters in the diffusion-orientation subspace of the fiber-like
diffusion-relaxation components output by Monte-Carlo signal inversions and
then draws from the statistical aspect of these inversion algorithms to compute
the median and interquartile range of orientation-resolved means of
diffusivities and relaxation rates. Evaluating MC-DPC on tensor-valued
diffusion-encoded and T2-weighted correlated datasets in silico and in vivo, we
demonstrate its ability to simultaneously capture sub-voxel fiber orientations
and cones of uncertainty, and measure fiber-specific diffusion-relaxation
properties that are consistent with the known anatomy and existing literature.
Straightforwardly translatable to other diffusion-relaxation correlation
experiments probing $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, MC-DPC shows potential in tracking
bundle-specific patient-control group differences and longitudinal
microstructural changes, enabling new tools for microstructure-informed

computer vision applications including medical diagnosis and autonomous
driving. One of the major concerns that these models face is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Realizing the importance of this issue,
more researchers are working towards developing robust models that are less
affected by adversarial attacks. Adversarial training method shows promising
results in this direction. In adversarial training regime, models are trained
with mini-batches augmented with adversarial samples. Fast and simple methods
(e.g., single-step gradient ascent) are used for generating adversarial
samples, in order to reduce computational complexity. It is shown that models
trained using single-step adversarial training method (adversarial samples are
generated using non-iterative method) are pseudo robust. Further, this pseudo
robustness of models is attributed to the gradient masking effect. However,
existing works fail to explain when and why gradient masking effect occurs
during single-step adversarial training. In this work, (i) we show that models
trained using single-step adversarial training method learn to prevent the
generation of single-step adversaries, and this is due to over-fitting of the
model during the initial stages of training, and (ii) to mitigate this effect,
we propose a single-step adversarial training method with dropout scheduling.
Unlike models trained using existing single-step adversarial training methods,
models trained using the proposed single-step adversarial training method are
robust against both single-step and multi-step adversarial attacks, and the
performance is on par with models trained using computationally expensive
multi-step adversarial training methods, in white-box and black-box settings.

alternative to mean bias reduction. The estimator is obtained as solution to a
modified score equation ensuring smaller asymptotic median bias than the
maximum likelihood estimator. This paper provides a simplified algebraic form
of the adjustment term for general regular models. With the new formula, the
estimation procedure benefits from a considerable computational gain by
avoiding multiple summations and thus allows an efficient implementation. More
importantly, the new formulation allows to highlight how the median bias
reduction adjustment can be obtained by adding an extra term to the mean bias
reduction adjustment. Illustrations are provided through new applications of
median bias reduction to two regression models not belonging to the generalized
linear models class, extended beta regression and beta-binomial regression.
Mean bias reduction is also provided here for the latter model. Simulation
studies show remarkable componentwise median centering of the median bias

resistor and its parasitic capacitance in high-speed applications. To overcome
this drawback, a capacitive feedback TIA (CF-TIA) can be used. The gain and
bandwidth performance of the CF-TIA are theoretically equivalent to those of
the RF-TIA. Although CF-TIA has been introduced in previous studies for
reducing thermal noise and addressing the difficulty in integrating a high

at anytime and anywhere. However, in an IoT, edge computing sessions are often
ephemeral, i.e., they last for a short period of time and can often be
discontinued once the current application usage is completed or the edge
devices leave the system due to factors such as mobility. Therefore, in this
paper, the problem of ephemeral edge computing in an IoT is studied by
considering scenarios in which edge computing operates within a limited time
period. To this end, a novel online framework is proposed in which a source
edge node offloads its computing tasks from sensors within an area to
neighboring edge nodes for distributed task computing, within the limited
period of time of an ephemeral edge computing system. The online nature of the
framework allows the edge nodes to optimize their task allocation and decide on
which neighbors to use for task processing, even when the tasks are revealed to
the source edge node in an online manner, and the information on future task
arrivals is unknown. The proposed framework essentially maximizes the number of
computed tasks by jointly considering the communication and computation
latency. To solve the problem, an online greedy algorithm is proposed and
solved by using the primal-dual approach. Since the primal problem provides an
upper bound of the original dual problem, the competitive ratio of the online
approach is analytically derived as a function of the task sizes and the data
rates of the edge nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed online
algorithm can achieve a near-optimal task allocation with an optimality gap
that is no higher than 7.1% compared to the offline, optimal solution with
complete knowledge of all tasks.

to be capable of mastering complicated decision-making tasks, the sample
complexity of these methods has remained a hurdle to utilizing them in many
real-world applications. In this regard, model-based reinforcement learning
proposes some remedies. Yet, inherently, model-based methods are more
computationally expensive and susceptible to sub-optimality. One reason is that
model-generated data are always less accurate than real data, and this often
leads to inaccurate transition and reward function models. With the aim to
mitigate this problem, this work presents the notion of survival by discussing
cases in which the agent's goal is to survive and its analogy to maximizing the
expected rewards. To that end, a substitute model for the reward function
approximator is introduced that learns to avoid terminal states rather than to
maximize accumulated rewards from safe states. Focusing on terminal states, as
a small fraction of state-space, reduces the training effort drastically. Next,
a model-based reinforcement learning method is proposed (Survive) to train an
agent to avoid dangerous states through a safety map model built upon temporal
credit assignment in the vicinity of terminal states. Finally, the performance
of the presented algorithm is investigated, along with a comparison between the
proposed and current methods.

contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of
COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=635) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg,
n=29,859) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we

A few open
clusters show some evidence on this mechanism but there is no systematic study.
In this work, we investigate the role of radial migration on the Galactic disk
based on a large sample of 146 open clusters with homogeneous metallicity and
age from Netopil et al. and kinematics calculated from Gaia DR2. The birth site
Rb, guiding radius Rg and other orbital parameters are calculated, and the
migration distance |Rg-Rb| is obtained, which is a combination of metallicity,
kinematics and age information. It is found that 44% open clusters have
|Rg-Rb|< 1 kpc, for which radial migration (churning) is not significant. Among
the remaining 56% open clusters with |Rg-Rb|> 1 kpc, young ones with t<1.0 Gyr
tend to migrate inward, while older clusters usually migrate outward. Different
mechanisms of radial migration between young and old clusters are suggested
based on their different migration rates, Galactic locations and orbital
parameters. For the old group, we propose a plausible way to estimate migration
rate and obtain a reasonable value of 1.5(+-0.5) kpc/Gyr based on ten
intermediate-age clusters at the outer disk, where the existence of several
special clusters implies its complicate formation history.

changes in the singular limit which gives rise to additional boundary layers at

the droplet as a function of the actuating forces and their positions within
the droplet. A single point force, F with general orientation and position,
r_0, gives rise to both, translational and rotational motion of the droplet. We
show that the translational mobility is anisotropic and the rotational mobility
can be nonmonotonic as a function of | r_0|, depending on the viscosity
contrast. Due to the linearity of the Stokes equation, superposition can be
used to discuss more complex arrays of point forces. We analyse force dipoles,
such as a stresslet, a simple model of a biflagellate swimmer and a rotlet,
representing a helical swimmer, driven by an external magnetic field. For a
general force distribution with arbitrary high multipole moments the propulsion
properties of the droplet depend only on a few low order multipoles: up to the
quadrupole for translational and up to a special octopole for rotational
motion. The coupled motion of droplet and device is discussed for a few
exemplary cases. We show in particular that a biflagellate swimmer, modeled as
a stresslet, achieves a steady comoving state, where the position of the device
relative to the droplet remains fixed. In fact there are two fixpoints,
symmetric with respect to the center of the droplet. A tiny external force
selects one of them and allows to switch between forward and backward motion.

solutions over time. We claim that distinguishing them from the widely used
evolutionary algorithms is relevant. The most important distinction lies in the
fact that in the former type of processes, the value function decreases over
successive generation of solutions, thus providing a natural stopping condition
for the computation process. We show how classical evolutionary concepts, such
as crossing, mutation and fitness can be adapted to aim at reaching an optimal
or close-to-optimal solution among the first generations of feasible solutions.
We additionally introduce a novel integer linear programming formulation of the
MLST problem and a valid constraint used for speeding up the devolutionary
process. Finally, we conduct an experiment comparing the performances of
devolutionary algorithms to those of state of the art approaches used for
solving randomly generated instances of the MLST problem. Results of this

artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In
this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle's behavior to predict
imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable
of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while
learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to
train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own
capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called
self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of
signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine
learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single
modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a
probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are
employed to model a vehicle's positional and visual information respectively.
Our results include experiments performed on a real vehicle, highlighting the
potentiality of the proposed approach at detecting abnormalities in real
scenarios.

  Information","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1904.01185",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today many mobile users in various zones are invited to sense and send back
real-time useful information (e.g., traffic observation and sensor data) to
keep the freshness of the content updates in such zones. However, due to the
sampling cost in sensing and transmission, a user may not have the incentive to
contribute the real-time information to help reduce the age of information
(AoI). We propose dynamic pricing for each zone to offer age-dependent monetary
returns and encourage users to sample information at different rates over time.
This dynamic pricing design problem needs to well balance the monetary payments
as rewards to users and the AoI evolution over time, and is challenging to
solve especially under the incomplete information about users' arrivals and
their private sampling costs. After formulating the problem as a nonlinear
constrained dynamic program, to avoid the curse of dimensionality, we first
propose to approximate the dynamic AoI reduction as a time-average term and
successfully solve the approximate dynamic pricing in closed-form. Further, by
providing the steady-state analysis for an infinite time horizon, we show that
the pricing scheme (though in closed-form) can be further simplified to an
$\varepsilon$-optimal version without recursive computing over time. Finally,
we extend the AoI control from a single zone to many zones with heterogeneous
user arrival rates and initial ages, where each zone cares not only its own AoI
dynamics but also the average AoI of all the zones in a mean field game system
to provide a holistic service. Accordingly, we propose decentralized mean field
pricing for each zone to self-operate by using a mean field term to estimate
the average age dynamics of all the zones, which does not even require many
zones to exchange their local data with each other.

seminal work in the literature that have clearly demonstrated that the
seemingly random movement patterns in the time series of a stock price can be

very effectively learn from the volatile and random movement patterns in a

include higher-order n-point statistics of the morphological features of

rendering. This is achieved by successively incorporating higher order Pn
functions up to n = 8 and quantitatively assessing the accuracy of the
reconstructed systems via un-constrained statistical morphological descriptors
(e.g., the lineal-path function). We examine a wide spectrum of representative
random systems with distinct geometrical and topological features. We find that
generally, successively incorporating higher order Pn functions, and thus, the
higher-order morphological information encoded in these descriptors, leads to
superior accuracy of the reconstructions. However, incorporating more Pn
