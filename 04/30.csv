matrices is very likely to give rise to the observed PMNS matrix. Assuming the
Haar measure, we determine the probability density functions for all quadratic,
quartic Majorana, and quartic Dirac rephasing invariants for an arbitrary
number of neutrino generations. We show that for a fixed number of neutrinos,
all rephasing invariants of the same type have the same probability density

invariants to determine, with the help of the Mellin transform, the three
probability density functions. We finally investigate the physical implications
of our results in function of the number of neutrinos.

homology, has been generalized to measure the distance between functors modeled
on many posets or even small categories. Existing theories require that such a
poset have a superlinear family of translations or a similar structure.
However, many posets of interest to topological data analysis, such as zig-zag
posets and the face relation poset of a cell-complex, do not admit interesting
translations, and consequently don't admit a nice theory of interleavings. In
this paper we show how one can side-step this limitation by providing a general
theory where one maps to a poset that does admit interesting translations, such
as the lattice of down sets, and then defines interleavings relative to this
map. Part of our theory includes a rigorous notion of discretization or
""pixelization"" of poset modules, which in turn we use for interleaving
inference. We provide an approximation condition that in the setting of
lattices gives rise to two possible pixelizations, both of which are guaranteed
to be close in the interleaving distance. Finally, we conclude by considering
interleaving inference for cosheaves over a metric space and give an explicit
description of interleavings over a grid structure on Euclidean space.

stability is not guaranteed in model-free RL by solely using data. From a
control-theoretic perspective, stability is the most important property for any
control system, since it is closely related to safety, robustness, and
reliability of robotic systems. In this paper, we propose an actor-critic RL
framework for control which can guarantee closed-loop stability by employing
the classic Lyapunov's method in control theory. First of all, a data-based
stability theorem is proposed for stochastic nonlinear systems modeled by
Markov decision process. Then we show that the stability condition could be
exploited as the critic in the actor-critic RL to learn a controller/policy. At

$G$, we define a general operator for reversibly changing between quantum
reference frames associated to a group $G$. This generalises the known operator
for translations and boosts to arbitrary finite and locally compact groups,
including non-Abelian groups. We show under which conditions one can uniquely
assign coordinate choices to physical systems (to form reference frames) and
how to reversibly transform between them, providing transformations between
coordinate systems which are `in a superposition' of other coordinate systems.
We obtain the change of quantum reference frame from the principles of
relational physics and of coherent change of reference frame. We prove a
theorem stating that the change of quantum reference frame consistent with
these principles is unitary if and only if the reference systems carry the left
and right regular representations of $G$. We also define irreversible changes
of reference frame for classical and quantum systems in the case where the
symmetry group $G$ is a semi-direct product $G = N \rtimes P$ or a direct
product $G = N \times P$, providing multiple examples of both reversible and
irreversible changes of quantum reference system along the way. Finally, we
apply the relational formalism and changes of reference frame developed in this

the generality of a patience (or budget) constraint which limits the number of

interactions. The proposed microscopic spin model contains first and second
neighbor Heisenberg interactions as well as the single-ion anisotropy. We
establish a rich phase diagram that includes a featureless quantum paramagnet
and various spin spiral states induced by the mechanism of order by quantum
disorder. Although the quantum paramagnet is dubbed featureless, it is shown
that, the magnetic excitations develop a contour degeneracy in the reciprocal
space at the band minima. These contour degenerate excitations are responsible
for the frustrated criticality from the quantum paramagnet to the ordered
phases. This work illustrates the effects of magnetic frustration on both
magnetic orderings and the magnetic excitations. We discuss the experimental
relevance to various Ni-based honeycomb lattice magnets.

submanifold and use it to show that tropical Lagrangian tori are weakly
unobstructed. Tropical graphs arise as large-scale behavior of
pseudoholomorphic disks under a multiple cut operation on a symplectic manifold
that produces a collection of cut spaces each containing relative normal
crossing divisors, following works of Ionel and Brett Parker. Given a
Lagrangian submanifold in the complement of the relative divisors in one of the
cut spaces, the structure maps of the broken Fukaya algebra count broken disks
associated to rigid tropical graphs. We introduce a further degeneration of the
matching conditions (similar in spirit to Bourgeois' version of symplectic
field theory) which results in a tropical Fukaya algebra whose structure maps
are, in good cases, sums of products over vertices of tropical graphs. We show
the tropical Fukaya algebra is homotopy equivalent to the original Fukaya
algebra. In the case of toric Lagrangians contained in a toric component of the
degeneration, an invariance argument implies the existence of projective
Maurer-Cartan solutions. We also give various computations of potentials, such
as those of Lagrangians in cubic surfaces and flag varieties.

be intermittent and localized spatially. Shear and normal stresses also
fluctuate between high- and low-stress states, and dilation is observed
frequently in the high stress state. On the other hand, a complete lack of
dilation is observed when the stresses remain at low values for a several
seconds. Dilation is most prominent while the stresses grow from the low-stress
state to the high-stress state, and the dilated region tends to span the entire

execution at the AP, as well as the local computing and task offloading, aiming
to minimize the total system energy consumption over a finite time horizon,

highlights the pressing issue of optimal charging control, as charging plays a
crucial role in the health, safety and life of batteries. The literature
increasingly adopts model predictive control (MPC) to address this issue,
taking advantage of its capability of performing optimization under
constraints. However, the computationally complex online constrained
optimization intrinsic to MPC often hinders real-time implementation. This
paper is thus proposed to develop a framework for real-time charging control
based on explicit MPC (eMPC), exploiting its advantage in characterizing an
explicit solution to an MPC problem, to enable real-time charging control. The
study begins with the formulation of MPC charging based on a nonlinear
equivalent circuit model. Then, multi-segment linearization is conducted to the
original model, and applying the eMPC design to the obtained linear models
leads to a charging control algorithm. The proposed algorithm shifts the
constrained optimization to offline by precomputing explicit solutions to the
charging problem and expressing the charging law as piecewise affine functions.
This drastically reduces not only the online computational costs in the control
run but also the difficulty of coding. Extensive numerical simulation and
experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed eMPC charging
control framework and algorithm. The research results can potentially meet the
needs for real-time battery management running on embedded hardware.

investigated from first principles and tight binding approach as a function of
the twist angle (ranging from the first ""magic"" angle $\theta=1.08^\circ$ to
$\theta=3.89^\circ$, with the former corresponding to the largest unit cell,
comprising 11164 carbon atoms). By properly taking into account the long-range
van der Waals interaction, we provide the patterns for the atomic displacements
(with respect to the ideal twisted bilayer). The out-of-plane relaxation shows
an oscillating (""buckling"") behavior, very evident for the smallest angles,
with the atoms around the AA stacking regions interested by the largest
displacements. The out-of-plane displacements are accompanied by a significant
in-plane relaxation, showing a vortex-like pattern, where the vorticity
(intended as curl of the displacement field) is reverted when moving from the
top to the bottom plane and viceversa. Overall, the atomic relaxation results
in the shrinking of the AA stacking regions in favor of the more energetically
favorable AB/BA stacking domains.
  The measured flat bands emerging at the first magic angle can be accurately
described only if the atomic relaxations are taken into account. Quite
importantly, the experimental gaps separating the flat band manifold from the
higher and lower energy bands cannot be reproduced if only in-plane or only
out-of-plane relaxations are considered. The stability of the relaxed bilayer
at the first magic angle is estimated to be of the order of 0.5-0.9 meV per
atom (or 7-10 K). Our calculations shed light on the importance of an accurate
description of the vdW interaction and of the resulting atomic relaxation to
envisage the electronic structure of this really peculiar kind of vdW bilayers.

behave as the sample size, $n$, and/or the number of parameters, $p$, in the
underlying data set increase. This type of analysis is often quite challenging,
in part because existing results for fixed $n$ and $p$ are simply not sharp
enough to yield good asymptotic results. One of the first convergence
complexity results for an MCMC algorithm on a continuous state space is due to
Yang and Rosenthal (2019), who established a mixing time result for a Gibbs
sampler (for a simple Bayesian random effects model) that was introduced and
studied by Rosenthal (1996). The asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap of
this Gibbs sampler is, however, still unknown. We use a recently developed
simulation technique (Qin et. al., 2019) to provide substantial numerical
evidence that the gap is bounded away from 0 as $n \rightarrow \infty$. We also
establish a pair of rigorous convergence complexity results for two different
Gibbs samplers associated with a generalization of the random effects model
considered by Rosenthal (1996). Our results show that, under strong regularity
conditions, the spectral gaps of these Gibbs samplers converge to 1 as the

  extinct","To appear in J.Math.Biol",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a population whose size changes stepwise by its members reproducing
or dying (disappearing), but is otherwise quite general. Denote the initial
(non-random) size by $Z_0$ and the size of the $n$th change by $C_n$, $n= 1, 2,
\ldots$. Population sizes hence develop successively as $Z_1=Z_0+C_1,\
Z_2=Z_1+C_2$ and so on, indefinitely or until there are no further size
changes, due to extinction. Extinction is thus assumed final, so that $Z_n=0$
implies that $Z_{n+1}=0$, without there being any other finite absorbing class
of population sizes. We make no assumptions about the time durations between
the successive changes. In the real world, or more specific models, those may
be of varying length, depending upon individual life span distributions and
their interdependencies, the age-distribution at hand and intervening
circumstances. Changes may have quite varying distributions. The basic
assumption is that there is a {\em carrying capacity}, i.e. a non-negative
number $K$ such that the conditional expectation of the change, given the
complete past history, is non-positive whenever the population exceeds the
carrying capacity. Further, to avoid unnecessary technicalities, we assume that
the change $C_n$ equals -1 (one individual dying) with a conditional (given the
past) probability uniformly bounded away from 0. It is a simple and not very
restrictive way to avoid parity phenomena, it is related to irreducibility in
Markov settings. The straightforward, but in contents and implications
far-reaching, consequence is that all such populations must die out.
Mathematically, it follows by a submartingale convergence property and positive
probability of reaching the absorbing extinction state.

Attacks (MotS), previously only seen where state actors have ""compromised"" a
number of telecommunication companies. MotS injection attacks have not been
widely investigated in scientific literature, despite having been discussed by
news outlets and security blogs. MotS came to attention after the Edward

Internet's infrastructure. For an advanced adversary attempting to interfere
with IT connected systems, the next logical step is to adapt this class of
attack to a smaller scale, such as enterprise or critical infrastructure
networks. MotS is a weaker form of attack compared to a Man-in-the-Middle
(MitM). A MotS attack allows an adversary to read and inject packets, but not
modify packets sent by other hosts. This paper presents practical experiments
where we have implemented and performed MotS attacks against two testbeds: 1)
on HTTP connections, by redirecting a victim to a host controlled by an
adversary; and 2) on an Industrial Control network, where we inject falsified
command responses to the victim. In both cases, the victims accept the injected
packets without generating a suspiciously large number of unusual packets on
the network. We then perform an analysis of three leading Network IDS to
determine whether the attacks are detected, and discuss mitigation methods.

unirradiated SiC does not oxidise. Comparisons are made to the apparent

there has been significant interest in utilizing this information in the

quality of existing approximations in this context. Our work examines this
question, identifies issues with existing approaches, and proposes a method
called WoodFisher to compute a faithful and efficient estimate of the inverse

  Our main application is to neural network compression, where we build on the

significantly outperforms popular state-of-the-art methods for one-shot

method results in a gain in test accuracy over the state-of-the-art approaches,
for pruning popular neural networks (like ResNet-50, MobileNetV1) trained on
standard image classification datasets such as ImageNet ILSVRC. We examine how
our method can be extended to take into account first-order information, as
well as illustrate its ability to automatically set layer-wise pruning
thresholds and perform compression in the limited-data regime. The code is

$k$, we extract a sequence $(M_g)_{g\geq 0}$ of $\mathcal{C}$-bimodules. We
show that the Hochschild chain complex $CH(\mathcal{C};M_g)$ of $\mathcal{C}$
with coefficients in $M_g$ carries a canonical homotopy coherent projective
action of the mapping class group of the surface of genus $g+1$. The ordinary
Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{C}$ corresponds to $CH(\mathcal{C};M_0)$.
  This result is obtained as part of the following more comprehensive
topological structure: We construct a symmetric monoidal functor
$\mathfrak{F}_{\mathcal{C}}:\mathcal{C}\text{-}\mathsf{Surf}^{\mathsf{c}}\to\mathsf{Ch}_k$
with values in chain complexes over $k$ defined on a symmetric monoidal
category of surfaces whose boundary components are labeled with projective
objects in $\mathcal{C}$. The functor $\mathfrak{F}_{\mathcal{C}}$ satisfies an
excision property which is formulated in terms of homotopy coends. In this
sense, any modular category gives naturally rise to a modular functor with
values in chain complexes. In zeroth homology, it recovers Lyubashenko's
mapping class group representations.
  The chain complexes in our construction are explicitly computable by choosing
a marking on the surface, i.e. a cut system and a certain embedded graph. For
our proof, we replace the connected and simply connected groupoid of cut
systems that appears in the Lego-Teichm\""uller game by a contractible Kan

2. A set of operations over such graphs is fixed, and each of the operations
has a certain cost, a strictly positive number. The transformation problem
consists in the following: for given structures a and b and given costs, find a
minimum total cost sequence of operations transforming a into b (""the shortest
transformation of a into b""). Each operation corresponds to an ""event"", the
latter being a change in the graph caused by executing one of the operations
over it. The possibility of assigning different costs is important in
applications, since it allows to distinguish between frequent and rare events.
Apparently, arbitrary costs make the problem NP-hard, which results in
nontriviality of passing from one restriction on costs to another, if the
problem is solved by a linear or at least polynomial algorithm (assuming that P
is not equal NP). We propose a novel linear time and space algorithm which
constructs a sequence of operations transforming a to b with total cost close
or equal to the absolute minimum. Namely, if all the so-called DCJ operations
have the same cost w and if deletions and insertions have costs either both
larger or both less than w, then the algorithm outputs a transformation of a
into b with the total cost differing from the absolute minimum by at most 2w
(in the former case) or equal to it (in the latter case). In some cases, the
algorithm outputs an exact solution, e.g., in the case of circular genome
structures. The condition on the costs of deletions and insertions can be
omitted (although the proof described below does not include this general

be codified in additional Hamiltonian terms. When applied to the paradigmatic
case of a mechanical oscillator, such terms, at the lowest order in the
deformation parameter, introduce a weak intrinsic nonlinearity and,
consequently, deviations from the classical trajectory. This point of view has
stimulated several experimental proposals and realizations, leading to

usually included in phenomenological quantum gravity models. However, it would
not be surprising if peculiar features that are predicted by considering the
joined roles of gravity and quantum physics should manifest themselves just on
purely quantum objects. On the base of this consideration, we propose
experiments aiming to observe possible quantum gravity effects on macroscopic
mechanical oscillators that are preliminary prepared in a high purity state,
and we report on the status of their realization.

of Brownian motion revealing that, at early times, hydrodynamic history forces
dominate Stokes damping. In these experiments, nonuniform particle motion is
well described by the Basset-Boussinesq-Oseen (BBO) equation, which captures
the unsteady Basset history force at low Reynolds number. Building off of these
results, earlier we showed that, at low temperature, BBO particles could
exploit fluid inertia in order to overcome potential barriers (generically
modeled as a tilted washboard) while its Langevin counter-part could not. Here,
we explore the behavior of BBO particles at finite temperature. Remarkably, we
find that the transport of particles injected into a bumpy potential with
sufficiently high barriers can be completely quenched at intermediate
temperatures, whereas itinerancy may be possible above and below that
temperature window. This effect is present for both Langevin and BBO dynamics,
though these occur over drastically different temperature ranges. Furthermore,
hydrodynamic memory mitigates these effects by sustaining initial particle
momentum, even in the difficult intermediate temperature regime.

hypernuclear matter and quark matter in a mixed phase between the pure hadronic

required to translate memory addresses between the virtual memory of the

reduce runtime, costs, and energy consumption of AR tools and applications with
similar memory access patterns simply by linking the tool against this new

that always leads to diffuse interfaces, the proposed nonlocal model can lead
to a strict separation into pure phases of the substance. Here, the lack of
smoothness of the potential is essential to guarantee the aforementioned

atmospheric circulation and tidal heating in the planet. A promising avenue to
generate obliquities is via spin-orbit resonances, where the spin and orbital
precession frequencies of the planet cross each other as the system evolves in
time. One such mechanism involves a dissipating (mass-losing) protoplanetary
disk that drives orbital precession of an interior planet. We study this
scenario analytically in this paper, and obtain the mapping between the general
initial spin orientation and the final obliquity. We show that (i) under
adiabatic evolution (i.e. the disk dissipates at a sufficiently slow rate), the
final planetary obliquity as a function of the initial spin orientation
bifurcates into distinct tracks governed by interactions with the resonance;
(ii) under nonadiabatic evolution, a broad range of obliquities can be excited.
We obtain analytical expressions for the final obliquities for various regimes
of parameter space. The dynamical system studied in this paper is an example of
""Colombo's top"", and our analysis and results can be adapted to other

born completely mass segregated. These initial conditions are, however,
gradually lost as the star cluster evolves dynamically. For star clusters with
single stars only and a canonical initial mass function, it has been suggested
that traces of these initial conditions vanish at a time $\tau_\mathrm{v}$
between 3 and $3.5\,t_\mathrm{rh}$ (initial half-mass relaxation times). Since
a significant fraction of stars are observed in binary systems and it is widely
accepted that most stars are born in binary systems, we aim to investigate what
role a primordial binary population (even up to $100\,\%$ binaries) plays in
the loss of primordial mass segregation of young star clusters. We used
numerical $N$-body models similar in size to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) --
a representative of young open clusters -- integrated over several relaxation
times to draw conclusions on the evolution of its mass segregation. We also
compared our models to the observed ONC. We found that $\tau_\mathrm{v}$
depends on the binary star fraction and the distribution of initial binary
parameters that include a semi-major axis, eccentricity, and mass ratio. For
instance, in the models with $50\,\%$ binaries, we find $\tau_\mathrm{v} = (2.7
\pm 0.8)\,t_\mathrm{rh}$, while for $100\,\%$ binary fraction, we find a lower
value $\tau_\mathrm{v} = (2.1 \pm 0.6)\,t_\mathrm{rh}$. We also conclude that
the initially completely mass segregated clusters, even with binaries, are more
compatible with the present-day ONC than the non-segregated ones.

transition between low-mass star-forming galaxies and high-mass, quenched

galaxies at higher redshifts. Both models predict a halo baryon fraction close
to the cosmic value for clusters, but IllustrisTNG predicts lower baryon

differences in modelling feedback from stars and supermassive black holes. The
gas content and star formation rates of galaxies in and around clusters and
groups differ substantially, with IllustrisTNG satellites less star-forming and
less gas-rich. We show that environmental processes such as ram-pressure
stripping are stronger and operate to larger distances and for a broader host

Metal-Insulator Transition (DMIT), where a Fermi liquid (FL) metal with a
generic electronic Fermi surface evolves into a gapped insulator (or, an
insulator with Goldstone modes) through a continuous quantum phase transition.
The transition can be accessed by tuning a single parameter, and its universal
critical properties can be understood using a controlled framework. At the
transition, the two layers are effectively decoupled, where each layer
undergoes a continuous transition from a FL to a generalized composite Fermi
liquid (gCFL). The thermodynamic and transport properties of the gCFL are
similar to the usual CFL, while its spectral properties are qualitatively
different. The FL-gCFL quantum critical point hosts a sharply defined Fermi
surface without long-lived electronic quasiparticles. Immediately across the
transition, the two layers of gCFL are unstable to forming an insulating phase.
We discuss the topological properties of the insulator and various observable
signatures associated with the DMIT.

brightness galaxies, of the class called ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). These
galaxies have recently been shown to be outliers from the baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation (BTFR), as they rotate much slower than expected given their baryonic
mass, and to have baryon fractions similar to the cosmological mean. By means
of a 3D kinematic modelling fitting technique, we show that the HI in our UDGs
is distributed in ""thin"" regularly rotating discs and we determine their
rotation velocity and gas velocity dispersion. We revisit the BTFR adding
galaxies from other studies. We find a previously unknown trend between the
deviation from the BTFR and the disc scale length valid for dwarf galaxies with
circular speeds < 45 km/s, with our UDGs being at the extreme end. Based on our
findings, we suggest that the high baryon fractions of our UDGs may originate

dynamic range in density and velocity over its volume---roughly 6 dex and 1000
km/s, respectively---translating into a 5 dex range in ram pressure imparted to
interacting satellites. The ram pressure profiles of the simulated CGM are
highly stochastic, owing to kpc-scale variations of the density and velocity
fields of the CGM gas. As a result, the efficacy of ram pressure stripping
depends strongly on the specific path a satellite takes through the CGM. The
ram-pressure history of a single satellite is generally unpredictable and not
well correlated with its approach vector with respect to the host galaxy. The
cumulative impact of ram pressure on the simulated satellites is dominated by
only a few short strong impulses---on average, 90% of the total surface

the primary source of gravitational waves (GWs) at low frequencies. Current
estimates of GW detection rates for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and
the Pulsar Timing Array vary by three orders of magnitude. To understand this
variation, we simulate the merger of equal-mass, eccentric, galaxy pairs with
central massive black holes and shallow inner density cusps. We model the
formation and hardening of a central BHB using the Fast Multiple Method as a
force solver, which features a $O(N)$ scaling with the number $N$ of particles
and obtains results equivalent to direct-summation simulations. At $N \sim
5\times 10^5$, typical for contemporary studies, the eccentricity of the BHBs
can vary significantly for different random realisations of the same initial
condition, resulting in a substantial variation of the merger timescale. This
scatter owes to the stochasticity of stellar encounters with the BHB and
decreases with increasing $N$. We estimate that $N \sim 10^7$ within the
stellar half-light radius suffices to reduce the scatter in the merger
timescale to $\sim 10$\%. Our results suggest that at least some of the
uncertainty in low-frequency GW rates owes to insufficient numerical

diffusion length of the metal, the frequency and the incident angle of the

equations. For small amplitude axisymmetric disturbances on the external
surface from the linear stability analysis by \citet{moff78} emerged the
formation of a tail. Successive studies confirmed this fact, and in addition
observed a different shape of the tail with azimuthal small amplitude
disturbances. In this paper the Navier-Stokes equations are solved at high
values of the Reynolds number imposing large amplitude axisymmetric and
three-dimensional disturbances on the surface of the vortex. The conclusion is
that the azimuthal disturbances produce a hierarchy of structures inside the
vortex maintaining the shape of the vortex. On the other hand the axisymmetric
disturbances are convected in the rear side, are dumped and form an
axisymmetric wave longer higher the magnitude of the surface disturbance.
Simulations in a moving frame allow to extend the evolution in time leading to

the progenitor of SN 1987A. Others may transit a given part of the HRD more
than twice in a ""blue loop"" and end up as red supergiants before they explode.

a low-input, high-efficiency, and sustainable kind of agriculture when
performing site-specific management practices. To achieve this objective, a
reliable and updated description of the local status of crops is required.
Remote sensing, and in particular satellite-based imagery, proved to be a
valuable tool in crop mapping, monitoring, and diseases assessment. However,
freely available satellite imagery with low or moderate resolutions showed some
limits in specific agricultural applications, e.g., where crops are grown by
rows. Indeed, in this framework, the satellite's output could be biased by
intra-row covering, giving inaccurate information about crop status. This paper
presents a novel satellite imagery refinement framework, based on a deep
learning technique which exploits information properly derived from high
resolution images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne
multispectral sensors. To train the convolutional neural network, only a single
UAV-driven dataset is required, making the proposed approach simple and
cost-effective. A vineyard in Serralunga d'Alba (Northern Italy) was chosen as
a case study for validation purposes. Refined satellite-driven normalized
difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps, acquired in four different periods
during the vine growing season, were shown to better describe crop status with
respect to raw datasets by correlation analysis and ANOVA. In addition, using a
K-means based classifier, 3-class vineyard vigor maps were profitably derived
from the NDVI maps, which are a valuable tool for growers.

use the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM), based on
collocation of quadrature and interpolation points (Kopriva and Gassner, J.
Sci. Comput., 44 (2010), pp. 136-155). The DGSEM uses summation-by-parts (SBP)
operators in the numerical quadrature for approximating the integrals over
discretization elements (Carpenter et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 36 (2014), pp.
B835-B867; Gassner et al., J. Comput. Phys., 327 (2016), pp. 39-66). Here, we
build upon the framework provided in (F. Renac, J. Comput. Phys., 382 (2019),
pp. 1-36) for nonconservative hyperbolic systems to modify the integration over
cell elements using the SBP operators and replace the physical fluxes with
entropy conservative fluctuation fluxes from Castro et al. (SIAM J. Numer.
Anal., 51 (2013), pp. 1371-1391), while we derive entropy stable fluxes applied
at interfaces. This allows to establish a semi-discrete inequality for the
cell-averaged physical entropy, while being high-order accurate. The design of
the numerical fluxes also formally preserves the kinetic energy at the
semi-discrete level. High-order integration in time is performed using strong
stability-preserving Runge-Kutta schemes and we propose conditions on the
numerical parameters for the positivity of the cell-averaged void fraction and
partial densities. The positivity of the cell-averaged solution is extended to
nodal values by the use of an a posteriori limiter. The high-order accuracy,
nonlinear stability, and robustness of the present scheme are assessed through
several numerical experiments in one and two space dimensions.

some energies and spins. We consider a minimal cure for this non-unitarity of
the pure gravity partition function, which involves the inclusion of additional
states below the black hole threshold. We propose a geometric interpretation
for these extra states: they are conical defects with deficit angle
$2\pi(1-1/N)$, where $N$ is a positive integer. That only integer values of $N$
should be included can be seen from a modular bootstrap argument, and leads us
to propose a modest extension of the set of saddle-point configurations that
contribute to the gravitational path integral: one should sum over orbifolds in
addition to smooth manifolds. These orbifold states are below the black hole
threshold and are regarded as massive particles in AdS, but they are not
perturbative states: they are too heavy to form multi-particle bound states. We
compute the one-loop determinant for gravitons in these orbifold backgrounds,
which confirms that the orbifold states are Virasoro primaries. We compute the
gravitational partition function including the sum over these orbifolds and
find a finite, modular invariant result; this finiteness involves a delicate
cancellation between the infinite tower of orbifold states and an infinite

know the completeness of this Gaia-verse of catalogues: what stars does it
contain and what stars is it missing? We argue that the completeness is driven
by Gaia's spinning-and-precessing scanning law and will apply this principle to
the Gaia-verse over this series. We take a first step by identifying the
periods in time that did not contribute any measurements to Gaia DR2; these
gaps create ribbons of incompleteness across the sky that will bias any study
that ignores them, although some of these gaps may be filled in future data
releases. Our first approach was to use the variable star photometry to
identify the 94 gaps longer than 1% of a day. Our second approach was to
predict the number of observations of every point on the sky, which in
comparison to the reported number of detections revealed additional gaps in the
astrometry and spectroscopy. Making these predictions required us to make the
most precise, publicly-available determination of the Gaia scanning law. Using
this scanning law, we further identified that most stars fainter than $G=22$ in
DR2 have spurious magnitudes due to a miscalibration resulting from a
thunderstorm over Madrid. Our list of gaps and precision scanning law will
allow astronomers to know when Gaia's eye was truly on their binary star,

calculations are routinely used to calculate the electronic structure of a wide
variety of materials. However, DFT calculations are expensive and the computing
cost scales as the cube of the number of electrons present in the system. Thus,
it is desirable to generate surrogate models that can mitigate these issues. To
this end, we present a two step procedure to predict total energies of large
three-dimensional systems (with periodic boundary conditions) with chemical
accuracy (1kcal/mol) per atom using a small data set, meaning that such models
can be trained on-the-fly. Our procedure is based on the idea of the
Hohenberg-Kohn map proposed by Brockherde et al. (Nat. Commun, 8, 872 (2017))
and involves two training models: one, to predict the ground state charge
density, $\rho(r)$, directly from the atomic structure, and another to predict
the total energy from $\rho(r)$. To predict $\rho(r)$, we use many-body
correlation descriptors to accurately describe the neighborhood of a grid point
and to predict the total energy we use amplitudes of these many-body
correlation descriptors. Utilizing the amplitudes of the many-body descriptors
allows for uniquely identifying a structure while accounting for constraints,
such as translational invariance; additionally, such a formulation is
independent of the charge density grid.

fine-tuning necessarily makes significant changes, it does not lead to
catastrophic forgetting of linguistic phenomena. We instead find that
fine-tuning primarily affects the top layers of BERT, but with noteworthy
variation across tasks. In particular, dependency parsing reconfigures most of
the model, whereas SQuAD and MNLI appear to involve much shallower processing.

nanoparticle ensembles are investigated in the framework of many-body radiative
heat transfer theory. We consider nanoparticles made of different materials:
metals (Ag), polar dielectrics (SiC) or insulator-metallic phase-change
materials (VO$_2$). We start by investigating the RHT between two parallel 2D
finite-size square-lattice nanoparticle ensembles, with particular attention to
many-body interactions (MBI) effects. We systematically analyze the different
physical regimes characterizing the RHT. When $p\ll \lambda_T$, a multiple
scattering of the electromagnetic field inside the systems gives rise to a MBI
regime. MBI effects manifest themselves in different ways, depending on $d$:
(a) if $d > \lambda_T$, due to the pure intra-ensemble MBI inside each 2D
ensemble, the total heat conductance is less affected, and the thermal
conductance spectrum manifests a single peak which is nonetheless shifted with
respect to the one typical of two isolated nanoparticles. (b) if $d <
\lambda_T$, there is a strong simultaneous intra- and inter-ensemble MBI. In
this regime there is a direct quantitative effect on the heat conductance, in
addition to a qualitative effect on the thermal conductance spectrum which now
manifests a new second peak. As for the RTE, to correctly describe the
radiation emitted by metallic nanoparticles, we derive an expression of the
Poynting vector including also magnetic contribution, in addition to the
electric one. By analyzing both periodic and non-periodic ensembles, we show
that the RTE emitted by a single 2D nanoparticle ensemble is sensitive to the
particle distribution. As instance, we see that the RTE emitted by 2D
concentric ring-configuration ensemble has an inhibition feature near the
center of the ensemble.

applying different low-pass filters. Two different filters are examined, a
sharp Fourier filter and a Gaussian filter. The probability density function
(pdf) of the local energy flux is calculated for the different filters and for
different filtering scales. It is shown that the local energy flux is a largely
fluctuating quantity taking both negative and positive values and this is more
pronounced for the sharp filter. The variance, the skewness and the kurtosis of
these fluctuations are shown to increase as the filtering scale is decreased.
Furthermore we calculate the joint pdf of $\Pi_\ell(\bf x)$ with the local
filtered strain rate $S_\ell$ and the enstrophy $\Omega_\ell$. The flux shows a
good correlation with the strain but not with the enstrophy. It is shown that
its conditional mean value scales like $<{\Pi_\ell}>_S \propto \ell^2

strong fluctuations exist around this value that also need to be modeled. We

measure the diameter of the tumour in its largest dimension. It has been shown
that volumetric measurement is more accurate and more reliable as a measure of
VS size. The reference approach to achieve such volumetry is to manually
segment the tumour, which is a time intensive task. We suggest that
semi-automated segmentation may be a clinically applicable solution to this
problem and that it could replace linear measurements as the clinical standard.
Using high-quality software available for academic purposes, we ran a
comparative study of manual versus semi-automated segmentation of VS on MRI
with 5 clinicians and scientists. We gathered both quantitative and qualitative
data to compare the two approaches; including segmentation time, segmentation
effort and segmentation accuracy. We found that the selected semi-automated
segmentation approach is significantly faster (167s versus 479s, p<0.001), less
temporally and physically demanding and has approximately equal performance
when compared with manual segmentation, with some improvements in accuracy.
There were some limitations, including algorithmic unpredictability and error,
which produced more frustration and increased mental effort in comparison to
manual segmentation. We suggest that semi-automated segmentation could be
applied clinically for volumetric measurement of VS on MRI. In future, the
generic software could be refined for use specifically for VS segmentation,
thereby improving accuracy.

The bottleneck channel from relay to destination has a fixed capacity C. We
examine also the case where the channel capacity can dynamically change due to
variable loads on the backhaul link. The broadcast approach is analyzed for
cases that only the relay knows the available capacity for next block, and for
the case that neither source nor relay know the capacity per block, only its

vectors corresponding to simple representations and pure D0-branes. This opens
up the possibility to compute the BPS indices in any chamber using either the

developing a storage architecture for in-memory database management systems

defined the speed functions on the complete graph. We argue that this model is

to a complex problem that challenges the capabilities of current solution

networks as a paradigm. An economic network can be examined at many levels:
linkages among individual agents (microscopic), among firms/sectors
(mesoscopic) or among countries (macroscopic). New emergent dynamical
properties appear at every level, so the granularity matters. For viral
epidemics, even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and
potentially affect the entire network. Economic networks, however, are known to
be immune at the micro-levels and more prone to failure in the
meso/macro-levels. We propose a dynamical interaction model to characterize the
mechanism of distress propagation, across different modules of a network,
initiated at different epicenters. Vulnerable modules often lead to large
degrees of destabilization. We demonstrate our methodology using a unique
empirical data-set of input-output linkages across 0.14 million firms in one
administrative state of India, a developing economy. The network has multiple
hub-and-spoke structures that exhibits moderate disassortativity, which varies
with the level of coarse-graining. The novelty lies in characterizing the

finding `too-big-to-fail' modules supersede `too-central-to-fail' modules in

of neutral regions but also to the residual neutral hydrogen within ionized
regions, for which a density even as low as $n_{\rm HI}\sim
10^{-9}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ (sometimes combined with kinematic effects) leads to
a significantly reduced visibility. Still, we find that $\sim 1\%$ of
sightlines towards $M_{\mathrm{1600AB}}\sim -21$ galaxies at $z\sim 7$ are
transparent enough to allow a transmission of a blue Ly$\alpha$ peak. We
discuss our results in the context of the interpretation of observations.

with applications across medicine and social science. Many methods for
estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) have been proposed in
recent years, but there are important theoretical gaps in understanding if and
when such methods are optimal. This is especially true when the CATE has
nontrivial structure (e.g., smoothness or sparsity). Our work contributes in
several main ways. First, we study a two-stage doubly robust CATE estimator and
give a generic model-free error bound, which, despite its generality, yields
sharper results than those in the current literature. We apply the bound to
derive error rates in nonparametric models with smoothness or sparsity, and
give sufficient conditions for oracle efficiency. Underlying our error bound is
a general oracle inequality for regression with estimated or imputed outcomes,
which is of independent interest; this is the second main contribution. The
third contribution is aimed at understanding the fundamental statistical limits
of CATE estimation. To that end, we propose and study a local polynomial
adaptation of double-residual regression. We show that this estimator can be
oracle efficient under even weaker conditions, if used with a specialized form
of sample splitting and careful choices of tuning parameters. These are the
weakest conditions currently found in the literature, and we conjecture that
they are minimal in a minimax sense. We go on to give error bounds in the
non-trivial regime where oracle rates cannot be achieved. Some finite-sample
properties are explored with simulations.

distribution over all classes and then selecting that class with the largest
estimated probability. In many settings however, the quality of posterior
probability itself (e.g., 65% chance having diabetes), gives more reliable
information than the final predicted class alone. When these methods are shown
to be poorly calibrated, most fixes to date have relied on posterior
calibration, which rescales the predicted probabilities but often has little
impact on final classifications. Here we propose an end-to-end training
procedure called posterior calibrated (PosCal) training that directly optimizes
the objective while minimizing the difference between the predicted and
empirical posterior probabilities.We show that PosCal not only helps reduce the
calibration error but also improve task performance by penalizing drops in
performance of both objectives. Our PosCal achieves about 2.5% of task
performance gain and 16.1% of calibration error reduction on GLUE (Wang et al.,
2018) compared to the baseline. We achieved the comparable task performance
with 13.2% calibration error reduction on xSLUE (Kang and Hovy, 2019), but not
outperforming the two-stage calibration baseline. PosCal training can be easily
extendable to any types of classification tasks as a form of regularization
term. Also, PosCal has the advantage that it incrementally tracks needed
statistics for the calibration objective during the training process, making
efficient use of large training sets.

input (e.g., touch, speech, pen, gaze) exhibit the potential to facilitate
fluid interaction during visual network exploration and analysis. While
multimodal interaction with network visualization seems like a promising idea,
many open questions remain. For instance, do users actually prefer multimodal
input over unimodal input, and if so, why? Does it enable them to interact more
naturally, or does having multiple modes of input confuse users? To answer such
questions, we conducted a qualitative user study in the context of a network
visualization tool, comparing speech- and touch-based unimodal interfaces to a
multimodal interface combining the two. Our results confirm that participants
strongly prefer multimodal input over unimodal input attributing their

model of flares proposed by Belova and Bychkov, as opposed to the model of

the interaction between a thermal wave (temperature jump) and a non-stationary
radiative shock. In particular, this model (a) does not make it possible to
increase the geometric thickness of a chromospheric condensation owing to
divergence of the fronts of the thermal and shock waves during impulsive
heating, (b) cannot provide heating of the chromospheres of red dwarfs over
significant distances, and (c) predicts $\mathrm{H}_\alpha$ line profiles in
conflict with observational data. It is argued that: (a) the shock-wave model
by Belova and Bychkov represents a development of the kinematic model of solar
flares (Nakagawa et al.) and its application to dMe stars, specifically: a
study of the radiative response of the chromosphere of a red dwarf to impulsive
heating in the simplest gas dynamic statement of the problem (a thermal wave is
excluded, a stationary approach is used); (b) in terms of the Kostyuk and
Pikelner model, the regions behind the stationary shock fronts do not
correspond to a chromospheric condensation with time-varying thickness but to
zones in which the plasma relaxes to a state of thermal equilibrium. It is

physical properties, are necessary for critical advances in technologies.
Simultaneous control of structural and physical properties via a small
electrical current is of great significance both fundamentally and
technologically. Recent studies demonstrate that a combination of strong
spin-orbit interactions and a distorted crystal structure in magnetic Mott
insulators is sufficient to attain this long-desired goal. In this Topical
Review, we highlight underlying properties of this class of materials and
present two representative antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, namely,
4d-electron based Ca2RuO4 and 5d-electron based Sr2IrO4, as model systems. In
essence, a small, applied electrical current engages with the lattice,
critically reducing structural distortions, which in turn readily suppresses
the antiferromagnetic and insulating state and subsequently results in emergent
new states. While details may vary in different materials, at the heart of
these phenomena are current-reduced lattice distortions, which, via spin-orbit
interactions, dictate physical properties. Electrical current, which joins
magnetic field, electric field, pressure, light, etc. as a new external
stimulus, provides a new, key dimension for materials research, and also pose a
series of intriguing questions that may provide the impetus for advancing our
understanding of spin-orbit-coupled matter. This Topical Review provides a
brief introduction, a few hopefully informative examples and some general
remarks. It is by no means an exhaustive report of the current state of studies

significantly outperformed previous supervised and unsupervised word alignment

balances achieved by the true cylinder flow -- both for the flow as a whole and
for each of its most energetic harmonic frequencies. It is found that viscous
dissipation balances production when each is considered over the entire flow
field and therefore that linear mechanisms achieve an energy balance on their
own, thus respecting the Reynolds--Orr equation. Suitable energy conservation
laws reveal that while nonlinear mechanisms neither produce nor consume energy
overall, they nevertheless account for an important transfer of energy to
higher frequencies. The energy balance for DNS is compared to that predicted by
resolvent analysis. Although a suitable energy balance is achieved for each
harmonic, resolvent analysis does not correctly model energy transfer between
temporal frequencies. We further investigate the detailed roles of energy
transfer from the viewpoint of nonlinear triadic interactions by considering a
finite number of harmonic frequencies. It is shown that the nonlinearity plays
a critical role in the redistribution of energy to higher harmonic frequencies.
We observe not only an energy cascade from low frequencies to high frequencies,
but also a considerable inverse cascade from high frequencies to low
frequencies. The true nonlinear energy transfer mechanisms provide insight into
closure models for improved resolvent-based predictions of harmonic modes in

perturbations such as global and local-scale flows and structural
asphericities, result in the splitting of eigenfrequencies in the observed
spectrum of solar oscillations. Drawing from prevalent ideas in normal-mode
coupling theory in geophysical literature, we devise a procedure that enables
the computation of sensitivity kernels for general Lorentz stress fields in the
Sun. Mode coupling due to any perturbation requires careful consideration of
self- and cross-coupling of multiplets. Invoking the isolated-multiplet
approximation allows for limiting the treatment to purely self-coupling,
requiring significantly less computational resources. We identify the presence
of such isolated multiplets under the effect of Lorentz stresses in the Sun.
Currently, solar missions allow precise measurements of self-coupling of
multiplets via ""$a$-coefficients"" and the cross-spectral correlation signal
which enables the estimation of the ""structure coefficients"". We demonstrate
the forward problem for both self-coupling ($a$-coefficients) and
cross-coupling (structure coefficients). In doing so, we plot the self-coupling
kernels and estimate $a$-coefficients arising from a combination of
deep-toroidal and surface-dipolar axisymmetric fields. We also compute the
structure coefficients for an arbitrary general magnetic field (real and
solenoidal) and plot the corresponding ""splitting function"", a convenient way
to visualize the splitting of multiplets under 3D internal perturbations. The
results discussed in this paper pave the way to formally pose an inverse

excellent optoelectronic properties. They also possess strong material
nonlinearity as well as high refractive indices. In view of these properties,
AlGaAs is a promising candidate for integrated photonics, including both linear
and nonlinear devices, passive and active devices, and associated applications.
For integrated photonics low propagation loss is essential, particularly in
nonlinear applications. However, achieving low-loss and high-confinement AlGaAs
photonic integrated circuits poses a challenge. Here we show an effective
reduction of surface-roughness-induced scattering loss in fully etched
high-confinement AlGaAs-on-insulator nanowaveguides, by using a heterogeneous
wafer-bonding approach and optimizing fabrication techniques. We demonstrate
ultrahigh-quality AlGaAs microring resonators and realize quality factors up to
3.52E6 and finesses as high as 1.4E4. We also show ultra-efficient frequency
comb generations in those resonators and achieve record-low threshold powers on
the order of ~20 uW and ~120 uW for the resonators with 1 THz and 90 GHz
free-spectral ranges, respectively. Our result paves the way for the
implementation of AlGaAs as a novel integrated material platform specifically
for nonlinear photonics, and opens a new window for chip-based
efficiency-demanding practical applications.

and degenerate states are all of three types of singular points of polarization
in the momentum space. For photonic crystal slabs (PhCSs) with linearly
polarized far fields, BICs were found to be the centers of polarization
vortices and attracted more attention in the previous studies. Here, we
theoretically demonstrate that the far fields of PhCSs can exhibit remarkably
diverse polarizations due to the robust existences of C points in the
continuum. Only a pair of C points with identical handedness and opposite
topological charge can be annihilated together. Continuously fine tuning of the
structure parameters of PhCSs without breaking their symmetry, a pair of C
points with identical topological charge and opposite handedness are able to
merge into a BIC, then the BIC splits into C points again. Interestingly, a
Dirac-degenerate BIC with one half of topological charge is observed when two
pairs of C points with identical topological charge from the upper and lower
band, respectively, simultaneously merge at the Dirac-degenerate point. The law
of topological charge conservation is verified to play an important role in the
evolutions and interconversions between different types of polarization
singularities. Our findings might shed light on the origin of singular points
of polarization, could open a gateway towards the applications of them in the
generation and manipulation of vector beams.

120, 230501 (2018)], many discussions on this topic have been published. In
this paper, we consider relationship between quantum multipartite maskers
(QMMs) and quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). We say that a subset $Q$ of
pure states of a system $K$ can be masked by an operator $S$ into a
multipartite system $\H^{(n)}$ if all of the image states $S|\psi\>$ of states
$|\psi\>$ in $Q$ have the same marginal states on each subsystem. We call such
an $S$ a QMM of $Q$. By establishing an expression of a QMM, we obtain a
relationship between QMMs and QECCs, which reads that an isometry is a QMM of
all pure states of a system if and only if its range is a QECC of any
one-erasure channel. As an application, we prove that there is no an isometric
universal masker from $\C^2$ into $\C^2\otimes\C^2\otimes\C^2$ and then the
states of $\C^3$ can not be masked isometrically into
$\C^2\otimes\C^2\otimes\C^2$. This gives a consummation to a main result and
leads to a negative answer to an open question in [PRA 98, 062306 (2018)].
Another application is that arbitrary quantum states of $\C^d$ can be
completely hidden
  in correlations between any two subsystems of the tripartite system
$\C^{d+1}\otimes\C^{d+1}\otimes\C^{d+1}$, while arbitrary quantum states cannot
be completely hidden in the correlations between subsystems of a bipartite

differentiate between progenitor scenarios and explosion mechanisms. Here we
revisit the relation between photospheric Si II 6355 velocities (Vsi) and
host-galaxy properties with ~280 SNe Ia. A more stringent criterion on the
phase of SN spectra is adopted to classify SNe Ia in terms of their
photospheric velocities. We find significant trend that SNe Ia with faster Si
II 6355 (high-Vsi SNe Ia) tend to explode in massive environments, whereas
their slower counterparts can be found in both lower-mass and massive
environments. This trend is further supported by the direct measurements on
host gas-phase metallicities. We suggest this relation is likely caused by at
least two populations of SNe Ia. Since stars of higher metallicity (at a given
mass) generally form less massive white dwarfs (WDs), our results support some
theoretical models that high-Vsi SNe Ia may originate from sub-Chandrasekhar
class of explosions. Previous observations also showed some evidence that
high-Vsi SNe Ia could be related to the single degenerate systems. However, we
find high-Vsi SNe Ia do not come from particularly young populations. We
conclude metallicity is likely the dominant factor in forming high-Vsi SNe Ia.
This also implies their potential evolution with redshift and impact on the

condition at high frequency. First, error estimates with explicit dependence on
the wave number $k$ for the HDG approximations to the exact solution $u$ and
its negative gradient $\mathbf{q}=-\nabla u$ are derived. It is shown that
$k\Vert u - u_h \Vert_{L^2(\Omega)} + \Vert \mathbf{q} -\mathbf{q}_h
\Vert_{L^2(\Omega)} = O(k^2h^2+k^4h^3)$ under the conditions that $k^3h^2$ is
sufficiently small and that the penalty parameter $\tau\eqsim k$, where $h$ is
the mesh size. Note that the convergence order in $\mathbf{q}_h$ is full and
the pollution error is $O(k^4h^3)$, which improve the existent results.
Secondly, by using a standard postprocessing procedure from the HDG method for
elliptic problems, a piecewise quadratic function $u_h^*$ is obtained so that
$k\Vert u-u_h^*\Vert_{L^2(\Omega)}=O(k^3h^3+k^4h^3)$. Note that the
postprocessing procedure improves only the interpolation error (from
$O(k^2h^2)$ to $O(k^3h^3)$) but leaves the pollution error $O(k^4h^3)$
unchanged. Thirdly, dispersion analyses and extensive numerical tests show that
the pollution effect can be eliminated completely in 1D case and reduced
greatly in 2D case by selecting appropriate penalty parameters. The
preasymptotic error analysis of the higher order HDG method for the Helmholtz
equation with high wave number is studied in Part II.

all increase with $q$, exceed their usual Stefan-Boltzmann limits and tend to a
new $q$-related Tsallis limit at temperature high enough. Interestingly,
however, due to a surprising cancellation, the high temperature limit of
$c_{s}^{2}$ is still its SB limit $1/3$. In addition, we found some
similarities between the non-extensive effect and the finite-size effect. For
example, as $q$ increases (size decreases), the criticality of
$\frac{c_{v}}{T^{3}}$ and $c_{s}^{2}$ gradually disappears. Besides, in order
to better study the non-extensive effect, we defined a new susceptibility and
calculated the response of thermodynamic quantities and transport coefficients
to $q$. And found that their response patterns are different.

Specifically, we introduce a generic optimization model to formulate

propose a novel bilevel self-tuned training strategy, allowing efficient search
of task-specific hyper-parameters. This training strategy increases the

measured by recording the surface temperature history in a transient experiment
and interpreting this surface temperature with the aid of a suitable model for
transient conduction within the substrate. The semi-infinite one-dimensional
model is often adopted, and several well-developed techniques for application
of this model to surface temperature data are available. However, when a
spatial variation of heat flux exists across the surface, the application of
the semi-infinite one-dimensional approach may not always be a reasonable
approximation. In this paper we introduce a method for treatment of the
measured surface temperature history that is more accurate than the
semi-infinite one-dimensional approximation when substrate lateral conduction
is significant and the relative spatial distribution of the flux is known a
priori. This new method uses the so-called \textit{Neumann heat kernel}, which
evolves a temperature over an insulated domain with unit energy initially
deposited at a specified point. A useful impulse response function is formed by
integrating this Neumann heat kernel against the spatial variation of flux over
the surface of the domain. Neumann heat kernels are constructed for the solid
box, cylinder, and sphere. By applying the heat kernel result for the sphere to
the analysis of a convective experiment using hemispherical-nosed probes, we
demonstrate how the theoretical results enhance the practical analysis of
transient surface temperature measurements. The current approach is superior to
former methods relying on semi-empirical approximations because the
multi-dimensional heat conduction within the substrate is modelled with greater
fidelity using the heat kernel analysis.

existence and liveness for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with
differential dynamic logic (dL). The approach yields proofs that the solution
of a given ODE exists long enough to reach a given target region without
leaving a given evolution domain. Numerous subtleties complicate the
generalization of discrete liveness verification techniques, such as loop
variants, to the continuous setting. For example, ODE solutions may blow up in
finite time or their progress towards the goal may converge to zero. These
subtleties are handled in dL by successively refining ODE liveness properties
using ODE invariance properties which have a complete axiomatization. This
approach is widely applicable: several liveness arguments from the literature
are surveyed and derived as special instances of axiomatic refinement in dL.
These derivations also correct several soundness errors in the surveyed
literature, which further highlights the subtlety of ODE liveness reasoning and
the utility of an axiomatic approach. An important special case of this
approach deduces (global) existence properties of ODEs, which are a fundamental
part of every ODE liveness argument. Thus, all generalizations of existence
properties and their proofs immediately lead to corresponding generalizations
of ODE liveness arguments. Overall, the resulting library of common refinement
steps enables both the sound development and justification of new ODE existence
and of liveness proof rules from dL axioms. These insights are put into
practice through an implementation of ODE liveness proofs in the KeYmaera X
theorem prover for hybrid systems.

been widely adopted because of its solid theoretical rationale and efficient

pretrained model by low-rank decomposition; however, small approximation errors
in parameters can ripple over a large prediction loss. As a result, performance
usually drops significantly and a sophisticated effort on fine-tuning is
required to recover accuracy. Apparently, it is not optimal to separate
low-rank approximation from training. Unlike previous works, this paper
integrates low rank approximation and regularization into the training process.
We propose Trained Rank Pruning (TRP), which alternates between low rank
approximation and training. TRP maintains the capacity of the original network
while imposing low-rank constraints during training. A nuclear regularization
optimized by stochastic sub-gradient descent is utilized to further promote low
rank in TRP. The TRP trained network inherently has a low-rank structure, and
is approximated with negligible performance loss, thus eliminating the
fine-tuning process after low rank decomposition. The proposed method is
comprehensively evaluated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, outperforming previous
compression methods using low rank approximation.

works of channel pruning have been proposed to prune away compute and memory

decide which and how many channels to remove from each layer leading to
channel-wise and/or layer-wise pruning profiles, respectively. In this paper,
we conduct several baseline experiments and establish that profiles from random
channel-wise pruning policies are as good as metric-based ones. We also
establish that there may exist profiles from some layer-wise pruning policies
that are measurably better than common baselines. We then demonstrate that the
top layer-wise pruning profiles found using an exhaustive random search from
one datatset are also among the top profiles for other datasets. This implies
that we could identify out-of-the-box layer-wise pruning profiles using
benchmark datasets and use these directly for new datasets. Furthermore, we
develop a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy-based search algorithm with a
direct objective of finding transferable layer-wise pruning profiles using many

this RL search towards an expected compression while maximizing accuracy. Our
results show that our transferred RL-based profiles are as good or better than
best profiles found on the original dataset via exhaustive search. We then

Josephson junctions with Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction (RDSOI) in
the presence of a Zeeman field. Through investigating self-biased supercurrent
(so called $\varphi_0$-Josephson state), we obtain explicit expressions for the
functionality of the $\varphi_0$ state with respect to RDSOI parameters
($\alpha,\beta$) and in-plane Zeeman field components ($h_x,h_y$). Our findings
reveal that, when the chemical potential ($\mu$) is high enough compared to the
energy gap ($\Delta$) in superconducting electrodes, i.e., $\mu \gg \Delta$,
RSOI and DSOI with equal strengths ($|\alpha|=|\beta|$) cause vanishing
$\varphi_0$ state independent of magnetization and the type of RDSOI. A Zeeman
field with unequal components, i.e., $|h_x|\neq |h_y|$, however, can counteract
and nullify the destructive impact of equal-strength RDSOIs (for one type
only), where $\mu\sim\Delta$, although $|h_x|= |h_y|$ can still eliminate the
$\varphi_0$ state. Remarkably, in the $\mu\sim\Delta$ limit, the $\varphi_0$
state is proportional to the multiplication of both components of an in-plane
Zeeman field, i.e., $h_xh_y$, which is absent in the $\mu \gg \Delta$ limit.
Furthermore, our results of critical supercurrents demonstrate that the
persistent spin helices can be revealed in a high enough chemical potential
regime $\mu\gg \Delta$, while an opposite regime, i.e., $\mu\sim\Delta$,
introduces an adverse effect. In the ballistic regime, the ""maximum"" of the
critical supercurrent occurs at $|\alpha|=|\beta|$ and the Zeeman field can
boost this feature. The presence of disorder and nonmagnetic impurities change
this picture drastically so the ""minimum"" of the critical supercurrent occurs
at and around the symmetry lines $|\alpha|=|\beta|$.

For $p+{}^6\textrm{He}$ inelastic scattering to the $2^+_1$ state, the
calculated result was in reasonable agreement with the $(p,p')$ data at

overshot the $(p,p')$ cross sections at $E=72$ MeV/A by a factor of three.
According to a phenomenological model analysis, $M_n$ values in the range of
4--6 fm$^2$ were favored to reproduce the ${}^8\textrm{He}(2^+_1)$ cross

which has paired tokens but no recursion. Surprisingly, training a model on
either of these artificial languages leads to the same substantial gains when
testing on natural language. Further experiments on transfer between natural

to a gas like states at very low pressure. The neutral pressure range where
this melting transition is observed is an order of magnitude less than what

variation in different characteristic parameters such as the pair correlation

spherical heater with a solid wall and a point-like heater. In both cases, a
spherical vortex tangle is formed surrounding the heater. The mechanism of
vortex tangle development in the vicinity of a solid wall is strongly governed
by Donnelly-Glaberson instability; while, far away from the heater or around a
point heater, the mechanism is governed by the dynamics of polarized vortex
loops in radial counterflow. The decay process of such localized vortex tangles
is also investigated and is compared with that of homogeneous vortex tangles.

source audio as a reference while synthesising speech. Fine-grained PT aims at
capturing prosodic aspects like rhythm, emphasis, melody, duration, and
loudness, from a source audio at a very granular level and transferring them
when synthesising speech in a different target speaker's voice. Current
approaches for fine-grained PT suffer from source speaker leakage, where the
synthesised speech has the voice identity of the source speaker as opposed to
the target speaker. In order to mitigate this issue, they compromise on the
quality of PT. In this paper, we propose CopyCat, a novel, many-to-many PT
system that is robust to source speaker leakage, without using parallel data.
We achieve this through a novel reference encoder architecture capable of
capturing temporal prosodic representations which are robust to source speaker
leakage. We compare CopyCat against a state-of-the-art fine-grained PT model
through various subjective evaluations, where we show a relative improvement of
$47\%$ in the quality of prosody transfer and $14\%$ in preserving the target
speaker identity, while still maintaining the same naturalness.

differences between them, so that these records need to be cross-calibrated
before they can be reliably used for further studies. We produce a
cross-calibrated and homogeneous record of total daily sunspot areas, both
projected and corrected, covering the period between 1874 and 2019. A catalogue
of calibrated individual group areas is also generated for the same period. We
have compared the data from nine archives: Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO),
Kislovodsk, Pulkovo, Debrecen, Kodaikanal, Solar Optical Observing Network
(SOON), Rome, Catania, and Yunnan Observatories, covering the period between
1874 and 2019. Mutual comparisons of the individual records have been employed
to produce homogeneous and inter-calibrated records of daily projected and
corrected areas. As in earlier studies, the basis of the composite is formed by
the data from RGO. After 1976, the only datasets used are those from
Kislovodsk, Pulkovo and Debrecen observatories. This choice was made based on
the temporal coverage and the quality of the data. In contrast to the SOON data
used in previous area composites for the post-RGO period, the properties of the
data from Kislovodsk and Pulkovo are very similar to those from the RGO series.
They also directly overlap the RGO data in time, which makes their
cross-calibration with RGO much more reliable. We have also computed and
provide the daily Photometric Sunspot Index (PSI) widely used, e.g., in
empirical reconstructions of solar irradiance.

using four methods: the behavioral evaluation methods of (1) challenge test

methods of (3) probes and (4) interventions. To facilitate this holistic
evaluation, we present Monotonicity NLI (MoNLI), a new naturalistic dataset
focused on lexical entailment and negation. In our behavioral evaluations, we
find that models trained on general-purpose NLI datasets fail systematically on
MoNLI examples containing negation, but that MoNLI fine-tuning addresses this
failure. In our structural evaluations, we look for evidence that our
top-performing BERT-based model has learned to implement the monotonicity
algorithm behind MoNLI. Probes yield evidence consistent with this conclusion,
and our intervention experiments bolster this, showing that the causal dynamics
of the model mirror the causal dynamics of this algorithm on subsets of MoNLI.
This suggests that the BERT model at least partially embeds a theory of lexical

returning a ranking based on the additive scores computed by a limited portion

planets are eccentric and fall near the 4:1 mean-motion resonances. This
configuration is stable on long timescales, but induces dynamical interactions
so that the orbits differ slightly from purely Keplerian orbits. In particular,
WASP-148b shows transit-timing variations of typically 15 minutes, making it
the first interacting system with transit-timing variations that is detected on
ground-based light curves. We establish that the mutual inclination of the
orbital plane of the two planets cannot be higher than 35 degrees, and the true
mass of WASP-148c is below 0.60 M_Jup. We present photometric and spectroscopic
observations of this system that cover a time span of ten years. We also

Prediction of Bootstrap Latents (PBL), a simple and flexible self-supervised
representation learning algorithm for multitask deep RL. PBL builds on
multistep predictive representations of future observations, and focuses on
capturing structured information about environment dynamics. Specifically, PBL
trains its representation by predicting latent embeddings of future
observations. These latent embeddings are themselves trained to be predictive
of the aforementioned representations. These predictions form a bootstrapping
effect, allowing the agent to learn more about the key aspects of the
environment dynamics. In addition, by defining prediction tasks completely in
latent space, PBL provides the flexibility of using multimodal observations
involving pixel images, language instructions, rewards and more. We show in our
experiments that PBL delivers across-the-board improved performance over state

neutron to proton ratio is not unity, and it is worthwhile to think about more
neutron-rich objects with $N>Z$ as the building blocks of cluster structures.
Here the nuclei with the neutron number six, which is the subclosure of the
$p_{3/2}$ subshell of the $jj$-coupling shell model, are assumed to be
clusters, and thus we study the $^8$He and $^9$Li cluster structures in
$^{16}$Be ($^8$He+$^8$He), $^{17}$B ($^8$He+$^9$Li), $^{18}$C ($^9$Li+$^9$Li),

relative distances, we increase the expectation value of the principal quantum

total angular momentum is unchanged (equal to $J^\pi =0$). As a result,
developed cluster states are obtained around the corresponding threshold
energies. The rotational band structure of $^{24}$C, which reflect the symmetry
of equilateral triangular configuration ($D_{3h}$ symmetry) of three $^8$He
clusters, also appears around the threshold energy.

method is fast and accurate, it can be applied to the calculation of the
normalizing constant of high-dimensional Fisher--Bingham distributions. More
precisely, the error decays exponentially with an increase in the integration
points, and the computation cost increases linearly with the dimensions. In
addition, this formula is useful for calculating the gradient and Hessian
matrix of the normalizing constant. Therefore, we apply this formula to
efficiently calculate the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of
high-dimensional data. Finally, we apply the MLE to the hyperspherical

expressed properly using the decimation transformation process in the presence
of an external field so that their applications lead to some significant
physical results. Indeed, their applications produce or reproduce some relevant
and important results which were included in cumbersome mathematics in the
previous studies, if not in a form impossible to understand. The average
magnetization or the order parameter $<\!\!\sigma\!\!> $ is expressed as
$<\!\!\sigma_{0,i}\!\!>=
  <\!\!\tanh[ \kappa(\sigma_{1,i}+\sigma_{2,i}+\dots +\sigma_{z,i})+H]\!\!> $.
Here, $\kappa$ is the coupling strength, $z$ is the number of nearest
neighbors. $\sigma_{0,i}$ denotes the central spin at the $i^{th}$ site, while
$\sigma_{l,i}$, $l=1,2,\dots,z$ are the nearest neighbor spins around the
central spin. $H$ is the normalized external magnetic field. We show that the
application of this relation to the 1D Ising model reproduces readily the
previously obtained exact results in the absence of an external field.
Furthermore, the three-site correlation functions of square and honeycomb
lattices of the form $<\!\!\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3}\!\!>$ are
analytically obtained. One finds that the three-site correlation functions are
equal to $f(\kappa)\!\!<\!\!\sigma\!\!>$. Here $f(\kappa)$ depends on the
lattice types and is an analytic function of coupling constant. This result
indicates that the critical properties of three-site correlation functions of
those lattices are the same as the corresponding order parameters
$<\!\!\sigma\!\!>$ of those lattices. This will mean that the uniqueness of the
average magnetization as an order parameter is questionable. ...

network systems consisting of qubits. Qubit probes are employed to measure a
set of selected nodes of the quantum network systems. For a variety of
applications, a state space model is a useful way to model the system dynamics.
To construct a state space model for a quantum network system, the major task
is to find an accessible set containing all of the operators coupled to the
measurement operators. This paper focuses on the generation of a proper
accessible set for a given system and measurement scheme. We provide analytic
results on simplifying the process of generating accessible sets for systems
with a time-independent Hamiltonian. Since the order of elements in the
accessible set determines the form of state space matrices, guidance is
provided to effectively arrange the ordering of elements in the state vector.
Defining a system state according to the accessible set, one can develop a
state space model with a special pattern inherited from the system structure.
As a demonstration, we specifically consider a typical 1D-chain system with
several common measurements, and employ the proposed method to determine its
accessible set.

all considered system sizes, albeit at a significantly higher cost per epoch.
In sharp contrast to most classical gradient based learning, the performance of
all optimizers is found to decrease upon seemingly benign overparametrization
of the ansatz class, with BFGS and ADAM failing more often and more severely
than NatGrad. Additional tests for the Heisenberg XXZ model corroborate the
accuracy problems of BFGS in high dimensions, but they reveal some shortcomings

objectives of this long-term timing is to use the large asymmetry in
gravitational binding energy between the neutron star and the WD to test
gravitational theories. Such tests, however, will be eventually limited by the
accuracy of the distance to the pulsar. Here, we present VLBI (very long
baseline interferometry) astrometry results spanning approximately 2.5 years
for PSR J1012+5307, obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array as part of the
MSPSRPI project. These provide the first proper motion and absolute position
for PSR J1012+5307 measured in a quasi-inertial reference frame. From the VLBI
results, we measure a distance of $0.83^{+0.06}_{-0.02}$kpc (all the estimates
presented in the abstract are at 68% confidence) for PSR J1012+5307, which is
the most precise obtained to date. Using the new distance, we improve the
uncertainty of measurements of the unmodeled contributions to orbital period
decay, which, combined with three other pulsars, places new constraints on the

for Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase in the d-state clock model where we find a
corresponding quantum model constructed by applying a local invertible
transformation on a d-level version of Kitaev's Toric code. In particular, we
show the ground state fidelity in such quantum model is mapped to the heat
capacity of the clock model. Accordingly, we identify an extended topological
phase transition in our model in a sense that, for $d \geq 5$, a KT-like
quantum phase emerges between a $Z_d$ topological phase and a trivial phase.
Then, using a mapping to the correlation function in the clock model, we
introduce a non-local (string) observable for the quantum model which
exponentially decays in terms of distance between two endpoints of the
corresponding string in the $Z_d$ topological phase while it shows a power law
behavior in the KT-like phase. Finally, using well-known transition

zero obliquity case, a comparison between the seasonal response to changes in
eccentricity and perpetual changes in the solar constant shows that the
seasonal response strongly depends on the orbital period and radiative
timescale. More specifically, using a simple energy balance model, we show the
importance of the latitudinal structure of the radiative timescale in the
climate response. We also show that the response strongly depends on the
atmospheric moisture content. The combination of an eccentric orbit with
non-zero obliquity is complex, as the insolation also depends on the perihelion
position. Although the detailed response of the climate to variations in
eccentricity, obliquity, and perihelion is involved, the circulation is
constrained mainly by the thermal Rossby number and the maximum temperature
latitude. Finally, we discuss the importance of different planetary parameters
that affect the climate response to orbital configuration variations.

surface, perpendicular to the acceleration of gravity is shown to transition to
turbulence in the plume and the core, modifying the rate of heat and momentum
transport. These transitions set a sequence of scaling laws blending the
theoretical arguments from both the Shishkina, Grossmann & Lohse (SGL) theory

HGM model in the SGL theory, agree, and extend the known regime diagram of
horizontal convection at high Rayleigh numbers. In particular, we show that HC

HC enhances the transport of heat and momentum with respect to previously

silicon carbide to extract radiation-induced hardening. Residual stress is
evaluated using HR-EBSD, AFM swelling measurements, and a novel microcantilever
relaxation technique coupled with finite element modelling. Large compressive
residual stresses of several GPa are found in the irradiated material, which

hardening is the unirradiated substrate which constrains radiation swelling.
Comparisons with other materials susceptible to irradiation swelling show that
this effect should not be neglected in studying the effects of ion irradiation
damage on mechanical properties. This constraint may also be influencing
fundamental radiation defects. This has significant implications for the

Specifically, for such critical applications, data storage poses challenges
since the data may be compromised during the storage and the integrity might be
violated without being noticed. In such cases, integrity and data provenance
are required in order to be able to detect the source of any incident and prove
it in legal cases if there is a dispute with the involved parties. To address

design sparse hash functions where variables can be chosen with smaller
probability and lead to smaller sized XOR constraints.
  In this paper, we address this challenge from theoretical and practical
perspectives. First, we formalize a relaxation of universal hashing, called
concentrated hashing and establish a novel and beautiful connection between
concentration measures of these hash functions and isoperimetric inequalities
on boolean hypercubes. This allows us to obtain (log m) tight bounds on
variance and dispersion index and show that p = O( log(m)/m ) suffices for
design of sparse hash functions from {0, 1}^n to {0, 1}^m. We then use sparse
hash functions belonging to this concentrated hash family to develop new
approximate counting algorithms. A comprehensive experimental evaluation of our
algorithm on 1893 benchmarks demonstrates that usage of sparse hash functions
can lead to significant speedups.

  Denoising Autoencoders",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Text simplification (TS) rephrases long sentences into simplified variants
while preserving inherent semantics. Traditional sequence-to-sequence models
heavily rely on the quantity and quality of parallel sentences, which limits
their applicability in different languages and domains. This work investigates
how to leverage large amounts of unpaired corpora in TS task. We adopt the
back-translation architecture in unsupervised machine translation (NMT),
including denoising autoencoders for language modeling and automatic generation
of parallel data by iterative back-translation. However, it is non-trivial to
generate appropriate complex-simple pair if we directly treat the set of simple
and complex corpora as two different languages, since the two types of
sentences are quite similar and it is hard for the model to capture the
characteristics in different types of sentences. To tackle this problem, we
propose asymmetric denoising methods for sentences with separate complexity.
When modeling simple and complex sentences with autoencoders, we introduce
different types of noise into the training process. Such a method can
significantly improve the simplification performance. Our model can be trained
in both unsupervised and semi-supervised manner. Automatic and human
evaluations show that our unsupervised model outperforms the previous systems,
and with limited supervision, our model can perform competitively with multiple
state-of-the-art simplification systems.

models is the (synchronous) parameter server (PS). This paradigm consists of
$n$ workers, which iteratively compute updates of the model parameters, and a
stateful PS, which waits and aggregates all updates to generate a new estimate
of model parameters and sends it back to the workers for a new iteration.
Transient computation slowdowns or transmission delays can intolerably lengthen
the time of each iteration. An efficient way to mitigate this problem is to let
the PS wait only for the fastest $n-b$ updates, before generating the new
parameters. The slowest $b$ workers are called backup workers. The optimal
number $b$ of backup workers depends on the cluster configuration and workload,
but also (as we show in this paper) on the hyper-parameters of the learning

show that DBW 1) removes the necessity to tune $b$ by preliminary
time-consuming experiments, and 2) makes the training up to a factor $3$ faster

only one parameter, and three inflation models, namely the chaotic inflation,
the Higgs inflation, and the monodromy inflation. We find that the disformal
coupling can have some modifications to the observational variables of these
models such as the power spectrum, the spectral index as well as the
tensor/scalar ratio, although not too large due to the constraints on the
disformal coupling parameter. With these modifications, one has the opportunity
of improving models that lie on the edge of the favorable regions of Planck
observational data, such as monodromy inflation. Moreover, the non-trivial
sound speed of tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) may come out, due to
the coupling of gravity and kinetic terms of the field.

with implicit yet biased user feedback data. Unbiased ranking methods typically
rely on causality models and debias the user feedback through inverse
propensity weighting. While practical, these methods still suffer from two
major problems. First, when inferring a user click, the impact of the
contextual information, such as documents that have been examined, is often
ignored. Second, only the position bias is considered but other issues resulted
from user browsing behaviors are overlooked. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end Deep Recurrent Survival Ranking (DRSR), a unified framework to
jointly model user's various behaviors, to (i) consider the rich contextual
information in the ranking list; and (ii) address the hidden issues underlying
user behaviors, i.e., to mine observe pattern in queries without any click
(non-click queries), and to model tracking logs which cannot truly reflect the
user browsing intents (untrusted observation). Specifically, we adopt a
recurrent neural network to model the contextual information and estimates the
conditional likelihood of user feedback at each position. We then incorporate
survival analysis techniques with the probability chain rule to mathematically
recover the unbiased joint probability of one user's various behaviors. DRSR
can be easily incorporated with both point-wise and pair-wise learning
objectives. The extensive experiments over two large-scale industrial datasets
demonstrate the significant performance gains of our model comparing with the
state-of-the-arts.

to uncertainty in access to credit. Time-variation in uncertainty about credit
availability is estimated using particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We extract
shocks to time-varying credit uncertainty and decompose it into two parts: the
first captures the ""pure"" effect of a shock to the second moment; the second
captures total effects of uncertainty including effects on the first moment.
Using state-dependent local projections, we find that the ""pure"" effect by
itself generates a sharp slowdown in real activity and the effects are largely
countercyclical. We feed the estimated shocks into a flexible price real
business cycle model with a collateral constraint and show that when the
collateral constraint binds, an uncertainty shock about credit access is
recessionary leading to a simultaneous decline in consumption, investment, and

a simple but powerful approach to learn NER models in the absence of labelled

Transverse oscillations of coronal structures are currently

measure the thermodynamic evolution of a sample of coronal loops that undergo
decaying kink oscillations in response to an eruption in the corresponding
active region. Methods. Using data from the six coronal wavelengths of SDO/AIA,
we performed a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of 15 coronal loops
before, during, and after the eruption and oscillation. Results. We find that
the emission measure, temperature, and width of the DEM distribution undergo
significant variations on time scales relevant for the study of transverse
oscillations. There are no clear collective trends of increases or decreases
for the parameters we analysed. The strongest variations of the parameters
occur during the initial perturbation of the loops, and the influence of
background structures may also account for much of this variation. Conclusions.
The DEM analysis of oscillating coronal loops in erupting active regions shows
evidence of evolution on time scales important for the study of the
oscillations. Further work is needed to separate the various observational and
physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the variations in temperature,
DEM distribution width, and total emission measure.

measuring the association between a sparse event series and a time series. We

contrast to previous methods for causal inference or independence tests on time

on serial dependencies and peaks over multiple thresholds. The analysis gives
rise to a novel visualization of the association via quantile-trigger rate

applied in various fields including recommender systems. However, GCN still
suffers from many issues such as training difficulties, over-smoothing,
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, etc. Distinct from current GCN-based methods
which simply employ GCN for recommendation, in this paper we are committed to
build a robust GCN model for collaborative filtering. Firstly, we argue that
recursively incorporating messages from different order neighborhood mixes
distinct node messages indistinguishably, which increases the training
difficulty; instead we choose to separately aggregate different order neighbor
messages with a simple GCN model which has been shown effective; then we
accumulate them together in a hierarchical way without introducing additional
model parameters. Secondly, we propose a solution to alleviate over-smoothing
by randomly dropping out neighbor messages at each layer, which also well
prevents over-fitting and enhances the robustness. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our
model.

  Entropy Approach",,,"10.3390/e22060634",,"q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A perspective is taken on the intangible complexity of economic and social
systems by investigating the underlying dynamical processes that produce, store
and transmit information in financial time series in terms of the
\textit{moving average cluster entropy}. An extensive analysis has evidenced
market and horizon dependence of the \textit{moving average cluster entropy} in
real world financial assets. The origin of the behavior is scrutinized by
applying the \textit{moving average cluster entropy} approach to long-range
correlated stochastic processes as the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated
Moving Average (ARFIMA) and Fractional Brownian motion (FBM). To that end, an
extensive set of series is generated with a broad range of values of the Hurst
exponent $H$ and of the autoregressive, differencing and moving average
parameters $p,d,q$. A systematic relation between \textit{moving average
cluster entropy}, \textit{Market Dynamic Index} and long-range correlation
parameters $H$, $d$ is observed. This study shows that the characteristic
behaviour exhibited by the horizon dependence of the cluster entropy is related
to long-range positive correlation in financial markets. Specifically, long
range positively correlated ARFIMA processes with differencing parameter $
d\simeq 0.05$, $d\simeq 0.15$ and $ d\simeq 0.25$ are consistent with
\textit{moving average cluster entropy} results obtained in time series of

a general trend, the average number of hydrogen bonds increases upon cooling.

vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of dimension $n>0$. Let $\Omega_V$ be the
Drinfeld period domain over $\mathbb{F}_q$. This is an affine scheme of finite
type over $\mathbb{F}_q$, and its base change to $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ is the
moduli space of Drinfeld $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$-modules with level $(t)$ structure
and rank $n$. In this thesis, we give a new modular interpretation to Pink and
Schieder's smooth compactification $B_V$ of $\Omega_V$. Let $\hat V$ be the set
$V\cup\{\infty\}$ for a new symbol $\infty$. We define the notion of a $V$-fern
over an $\mathbb{F}_q$-scheme $S$, which consists of a stable $\hat V$-marked
curve of genus $0$ over $S$ endowed with a certain action of the finite group
$V\rtimes \mathbb{F}_q^\times$. Our main result is that the scheme $B_V$
represents the functor that associates an $\mathbb{F}_q$-scheme $S$ to the set
of isomorphism classes of $V$-ferns over $S$. Thus $V$-ferns over
$\mathbb{F}_q(t)$-schemes can be regarded as generalizations of Drinfeld
$\mathbb{F}_q[t]$-modules with level $(t)$ structure and rank $n$. To prove
this theorem, we construct an explicit universal $V$-fern over $B_V$. We then
show that any $V$-fern over a scheme $S$ determines a unique morphism $S\to
B_V$, depending only its isomorphism class, and that the $V$-fern is isomorphic
to the pullback of the universal $V$-fern along this morphism. We also give
several functorial constructions involving $V$-ferns, some of which are used to
prove the main result. These constructions correspond to morphisms between
various modular compactifications of Drinfeld period domains over
$\mathbb{F}_q$. We describe these morphisms explicitly.

line. The distinctive Fermi surfaces of such semimetals, dubbed as type III or
zero-index WSMs, gives rise to unique physical properties: one of the edge
modes of the semimetal exhibits a zero index of refraction along a specific

  Dynamical Models and Pedestrian Activity Recognition","12 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to several reports published by worldwide organisations, thousands
of pedestrians die in road accidents every year. Due to this fact, vehicular
technologies have been evolving with the intent of reducing these fatalities.
This evolution has not finished yet since, for instance, the predictions of
pedestrian paths could improve the current Automatic Emergency Braking Systems
(AEBS). For this reason, this paper proposes a method to predict future
pedestrian paths, poses and intentions up to 1s in advance. This method is
based on Balanced Gaussian Process Dynamical Models (B-GPDMs), which reduce the
3D time-related information extracted from keypoints or joints placed along
pedestrian bodies into low-dimensional spaces. The B-GPDM is also capable of
inferring future latent positions and reconstruct their associated
observations. However, learning a generic model for all kind of pedestrian
activities normally provides less ccurate predictions. For this reason, the
proposed method obtains multiple models of four types of activity, i.e.
walking, stopping, starting and standing, and selects the most similar model to
estimate future pedestrian states. This method detects starting activities
125ms after the gait initiation with an accuracy of 80% and recognises stopping
intentions 58.33ms before the event with an accuracy of 70%. Concerning the
path prediction, the mean error for stopping activities at a Time-To-Event
(TTE) of 1s is 238.01mm and, for starting actions, the mean error at a TTE of
0s is 331.93mm.

started improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a
portion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing
voluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases. However,
after about two weeks, the statistics saturated and stopped improving, despite
the continuous rise in COVID-19 cases. The study suggests that there is a
natural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the
extent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics. The national

the widely shared notion that such models are not fit for direct use in

non-convex, thwarting existing scalable robustness analysis methods, which are

variable models that have been shown effective in learning text representations
as well as in text generation. The key challenge with using VAEs is the {\it
posterior collapse} problem: learning tends to converge to trivial solutions
where the generators ignore latent variables. In our Levenstein VAE, we propose
to replace the evidence lower bound (ELBO) with a new objective which is simple
to optimize and prevents posterior collapse. Intuitively, it corresponds to
generating a sequence from the autoencoder and encouraging the model to predict
an optimal continuation according to the Levenshtein distance (LD) with the
reference sentence at each time step in the generated sequence. We motivate the
method from the probabilistic perspective by showing that it is closely related
to optimizing a bound on the intractable Kullback-Leibler divergence of an
LD-based kernel density estimator from the model distribution. With this
objective, any generator disregarding latent variables will incur large
penalties and hence posterior collapse does not happen. We relate our approach
to policy distillation \cite{RossGB11} and dynamic oracles \cite{GoldbergN12}.
By considering Yelp and SNLI benchmarks, we show that Levenstein VAE produces
more informative latent representations than alternative approaches to
preventing posterior collapse.

incompleteness. In contrast, textual encoding approaches, e.g., KG-BERT, resort
to graph triple's text and triple-level contextualized representations. They
are generalizable enough and robust to the incompleteness, especially when
coupled with pre-trained encoders. But two major drawbacks limit the
performance: (1) high overheads due to the costly scoring of all possible
triples in inference, and (2) a lack of structured knowledge in the textual
encoder. In this paper, we follow the textual encoding paradigm and aim to
alleviate its drawbacks by augmenting it with graph embedding techniques -- a
complementary hybrid of both paradigms. Specifically, we partition each triple
into two asymmetric parts as in translation-based graph embedding approach, and
encode both parts into contextualized representations by a Siamese-style
textual encoder. Built upon the representations, our model employs both
deterministic classifier and spatial measurement for representation and
structure learning respectively. Moreover, we develop a self-adaptive ensemble

quasiparticle properties change significantly upon doping - an effect which is
not captured by tight-binding theory. In particular, we observe that the
partially occupied bands flatten significantly which enhances the density of
states at the Fermi level. We predict a clear signature of this band flattening

generalization of the widely used Kermack-McKendrick(KM) model where the
susceptible(S) population evolves into two other categories, namely
infectives(I) and removed(R). This is the well-known SIR model in which we
further divide both S and I into high and low risk categories. We first
formulate a set of non-local dynamical equations for the time evolution of
distinct population distributions under this categorization in an attempt to
describe the general scenario of infectious disease progression. We then solve
the non-linear coupled differential equations-(i) numerically by the method of
propagation, and (ii) a more flexible and versatile cellular automata (CA)
simulation which provides a coarse-grained description of the generalized
non-local model. In order to account for multiple factors such as role of
spreaders before containment, we introduce a time dependent rate which appears
to be essential to explain the sudden spikes before the plateau observed in
many cases (for example like China). We demonstrate how this generalized
approach allows us to handle the effects of (i) time-dependence of the
rate-constants of spread, (ii) different population density, (iii) the age
ratio, (iv) quarantine, (v) lockdown, and (vi) social distancing. Our study
allows us to make certain predictions regarding the nature of spread with
respect to several external parameters, treated as control variables. Analysis
of the model clearly shows that due to the strong heterogeneity in the epidemic
process originating from the distribution of initial infectives, the theory
must be local in character but at the same time connect to a global
perspective.

proper subclasses of dimension-2 posets all have bounded twin-width. On all

twin-width is at most $d$. We show that FO model checking, that is deciding if
a given first-order formula $\phi$ evaluates to true for a given binary
structure $G$ on a domain $D$, is FPT in $|\phi|$ on classes of bounded
twin-width, provided the witness is given. More precisely, being given a
$d$-contraction sequence for $G$, our algorithm runs in time $f(d,|\phi|) \cdot
|D|$ where $f$ is a computable but non-elementary function. We also prove that
bounded twin-width is preserved by FO interpretations and transductions

K servers, each with its own queue. Every arriving job is replicated into
2<=d<=K tasks, which are then routed to d servers chosen uniformly at random.
When the first task finishes service, the remaining d-1 tasks are cancelled and
the job departs the system.
  Despite the fact that R(d) is known, under certain conditions, to
substantially improve job completion times compared to not using redundancy at
all, little is known on a more fundamental performance criterion: what is the
set of arrival rates under which the R(d) queueing system with FIFO service
discipline is stable? In this context, due to the complex dynamics of systems
with redundancy and cancellations, existing results are scarce and are limited
to very special cases with respect to the joint service time distribution of

  In this paper we provide a non-trivial, closed form lower bound on the

Bernoulli arrivals and assume that jobs are processed by their order of

characterize the set of arrival rates for which the system is stable. While

with knowledge transferred from seen classes. This is typically achieved by
exploiting a semantic feature space shared by both seen and unseen classes,
i.e., attribute or word vector, as the bridge. One common practice in zero-shot
learning is to train a projection between the visual and semantic feature
spaces with labeled seen classes examples. When inferring, this learned
projection is applied to unseen classes and recognizes the class labels by some
metrics. However, the visual and semantic feature spaces are mutually
independent and have quite different manifold structures. Under such a
paradigm, most existing methods easily suffer from the domain shift problem and
weaken the performance of zero-shot recognition. To address this issue, we
propose a novel model called AMS-SFE. It considers the alignment of manifold
structures by semantic feature expansion. Specifically, we build upon an
autoencoder-based model to expand the semantic features from the visual inputs.
Additionally, the expansion is jointly guided by an embedded manifold extracted
from the visual feature space of the data. Our model is the first attempt to
align both feature spaces by expanding semantic features and derives two
benefits: first, we expand some auxiliary features that enhance the semantic
feature space; second and more importantly, we implicitly align the manifold
structures between the visual and semantic feature spaces; thus, the projection
can be better trained and mitigate the domain shift problem. Extensive
experiments show significant performance improvement, which verifies the
effectiveness of our model.

limited formal evaluation of these methods and whether they can be used to
accurately compare treatments. Thus, we undertake a comprehensive simulation
study to compare standard unadjusted indirect comparisons, MAIC and STC across
162 scenarios. This simulation study assumes that the trials are investigating
survival outcomes and measure continuous covariates, with the log hazard ratio
as the measure of effect. MAIC yields unbiased treatment effect estimates under
no failures of assumptions. The typical usage of STC produces bias because it
targets a conditional treatment effect where the target estimand should be a
marginal treatment effect. The incompatibility of estimates in the indirect
comparison leads to bias as the measure of effect is non-collapsible. Standard
indirect comparisons are systematically biased, particularly under stronger
covariate imbalance and interaction effects. Standard errors and coverage rates
are often valid in MAIC but the robust sandwich variance estimator
underestimates variability where effective sample sizes are small. Interval
estimates for the standard indirect comparison are too narrow and STC suffers
from bias-induced undercoverage. MAIC provides the most accurate estimates and,
with lower degrees of covariate overlap, its bias reduction outweighs the loss
in effective sample size and precision under no failures of assumptions. An
important future objective is the development of an alternative formulation to
STC that targets a marginal treatment effect.

available Kepler light curves and APOGEE spectra, and discuss some of the
systematics that may affect the accuracy of the inferred stellar properties.
First, we look at age-chemical-abundances relations. We find a dearth of young,
metal-rich stars, and the existence of a significant population of old (8-9
Gyr), low-[$\alpha$/Fe], super-solar metallicity stars, reminiscent of the age
and metallicity of the well-studied open cluster NGC6791. The
age-chemo-kinematic properties of these stars indicate that efficient radial
migration happens in the thin disk. We find that ages and masses of the nearly
400 $\alpha$-element-rich red-giant-branch (RGB) stars in our sample are
compatible with those of an old (~11 Gyr), nearly coeval, chemical-thick disk
population. Using a statistical model, we show that 95% of the population was
born within ~1.5 Gyr. Moreover, we find a difference in the vertical velocity
dispersion between low- and high-[$\alpha$/Fe] populations, confirming their
different chemo-dynamical histories. We then exploit the almost coeval
$\alpha$-rich population to gain insight into processes that may have altered
the mass of a star along its evolution, which are key to improve the mapping of
the observed stellar mass to age. We find evidence for a mean integrated RGB
mass loss <$\Delta$M>= 0.10 $\pm$ 0.02 Msun and that the occurrence of massive
(M $\gtrsim$ 1.1 Msun) $\alpha$-rich stars is of the order of 5% on the RGB,
and significantly higher in the RC, supporting the scenario in which most of
these stars had undergone interaction with a companion.

high-dimensional compositional as well as clinical data. Additionally, we
accommodate the compositional structure of the data via balances and
overdispersion typically found in microbial samples. We apply our model to
understand the relations between dietary intake, microbial samples, and BMI. In
this analysis, we find numerous associations between microbial taxa and dietary
factors that may lead to a microbiome that is generally more hospitable to the
development of chronic diseases, such as obesity. Additionally, we demonstrate
on simulated data how our method outperforms two-step approaches and also

interpret practical signals using TFDs. In order to address these issues, we
propose the U-Net aided iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (U-ISTA) for

followed by unfolding the ISTA as a recurrent neural network. To consider

constraint is incorporated into the unfolded ISTA by regarding the U-Net as an
adaptive threshold block, in which structure-aware thresholds are learned from

TF coefficients. The proposed U-ISTA model is trained by both non-overlapped

processing methods combined with numerical and analytical models provide a
comprehensive quantitative description of these solids and their global
behaviour, including the influence of the boundary conditions, of the
manufacturing process, and of geometric and constitutive non-linearities. To
this end, an adapted multi-scale digital image correlation analysis is used to
track both elongations and rotations of particular features of the unit cell at
the local and global (homogenized) scale of the material. This permits to
observe with unprecedented clarity the strains for various unit cells in the
structure and to detect global deformation patterns and heterogeneities of the
homogenized strain distribution. This method is here demonstrated on elastic
sheets undergoing extreme longitudinal and shear deformations. These
experimental results are compared to non-linear finite element simulations,
which are also used to evaluate the effects of manufacturing imperfections on
the response. A skeletal representation of the architectured solid is then
extracted from the experiments and used to create a purely-kinematic
truss-hinge model that can accurately capture its behaviour. The analysis
proposed in this work can be extended to guide the design of two-dimensional
architectured solids featuring other regular, quasi-regular or graded patterns,
and subjected to other types of loads.

methods based on random forests (RF) have become widely accepted, as the RF
algorithm can achieve high accuracy without the need for specification of data
distributions or relationships. However, the predictions from RF do not contain
information about prediction uncertainty, which was unacceptable for multiple
imputation. Available RF-based multiple imputation methods tried to do proper
multiple imputation either by sampling directly from observations under
predicting nodes without accounting for the prediction error or by making
normality assumption about the prediction error distribution. In this study, a
novel RF-based multiple imputation method was proposed by constructing
conditional distributions the empirical distribution of out-of-bag prediction
errors. The proposed method was compared with previous method with parametric
assumptions about RF's prediction errors and predictive mean matching based on
simulation studies on data with presence of interaction term. The proposed
non-parametric method can deliver valid multiple imputation results. The
accompanying R package for this study is publicly available.

cumulative incidences quantifies the total causal effect of a treatment on the
event of interest. However, effects of treatment on the competing event may
indirectly contribute to this total effect, complicating its interpretation. We
previously proposed the separable effects (Stensrud et al, 2019) to define
direct and indirect effects of the treatment on the event of interest. This
definition presupposes a treatment decomposition into two components acting
along two separate causal pathways, one exclusively outside of the competing
event and the other exclusively through it. Unlike previous definitions of
direct and indirect effects, the separable effects can be subject to empirical
scrutiny in a study where separate interventions on the treatment components
are available. Here we extend and generalize the notion of the separable
effects in several ways, allowing for interpretation, identification and
estimation under considerably weaker assumptions. We propose and discuss a
definition of separable effects that is applicable to general time-varying
structures, where the separable effects can still be meaningfully interpreted,
even when they cannot be regarded as direct and indirect effects. We further
derive weaker conditions for identification of separable effects in
observational studies where decomposed treatments are not yet available; in
particular, these conditions allow for time-varying common causes of the event
of interest, the competing events and loss to follow-up. For these general
settings, we propose semi-parametric weighted estimators that are
straightforward to implement. As an illustration, we apply the estimators to
study the separable effects of intensive blood pressure therapy on acute kidney

under the action of repulsive drivers. The problem is formulated in an optimal
control framework, where the drivers (controls) aim to guide the evaders
(states) to a desired region of the Euclidean space. The numerical simulation
of such models quickly becomes unfeasible for a large number of interacting
agents. To reduce the computational cost, we use the Random Batch Method (RBM),
which provides a computationally feasible approximation of the dynamics. At
each time step, the RBM randomly divides the set of particles into small
subsets (batches), considering only the interactions inside each batch. Due to
the averaging effect, the RBM approximation converges to the exact dynamics as
the time discretization gets finer. We propose an algorithm that leads to the
optimal control of a fixed RBM approximated trajectory using a classical
gradient descent. The resulting control is not optimal for the original
complete system, but rather for the reduced RBM model. We then adopt a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to handle the error in the dynamics. While
the system evolves in time, the MPC strategy consists in periodically updating
the state and computing the optimal control over a long-time horizon, which is
implemented recursively in a shorter time-horizon. This leads to a
semi-feedback control strategy. Through numerical experiments we show that the
combination of RBM and MPC leads to a significant reduction of the
computational cost, preserving the capacity of controlling the overall
dynamics.

experimentally thermal single-pulse switching in GdFeCo alloys, for a wide

duration. We provide a quantitative description of the switching dynamics using
atomistic spin dynamics methods with excellent agreement between the model and
our experiments across a wide range of parameters and timescales, ranging from
femtoseconds to picoseconds. Furthermore, we find distinct element-specific
damping parameters as a key ingredient for switching with long picosecond
pulses and argue, that switching with pulse durations as long as 15 picoseconds
is possible due to a low damping constant of Gd. Our findings can be easily
extended to speed up dynamics in other contexts where ferrimagnetic GdFeCo

around a static and spherically symmetric wormhole influenced by a radiation
field including the general relativistic Poynting-Robertson effect. From the
analysis of this dynamical system, we develop a diagnostic to distinguish a
black hole from a wormhole, which can be timely supported by several and
different observational data. This procedure is based on the possibility of
having some wormhole metrics, which smoothly connect to the Schwarzschild
metric in a small transition surface layer very close to the black hole event
horizon. To detect such a metric-change, we analyse the emission proprieties
from the critical hypersurface (stable region where radiation and gravitational
fields balance) together with those from an accretion disk in the Schwarzschild
spacetime toward a distant observer. Indeed, if the observational data are well
fitted within such model, it immediately implies the existence of a black hole;
while in case of strong departures from such description it means that a
wormhole could be present. Finally, we discuss our results and draw the
conclusions.

an important issue. In such situations, penalized regression models may face
computational problems and some pre screening of the variables may be
necessary. A number of procedures for such pre-screening has been developed;
among them the sure independence screening (SIS) enjoys some popularity.
However, SIS is vulnerable to outliers in the data, and in particular in small
samples this may lead to faulty inference. In this paper, we develop a new
robust screening procedure. We build on the density power divergence (DPD)
estimation approach and introduce DPD-SIS and its extension iterative DPD-SIS.
We illustrate the behavior of the methods through extensive simulation studies
and show that they are superior to both the original SIS and other robust
methods when there are outliers in the data. We demonstrate the claimed
robustness through use of influence functions, and we discuss appropriate
choice of the tuning parameter $\alpha$. Finally, we illustrate its use on a
small dataset from a study on regulation of lipid metabolism.

successfully inflation by a non-minimal coupling to supergravity and shows a

is in agreement with current collider and Dark Matter constraints, and study
the influence of the non-minimal coupling on the phenomenology. Measuring the

promising for resolving the models, even though the Standard Model-like Higgs

still show a high error rate. In this paper, we investigate the questions: Have
we reached a performance ceiling or is there still room for improvement? And
how do crowd annotations, dataset, and models contribute to this error rate? To
answer these questions, we first validate the most challenging 5K examples in
the development and test sets using trained annotators. We find that label
errors account for 8% absolute F1 test error, and that more than 50% of the
examples need to be relabeled. On the relabeled test set the average F1 score
of a large baseline model set improves from 62.1 to 70.1. After validation, we
analyze misclassifications on the challenging instances, categorize them into
linguistically motivated error groups, and verify the resulting error
hypotheses on three state-of-the-art RE models. We show that two groups of
ambiguous relations are responsible for most of the remaining errors and that
models may adopt shallow heuristics on the dataset when entities are not

lithium abundance predicted by the Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the one
observed for the stars of the 'Spite plateau', is one of the long standing
problems of modern astrophysics. Recent hints for a possible solution involve
lithium burning induced by protostellar mass accretion on Spite plateau stars.
  The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of protostellar accretion
on low metallicity low-mass stars with a focus on PMS lithium evolution. We
computed the evolution from the protostar to the MS phase of accreting models
with final masses of 0.7 and 0.8 M$_\odot$, and three metallicities Z=0.0001,
Z=0.0010, and Z=0.0050. The effects of changing the main parameters affecting
accreting models, that is the accretion energy (cold versus hot accretion), the
initial seed mass $M_{seed}$ and radius $R_{seed}$, and the mass accretion rate
$\dot{m}$, have been investigated in detail.
  As for the main stellar properties and the surface $^7 Li$ abundance, hot
accretion models converge to standard non-accreting ones within 1 Myr,
regardless of the actual value of $M_{seed}$, $R_{seed}$, and $\dot{m}$. Also,
cold accretion models with a relatively large $M_{seed}$ ($\gtrsim 10~M_{jup}$)
or $R_{seed}$ ($\gtrsim 1~R_\odot$) converge to standard non-accreting ones in
less than about 10-20~Myr. A drastically different evolution occurs whenever a
cold protostellar accretion process starts from small values of $M_{seed}$ and
$R_{seed}$ ($M_{seed}\sim 1~M_{jup}$, $R_{seed} \lesssim 1~R_\odot$). These
models almost entirely skip the standard Hayashi track evolution and deplete Li
before the end of the accretion phase. The exact amount of depletion depends on
the actual combination of the accretion parameters ($\dot{m}$, $M_{seed}$, and
$R_{seed}$), achieving in some cases the complete exhaustion of Li in the whole
star.

finite-dimensional vector space. A fundamental result in invariant theory
states that the orbit closure of a vector v is separated from the origin if and
only if some homogeneous invariant polynomial is nonzero on v, i.e. v is not in
the null cone. Thus, efficiently finding the minimum distance between the orbit
closure and the origin can lead to deterministic algorithms for null cone
membership, an important polynomial identity testing problem including the
non-commutative Edmonds problem. This connection to optimization has recently
led to efficient algorithms for many problems in invariant theory.
  Here we explore a refinement of the famous duality between orbit closures and
invariant polynomials, which holds that the following two quantities coincide:
(1) the logarithm of the Euclidean distance between the orbit closure and the
origin and (2) the rate of exponential growth of the 'invariant part' of
$v^{\otimes k}$ in the semiclassical limit as k tends to infinity. This result
can be deduced from work of S. Zhang (Geometric reductivity at Archimedean
places, 1994), which uses sophisticated tools in arithmetic geometry. We
provide a new and independent elementary proof inspired by the Fourier-analytic
proof of the local central limit theorem. We generalize the result to
projections onto highest weight vectors and isotypical components, and explore
connections between such semiclassical limits and the asymptotic behavior of
multiplicities in representation theory, large deviations theory in classical
and quantum statistics, and the Jacobian conjecture as reformulated by Mathieu.
Our formulas imply that they can be computed, in many cases efficiently, to
arbitrary precision.

a human translator. If this was achievable, then it would revolutionise Deaf
hearing communications. Previous work on predominantly isolated SLP has shown
the need for architectures that are better suited to the continuous domain of
full sign sequences.
  In this paper, we propose Progressive Transformers, a novel architecture that
can translate from discrete spoken language sentences to continuous 3D skeleton
pose outputs representing sign language. We present two model configurations,
an end-to-end network that produces sign direct from text and a stacked network
that utilises a gloss intermediary.
  Our transformer network architecture introduces a counter that enables
continuous sequence generation at training and inference. We also provide
several data augmentation processes to overcome the problem of drift and
improve the performance of SLP models. We propose a back translation evaluation
mechanism for SLP, presenting benchmark quantitative results on the challenging
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T(PHOENIX14T) dataset and setting baselines for future
research.

of coupled oscillators governed by a collection of differential equations. The
ubiquitous Kuramoto models rely on an {\em a priori} fixed connectivity pattern
facilitates mutual communication and influence between oscillators. In
biological synchronizable systems, like the mammalian suprachaismatic nucleus,
enabling communication comes at a cost -- the organism expends energy creating
and maintaining the system -- linking their development to evolutionary
selection. Here, we introduce and analyze a new evolutionary game theoretic
framework modeling the behavior and evolution of systems of coupled
oscillators. Each oscillator in our model is characterized by a pair of dynamic
behavioral traits: an oscillatory phase and whether they connect and
communicate to other oscillators or not. Evolution of the system occurs along
these dimensions, allowing oscillators to change their phases and/or their
communication strategies. We measure success of mutations by comparing the
benefit of phase synchronization to the organism balanced against the cost of
creating and maintaining connections between the oscillators. Despite such a
simple setup, this system exhibits a wealth of nontrivial behaviors, mimicking
different classical games -- the Prisoner's Dilemma, the snowdrift game, and
coordination games -- as the landscape of the oscillators changes over time.
Despite such complexity, we find a surprisingly simple characterization of
synchronization through connectivity and communication: if the benefit of
synchronization $B(0)$ is greater than twice the cost $c$, $B(0) > 2c$, the
organism will evolve towards complete communication and phase synchronization.
Taken together, our model demonstrates possible evolutionary constraints on
both the existence of a synchronized oscillatory system and its overall
connectivity.

information expressed in multiple documents, such as user reviews of a product.
The task is practically important and has attracted a lot of attention.
However, due to the high cost of summary production, datasets large enough for
training supervised models are lacking. Instead, the task has been
traditionally approached with extractive methods that learn to select text
fragments in an unsupervised or weakly-supervised way. Recently, it has been
shown that abstractive summaries, potentially more fluent and better at
reflecting conflicting information, can also be produced in an unsupervised
fashion. However, these models, not being exposed to actual summaries, fail to
capture their essential properties. In this work, we show that even a handful
of summaries is sufficient to bootstrap generation of the summary text with all
expected properties, such as writing style, informativeness, fluency, and
sentiment preservation. We start by training a conditional Transformer language
model to generate a new product review given other available reviews of the
product. The model is also conditioned on review properties that are directly
related to summaries; the properties are derived from reviews with no manual
effort. In the second stage, we fine-tune a plug-in module that learns to
predict property values on a handful of summaries. This lets us switch the
generator to the summarization mode. We show on Amazon and Yelp datasets that
our approach substantially outperforms previous extractive and abstractive

coupling cell-vertex algorithm, well suited for industrial purposes, making it
highly valuable for aeroacoustic applications. It is indeed known that the
convection of vortical structures across a grid refinement interface, where
cell size is abruptly doubled, is likely to generate spurious noise that may
corrupt the solution over the whole computational domain. This issue becomes
critical in the case of aeroacoustic simulations, where accurate pressure
estimations are of paramount importance. Consequently, any interfering noise
that may pollute the acoustic predictions must be reduced.
  The proposed grid refinement algorithm differs from conventionally used ones,
in which an overlapping mesh layer is considered. Instead, it provides a direct
connection allowing a tighter link between fine and coarse grids, especially
with the use of a coherent equilibrium function shared by both grids. Moreover,
the direct coupling makes the algorithm more local and prevents the duplication
of points, which might be detrimental for massive parallelization. This work
follows our first study (Astoul~\textit{et al. 2020}) on the deleterious effect
of non-hydrodynamic modes crossing mesh transitions, which can be addressed
using an appropriate collision model. The Hybrid Recursive Regularized model is
then used for this study. The grid coupling algorithm is assessed and compared
to a widely-used cell-vertex algorithm on an acoustic pulse test case, a
convected vortex and a turbulent circular cylinder wake flow at high Reynolds
number.

linguistic information, especially the one generated by human beings. Various
CWW approaches have emerged since the inception of CWW, such as perceptual
computing, extension principle based CWW approach, symbolic method based CWW
approach, and 2-tuple based CWW approach. Furthermore, perceptual computing can
use interval approach (IA), enhanced interval approach (EIA), or Hao-Mendel
approach (HMA), for data processing. There have been numerous works in which
HMA was shown to be better at word modelling than EIA, and EIA better than IA.
But, a deeper study of these works reveals that HMA captures lesser fuzziness
than the EIA or IA. Thus, we feel that EIA is more suited for word modelling in
multi-person systems and HMA for single-person systems (as EIA is an
improvement over IA). Furthermore, another set of works, compared the
performances perceptual computing to the other above said CWW approaches. In
all these works, perceptual computing was shown to be better than other CWW
approaches. However, none of the works tried to investigate the reason behind
this observed better performance of perceptual computing. Also, no comparison
has been performed for scenarios where the inputs are differentially weighted.
Thus, the aim of this work is to empirically establish that EIA is suitable for
multi-person systems and HMA for single-person systems. Another dimension of
this work is also to empirically prove that perceptual computing gives better

detection is to estimate and remove systematic noise independently of and prior
to a transit detection test. If a transit signal is present in a light curve,
the process of systematic noise removal may distort the transit signal by
overfitting and thereby reduce detection efficiency. We present a Bayesian
framework for joint detection of transit signals and systematic noise
characterization and describe the implementation of these detectors as optimal
Neyman-Pearson likelihood ratio tests. The joint detectors reduce to closed
form as matched filters under the assumption of a Gaussian Bayesian prior for
the systematic noise. The performance of the exploratory detectors was
evaluated in injection tests and show $\sim 2\%$ improvement in overall
detection efficiency relative to the standard approach. We find that joint
detection efficiency is specifically improved for short-period, low
transit-depth exoplanet transits, providing evidence in support of the
hypothesis that joint detection may indeed help to mitigate overfitting. In
addition, an initial feasibility test to detect known exoplanets in Kepler data

with solar eruptive sources (coronal mass ejections, CMEs). The analysis aims
to obtain a possibly complete picture of the relationship between the transit
time of propagation of CMEs and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs)
from the Sun to the Earth (more precisely, the time interval dtp from the
moment of an eruption until the peak of the corresponding GMS) and the maximum
intensity of this GMS, as measured by the disturbance storm time geomagnetic
index Dst. Two groups of events are singled out: one includes GMSs, the source
of which was an eruption from an active region (AR events), the other GMSs
caused by filament eruptions from quiescent areas of the Sun located outside
ARs (QS events). The distribution of the large number of the analyzed events on
a dtp - Dst plane confirms and substantially clarifies the known regularities.
The AR events are characterized by a shorter transit time (dtp ~ 1-4 days) and
much stronger GMSs (Dst up to -600 nT mainly) in comparison with the QS events
(dtp ~ 3-5 days, Dst > -200 nT). For events of both groups, the shorter transit
time of CMEs/ICMEs, the more intense GMSs; in particular, for AR events when
dtp declines from 4 to 1 day, Dst decreases on average from -100 to -470 nT and
can reach -900 nT. From the point of view of the nature of GMSs and their
sources on the Sun, the obtained results mean that both the speed of CMEs/ICMEs
and the strength of the magnetic field transferred by them are largely
determined by the parameters of the corresponding eruptions, in particular, by
the eruptive magnetic flux and the released energy.

nuclear interaction? While there is ample experimental evidence for this
phenomenon, its theoretical characterization directly from nucleons as degrees
of freedom remains a challenge, making it difficult to improve nuclear forces
using clustering observables. In this work, a simple ratio of energies based on
effective scale arguments is proposed to assess the quality of nuclear forces
on alpha clustering (${ {}^{4}\text{He} }$) in bound and narrow ground-state
nuclei. The proposed clustering ratio is parameter-free and correctly identify
basic alpha clustering features in light nuclei. It is found that in nuclei
ranging from ${ {}^{6}\text{Li} }$ to ${ {}^{14}\text{C} }$, state-of-the-art
\textit{ab initio} nuclear forces underestimate the degree of alpha clustering
in key nuclei such as ${ {}^{8}\text{Be} }$ and ${ {}^{12}\text{C} }$.
Stringent constraints on binding energies are then provided by back-propagating
10\% relative uncertainties on the experimental clustering ratios using a
parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. It is demonstrated that the
binding energies of the nuclei $^{6,7}$Li, $^7$Be, $^{10,11}$B, and $^{11}$C
need to be obtained within tens of keV precision by nuclear forces to ensure a
proper reproduction of basic alpha clustering features in light nuclei. This
study provides a new and practical path to guide future optimizations of
nuclear forces with a potential impact for medium-mass nuclei.

a natural generalization of the original $3n+1$ problem, it consists of a
discrete dynamical system of an arithmetical kind. Using standard methods of
number theory and dynamical systems, general properties are established, such
as the existence of finitely many periodic sequences for each $q$. In
particular, when $q$ is a Mersenne number, $q=2^p-1$, there only exists one
such cycle, known as the trivial one. Further analysis based on a probabilistic
model shows that for $q=3$ the asymptotic behavior of all sequences is always
convergent, whereas for $q\geq 5$ the asymptotic behavior of the sequences is
divergent for almost all numbers (for a set of natural density one). This leads
to the conclusion that the so called Collatz Conjecture is true, and that $q=3$

will devise an intermediary filter based on reference governors that guarantees
the satisfaction of performance-related constraints. Since these modifications
and impact events lead to deviations from the desired periodic orbits, we will
guarantee hybrid invariance in a robust way by applying predictive schemes
withing a very short time envelope during the gait cycle. To achieve the hybrid
invariance, we will leverage the unique features in our model, that is, the
thrusters. The merit of our approach is that unlike existing optimization-based
nonlinear control methods, satisfying performance-related constraints during

allows for exploiting performance and robustness enhancing capabilities during

main challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2)
the task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To
address them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19
diagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy
via feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a
novel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose
COVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations.
Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of COVID-DA and its great
potential for real-world applications.

and transfer learning to classify chest X-ray images according to three labels:
COVID-19, pneumonia and normal.
  Methods: We fine-tuned neural networks pretrained on ImageNet and applied a
twice transfer learning approach, using NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset as an
intermediate step. We also suggested a novelty called output neuron keeping,
which changes the twice transfer learning technique. In order to clarify the
modus operandi of the models, we used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to
generate heatmaps.
  Results: We were able to reach test accuracy of 100% on our test dataset.
Twice transfer learning and output neuron keeping showed promising results
improving performances, mainly in the beginning of the training process.
Although LRP revealed that words on the X-rays can influence the networks'
predictions, we discovered this had only a very small effect on accuracy.
  Conclusion: Although clinical studies and larger datasets are still needed to
further ensure good generalization, the state-of-the-art performances we
achieved show that, with the help of artificial intelligence, chest X-rays can
become a cheap and accurate auxiliary method for COVID-19 diagnosis. Heatmaps
generated by LRP improve the interpretability of the deep neural networks and
indicate an analytical path for future research on diagnosis. Twice transfer

promising way to stabilize their shape and improve thermal conductivity which

composites a general understanding of how leakage is related to the
characteristics of the porous material is still lacking. As a result, the
energy density and the antileakage capability are often antagonistically
coupled. In this work we overcome the current limitations, showing that a high
energy density can be reached together with superior anti-leakage performance
by using hierarchical macro-nanoporous metals for PCMs impregnation. By
analyzing capillary phenomena and synthesizing a new type of material, it was
demonstrated that a hierarchical trimodal macro-nanoporous metal (copper)
provides superior antileakage capability (due to strong capillary forces of
nanopores), high energy density (90vol% of PCM load due to macropores) and
improves the charging/discharging kinetics, due to a three-fold enhancement of
thermal conductivity. It was further demonstrated by CFD simulations that such
a composite can be used for thermal management of a battery pack and unlike
pure PCM it is capable of maintaining the maximum temperature below the safety
limit. The present results pave the way for the application of hierarchical
macro-nanoporous metals for high-energy density, leakage-free, and
shape-stabilized PCMs with enhanced thermal conductivity. These innovative
composites can significantly facilitate the thermal management of compact

impact, as current data-driven methods try to efficiently combine statistics
with economic indices and machine learning. However, recent studies in network
science pinpoint towards the importance of temporal characteristics in the
diffusion of opinion. As such, we combine concepts of micro-scale opinion
dynamics and temporal epidemics, and develop a novel macro-scale temporal
attenuation (TA) model, which uses pre-election poll data to improve
forecasting accuracy. Our hypothesis is that the timing of publicizing opinion
polls plays a significant role in how opinion oscillates, especially right
before elections. Thus, we define the momentum of opinion as a temporal
function which bounces up when opinion is injected in a multi-opinion system of
voters, and dampens during states of relaxation. We validate TA on survey data
from the US Presidential Elections between 1968-2016, and TA outperforms
statistical methods, as well the best pollsters at their time, in 10 out of 13
presidential elections. We present two different implementations of the TA
model, which accumulate an average forecasting error of 2.8-3.28 points over
the 48-year period. Conversely, statistical methods accumulate 7.48 points
error, and the best pollsters accumulate 3.64 points. Overall, TA offers
increases of 23-37% in forecasting performance compared to the state of the
art. We show that the effectiveness of TA does not drop when relatively few
polls are available; moreover, with increasing availability of pre-election
surveys, we believe that our TA model will become a reference alongside other
modern election forecasting techniques.

distribution, propagation pathloss and many system parameters, which renders
its analytical study difficult so that numerical algorithms are widely used
instead. In this paper, the problem is studied analytically. First, it is
formulated as a convex optimization problem to minimize the total BS transmit
power subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, which also account for
fairness among users. Due to its convex nature, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions are used to characterize a globally-optimum location as a convex
combination of user locations, where convex weights depend on user parameters,
pathloss exponent and overall geometry of the problem. Based on this
characterization, a number of closed-form solutions are obtained. In
particular, the optimum BS location is the mean of user locations in the case
of free-space propagation and identical user parameters. If the user set is
symmetric (as defined in the paper), the optimal BS location is independent of
pathloss exponent, which is not the case in general. The analytical results
show the impact of propagation conditions as well as system and user parameters
on optimal BS location and can be used to develop design guidelines.

have also been steady attempts to produce UAVs using Coanda Effect, but have
never tried to achieve Acoustic Stealth through Coanda UAVs. But Coanda Effect
uses only one motor and is structurally quiet. So we tried to find quiet
methods (materials, structures) while at the same time having sufficient
stimulus through the Coanda Effect. Verification went through experiments. The
control group used the most common type of Quadrone, and determine if the
hypothesis is correct by testing various structures and materials under the
same conditions, and measuring noise. UAVs using Coanda Effect are not of any
shape or structure that is not changeable, and internal space is also empty.
That's why the Coanda Effect UAV we present can be improved through follow-up
research. That's why the Coanda Effect UAV could open up a new frontier for the
Stealth UAVs.

converter considering the loss mechanisms due to the space charge effect and
interelectrode radiative heat transfer. The dependencies of the space charge
effect and near-field radiative heat exchange on the interelectrode distance
are derived based on established theories. The electrode temperatures are
determined by solving the steady-state energy balance equations in a numerical,
iterative process and considering a constant energy flux input to the emitter.
The resultant behaviour of the different mechanisms of energy flow from the
electrodes is studied for a wide range of interelectrode distances, which
provides new insights into the device operation. The maximum efficiency of the
converter is obtained by optimizing the operating voltage and interelectrode
distance. Considering the interplay between space charge and near-field
radiative heat transfer, an optimal range is determined for the interelectrode
distance. The optimal value of the distance and the lower limit of this range
are found to be significantly higher than previously reported, where constant
electrode temperatures had been assumed.

R\'{e}nyi-$\alpha$ entanglement of assistance (REoA) of a reduced density
matrix for a generalized $W$-class states. According to the analytical formula,
we show monogamy and polygamy relations for generalized $W$-class states in
terms of R$\alpha$E and REoA. Then we give the upper bounds for generalized
$W$-class states in terms of R$\alpha$E. Next, we provide tighter monogamy
relations for generalized $W$-class states in terms of concurrence and
convex-roof extended negativity and obtain the monogamy relations for
R$\alpha$E by the analytical expression between R$\alpha$E and concurrence.
Finally, we apply our results into quantum games and present a new bound of the
nonclassicality of quantum games restricting to generalized $W$-class states.
