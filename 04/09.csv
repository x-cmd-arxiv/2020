forgetting previous knowledge, also known as Continual Learning (CL), is a key
enabler for scalable and trustworthy deployments of adaptive solutions. While
the importance of continual learning is largely acknowledged in machine vision
and reinforcement learning problems, this is mostly under-documented for
sequence processing tasks. This work proposes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
model for CL that is able to deal with concept drift in input distribution
without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. We also implement and test a
popular CL approach, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), on top of two
different types of RNNs. Finally, we compare the performances of our enhanced
architecture against EWC and RNNs on a set of standard CL benchmarks, adapted
to the sequential data processing scenario. Results show the superior
performance of our architecture and highlight the need for special solutions
designed to address CL in RNNs.

quivers for the Higgs branches at finite and infinite gauge coupling. Comparing
these moduli spaces allows to study the non-perturbative effects when
transitioning to the fixed point. For 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SQCD, 5-brane webs

important class of families considered are the orthogonal exceptional $E_n$

of radio pulsations. We report here on the analysis of the Swift burst and
follow-up X-ray and radio observations. The burst average luminosity was
$L_{\rm burst} \sim2\times 10^{39}$ erg/s (at 4.8 kpc). Simultaneous
observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR three days after the burst provided a
source spectrum well fit by an absorbed blackbody ($N_{\rm H} = (1.13\pm0.03)

($\Gamma=0.0\pm1.3$) in the 1-20 keV band, with a luminosity of
$\sim$$8\times10^{34}$ erg/s, dominated by the blackbody emission. From our
timing analysis, we derive a dipolar magnetic field $B \sim 7\times10^{14}$ G,
spin-down luminosity $\dot{E}_{\rm rot} \sim 1.4\times10^{36}$ erg/s and
characteristic age of 240 yr, the shortest currently known. Archival
observations led to an upper limit on the quiescent luminosity
$<$$5.5\times10^{33}$ erg/s, lower than the value expected from magnetar
cooling models at the source characteristic age. A 1 hr radio observation with
the Sardinia Radio Telescope taken about 1 week after the X-ray burst detected
a number of strong and short radio pulses at 1.5 GHz, in addition to regular
pulsed emission; they were emitted at an average rate 0.9 min$^{-1}$ and
accounted for $\sim$50% of the total pulsed radio fluence. We conclude that
Swift ,J1818.0-1607 is a peculiar magnetar belonging to the small, diverse
group of young neutron stars with properties straddling those of rotationally

estimation of the age possible by measuring the spin-down rate in quiescence.

interest in condensed matter physics. It has been verified that the gapless

In this paper, we study the fermionic quantum criticality with enlarged
Ising$\times$Ising fluctuations in honeycomb lattice materials. The
Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory for the multicriticality between the semimetallic
phase and two ordered phases that break Ising symmetry is investigated by
employing perturbative renormalization group approach. We first determine the
critical range in which the quantum fluctuations may render the phase

when the flavor numbers of four-component Dirac fermions $N_f\geq1/4$. Using
the $\epsilon$ expansion in four space-time dimensions, we then study the

However, the issue of BFL is that the mobile devices have energy and CPU
constraints that may reduce the system lifetime and training efficiency. The
other issue is that the training latency may increase due to the blockchain
mining process. To address these issues, the MLMO needs to (i) decide how much

the block generation rate to minimize the system latency, energy consumption,

to apparently become a unique object (a skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair or $SAP$).
After glued by sector $2$, the skyrmion and the antiskyrmion move together (as
a $SAP$) along the direction of the applied current. It is also shown that such
an engineered racetrack can support a sequence of several $SAP$ structures in
motion, forming a current.

the hydraulic properties of biomedical devices, wherein the large scale blood
circulation needs to be simulated by accounting for the mechanical response of
red blood cells (RBCs) at mesoscales. In many practical instances, biomedical
devices work on time-scales comparable to the intrinsic relaxation time of
RBCs: thus, a systematic understanding of the time-dependent response of
erythrocyte membranes is crucial for the effective design of such devices. So
far, this information has been deduced from experimental data, which do not
necessarily adapt to the the broad variety of the fluid dynamic conditions that
can be encountered in practice. This work explores the novel possibility of
studying the time-dependent response of an erythrocyte membrane to external
mechanical loads via ab-initio, mesoscale numerical simulations, with a primary
focus on the detailed characterisation of the RBC relaxation time $t_c$
following the arrest of the external mechanical load. The adopted mesoscale
model exploits a hybrid Immersed Boundary-Lattice Boltzmann Method (IB-LBM),
coupled with the Standard Linear Solid model (SLS) to account for the RBC
membrane viscosity. We underscore the key importance of the 2D membrane
viscosity $\mu_{m}$ to correctly reproduce the relaxation time of the RBC
membrane. A detailed assessment of the dependencies on the typology and
strength of the applied mechanical loads is also provided. Overall, our
findings open interesting future perspectives for the study of the non-linear
response of RBCs immersed in time-dependent strain fields.

convergence $u_m \to u$ in $L^2$, namely $m^{-\beta}$ for all $\beta < 1/2$.
Moreover, we consider the fluctuations. In the central limit scaling, we show
that these converge to a Gaussian field, locally in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$, with
an explicit covariance.
  Our analysis is based on explicit approximations for the solutions $u_m$ in

one major concern is the closed set nature of the classification decision on

interpretation of this classification is required to determine if the
classification result is trusted. Un-trusted classifications can occur when the
input data to the deep neural network changes over time. One type of change
that can occur is concept evolution, where a new class is introduced that the
deep neural network was not trained on. In the majority of deep neural network
architectures, the only option is to assign this instance to one of the classes

detect the arrival of a new class in the stream. Existing work on interpreting
deep neural networks often focuses on neuron activations to provide visual

uses streaming approaches for real-time concept evolution detection in deep

acetonitrile, both with and without supporting salts. All solutions tested show
Newtonian behavior over shear rates of up to 30,000 1/s, which is rationalized
by scaling arguments for the diffusion-based relaxation time of a single MEEPT
molecule without aggregation. Neat MEEPT is flowable but with a large viscosity
(412 mPa s) at room temperature), which is approximately 1,000 times larger
than acetonitrile. When dissolved in acetonitrile, MEEPT solutions have low
viscosities; at concentrations up to 0.5 M, the viscosity increases by less
than a factor of two. From concentration-dependent viscosity measurements,
molecular information is inferred from intrinsic viscosity (hydrodynamic
diameter) and the Huggins coefficient (interactions). Model fit credibility is
assessed using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). It is found that the
MEEPT and its charged cation are ""flowable"" and do not flocculate at
concentrations up to 0.5 M. MEEPT has a hydrodynamic diameter of around 0.85
nm, which is largely insensitive to supporting salt and state of charge. This
size is comparable to molecular dimensions of single molecules obtained from

linguistics rely on unary modalities to allow for the controlled application of
structural rules affecting word order and phrase structure. These controlled
structural operations give rise to derivational ambiguities that are missed by
the original Lambek Calculus or its pregroup simplification. Proposals for
compositional interpretation of extended Lambek Calculus in the compact closed
category of FVect and linear maps have been made, but in these proposals the
syntax-semantics mapping ignores the control modalities, effectively
restricting their role to the syntax. Our aim is to turn the modalities into
first-class citizens of the vectorial interpretation. Building on the
directional density matrix semantics, we extend the interpretation of the type
system with an extra spin density matrix space. The interpretation of proofs
then results in ambiguous derivations being tensored with orthogonal spin
states. Our method introduces a way of simultaneously representing co-existing
interpretations of ambiguous utterances, and provides a uniform framework for
the integration of lexical and derivational ambiguity.

$K$-theory arguments based on the work of Barge and Lannes and a second one
based on the Weil representations of symplectic groups arising in abelian
Chern-Simons theory. We can also retrieve this way Deligne's non-residual
finiteness of the universal central extension $\widetilde{Sp(2g,\mathbb Z)}$.
We prove then that the image of the second homology into finite quotients of
symplectic groups over a Dedekind domain of arithmetic type are torsion groups
of uniformly bounded size. In contrast, quantum representations produce for
every prime $p$, finite quotients of the mapping class group of genus $g\geq 3$
whose second homology image has $p$-torsion. We further derive that all central
extensions of the mapping class group are residually finite and deduce that
mapping class groups have Serre's property $A_2$ for trivial modules, contrary
to symplectic groups. Eventually we compute the module of coinvariants
$H_2(\mathfrak{sp}_{2g}(2))_{Sp(2g,\mathbb Z/2^k\mathbb Z)}=\mathbb Z/2\mathbb

degenerate light, a strange and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally
twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The lattice has a spatial
extent of 3~fm, lattice spacing of 0.093~fm, and reproduces a pion mass of
$260$ MeV. We use the quasi-distribution approach and employ three values of
the proton momentum boost, 0.83 GeV, 1.25 GeV, and 1.67 GeV. We use a
source-sink separation of 1.12~fm to suppress excited-states contamination. The
lattice data are renormalized non-perturbatively. We calculate the matching
equation within Large Momentum Effective Theory, which is applied to the
lattice data in order to obtain $g_T$. The final distribution is presented in
the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at a scale of 2 GeV. We also calculate the
helicity distribution $g_1$ to test the Wandzura-Wilczek approximation for

this bound is set at 20 microns. Thus, any subtle alterations to the material
at a \emph{smaller} scale should not in principle alter the dynamic fracture
response of the hydrogel. Here we test this directly by embedding
sub-micron-scale latex polystyrene microspheres within the brittle

comparing the crack tip opening displacement, fracture energy and the crack's

weighted graph where the weights denote the number of trains between the zones.
It may be pointed out that each zone is a complex network in itself and may
depict different characteristic features. The zonal network therefore can be
considered as a network of complex networks. In this paper, self links,
in-degree and out-degree of each zone have been computed which provides
information about the inter and intra zonal connectivity. Degree passenger
correlation which gives an idea about number of trains and passengers
originating from a particular zone which might play a role in policy making
decisions has also been studied. Some other complex network parameters like
betweenness, clustering coefficient and cliques have been obtained to get more
insight about the complex Indian zonal network.

inhibit surfactant adsorption; (b) solubilization prevents the formation of a
monolayer of surfactant molecules at the droplet interface. We use numerical

aspects. In the fault-tolerant regime, we optimize the $\rzgate$ and $\tgate$

optimize the two-qubit gate counts, assuming the use of the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) approach. Specific to the latter, we present a framework that
enables bootstrapping the VQE progression towards the convergence of the
ground-state energy of the fermionic system. This framework, based on
perturbation theory, is capable of improving the energy estimate at each cycle
of the VQE progression, by about a factor of three closer to the known
ground-state energy compared to the standard VQE approach in the test-bed,
classically-accessible system of the water molecule. The improved energy
estimate in turn results in a commensurate level of savings of quantum
resources, such as the number of qubits and quantum gates, required to be
within a pre-specified tolerance from the known ground-state energy. We also
explore a suite of generalized transformations of fermion to qubit operators

introduced in order to challenge the automatic sleep stage classification
conundrum. However, the difficulties can be posed in replacing the clinicians
with the automatic system due to the differences in many aspects found in
individual bio-signals, causing the inconsistency in the performance of the
model on every incoming individual. Thus, we aim to explore the feasibility of
using a novel approach, capable of assisting the clinicians and lessening the
workload. We propose the transfer learning framework, entitled
MetaSleepLearner, based on Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), in order to
transfer the acquired sleep staging knowledge from a large dataset to new
individual subjects. The framework was demonstrated to require the labelling of
only a few sleep epochs by the clinicians and allow the remainder to be handled
by the system. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was also applied to
understand the learning course of our approach. In all acquired datasets, in
comparison to the conventional approach, MetaSleepLearner achieved a range of
5.4\% to 17.7\% improvement with statistical difference in the mean of both
approaches. The illustration of the model interpretation after the adaptation
to each subject also confirmed that the performance was directed towards
reasonable learning. MetaSleepLearner outperformed the conventional approaches
as a result from the fine-tuning using the recordings of both healthy subjects
and patients. This is the first work that investigated a non-conventional
pre-training method, MAML, resulting in a possibility for human-machine
collaboration in sleep stage classification and easing the burden of the
clinicians in labelling the sleep stages through only several epochs rather
than an entire recording.

simulations of jets with different luminosities and inclinations. The
luminosity of the jet is self-regulated by the mass accretion rate and an
efficiency $\eta$. Depending on the value of $\eta$ the jet can break out of
the BHL bulge (""successful jet"") and aligns against the incoming wind, in turn,
it will realign in favour of the direction of the wind. The jet varies in size
and orientation and may present quiescent and active epochs. The inclination of
the jet and the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, only slightly affect the
global evolution. As the accretion is hypercritical, and the specific angular
momentum is above the critical value for the formation of a disk, we infer the
formation of a disk and launching of jets. The disks' mass and size would be
$\sim$10$^{-2}$~M$_\odot$ and $\gtrsim 10^{10}$ cm, and it may have rings with

notably: 1) biases introduced in the selection of the panel. 2) experts have to
read a very large number of proposals. Distributed Peer Review promises to
alleviate several of the described problems by distributing the task of
reviewing among the proposers. Each proposer is given a limited number of
proposals to review and rank. We present the result of an experiment running a

the distributed peer review is statistically the same as a `traditional' panel,
that our machine learning algorithm can predict expertise of reviewers with a

information to understand the physics of these energetic explosions. The blast
wave model has become the standard to describe the evolution of the afterglow
emission over time and frequency. Thanks to recent developments in the theory
of afterglows and numerical simulations of relativistic outflows, we are able
to model the afterglow emission with realistic dynamics and radiative
processes. Although the models agree with observations remarkably well, the
afterglow emission still contains additional physics, instrumental systematics,
and propagation effects which make the modelling of these events challenging.
In this work, we present a new approach to modelling GRB afterglows, using
Gaussian processes (GPs) to take into account systematics in the afterglow
data. We show that, using this new approach, it is possible to obtain more
reliable estimates of the explosion and microphysical parameters of GRBs. We
present fit results for 5 long GRBs and find a preliminary correlation between
the isotropic energetics and opening angles of GRBs, which confirms the idea of
a common energy reservoir for the kinetic energy of long GRBs.

also understood to be dual to higher-dimensional theories of gravity via the
anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. To reproduce
various features of AdS/CFT, a large number of discrete models based on tensor
networks have been proposed. Some recent models, most notably including toy
models of holographic quantum error correction, are constructed on regular
time-slice discretizations of AdS. In this work, we show that the symmetries of
these models are well suited for approximating CFT states, as their geometry
enforces a discrete subgroup of conformal symmetries. Based on these
symmetries, we introduce the notion of a quasiperiodic conformal field theory
(qCFT), a critical theory less restrictive than a full CFT and with
characteristic multi-scale quasiperiodicity. We discuss holographic code states
and their renormalization group flow as specific implementations of a qCFT with
fractional central charges and argue that their behavior generalizes to a large

electronic orbits: the ballistic transport through the bulk enabled by the

also be induced by axial fields whose sign depends on the chirality of the Weyl

described in terms of gauge fields only in the low-energy sectors around the

Therefore, the existence of non-local orbits driven exclusively by

detected in emission in both the QSO and SMG. The QSO is the most luminous HF
emitter yet found and has the same ratio of HF emission line to infrared
luminosity as a sample of local AGN and the Orion Bar. This consistency covers
about 10 orders-of-magnitude in infrared luminosity, L_IR. Based on the
conclusions of a study of HF emission in the Orion Bar and modeling, the HF
emission in the QSO is either excited by collisions with electrons and H2 in
molecular plasmas irradiated by the AGN and intense star formation or
predominately by collisions with H2, with a modest contribution from electrons,
in a relatively high temperature (~120 K), dense (~10^5 cm^-3) medium. Although
HF should be an excellent tracer of molecular outflows, we do not find strong
evidence for outflows in HF in either the QSO or the SMG. From a putative
absorption feature in HF in the SMG, we estimate an upper limit on the outflow
rate, dM/dt_outflow <~45 M_sun/yr. The ratio of the outflow rate to the star
formation rate is <5% for the SMG. The broadness of the H2O line in the SMG,
FWHM~1020 km/s, may suggest that either the gas on large scales (>4 kpc) is
significantly more disturbed and turbulent due either to interactions and mass
exchange with the other members of the group or to the dissipation of the
energy of the intense star formation or both. The lack of significant molecular
outflows in either source may imply that much of the energy from the intense
star formation and AGN activity in this pair is being dissipated in their ISM.

flares observed in the early X-ray afterglow of gamma-ray bursts, either in the
form of an active neutron star remnant or (fall-back) accretion onto a black
hole. However, these scenarios are not always plausible, in particular when
flares are delayed to very late times after the burst. Recently, a new scenario
was proposed that suggests X-ray flares can be the result of the passing of a
long-lived reverse shock through a stratified ejecta, with the advantage that
it does not require late-time engine activity. In this work, we numerically
demonstrate this scenario to be physically plausible, by performing
onedimensional simulations of ejecta dynamics and emission using our novel
moving-mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code. Improved efficiency and precision
over previous work enables the exploration of a broader range of setups. We can
introduce a more physically realistic description of the circumburst medium
mass density. We can also locally trace the cooling of electrons when computing
the broadband emission from these setups. We show that the synchrotron cooling
timescale can dominate the flare decay time if the stratification in the ejecta
is constrained to a localised angular region inside the jet, with size
corresponding to the relativistic causal connection angle, and that it
corresponds to values reported in observations. We demonstrate that this
scenario can produce a large range of observed flare times, suggesting a

3D objects. However, none of these is able to produce textured objects, which
renders them of limited use for practical tasks. In this work, we present the
first generative model of textured 3D meshes. Training such a model would
traditionally require a large dataset of textured meshes, but unfortunately,
existing datasets of meshes lack detailed textures. We instead propose a new
training methodology that allows learning from collections of 2D images without
any 3D information. To do so, we train our model to explain a distribution of
images by modelling each image as a 3D foreground object placed in front of a
2D background. Thus, it learns to generate meshes that when rendered, produce
images similar to those in its training set.
  A well-known problem when generating meshes with deep networks is the
emergence of self-intersections, which are problematic for many use-cases. As a
second contribution we therefore introduce a new generation process for 3D
meshes that guarantees no self-intersections arise, based on the physical
intuition that faces should push one another out of the way as they move.
  We conduct extensive experiments on our approach, reporting quantitative and
qualitative results on both synthetic data and natural images. These show our
method successfully learns to generate plausible and diverse textured 3D
samples for five challenging object classes.

toric code, whose ground state can be viewed as an equal-weight superposition
of two-dimensional (2D) membrane coverings. We then decorate those membranes
with 2D cluster states possessing symmetry-protected topological order under
line-like subsystem symmetries. This endows the decorated model with planar
subsystem symmetries under which the loop-like excitations of the toric code
fractionalize, resulting in an extensive degeneracy per unit length of the
excitation. We also show that the value of the topological entanglement entropy
is larger than that of the toric code for certain bipartitions due to the
subsystem symmetry enrichment. Our model can be obtained by gauging the global
symmetry of a short-range entangled model which has symmetry-protected
topological order coming from an interplay of global and subsystem symmetries.
We study the non-trivial action of the symmetries on boundary of this model,
uncovering a mixed boundary anomaly between global and subsystem symmetries. To
further study this interplay, we consider gauging several different subgroups
of the total symmetry. The resulting network of models, which includes models
with fracton topological order, showcases more of the possible types of
subsystem symmetry enrichment that can occur in 3D.

anoxic CO$_2$-N$_2$ atmospheres. Such worlds are representative of early Earth,
Mars and Venus, and analogous exoplanets. H$_2$O photodissociation controls the
atmospheric photochemistry of these worlds through production of reactive OH,
which dominates the removal of atmospheric trace gases. The near-UV (NUV;
$>200$ nm) absorption cross-sections of H$_2$O play an outsized role in OH
production; these cross-sections were heretofore unmeasured at habitable
temperatures ($<373$ K). We present the first measurements of NUV H$_2$O
absorption at $292$ K, and show it to absorb orders of magnitude more than
previously assumed. To explore the implications of these new cross-sections, we
employ a photochemical model; we first intercompare it with two others and
resolve past literature disagreement. The enhanced OH production due to these
higher cross-sections leads to efficient recombination of CO and O$_2$,
suppressing both by orders of magnitude relative to past predictions and
eliminating the low-outgassing ""false positive"" scenario for O$_2$ as a
biosignature around solar-type stars. Enhanced [OH] increases rainout of
reductants to the surface, relevant to prebiotic chemistry, and may also
suppress CH$_4$ and H$_2$; the latter depends on whether burial of reductants
is inhibited on the underlying planet, as is argued for abiotic worlds. While
we focus on CO$_2$-rich worlds, our results are relevant to anoxic planets in
general. Overall, our work advances the state-of-the-art of photochemical
models by providing crucial new H$_2$O cross-sections and resolving past
disagreement in the literature, and suggests that detection of spectrally
active trace gases like CO in rocky exoplanet atmospheres may be more
challenging than previously considered.

algorithms enable a user to continuously switch his privacy between ON and OFF.
An obvious example is the incognito mode in internet browsers. But beyond
internet browsing, ON-OFF privacy can be a desired feature in most online
applications. The challenge is that the statistical correlation over time of
user's online behavior can lead to leakage of information.
  We consider the setting in which a user is interested in retrieving the
latest message generated by one of N sources. The user's privacy status can
change between ON and OFF over time. When privacy is ON the user wants to hide
his request. Moreover, since the user's requests depend on personal attributes
such as age, gender, and political views, they are typically correlated over
time. As a consequence, the user cannot simply ignore privacy when privacy is
OFF. We model the correlation between user's requests by an N state Markov
chain. The goal is to design query schemes with optimal download rate, that
preserve privacy in an ON-OFF privacy setting. In this paper, we present inner
and outer bounds on the achievable download rate for N sources. We also devise
an efficient algorithm to construct an ON-OFF privacy scheme achieving the
inner bound and prove its optimality in the case N = 2 sources. For N > 2,
finding tighter outer bounds and efficient constructions of ON-OFF privacy
schemes that would achieve them remains an open question.

images of central-disk solar spicules, using data of Samanta et al. (2019). We
compare with coronal-jet chromospheric-component observations of Sterling et
al. (2010a). Morphologically, bursts of spicules, referred to as ""enhanced
spicular activities"" by Samanta et al. (2019), appear as scaled-down versions
of the jet's chromospheric component. Both the jet and the enhanced spicular
activities appear as chromospheric-material strands, undergoing twisting-type
motions of ~20---50 km/s in the jet and ~20---30 km/s in the enhanced spicular
activities. Presumably, the jet resulted from a minifilament-carrying magnetic
eruption. For two enhanced spicular activities that we examine in detail, we
find tentative candidates for corresponding erupting microfilaments, but not
expected corresponding base brightenings. Nonetheless, the
enhanced-spicular-activities' interacting mixed-polarity base fields,
frequent-apparent-twisting motions, and morphological similarities to the
coronal jet's chromospheric-temperature component, suggest that erupting
microfilaments might drive the enhanced spicular activities but be hard to
detect, perhaps due to H-alpha opacity. Degrading the BBSO/GST-image resolution
with a 1''.0-FWHM smoothing function yields enhanced spicular activities
resembling the ""classical spicules"" described by, e.g., Beckers (1968). Thus, a
microfilament eruption might be the fundamental driver of many spicules, just
as a minifilament eruption is the fundamental driver of many coronal jets.
Similarly, a 0"".5-FWHM smoothing renders some enhanced spicular activities to
resemble previously-reported ""twinned"" spicules, while the full-resolution
features might account for spicules sometimes appearing as 2D-sheet-like
structures.

determining a period (cyclic) planning for the collection and purchasing of oil

state-dependent modulations may occur early in the cortical hierarchy and may
be implemented via top-down projections from cortico-cortical or
neuromodulatory pathways. However, the computational mechanisms mediating the
effects of such projections are not known. Here, we introduce a theoretical
framework to classify the effects of cell-type specific top-down perturbations
on the information processing speed of cortical circuits. Our theory
demonstrates that perturbation effects on stimulus processing can be predicted
by intrinsic gain modulation, which controls the timescale of the circuit
dynamics. Our theory leads to counter-intuitive effects such as improved
performance with increased input variance. We tested the model predictions
using large-scale electrophysiological recordings from the visual hierarchy in
freely running mice, where we found that a decrease in single-cell intrinsic
gain during locomotion led to an acceleration of visual processing. Our results
establish a novel theory of cell-type specific perturbations, applicable to
top-down modulation as well as optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations.
Our theory links connectivity, dynamics, and information processing via gain
modulation.

significant compilation. Experimental scans of the QAOA energy landscape show
good agreement with theory across even the largest instances studied (23
qubits) and we are able to perform variational optimization successfully. For
problems defined on our hardware graph we obtain an approximation ratio that is
independent of problem size and observe, for the first time, that performance
increases with circuit depth. For problems requiring compilation, performance
decreases with problem size but still provides an advantage over random
guessing for circuits involving several thousand gates. This behavior
highlights the challenge of using near-term quantum computers to optimize
problems on graphs differing from hardware connectivity. As these graphs are
more representative of real world instances, our results advocate for more

  learning-to-mis-rank formulation to perturb the ranking of the system output",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The success of DNNs has driven the extensive applications of person
re-identification (ReID) into a new era. However, whether ReID inherits the
vulnerability of DNNs remains unexplored. To examine the robustness of ReID
systems is rather important because the insecurity of ReID systems may cause
severe losses, e.g., the criminals may use the adversarial perturbations to
cheat the CCTV systems. In this work, we examine the insecurity of current
best-performing ReID models by proposing a learning-to-mis-rank formulation to
perturb the ranking of the system output. As the cross-dataset transferability
is crucial in the ReID domain, we also perform a back-box attack by developing
a novel multi-stage network architecture that pyramids the features of
different levels to extract general and transferable features for the
adversarial perturbations. Our method can control the number of malicious
pixels by using differentiable multi-shot sampling. To guarantee the
inconspicuousness of the attack, we also propose a new perception loss to
achieve better visual quality. Extensive experiments on four of the largest
ReID benchmarks (i.e., Market1501 [45], CUHK03 [18], DukeMTMC [33], and MSMT17
[40]) not only show the effectiveness of our method, but also provides
directions of the future improvement in the robustness of ReID systems. For
example, the accuracy of one of the best-performing ReID systems drops sharply
from 91.8% to 1.4% after being attacked by our method. Some attack results are
shown in Fig. 1. The code is available at

repulsively interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can only access
a narrow range of soliton velocities. Because velocity affects the stability of
individual solitons and the properties of soliton-soliton interactions, this
technical limitation has hindered experimental progress. Here we create dark
solitons in highly anisotropic cigar-shaped BECs with arbitrary position and
velocity by simultaneously engineering the amplitude and phase of the
condensate wavefunction, improving upon previous techniques which only
explicitly manipulated the condensate phase. The single dark soliton solution
present in true 1D systems corresponds to the kink soliton in anisotropic 3D
systems and is joined by a host of additional dark solitons including vortex
ring and solitonic vortex solutions. We readily create dark solitons with
speeds from zero to half the sound speed. The observed soliton oscillation
frequency suggests that we imprinted solitonic vortices, which for our
cigar-shaped system are the only stable solitons expected for these velocities.
Our numerical simulations of 1D BECs show this technique to be equally
effective for creating kink solitons when they are stable. We demonstrate the
utility of this technique by deterministically colliding dark solitons with
domain walls in two-component spinor BECs.

crystal/$J_2$ plasticity that fundamentally accounts for polar/excess
dislocations at the mesoscale. It has the ability to compute the static and
dynamic finite deformation stress fields of arbitrary (evolving) dislocation
distributions in finite bodies of arbitrary shape and elastic anisotropy under
general boundary conditions. This capability is used to present a comparison of
the static stress fields, at finite and small deformations, for screw and edge
dislocations, revealing heretofore unexpected differences. The computational
framework is verified against the sharply contrasting predictions of
geometrically linear and nonlinear theories for the stress field of a spatially
homogeneous dislocation distribution in the body, as well as against other
exact results of the theory. Verification tests of the time-dependent numerics
are also presented. Size effects in crystal and isotropic versions of the
theory are shown to be a natural consequence of the model and are validated
against available experimental data. With inertial effects incorporated, the
development of an (asymmetric) propagating Mach cone is demonstrated in the
finite deformation theory when a dislocation moves at speeds greater than the
linear elastic shear wave speed of the material.

twice-punctured torus $F$ with boundary slope $\beta$ and admits a filling with
slope $\alpha$ producing a Seifert fibred space, then the distance between the
slopes $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is less than or equal to $5$ unless $M$ is the
exterior of the figure eight knot. The result is sharp; the bound of $5$ can be
realized on infinitely many hyperbolic knot manifolds. We also determine
distance bounds in the case that the fundamental group of the $\alpha$-filling
contains no non-abelian free group. The proofs are divided into the four cases
$F$ is a semi-fibre, $F$ is a fibre, $F$ is non-separating but not a fibre, and
$F$ is separating but not a semi-fibre, and we obtain refined bounds in each
case.

underwater robots (AUV), in the frame of the HARNESS project; by localization,
we mean the relative swarm configuration, i.e., the geometrical shape of the
group. The result is achieved by using the signals that the robots exchange.
The swarm is organized by rules and conceived to perform tasks, ranging from
environmental monitoring to terrorism-attack surveillance. Two methods of
determining the shape of the swarm, both based on trilateration calculation,
are proposed. The first method focuses on the robot's speed. In this case, we
use our knowledge of the speeds and distances between the machines, while the
second method considers only distances and the orientation angles of the
robots. Unlike a trilateration problem, we do not know the position of the
beacons and this renders the problem a difficult one. Moreover, we have very
few data. More than one step of motion is needed to resolve the multiple
solutions found, owing to the symmetries of the system and optimization process
of one or more objective functions leading to the final configuration. We
subsequently checked our algorithm using a simulator taking into account random
errors affecting the measurements

various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2
causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social
distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this
end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized
(C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and
analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous
complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is
necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is
insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with
the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy
at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees
to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that
stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the
outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for
the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus
reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find
that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the
adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a
region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an
understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our
investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into
understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak
infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to
understand and control over an extended period of time.

judgments of factual consistency on model-generated summaries for the
CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) and XSUM (Narayan et al., 2018)

judgments than other automatic evaluation metrics. Also, QAGS offers a natural

QAGS indicate which tokens of a summary are inconsistent and why. We believe
QAGS is a promising tool in automatically generating usable and factually

Therefore, we apply neutron spin echo, X-ray scattering, fluorescence, and EPR

host planet. Unfortunately, so are many other astrophysical phenomena - most
notably other planets in the system. In this work, an argument of reductio ad
absurdum is invoked, by deriving the transit timing effects that are impossible
for a single exomoon to produce. Our work derives three key analytic tests.
First, one may exploit the fact that a TTV signal from an exomoon should be
accompanied by transit duration variations (TDVs), and that one can derive a
TDV floor as a minimum expected level of variability. Cases for which the TDV
upper limit is below this floor can thus be killed as exomoon candidates.
Second, formulae are provided for estimating whether moons are expected to be
'killable' when no TDVs presently exist, thus enabling the community to
estimate whether it's even worth deriving TDVs in the first place. Third, a TTV
ceiling is derived, above which exomoons should never be able to produce TTV
amplitudes. These tools are applied to a catalog of TTVs and TDVs for two and
half thousand Kepler Objects Interest, revealing over two hundred cases that
cannot be due to a moon. These tests are also applied to the exomoon candidate
Kepler-1625b i, which comfortably passes the criteria. These simple analytic
results should provide a means of rapidly rejecting putative exomoons and
streamlining the search for satellites.

of rotation rates as a function of color (a proxy for mass) is similar to that
found in other clusters: the slowest rotators are among the early M spectral
types, with faster rotation towards both earlier FGK and later M types. The
relationship between period and color/mass exhibited by older clusters such as
the Pleiades is already in place by Taurus age. The foreground population has
very few stars, but is consistent with the USco and Pleiades period
distributions. As found in other young clusters, stars with disks rotate on
average slower, and few with disks are found rotating faster than $\sim$2 d.

stars have generally lower amplitudes than lower mass stars. Stars with disks
have on average larger amplitudes than stars without disks, though the physical

errors. Moreover, UAVs have to minimize external contact forces in order to
maintain stability. Biological systems, on the other hand, exploit softness to
overcome similar limitations, and leverage compliance to enable aggressive
grasping. This paper investigates control and trajectory optimization for a
soft aerial manipulator, consisting of a quadrotor and a tendon-actuated soft
gripper, in which the advantages of softness can be fully exploited. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work at the intersection between soft
manipulation and UAV control. We present a decoupled approach for the quadrotor
and the soft gripper, combining (i) a geometric controller and a minimum-snap
trajectory optimization for the quadrotor (rigid) base, with (ii) a
quasi-static finite element model and control-space interpolation for the soft
gripper. We prove that the geometric controller asymptotically stabilizes the
quadrotor velocity and attitude despite the addition of the soft load. Finally,
we evaluate the proposed system in a realistic soft dynamics simulator, and
show that: (i) the geometric controller is fairly insensitive to the soft
payload, (ii) the platform can reliably grasp unknown objects despite
inaccurate positioning and initial conditions, and (iii) the decoupled
controller is amenable for real-time execution.

definition of the PDFs for initial hadrons was formulated while developing
KrkNLO scheme of matching QCD NLO corrections for the hard process with the
parton shower heavy boson production in hadron-hadron collision and for deep
inelastic lepton-hadron scattering. KRK FS (originally called Monte Carlo FS)
can be regarded as a variant of the $\overline{MS}$ system. It is therefore
trivially universal, that is process independent. The question of its
universality is formulated differently: As the basic role of KRK FS is to
simplify drastically NLO corrections, the question is now whether the same {\em
single} variant of PDFs in the KRK FS is able to achieve the same maximal
simplification of the NLO corrections for {\em all processes} with one or two
initial hadrons and any number of the final hadrons? Our answer is positive and
the proof is elaborated in the present note within the Catani-Seymour
subtraction methodology. KRK FS is mandatory in the KrkNLO method of matching
NLO calculation and parton shower -- a much simpler alternative of POWHEG
and/or MC\@ NLO. However, the use of KRK FS and the corresponding PDFs
simplifies NLO calculations for any other method of calculating NLO corrections

dominated by strong forbidden nebular emission lines of FeII and FeIII. Later
observations (at about 2 years) of the nearby SN 2011fe showed an unexpected
shift of ionization to FeI and FeII. Spectra of the very nearby SN Ia 2014J at
an intermediate phase (1 - 1.5 years) that are presented here show a
progressive decline of FeIII emission, while FeI is not yet strong. The
decrease in ionization can be explained if the degree of clumping in the ejecta
increases significantly at ~1.5 years, at least in the Fe-dominated zone.
Models suggest that clumps remain coherent after about one year, behaving like
shrapnel. The high density in the clumps, combined with the decreasing heating
rate, would then cause recombination. These data may witness the phase of
transition from relatively smooth ejecta to the very clumpy morphology that is
typical of SN remnants. The origin of the increased clumping may be the
development of local magnetic fields.

dMRI signal at any voxel as a convolved and noisy version of the underlying
FOD, and utilizes the spherical harmonics basis for representing the FOD, where
the spherical harmonic coefficients are adaptively and nonlinearly shrunk by
using a James-Stein type estimator. To further improve the estimation accuracy
by enhancing the localized peaks of the FOD, as a second step a
super-resolution sharpening process is then applied. The resulting estimated
FODs can be fed to a fiber tracking algorithm to reconstruct the white matter
fiber tracts. We illustrate the overall methodology using both synthetic data

[Si/Fe], [K/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Fe/H], and [Ni/Fe], abundances ratios which
together span multiple nucleosynthetic channels. In a high quality sample of

fifteen members. Our candidate clusters are more chemically homogeneous than a
population of non-member stars with similar [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H], even in
abundances not used for tagging. Group members are consistent with having the
same age and fall along a single stellar-population track in logg vs. Teff
space. Each group's members are distributed over multiple kpc, and the spread
in their radial and azimuthal actions increases with age. We qualitatively
reproduce this increase using N-body simulations of cluster dissolution in
Galactic potentials that include transient winding spiral arms. Observing our

approach, we investigate the qualitative differences in the wave and
particle-based phonon transport at the vicinity of nanoscale features. For the
simple example of a nanoporous geometry, we show that phonon transmission
agrees very well for both methods with an error margin of approximately 15%,
across phonon wavelengths even for features with sizes down to 3-4 nm. For
cases where phonons need to squeeze in smaller regions to propagate, we find
that MC underestimates the transmission of long wavelength phonons whereas wave
treatment within NEGF indicates that those long wavelength phonons can
propagate more easily. We also find that particle-based simulation methods are
somewhat more sensitive to structural variations compared to the wave-based
NEGF method. The insight extracted from comparing wave and particle methods can
be used to provide a better and more complete understanding of phonon transport

fields. It is of practical use to deal with a large amount of information in
the complex system that is hard to estimate. Weather forecasting is one of the
applications, where the prediction of meteorological data are corrected given
the observations. Numerous approaches are contained in data assimilation. One
specific sequential method is the Kalman Filter. The core is to estimate
unknown information with the new data that is measured and the prior data that
is predicted. As a matter of fact, there are different improved methods in the
Kalman Filter. In this project, the Ensemble Kalman Filter with perturbed
observations is considered. It is achieved by Monte Carlo simulation. In this
method, the ensemble is involved in the calculation instead of the state
vectors. In addition, the measurement with perturbation is viewed as the
suitable observation. These changes compared with the Linear Kalman Filter make
it more advantageous in that applications are not restricted in linear systems
any more and less time is taken when the data are calculated by computers. The
thesis seeks to develop the Ensemble Kalman Filter with perturbed observation
gradually. With the Mathematical preliminaries including the introduction of
dynamical systems, the Linear Kalman Filter is built. Meanwhile, the prediction
and analysis processes are derived. After that, we use the analogy thoughts to
lead in the non-linear Ensemble Kalman Filter with perturbed observations.
Lastly, a classic Lorenz 63 model is illustrated by MATLAB. In the example, we
experiment on the number of ensemble members and seek to investigate the
relationships between the error of variance and the number of ensemble members.
We reach the conclusion that on a limited scale the larger number of ensemble
members indicates the smaller error of prediction.

problems based on differential and integral equations with sparse, noisy,
unstructured, and multi-fidelity data. PINNs incorporate all available
information into a loss function, thus recasting the original problem into an
optimization problem. In this paper, we extend PINNs to parameter and function
inference for integral equations such as nonlocal Poisson and nonlocal
turbulence models, and we refer to them as nonlocal PINNs (nPINNs). The
contribution of the paper is three-fold. First, we propose a unified nonlocal
operator, which converges to the classical Laplacian as one of the operator
parameters, the nonlocal interaction radius $\delta$ goes to zero, and to the
fractional Laplacian as $\delta$ goes to infinity. This universal operator
forms a super-set of classical Laplacian and fractional Laplacian operators
and, thus, has the potential to fit a broad spectrum of data sets. We provide
theoretical convergence rates with respect to $\delta$ and verify them via
numerical experiments. Second, we use nPINNs to estimate the two parameters,
$\delta$ and $\alpha$. The strong non-convexity of the loss function yielding
multiple (good) local minima reveals the occurrence of the operator mimicking
phenomenon: different pairs of estimated parameters could produce multiple
solutions of comparable accuracy. Third, we propose another nonlocal operator
with spatially variable order $\alpha(y)$, which is more suitable for modeling
turbulent Couette flow. Our results show that nPINNs can jointly infer this
function as well as $\delta$. Also, these parameters exhibit a universal
behavior with respect to the Reynolds number, a finding that contributes to our
understanding of nonlocal interactions in wall-bounded turbulence.

a complex projective structure on a Riemann surface, which was introduced by Y.
Hoshi. Such an additional structure has some equivalent objects, e.g., a
dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2$-oper and a projective connection having a full set of
solutions. The main result of the present paper provides a canonical
construction of a Frobenius-constant quantization on the cotangent space minus
the zero section on an algebraic curve by means of a Frobenius-projective
structure. It may be thought of as a positive characteristic analogue of a
result by D. Ben-Zvi and I. Biswas. Finally, we give a higher-dimensional
variant of this result, as proved by I. Biswas in the complex case.

developed three informationally equivalent JSON-based representations for KGs,

and Chain-based Name/Value (JSON-CNV). We analyzed the effects of these
representations on query performance by storing them on two prominent
document-based Data Management Systems (DMSs), namely, MongoDB and Couchbase
and executing a set of benchmark queries over them. We also compared the
execution times with row-store Virtuoso, column-store Virtuoso, and
\mbox{Blazegraph} as three major DMSs with different architectures (aka,
RDF-stores). Our results indicate that the representation type has a
significant performance impact on query execution. For instance, the JSON-SNV
outperforms others by nearly one order of magnitude to execute subject-subject
join queries. This and the other results presented in this paper can assist in
more accurate benchmarking of the emerging DMSs.

the calculation of one more two--loop massive operator matrix element in QED.

for $\delta M_Z$ and $\delta \Gamma_Z$ which is estimated to be of O(30 keV) at

failures in autonomous systems. During execution, the RL agents often rely on
some domain-specific heuristic reward to guide them towards finding failures,
but constructing such a heuristic may be difficult or infeasible. Without a
heuristic, the agent may only receive rewards at the time of failure, or even
rewards that guide it away from failures. For example, some approaches give
rewards for taking more-likely actions, because we want to find more-likely
failures. However, the agent may then learn to only take likely actions, and
may not be able to find a failure at all. Consequently, the problem becomes a
hard-exploration problem, where rewards do not aid exploration. A new
algorithm, go-explore (GE), has recently set new records on benchmarks from the
hard-exploration field. We apply GE to adaptive stress testing (AST), one
example of an RL-based falsification approach that provides a way to search for
the most-likely failure scenario. We simulate a scenario where an autonomous
vehicle drives while a pedestrian is crossing the road. We demonstrate that GE
is able to find failures without domain-specific heuristics, such as the
distance between the car and the pedestrian, on scenarios that other RL
techniques are unable to solve. Furthermore, inspired by the robustification
phase of GE, we demonstrate that the backwards algorithm (BA) improves the
failures found by other RL techniques.

Large cloud customers often find it challenging to choose the right mix of

to adjust capacity up and down in response to workload variations.
  To address the problem, we design policies to optimize long-term cloud costs

gauge symmetry related to the first and second family of the lepton sector,
which features a two-loop induced neutrino mass model. The two families are
favored by minimally reproducing the current neutrino oscillation data and two
mass difference squares and canceling the gauge anomalies at the same time. As
a result, we have a prediction for neutrino masses. The lightest Dirac neutral
fermion is a dark matter candidate with tree-level interaction restricted to
electron, muon and neutrinos, which makes it difficult to detect in direct dark
matter search as well as indirect search focusing on the ${\tau}$-channel, such
as through ${\gamma}$-rays. It may however be probed by search for dark matter
signatures in electron and positron cosmic rays, and allows interpretation of a
structure appearing in the CALET electron+positron spectrum around 350-400 GeV
as its signature, with a boost factor $\approx$40 Breit-Wigner enhancement of
the annihilation cross section.

machine-learned models can handle complex dialogs, but they are considered to
be black boxes and require large amounts of training data. In this
demonstration, we showcase Conversation Learner, a machine teaching tool for

dialog authors to create a dialog flow using familiar tools, converting the
dialog flow into a parametric model (e.g., neural networks), and allowing
dialog authors to improve the dialog manager (i.e., the parametric model) over
time by leveraging user-system dialog logs as training data through a machine

where learning clients share a common wireless link to a coordinating server to
perform federated model training using their local data. In such wireless
federated learning networks (WFLNs), optimizing the learning performance
depends crucially on how clients are selected and how bandwidth is allocated
among the selected clients in every learning round, as both radio and client
energy resources are limited. While existing works have made some attempts to
allocate the limited wireless resources to optimize FL, they focus on the
problem in individual learning rounds, overlooking an inherent yet critical
feature of federated learning. This paper brings a new long-term perspective to
resource allocation in WFLNs, realizing that learning rounds are not only
temporally interdependent but also have varying significance towards the final
learning outcome. To this end, we first design data-driven experiments to show
that different temporal client selection patterns lead to considerably
different learning performance. With the obtained insights, we formulate a
stochastic optimization problem for joint client selection and bandwidth
allocation under long-term client energy constraints, and develop a new
algorithm that utilizes only currently available wireless channel information
but can achieve long-term performance guarantee. Further experiments show that
our algorithm results in the desired temporal client selection pattern, is
adaptive to changing network environments and far outperforms benchmarks that
ignore the long-term effect of FL.

robust strategies with an adjustable level of conservativeness. In particular,
the proposed robust dispatch method obtains operational strategies by solving a
nominal uncertainty-free dispatch problem, whose complexity is identical to a
deterministic problem. The robustness against uncertainties is enhanced by
endowing the nominal dispatch model with properly tightened constraints
considering time-variant uncertainty sets. Towards this end, a novel direct
constraint tightening algorithm is developed based on the dual norm to
calculate multi-period tightened constraints efficiently without linear
programming iterations. Furthermore, the budget uncertainty set is newly
combined with constraint tightening to flexibly adjust the conservativeness

assumed to share the same spectrum and vehicles broadcast their safety messages
to neighboring users. We model the locations of vehicles as a Poisson line Cox
point process and the locations of users as a planar Poisson point process. We
assume that users are associated with their closest base stations when there is
no vehicle within a certain distance $ \rho $. On the other hand, users located
within a distance $ \rho $ from vehicles are associated with the vehicles to
receive their safety messages. We quantify the properties of this
vehicle-prioritized association using the stochastic geometry framework. We
derive the fractions of users that receive safety messages from vehicles. Then,
we obtain the expression for the signal-to-interference ratio of the typical
user evaluated on each association type. To address the impact of vehicular
broadcast on the cellular network, the paper also derives the effective rate
offered to the typical user in this setting.

has attracted much attention due to its advantages of low cost, low power
consumption, and privacy protection. However, most existing PIR-based DFL
methods require high deployment density to achieve high localization accuracy.
Recently, a few works proposed that the deployment density can be reduced by
deeply analyzing the analog output of PIR sensors. However, these methods can
not well handle the localization task in multi-person scenarios yet. In this
paper, we propose a novel neural network for PIR-based multi-person
localization, which appropriately leverages a series of domain knowledge.
Specifically, the proposed network consists of two modules: one is for
determining the number of persons and another is for determining their
locations. Meanwhile, the module of person counting is further designed as a
two-stage network: one stage is for signal separation and another is for
single-person detection. The module for localization is also designed as a
two-stage network: one stage is for signal extraction and another is for
single-person localization. Through the above methods, we succeed to remarkably
reduce the deployment density of the traditional PIR-based method by about
76\%, while maintaining the localization accuracy.

dimensional (3D) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) downlink with uniform
planar array (UPA) and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In practical
massive MIMO with UPAs, the number of antennas in each column or row is usually
limited. The straightforward extension of the conventional DFT based beam
domain channel model widely used in massive MIMO with uniform linear arrays
(ULAs) can not apply. To overcome this issue, we establish a new beam domain
channel model by using sampled steering vectors. Then, a novel method to obtain
the beam domain channel power matrices and the instantaneous beam domain
channel coefficients is proposed, and an a posteriori beam domain channel model
which includes the channel aging and the spatial correlation is established. On
the basis of the a posteriori channel model, we consider the robust precoder
design with the expected weighted sum-rate maximization under a total power
constraint. By viewing the power constraint as a Riemannian manifold, we
transform the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained
optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold. Then, we derive an iterative
algorithm to obtain the optimal precoders by setting the Riemannian gradient of
the objective function to zero. Furthermore, we propose a low complexity robust
precoder design by replacing the expected rates in the objective function with
their upper bounds. Simulation results show that the proposed precoders can
achieve significant performance gain than the widely used regularized zero

in the viscous velocity of the accretion disc in the so-call disc-dominate
case. Recent hydrodynamic simulations, however, showed that planets migrate
with velocities much faster than the viscous one in massive discs. Such fast
migration cannot be explained by the conventional picture. Scardoni et al.
(2020) has recently argued this new picture. By carrying out similar
hydrodynamic simulations, they found that the migration velocity slows down
with time and eventually reaches the prediction by the conventional theory.
They interpreted the fast migration as an initial transient one and concluded
that the conventional type II migration is realised after the transient phase.
We show that the migration velocities obtained by Scardoni et al. (2020) are
consistent with the previous simulations even in the transient phase that they
proposed. We also find that the transient fast migration proposed by Scardoni
et al. (2020) is well described by a new model of Kanagawa et al. (2018). The
new model can appropriately describe significant inward migration during the
initial transient phase that Scardoni et al. (2020) termed. Hence, we conclude
that the time-variation of the transient migration velocity is due to the
changes of the orbital radius of the planet and its background surface density
during the migration.

pioneering work of Guibas & Sedgewick (1978), both 2-3 and 2-3-4 variants of RB
trees had been considered, but further study of the former had been abandoned
due to the higher number of rotations in the insert algorithm. Sedgewick (2008)
proposed a variant of 2-3 RB trees, viz. left-leaning red-black (LLRB) trees,
in which red links are restricted to left children and proposed concise
recursive insert and delete algorithms. However, the top-down deletion
algorithm of LLRB is still very complicated and highly inefficient. In this
paper, we reconsider 2-3 red-black trees in which both children of a node
cannot be red. We propose a parity-seeking delete algorithm with the basic idea
of making the deficient subtree on a par with its sibling: either by fixing the
deficient subtree or by turning the sibling deficient as well, ascending
deficiency to the parent node. Interestingly, the proposed parity-seeking
delete algorithm works for 2-3-4 RB trees as well. Our experiments show that
2-3 RB trees are almost as efficient as RB trees and twice faster than LLRB
trees. Besides, RB trees with the proposed parity-seeking delete algorithm have
the same number of rotations and almost identical running time as the classical
delete algorithm. While being extremely efficient, the proposed parity-seeking
delete algorithm is easily understandable and suitable for pedagogical
purposes.

correlation on inter-user channel correlation via a combination of measurement
and analysis. We show three key results. First, we collect a massive MIMO
channel dataset for examining the inter-user channel correlation in a
real-world propagation environment; the dataset is now open-access. We observed
channel correlation higher than $0.48$ for all close-by users. Additionally,
over $30$ % of far-away users, even when they are tens of wavelengths apart,
have inter-user channel correlation that is at least twice higher than the
correlation in the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel. Second, we compute the
inter-user channel correlation in closed-form as a function of inter-user angle
correlation, the number of base-station antennas, and base-station
inter-antenna spacing. Our analysis shows that inter-user angle correlation
increases the inter-user channel correlation. Inter-user channel correlation
reduces with a larger base-station array aperture, i.e., more antennas and
larger inter-antenna spacing. Third, we explain the measurements with numerical
experiments to show that inter-user angle correlation can result in significant
inter-user channel correlation in practical massive MIMO channels.

difficulties in tuning mechanical parameters to get desired wrinkling

synthesizes cloth animation at a much lower computational cost, and also
creates wrinkling effects that highly resemble the much controllable training
data. In this paper we propose a deep learning based method for synthesizing
cloth animation with high resolution meshes. To do this we first create a
dataset for training: a pair of low and high resolution meshes are simulated
and their motions are synchronized. As a result the two meshes exhibit similar
large-scale deformation but different small wrinkles. Each simulated mesh pair
are then converted into a pair of low and high resolution ""images"" (a 2D array

displacement, the normal and the velocity. With these image pairs, we design a
multi-feature super-resolution (MFSR) network that jointly train an upsampling
synthesizer for the three features. The MFSR architecture consists of two key
components: a sharing module that takes multiple features as input to learn
low-level representations from corresponding super-resolution tasks
simultaneously; and task-specific modules focusing on various high-level
semantics. Frame-to-frame consistency is well maintained thanks to the proposed
kinematics-based loss function. Our method achieves realistic results at high

demonstrate the performance of our method with various experimental scenes,

entanglement, quantum steering, and Bell nonlocality. Although Bell nonlocality
is more often used to show the ""quantum nonlocality"", the original EPR paradox
is essentially a steering paradox. In this work, we formulate the original EPR
steering paradox into a contradiction equality,thus making it amenable to an
experimental verification. We perform an experimental test of the steering
paradox in a two-qubit scenario. Furthermore, by starting from the steering
paradox, we generate a generalized linear steering inequality and transform
this inequality into a mathematically equivalent form, which is more friendly
for experimental implementation, i.e., one may only measure the observables in
$x$-, $y$-, or $z$-axis of the Bloch sphere, rather than other arbitrary

experimental errors, the experimental results coincide with the theoretical
predictions. Our results deepen the understanding of quantum foundations and
provide an efficient way to detect the steerability of quantum states.

microdischarge process of the carbon fibre microelectrode and the good
discharge effect of the helical electrode to provide plenty of initial
electrons for the discharge space. Besides, the non-uniform electric field
distribution with gradual change is conducive to the slow growth of electron
avalanches in this structure. Thus, the initial discharge voltage can be
reduced and the formation of filamentary discharge channels can be inhibited,
which provides theoretical possibilities for the homogeneous discharge in

structure of brain functional networks that captures variation across
individuals and evolution over time. Existing methods for community detection
focus only on single-subject analysis of dynamic networks; while recent
extensions to multiple-subjects analysis are limited to static networks. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-subject, Markov-switching
stochastic block model (MSS-SBM) to identify state-related changes in brain
community organization over a group of individuals. We first formulate a
multilayer extension of SBM to describe the time-dependent, multi-subject brain
networks. We develop a novel procedure for fitting the multilayer SBM that
builds on multislice modularity maximization which can uncover a common
community partition of all layers (subjects) simultaneously. By augmenting with
a dynamic Markov switching process, our proposed method is able to capture a
set of distinct, recurring temporal states with respect to inter-community
interactions over subjects and the change points between them. Simulation shows
accurate community recovery and tracking of dynamic community regimes over
multilayer networks by the MSS-SBM. Application to task fMRI reveals meaningful
non-assortative brain community motifs, e.g., core-periphery structure at the
group level, that are associated with language comprehension and motor
functions suggesting their putative role in complex information integration.
Our approach detected dynamic reconfiguration of modular connectivity elicited
by varying task demands and identified unique profiles of intra and
inter-community connectivity across different task conditions. The proposed

than the surface density, we investigate the existence of a volumetric star
formation law (SFL), how the volumetric SFL is different from the
surface-density SFL, and how the gas pressure regulates the SFR based on our
galaxy sample. We find that the volumetric and surface SFLs in terms of the
total gas have significantly different slopes, while the volumetric and surface
SFLs in terms of the molecular gas do not show any noticeable difference. The
volumetric SFL for the total gas has a flatter power-law slope of 1.26 with a
smaller scatter of 0.19 dex compared to the slope (2.05) and the scatter (0.25
dex) of the surface SFL. The molecular gas SFLs have similar slopes of 0.78

that the interstellar gas pressure is strongly correlated with the SFR but find
no significant difference between the correlations based on the volume and

Southeast Asia as a signed and weighted bipartite network of countries and
evaluative reactions to a variety of political issues, or determinants. This
network is then projected into two one-mode networks, one of countries and one
of determinants, and community detection methods are applied. The paper aims to
fill two deficiencies in the current research on attitudes towards immigrants:
1) the lack of cross-national studies in Asia, a region where migration is
growing, and 2) the tendency of researchers to treat determinants as
uncorrelated, despite the interdependent nature of evaluative reactions. The
results show that the nine countries in the sample are a cohesive clique,
showing greater similarities than differences in the determinants of their
attitudes. A blockmodeling approach was employed to identify eight determinants
in attitudes towards immigrants, namely views on independence and social
dependencies, group identities, absolute or relative moral orientation,
attitudes towards democracy, science and technology, prejudice and stigma, and
two determinants related to religion. However, the findings of this survey
yielded some surprising results when compared with the literature review.
First, education was not found to be a significant determinants of attitudes
towards immigrants, despite its strong and consistent predictive power in
European models. Second, prejudice appears to be mediated in part by religion,
especially in religious identification and belief in God. Group identity and
prejudice also appear to be related, though only weakly. Finally, anxiety
appears in clusters related to social norms, suggesting that fears regarding
immigrants relates closely to expectations of others' behavior.

Notably, we find higher repetition rates are not required for gates in longer

When pulse imperfections are considered in our calculations, we find that
achievable gate fidelity is independent of the number of ions in the chain. We
also show that pulse control requirements do not scale up with the number of

approaches have been developed to provide practical means for early warning

put into vibration-based methods, which utilize the vibration response of the

Meanwhile, with emerging computing power and sensing technology in the last

characterized as a function of phase, wavelength, a color parameter and a

sequence could give both the spectrum with wavelength range from 3000\AA~to
8000\AA~ and the light curve with phase from 20 days before to 50 days after
the maximum luminosity for the supernovae with different colors and decline

supernova sample by using the ANNSLCT model and obtain the parameters for each
supernova to make a constraint on the cosmological $\Lambda$CDM model. We find
that the best fitting values of these parameters are almost the same as those
from the JLA sample trained with the Spectral Adaptive Lightcurve Template 2

high-performance QKD demonstrations. The corresponding security proofs usually
assume that all physical detectors have the same detection efficiency. However,
the efficiencies of the detectors used in practice might show a mismatch
depending on the manufacturing and setup of these detectors. A mismatch can
also be induced as the different spatial-temporal modes of an incoming signal
might couple differently to a detector. Here we develop a method that allows to
provide security proofs without the usual assumption. Our method can take the
detection-efficiency mismatch into account without having to restrict the
attack strategy of the adversary. Especially, we do not rely on any
photon-number cut-off of incoming signals such that our security proof is
directly applicable to practical situations. We illustrate our method for a
receiver that is designed for polarization encoding and is sensitive to a
number of spatial-temporal modes. In our detector model, the absence of quantum
interference between any pair of spatial-temporal modes is assumed. For a QKD
protocol with this detector model, we can perform a security proof with
characterized efficiency mismatch and without photon-number cut-off assumption.
Our method also shows that in the absence of efficiency mismatch in our
detector model, the key rate increases if the loss due to detection
inefficiency is assumed to be outside of the adversary's control, as compared
to the view where for a security proof this loss is attributed to the action of
the adversary.

adaptation (DA) approaches are not equipped for practical DA scenarios as a
result of their reliance on the knowledge of source-target label-set

prior unsupervised DA works require coexistence of source and target samples
even during deployment, making them unsuitable for real-time adaptation. Devoid
of such impractical assumptions, we propose a novel two-stage learning process.
1) In the Procurement stage, we aim to equip the model for future source-free
deployment, assuming no prior knowledge of the upcoming category-gap and
domain-shift. To achieve this, we enhance the model's ability to reject
out-of-source distribution samples by leveraging the available source data, in
a novel generative classifier framework. 2) In the Deployment stage, the goal
is to design a unified adaptation algorithm capable of operating across a wide
range of category-gaps, with no access to the previously seen source samples.
To this end, in contrast to the usage of complex adversarial training regimes,
we define a simple yet effective source-free adaptation objective by utilizing
a novel instance-level weighting mechanism, named as Source Similarity Metric
(SSM). A thorough evaluation shows the practical usability of the proposed
learning framework with superior DA performance even over state-of-the-art

without decreasing performance. Many sparse regularization criteria have been
proposed to solve this problem. In a convolutional neural network (CNN), group
sparse regularizations are often used to remove unnecessary subsets of the
weights, such as filters or channels. When we apply a group sparse
regularization for the weights connected to a neuron as a group, each
convolution filter is not treated as a target group in the regularization. In
this paper, we introduce the concept of hierarchical grouping to solve this

criteria for CNNs. Our proposed the hierarchical group sparse regularization
can treat the weight for the input-neuron or the output-neuron as a group and
convolutional filter as a group in the same group to prune the unnecessary

cylindrical geometry) owing to the centripetal force, which increases the
transverse displacement of the jet. When the jet moves along a magnetic field,
then the Lorentz force tries to decrease the displacement and stabilises the
instability of sub-Alfvenic flows. The threshold of the instability depends on
the Alfven Mach number (the ratio of Alfven and jet speeds). We suggest that
the dynamic kink instability may be of importance to explain observed
transverse motions of type II spicules in the solar atmosphere. We show that
the instability may start for spicules which rise up at the peripheries of
vertically expanding magnetic flux tubes owing to the decrease of the Alfven
speed in both, the vertical and the radial directions. Therefore, inclined
spicules may be more unstable and have more higher transverse speeds. Periods
and growth times of unstable modes in the conditions of type II spicules have
the values of 30 s and 25-100 s, respectively, which are comparable to the life
time of the structures. This may indicate to the interconnection between high

exponentially fast with respect to this SNR.

economic games involving prosociality, suggesting that people hold moral
preferences for doing the ""right thing"". What gives rise to these preferences?
Here, we evaluate the explanatory power of a reputation-based account, which
proposes that people respond to moral frames because they are motivated to look
good in the eyes of others. Across two pre-registered experiments (total N =
3,610), we investigated whether reputational incentives amplify sensitivity to
framing effects. Both experiments manipulated (i) whether moral or neutral
framing was used to describe a Trade-Off Game (in which participants chose
between prioritizing equality or efficiency) and (ii) whether Trade-Off Game
choices were observable to a social partner in a subsequent Trust Game. We find
that framing effects are relatively insensitive to reputational incentives:
observability did not significantly amplify sensitivity to moral framing.
However, our results are not inconsistent with the possibility that
observability has some amplification effect; quantitatively, the observed
framing effect was 74% as large when decisions were private as when they were
observable. These results suggest that moral frames may tap into moral
preferences that are relatively deeply internalized, and that power of moral
frames to promote prosociality may not be strongly enhanced by making the
morally-framed behavior observable to others.

we introduce reinforcement learning to better guide the sampling process. We

Translation (NMT) for low-resource languages. However, at the same time,
transformer models remain difficult to optimize and require careful tuning of
hyper-parameters to be useful in this setting. Many NMT toolkits come with a
set of default hyper-parameters, which researchers and practitioners often
adopt for the sake of convenience and avoiding tuning. These configurations,
however, have been optimized for large-scale machine translation data sets with
several millions of parallel sentences for European languages like English and

large models is detrimental for low-resource languages, since it makes training
more difficult and hurts overall performance, confirming previous observations.
We see our work as complementary to the Masakhane project (""Masakhane"" means

  Embeddings","Workshop paper accepted at Deep Learning for Knowledge Graphs
  Workshop 2020",,,,"cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  RDF2vec is a technique for creating vector space embeddings from an RDF
knowledge graph, i.e., representing each entity in the graph as a vector. It
first creates sequences of nodes by performing random walks on the graph. In a
second step, those sequences are processed by the word2vec algorithm for
creating the actual embeddings. In this paper, we explore the use of external
edge weights for guiding the random walks. As edge weights, transition
probabilities between pages in Wikipedia are used as a proxy for the human
feedback for the importance of an edge. We show that in some scenarios, RDF2vec
utilizing those transition probabilities can outperform both RDF2vec based on
random walks as well as the usage of graph internal edge weights.

be combined into physically viable candidate partition functions. We explicitly
detail the list of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions that serve as
candidates for chiral and anti-chiral partition functions and note that modular
covariance is only consistent with such functions when the left (resp. right)
central charge is an integer multiple of 8, $c\in 8\mathbb{N}$. We then find
related constraints on the symmetry group of the corresponding topological,
Chern-Simons, theory in the bulk of AdS. The symmetry group of the theory can
be one of two choices: either $SO(2; 1) \times SO(2; 1)$ or its three-fold
diagonal cover. We introduce the generalized Hecke operators which map the
modular covariant functions to the modular covariant functions. With these
mathematical results, we obtain conjectural partition functions for extremal
CFT2s, and the corresponding microcanonical entropies, when the chiral central

estimating the rate coefficient of folding for various proteins. Nevertheless,
a chief bottleneck lies in the fact that there is still no perfect consensus on
how does a force generally perturb the crystal-coil transition. Consequently,
the goal of our work is in clarifying the generic behavior of most proteins in
force spectroscopy; in other words, what general signature does an arbitrary
protein exhibit for its rate coefficient as a function of the applied force? By
employing a biomimetic polymer in molecular simulations, we focus on evaluating
its respective activation energy for unfolding, while pulling on various pairs
of its monomers. Above all, we find that in the vicinity of the force-free
scenario, this activation energy possesses a negative slope and a negative
curvature as a function of the applied force. Our work is in line with the most
recent theories for unfolding, which suggest that such a signature is expected
for most proteins, and thus, we further reiterate that many of the classical
formulae, that estimate the rate coefficient of the crystal-coil transition,
are inadequate. Besides, we also present here an analytical expression which
experimentalists can use for approximating the activation energy for unfolding;
importantly, it is based on measurements for the mean and variance of the
distance between the beads which are being pulled. In summary, our work
presents an interesting view for protein folding in force spectroscopy.

Random matrices and random functions in many dimensions provide toy models of
the landscape, allowing the exploration of conceptual issues associated with
these scenarios. We compute the relative number and slopes of minima as a
function of the vacuum energy $\Lambda$ in an $N$-dimensional Gaussian random
potential, quantifying the associated probability density, $p(\Lambda)$. After
normalisations $p(\Lambda)$ depends only on the dimensionality $N$ and a single

of positive minima shrinks super-exponentially with $N$; at $N=100$,
$p(\Lambda>0) \approx 10^{-1197}$. Likewise, typical eigenvalues of the Hessian
matrices reveal that the flattest approaches to typical minima grow flatter
with $N$, while the ratio of the slopes of the two flattest directions grows
with $N$. We discuss the implications of these results for both swampland and
conventional anthropic constraints on landscape cosmologies. In particular, for

approaches to minima where $\Lambda \approx 0$ are much flatter than for
typical minima, increasingly the viability of quintessence solutions.

to head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images in which an MRI examination was
performed within 24 h following the CT scan. These 238 annotated cases were
divided into a training set including 189 cases and test set including 49

from the training set using the You Only Look Once v3 model and Visual Geometry

detection process in the test set. To assess the detection model's results, a
board-certified radiologist also evaluated the test set head CT images with and
without the aid of the detection model. The sensitivity of AIS detection and
number of false positives were calculated for the evaluation of the test set
detection results. The sensitivity of the radiologist with and without the
software detection results was compared using the McNemar test. A p-value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
  Results: For the two-stage model and radiologist without and with the use of

respectively, and the number of false positives per one case was 1.265, 0.327,

star, forms a PN, and leaves a WD remnant. If the mass-transfer brings the
secondary star to have a mass of >8Mo before it develops a helium core, and if
the secondary does not suffer an enhanced mass-loss before it develops a
massive helium core, e.g., by mass-transfer, it explodes as a CCSN and leaves a
NS remnant. The time period from the formation of the PN by the primary to the
explosion of the secondary is >10^6 year. By that time the PN has long
dispersed into the interstellar medium. In a binary system with nearly equal
mass components, the first mass-transfer episode takes place after the
secondary star has developed a helium core and it ends its life forming a PN
and a WD. The formation of a CCSN inside a PN (CCSNIP) requires the presence of
a third star. The third star should be less massive than the secondary star but
by no more than few times 0.01Mo. We estimate that the rate of CCSNIP is

given requirements is the central concept behind Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
To duly ensure the performance of components, a software-based resilience
manager is a flexible choice to detect and recover from faults quickly.
However, a single resilience manager, placed at the centre of the system to
deal with every fault, suffers from decision-making overburden; and therefore,
is out of the question for distributed large-scale CPS. On the other hand,
prompt detection of failures and efficient recovery from them are challenging
for decentralised resilience managers. In this regard, we present a novel
resilience management framework that utilises the concept of management
hierarchy. System design contracts play a key role in this framework for prompt
fault-detection and recovery. Besides the details of the framework, an Industry
4.0 related test case is presented in this article to provide further insights.

propose a risk based reward function which punishes risky situations instead of
only collision failures. Such rewarding approach helps to incorporate risk
prediction into our deep Q network and learn more reliable policies which are
safer in challenging situations. The efficiency of the proposed approach is
compared with a DQN learned with conventional collision based rewarding scheme

show that the proposed approach outperforms both of these methods. It provides
safer actions than collision-aware DQN approach and is less overcautious than
the rule-based policy.

observables sensitive to the primary particle mass, are constructed after
mapping the density of secondary particles from the ground plane to the shower
plane (perpendicular to the shower axis). A simple orthogonal projection of the
muon coordinates onto this plane distorts the azimuthal symmetry in the shower
plane. Using CORSIKA simulations, we correct for this distortion by projecting
each muon onto the normal plane following its incoming direction, taking also
into account the attenuation probability. We show that besides restoring the
azimuthal symmetry of muons density around the shower axis, the application of
this procedure has a significant impact on the reconstruction of the

predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional
dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social
distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict
what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages
state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison
procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal
ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological
populations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the

this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some
interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear
effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.

considered. The first class involves adversarial examples and concerns the
introduction of small perturbations of the input data that cause
misclassification. The second class, introduced here for the first time and
named stealth attacks, involves small perturbations to the AI system itself.
Here the perturbed system produces whatever output is desired by the attacker
on a specific small data set, perhaps even a single input, but performs as
normal on a validation set (which is unknown to the attacker). We show that in
both cases, i.e., in the case of an attack based on adversarial examples and in
the case of a stealth attack, the dimensionality of the AI's decision-making
space is a major contributor to the AI's susceptibility. For attacks based on
adversarial examples, a second crucial parameter is the absence of local
concentrations in the data probability distribution, a property known as
Smeared Absolute Continuity. According to our findings, robustness to
adversarial examples requires either (a) the data distributions in the AI's
feature space to have concentrated probability density functions or (b) the
dimensionality of the AI's decision variables to be sufficiently small. We also
show how to construct stealth attacks on high-dimensional AI systems that are
hard to spot unless the validation set is made exponentially large.

Michel-Dansac et. al., 2017, extended to two space dimensions. To get both
properties, we use a convex combination between the high-order scheme and the

parameter following a very simple steady state detector, we ensure that the
resulting scheme is both high-order accurate and well-balanced. The method is
then supplemented with a MOOD procedure to eliminate the spurious oscillations

many-body interactions between atoms and light confined to optical cavities.
One model which has received widespread attention of late is the Dicke model,
which under certain conditions exhibits a quantum phase transition to a state
in which the atoms collectively emit light into the cavity mode, known as
superradiance. We consider a generalization of this model that features
independently controllable strengths of the co- and counter-rotating terms of
the interaction Hamiltonian. We study this system in the semiclassical (mean
field) limit, i.e., neglecting the role of quantum fluctuations. Under this
approximation, the model is described by a set of nonlinear differential
equations, which determine the system's semiclassical evolution. By taking a
dynamical systems approach, we perform a comprehensive analysis of these
equations to reveal an abundance of novel and complex dynamics. Examples of the
novel phenomena that we observe are the emergence of superradiant oscillations
arising due to Hopf bifurcations, and the appearance of a pair of chaotic
attractors arising from period-doubling cascades, followed by their collision
to form a single, larger chaotic attractor via a sequence of infinitely many
homoclinic bifurcations. Moreover, we find that a flip of the collective spin
can result in the sudden emergence of chaotic dynamics. Overall, we provide a
comprehensive roadmap of the possible dynamics that arise in the unbalanced,
open Dicke model in the form of a phase diagram in the plane of the two
interaction strengths. Hence, we lay out the foundations to make further
advances in the study of the fingerprint of semiclassical chaos when
considering the master equation of the unbalanced Dicke model, that is, the
possibility of studying a manifestation of quantum chaos in a specific,

weighted directed graph $G=(V,E,w)$ undergoing edge deletions and a source
vertex $r \in V$; let $n = |V|, m = |E|$ and $W$ be the aspect ratio of the
graph. The goal is to obtain a data structure that maintains shortest paths
from $r$ to all vertices in $V$ and can answer distance queries in $O(1)$ time,
as well as return the corresponding path $P$ in $O(|P|)$ time.
  This problem was first considered by Even and Shiloach [JACM'81], who
provided an algorithm with total update time $O(mn)$ for unweighted undirected
graphs; this was later extended to directed weighted graphs [FOCS'95, STOC'99].
There are conditional lower bounds showing that $O(mn)$ is in fact near-optimal
[ESA'04, FOCS'14, STOC'15, STOC'20]. In a breakthrough result, Forster et al.
showed that it is possible to achieve total update time $mn^{0.9+o(1)}\log W$
if the algorithm is allowed to return $(1+{\epsilon})$-approximate paths,
instead of exact ones [STOC'14, ICALP'15]. No further progress was made until
Probst Gutenberg and Wulff-Nilsen [SODA'20] provided a new approach for the
problem, which yields total time $\tilde{O}(\min{m^{2/3}n^{4/3}\log W,
(mn)^{7/8} \log W})$.
  Our result builds on this recent approach, but overcomes its limitations by
introducing a significantly more powerful abstraction, as well as a different
core subroutine. Our new framework yields a decremental
$(1+{\epsilon})$-approximate SSSP data structure with total update time
$\tilde{O}(n^2 \log^4 W)$. Our algorithm is thus near-optimal for dense graphs
with polynomial edge-weights. Our framework can also be applied to sparse
graphs to obtain total update time $\tilde{O}(mn^{2/3} \log^3 W)$.
  Our main technique allows us to convert SSSP algorithms for DAGs to ones for
general graphs, which we believe has significant potential to influence future
work.

sentences refer to women than to men. In Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
gender bias has been shown to reduce translation quality, particularly when the
target language has grammatical gender. The recent WinoMT challenge set allows
us to measure this effect directly (Stanovsky et al, 2019).
  Ideally we would reduce system bias by simply debiasing all data prior to
training, but achieving this effectively is itself a challenge. Rather than
attempt to create a `balanced' dataset, we use transfer learning on a small set
of trusted, gender-balanced examples. This approach gives strong and consistent
improvements in gender debiasing with much less computational cost than
training from scratch.
  A known pitfall of transfer learning on new domains is `catastrophic
forgetting', which we address both in adaptation and in inference. During

is due to the presence of the intramolecular interactions because the
contributions to the virial and potential energy resulting from the
intermolecular interactions still exhibit strong linear dependence.
Interestingly, in contrast to the results reported for simple-liquids, the
slope of the mentioned linear dependence is different than the values of the
density scaling exponent. However, our findings show that for the quasi-real
materials, the slope of dependence between the virial and potential energy
(resulting from the intermolecular interactions) strongly depends on the range
of intermolecular distances that are taken into account. Consequently, the
value of the slope of the discussed relationship, which enables satisfactory
density scaling, can be obtained. Furthermore, we show that the above crucial

$n$HDM (MS-$n$HDM) can provide both natural SM alignment and quartic coupling
unification up to the Planck scale. Most remarkably, we show that the MS-2HDM
is a very predictive extension of the SM governed by two only additional
parameters: (i) the charged Higgs mass $M_{h^{\pm}}$ (or $m^2_{12}$) and (ii)
$\tan\beta$, whilst the quartic coupling unification scale $\mu_X$ is predicted
to assume two discrete values. With these two input parameters, the entire
Higgs-mass spectrum of the model can be determined. Moreover, we obtain
definite predictions of misalignment for the SM-like Higgs-boson couplings to
the gauge bosons and to the quarks, which might be testable at future precision

choose all data points as a big dictionary to build huge coding models, which
results in a high time and space complexity. In this paper, we develop a
learnable subspace clustering paradigm to efficiently solve the LSSC problem.
The key idea is to learn a parametric function to partition the
high-dimensional subspaces into their underlying low-dimensional subspaces
instead of the expensive costs of the classical coding models. Moreover, we
propose a unified robust predictive coding machine (RPCM) to learn the
parametric function, which can be solved by an alternating minimization

achieved by identifying the nearest neighbours to a query example and using

classification is of particular importance because issues of poor run-time

  Filtering","8 pages, 3 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Set-Membership Filter (SMF) has been extensively studied for state estimation
in the presence of bounded noises with unknown statistics. Since it was first
introduced in the 1960s, the studies on SMF have used the set-based description
as its mathematical framework. One important issue that has been overlooked is
the optimality of SMF. In this work, we put forward a new mathematical
framework for SMF using concepts of uncertain variables. We first establish two
basic properties of uncertain variables, namely, the law of total range (a
non-stochastic version of the law of total probability) and the equivalent
Bayes' rule. This enables us to put forward a general SMFing framework with
established optimality. Furthermore, we obtain the optimal SMF under a
non-stochastic Markov condition, which is shown to be fundamentally equivalent
to the Bayes filter. Note that the classical SMF in the literature is only
equivalent to the optimal SMF we obtained under the non-stochastic Markov
condition. When this condition is violated, we show that the classical SMF is
not optimal and it only gives an outer bound on the optimal estimation.

analysis is particularly valuable for systems containing coupled objects with
considerably different broadening of energy levels. In such systems, the
scattering of itinerant electrons on a discrete (or narrow) energy level gives
rise to the Fano-type interference. Systems with induced superconducting order,
along well understood Fano resonances, exhibit also another features on the
opposite side of the Fermi level. The lineshape of these resonances differs
significantly from their reflection on the opposite side of the Fermi level,
and their origin was not fully understood. Here, considering the spin-polarized
tunneling model, we explain a microscopic mechanism of a formation of these
resonances and discuss the nature of their uncommon lineshapes. We show that
the anomalous Fano profiles originate solely from the pairing of nonscattered
electrons with scattered ones. We investigate also the interplay of each type

adapt to geometric transformations. S-Conv also incorporates geometric

convolutional weights. The capability of perceiving geometry is largely
enhanced without much affecting the amount of parameters and computational

two key contributions. First, we propose SpatialSim (Spatial Similarity), a
novel geometrical reasoning benchmark, and argue that progress on this

challenge in the real world. This benchmark is composed of two tasks:
Identification and Comparison, each one instantiated in increasing levels of

fully-connected message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) are useful to
solve those tasks, and show their advantages over less relational baselines
such as Deep Sets and unstructured models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons.
Finally, we highlight the current limits of GNNs in these tasks.

likelihood function is analytically or computationally intractable. In SL, the
likelihood function of the data is replaced by a multivariate Gaussian density
over summary statistics of the data. SL requires simulation of many replicate
datasets at every parameter value considered by a sampling algorithm, such as
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), making the method computationally-intensive.
We propose two strategies to alleviate the computational burden. First, we
introduce an algorithm producing a proposal distribution that is sequentially
tuned and made conditional to data, thus it rapidly \textit{guides} the
proposed parameters towards high posterior density regions. In our experiments,
a small number of iterations of our algorithm is enough to rapidly locate high
density regions, which we use to initialize one or several chains that make use
of off-the-shelf adaptive MCMC methods. Our ""guided"" approach can also be
potentially used with MCMC samplers for approximate Bayesian computation (ABC).
Second, we exploit strategies borrowed from the correlated pseudo-marginal MCMC
literature, to improve the chains mixing in a SL framework. Moreover, our
methods enable inference for challenging case studies, when the posterior is
multimodal and when the chain is initialised in low posterior probability
regions of the parameter space, where standard samplers failed. To illustrate
the advantages stemming from our framework we consider five benchmark examples,
including estimation of parameters for a cosmological model and a stochastic
model with highly non-Gaussian summary statistics.

some room for improvement. A system should be able to recognize any name in a

has becoming inherently important to disseminate accurate and timely
information about the disease. Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and
smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing
paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we
propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing based risk alert systems to
spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer COVID-19 propagation.
CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the
COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas. The CovidSens concept is
motivated by three observations: 1) people actively share their experience of
COVID-19 via online social media, 2) official warning channels and news
agencies are relatively slower than people reporting on social media, and 3)
online users are frequently equipped with powerful mobile devices that can
perform data processing and analytics. We envision unprecedented opportunities
to leverage posts generated by ordinary people to build real-time sensing and
analytic system for gathering and circulating COVID-19 propagation data.
Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to
distill reliable information on COVID-19 with prevailing rumors and
misinformation? How to inform the general public about the state of the spread
timely and effectively? How to leverage the computational power on edge devices
to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms? In this
vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify potential
challenges in developing reliable social sensing based risk alert systems. We
envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines can be effective
in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a few research directions for
future work in CovidSens.

which can actively switch their interactions at a predefined kinetic rate. For
this, we employ a reaction-diffusion approach based on a reactive dynamical
density-functional theory (R-DDFT) and study the effect of a binary (two-state)
switching of the size of colloids interacting with a Gaussian pair potential.
The rate of switching interpolates between a near-equilibrium binary Gaussian
mixture at low rates and an effective monodisperse liquid for large rates,
hence strongly affecting the one-body density profiles, adsorption, and
pressure at confining walls. Importantly, we demonstrate that sufficiently fast
switching impedes the phase separation of an (in equilibrium) unstable liquid,
allowing the dynamic control of the degree of mixing/condensation and local
micro-structuring in a cellular confinement by tuning the switching rate.

measurements are needed to test stellar atmosphere models and calibrate
empirical methods to determine T$_{\rm eff}$. There are few standard stars
currently available to calibrate temperature indicators for dwarf stars. Gaia
parallaxes now make it possible, in principle, to measure T$_{\rm eff}$ for
many dwarf stars in eclipsing binaries. We aim to develop a method that uses
high-precision measurements of detached eclipsing binary stars, Gaia parallaxes
and multi-wavelength photometry to obtain accurate and precise fundamental
effective temperatures that can be used to establish a set of benchmark stars.
We select the well-studied binary AI Phoenicis to test our method, since it has
very precise absolute parameters and extensive archival photometry. The method
uses the stellar radii and parallax for stars in eclipsing binaries. We use a
Bayesian approach to obtain the integrated bolometric fluxes for the two stars
from observed magnitudes, colours and flux ratios. The fundamental effective
temperature of two stars in AI Phoenicis are $6199\pm22$ K for the F7V
component and $5094\pm16$ K for the K0IV component. The zero-point error in the
flux scale leads to a systematic error of only 0.2% ($\approx$ 11K) in T$_{\rm
eff}$. We find that these results are robust against the details of the
analysis, such as the choice of model spectra. Our method can be applied to
eclipsing binary stars with radius, parallax and photometric measurements
across a range of wavelengths. Stars with fundamental effective temperatures
determined with this method can be used as benchmarks in future surveys.

It addresses the problem of learning multiple disjoint subgraphs that do not
enable full propagation of evidence. This problem is highly prevalent in cases
where the sample size of the input data is low with respect to the
dimensionality of the model, which is often the case when working with real
data. The paper presents a novel hybrid structure learning algorithm, called
SaiyanH, that addresses this issue. The results show that this constraint helps
the algorithm to estimate the number of true edges with higher accuracy
compared to the state-of-the-art. Out of the 13 algorithms investigated, the
results rank SaiyanH 4th in reconstructing the true DAG, with accuracy scores
lower by 8.1% (F1), 10.2% (BSF), and 19.5% (SHD) compared to the top ranked

of the Hartree-Fock approximation and the linear response theory, we find that
an intrinsic contribution to the Hall conductivity becomes nonzero in the
electron-doped AFM metallic phase with a small canted ferromagnetic moment. We
show that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the spin canting is irrelevant
to the Hall response; the nonzero Hall conductivity originates from the
collinear component of the AFM order in the presence of the spin-orbit
coupling. These features are well explained analytically in the limit of strong
dimerization on the anisotropic triangular lattice. Furthermore, we present an
intuitive picture for the present AHE by considering the real-space
configuration of emergent magnetic fluxes. We also find that the Hall response
appears even in the undoped AFM insulating phase at nonzero frequency as the
magneto-optical Kerr effect, which is enhanced around the charge transfer
excitations. We discuss possible detections of the AHE in ET based compounds.

for any regular value $\lambda$, there exist ""large eigenfunctions"" that are
singular on the boundary and regular inside. We are also able to present a
Fredholm alternative in this setting, as $\lambda$ approaches the values of the

we propose a self-supervised equivariant attention mechanism (SEAM) to discover

observation that equivariance is an implicit constraint in fully supervised
semantic segmentation, whose pixel-level labels take the same spatial
transformation as the input images during data augmentation. However, this
constraint is lost on the CAMs trained by image-level supervision. Therefore,
we propose consistency regularization on predicted CAMs from various
transformed images to provide self-supervision for network learning. Moreover,
we propose a pixel correlation module (PCM), which exploits context appearance
information and refines the prediction of current pixel by its similar
neighbors, leading to further improvement on CAMs consistency. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods using the same level of supervision. The code is

non-linear regimes as a mechanism to concentrate solids and trigger
planetesimal formation in the midplane of protoplanetary discs. A related dust
settling instability (DSI) applies to particles while settling towards the
midplane. The DSI has previously been studied in the linear regime, with
predictions that it could trigger particle clumping away from the midplane.
This work presents a range of linear calculations and non-linear simulations,
performed with FARGO3D, to assess conditions for DSI growth. We expand on
previous linear analyses by including particle size distributions and
performing a detailed study of the amount of background turbulence needed to
stabilize the DSI. When including binned size distributions, the DSI often
produces converged growth rates with fewer bins than the standard SI. With
background turbulence, we find that the most favorable conditions for DSI
growth are weak turbulence, characterized by $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-6}$ with
intermediate-sized grains that settle from one gas scale-height. These
conditions could arise during a sudden decrease in disc turbulence following an
accretion outburst. Ignoring background turbulence, we performed a parameter
survey of local 2D DSI simulations. Particle clumping was either weak or
occurred slower than particles settle. Clumping was reduced by a factor of two
in a comparison 3D simulation. Overall, our results strongly disfavor the
hypothesis that the DSI significantly promotes planetesimal formation.
Non-linear simulations of the DSI with different numerical methods could
support or challenge these findings.

an organic ferroelectric material, with polarization values on par with those
found in inorganic ferroelectric materials and highest among organic
ferroelectric materials, has opened up possibilities to realize myriads of
nano-electronic and spintronic devices based on organic ferroelectrics. Such
possibilities require an adequate understanding of the ferroelectric properties
of Croconic Acid grown on surfaces that are commonly employed in device
fabrication. While several macroscopic studies on relatively larger crystals of
Croconic Acid have been performed, studies on thin films are only in their
early stages. We have grown thin films of Croconic Acid on gold and cobalt
surfaces, which are commonly used in spintronic devices as metallic electrodes,
and studied the ferroelectric response of the films using ex-situ Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy at room temperature. We show that the polarization reversal in
Croconic Acid domains is sensitive to the substrate surface. Using the same
experimental protocol, we observe the robust polarization reversal of a single,
mostly in-plane electrical domain for a cobalt substrate, whereas polarization
reversal is hardly observed for a gold substrate. We attribute this difference
to the influence of substrates on the Croconic Acid molecular networks. Our
study suggests that to realize devices one has to take care about the substrate
on which Croconic Acid will be deposited. The fact that polarization switching
is robust on cobalt surface can be used to fabricate multifunctional devices
that utilize the cobalt-Croconic Acid interface.

Schur's complement, General sign-definiteness principle, inverse Chi-square

these intricate constraints. The non-convex optimization problems are
transformed into several convex subproblems and efficient algorithms are
proposed. Simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and reveal the impacts of CSI uncertainties on ST's minimum transmit power and
feasibility rate of the optimization problems. Simulation results also show
that the number of transmit antennas at the ST and the number of phase shifts

As a consequence, specific mitigation strategies must be introduced. We
characterize the relative importance of different broad strategies by
accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity, i.e. geography and
demography. First, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative
entities, in which social interactions between age classs occur. Due to the
sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix, once started the epidemics tend
to develop independently across areas, justifying the adoption of solutions
specific to individual regions or to clusters of regions. Second, we show that
social contacts between age classes play a fundamental role and that measures
which take into account the age structure of the population can provide a
significant contribution to mitigate the rebound effects. Our model is general,

relevance of some key parameters on non-pharmaceutical mitigation mechanisms

controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare
system due to progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes
will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow
informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with
much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time

  Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous
population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested
people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current
fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to
real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still
higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in
spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in
place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is
still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of
restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is
demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where

distributed systems in key scenarios, it is important to conduct automated
integration tests, based on distributed test components (called local testers)
that are deployed close to the system components to simulate inputs from the
environment and monitor the interactions with the environment and other system
components. We say that a distributed test scenario is locally controllable and
locally observable if test inputs can be decided locally and conformance errors
can be detected locally by the local testers, without the need for exchanging
coordination messages between the test components during test execution (which
may reduce the responsiveness and fault detection capability of the test
harness). DCO Analyzer is the first tool that checks if distributed test
scenarios specified by means of UML sequence diagrams exhibit those properties,
and automatically determines a minimum number of coordination messages to

the geometric complexity of the human cortex and the high degree of
inter-subject variability. A conventional solution is to use a spherical
representation of surface properties and perform registration by aligning
cortical folding patterns in that space. This strategy produces accurate
spatial alignment but often requires a high computational cost. Recently,
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated the potential to
dramatically speed up volumetric registration. However, due to distortions
introduced by projecting a sphere to a 2D plane, a direct application of recent
learning-based methods to surfaces yields poor results. In this study, we
present SphereMorph, a diffeomorphic registration framework for cortical
surfaces using deep networks that addresses these issues. SphereMorph uses a
UNet-style network associated with a spherical kernel to learn the displacement
field and warps the sphere using a modified spatial transformer layer. We
propose a resampling weight in computing the data fitting loss to account for
distortions introduced by polar projection, and demonstrate the performance of
our proposed method on two tasks, including cortical parcellation and
group-wise functional area alignment. The experiments show that the proposed
SphereMorph is capable of modeling the geometric registration problem in a CNN
framework and demonstrate superior registration accuracy and computational
efficiency. The source code of SphereMorph will be released to the public upon

Wikipedia needs to cover in order to achieve that goal. We argue that we need a
new approach to tackle this problem more effectively, a multilingual Wikipedia
where content can be shared between language editions. This paper proposes an
architecture for a system that fulfills this goal. It separates the goal in two
parts: creating and maintaining content in an abstract notation within a
project called Abstract Wikipedia, and creating an infrastructure called
Wikilambda that can translate this notation to natural language. Both parts are
fully owned and maintained by the community, as is the integration of the
results in the existing Wikipedia editions. This architecture will make more
encyclopedic content available to more people in their own language, and at the
same time allow more people to contribute knowledge and reach more people with
their contributions, no matter what their respective language backgrounds.
Additionally, Wikilambda will unlock a new type of knowledge asset people can
share in through the Wikimedia projects, functions, which will vastly expand
what people can do with knowledge from Wikimedia, and provide a new venue to
collaborate and to engage the creativity of contributors from all around the

  Daily Death Count Predictions",,,,,"stat.OT q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper provides a formal evaluation of the predictive performance of a
model (and its various updates) developed by the Institute for Health Metrics
and Evaluation (IHME) for predicting daily deaths attributed to COVID19 for
each state in the United States. The IHME models have received extensive
attention in social and mass media, and have influenced policy makers at the
highest levels of the United States government. For effective policy making the
accurate assessment of uncertainty, as well as accurate point predictions, are
necessary because the risks inherent in a decision must be taken into account,
especially in the present setting of a novel disease affecting millions of
lives. To assess the accuracy of the IHME models, we examine both forecast
accuracy as well as the predictive performance of the 95% prediction intervals
provided by the IHME models. We find that the initial IHME model underestimates
the uncertainty surrounding the number of daily deaths substantially.
Specifically, the true number of next day deaths fell outside the IHME
prediction intervals as much as 70% of the time, in comparison to the expected
value of 5%. In addition, we note that the performance of the initial model
does not improve with shorter forecast horizons. Regarding the updated models,
our analyses indicate that the later models do not show any improvement in the
accuracy of the point estimate predictions. In fact, there is some evidence
that this accuracy has actually decreased over the initial models. Moreover,
when considering the updated models, while we observe a larger percentage of
states having actual values lying inside the 95% prediction intervals (PI), our
analysis suggests that this observation may be attributed to the widening of
the PIs. The width of these intervals calls into question the usefulness of the
predictions to drive policy making and resource allocation.

importance to understand the dynamics of the coronavirus spread. This can help
health and government authorities take the appropriate measures and implement
suitable politics aimed at fighting and preventing it. Methods: A
time-dependent dynamic SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during
the MERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of
active and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the
virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable
parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of
about 22,000 active cases is estimated, although the official value for
recovered cases is out of date. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about
1,250 cases, of which 200/300 in ICU units. Conclusion: With appropriate
measures, the number of active cases in Portugal can be controlled at about
22,000 people, of which about 1,250 hospitalized and 200/300 in ICU units. This
seems manageable by the country national health service with an estimated 1,140
ventilators.

with (1) the requirement of large-scale face recognition (FR) training data
with age labels, which is limited in practice; (2) heavy deep network
architectures for high performance; and (3) their evaluations are usually taken
place on age-related face databases while neglecting the standard large-scale
FR databases to guarantee robustness. This work presents a novel Lightweight
Attentive Angular Distillation (LIAAD) approach to Large-scale Lightweight AiFR
that overcomes these limitations. Given two high-performance heavy networks as
teachers with different specialized knowledge, LIAAD introduces a learning
paradigm to efficiently distill the age-invariant attentive and angular
knowledge from those teachers to a lightweight student network making it more
powerful with higher FR accuracy and robust against age factor. Consequently,
LIAAD approach is able to take the advantages of both FR datasets with and
without age labels to train an AiFR model. Far apart from prior distillation
methods mainly focusing on accuracy and compression ratios in closed-set
problems, our LIAAD aims to solve the open-set problem, i.e. large-scale face
recognition. Evaluations on LFW, IJB-B and IJB-C Janus, AgeDB and
MegaFace-FGNet with one million distractors have demonstrated the efficiency of
the proposed approach on light-weight structure. This work also presents a new

extended this construction to an arbitrary positive characteristic. It is known
that the famous construction of Golod yields finitely generated associative

to construct finitely generated associative nil-algebras of polynomial and
intermediate growth. Another motivation of the paper is a construction of
groups of oscillating growth by Kassabov and Pak.
  For any prime $p$ we construct a family of 3-generated restricted Lie
algebras of intermediate oscillating growth. We call them Phoenix algebras
because, for infinitely many periods of time, the algebra is ""almost dying"" by
having a quasi-linear growth, namely the lower Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is
one, more precisely, the growth is of type $n \big(\ln^{(q)} \!n\big
)^{\kappa}$. On the other hand, for infinitely many $n$ the growth has a rather
fast intermediate behaviour of type $\exp( n/ (\ln n)^{\lambda})$, for such
periods the algebra is ""resuscitating"". Moreover, the growth function is
oscillating between these two types of behaviour. These restricted Lie algebras
have a nil $p$-mapping.

maximum gravitational mass is larger when we use the density-dependent bag

determine the conditions for escape from poverty for the rural poor. We have
developed a suite of dynamic, multidimensional poverty trap models of
households that combine economic aspects of growth with ecological dynamics of
soil quality, water and nutrient flows to analyze the effectiveness of common
poverty alleviation strategies such as intensification through agrochemical
inputs, diversification of energy sources and conservation tillage. Our results
show that (i) agrochemical inputs can reinforce poverty by degrading soil
quality, (ii) diversification of household energy sources can create
possibilities for effective application of other strategies, and (iii)
sequencing of interventions can improve effectiveness of conservation tillage.
Our model-based approach demonstrates the interdependence of economic and

Stylized models as developed here can be used for testing effectiveness of
different strategies given biophysical and economic settings in the target

capabilities of the framework by solving two outstanding challenge problems in
mesoscale plasticity: 1) recover the experimentally observed power-law scaling
of stress-strain behavior in constrained simple shear of thin metallic films
inferred from micropillar experiments which all strain gradient plasticity
models overestimate and fail to predict; 2) predict the finite deformation
stress and energy density fields of a sequence of dislocation distributions

development of practical orbital-based linear-scaling DFT methods has long been

show that the slow and unstable optimization of compact orbitals originates
from the nearly-invariant mixing of compact orbitals that are mostly but not
completely localized within the same subsets of basis functions. We also
construct an approximate Hessian that can be used to identify the problematic
nearly-invariant modes and obviate the variational optimization along them
without introducing significant errors into the computed energies. This enables
us to create a linear-scaling DFT method with a low computational overhead that
is demonstrated to be efficient and accurate in fixed-nuclei calculations and

generation of radio interferometric (RI) telescopes, such as the Square
Kilometre Array (SKA), which will acquire massive volumes of data. In this
article we review methods proposed recently to resolve the ill-posed inverse

big-data scenario. We focus on the recently proposed online reconstruction
method [4] and the considerable savings in data storage requirements and
computational cost that it yields.

  Autoencoder",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much scientific enquiry across disciplines is founded upon a mechanistic
treatment of dynamic systems that ties form to function. A highly visible
instance of this is in molecular biology, where an important goal is to
determine functionally-relevant forms/structures that a protein molecule
employs to interact with molecular partners in the living cell. This goal is
typically pursued under the umbrella of stochastic optimization with algorithms
that optimize a scoring function. Research repeatedly shows that current
scoring function, though steadily improving, correlate weakly with molecular
activity. Inspired by recent momentum in generative deep learning, this paper
proposes and evaluates an alternative approach to generating
functionally-relevant three-dimensional structures of a protein. Though
typically deep generative models struggle with highly-structured data, the work
presented here circumvents this challenge via graph-generative models. A
comprehensive evaluation of several deep architectures shows the promise of
generative models in directly revealing the latent space for sampling novel
tertiary structures, as well as in highlighting axes/factors that carry
structural meaning and open the black box often associated with deep models.
The work presented here is a first step towards interpretative, deep generative
models becoming viable and informative complementary approaches to protein
structure prediction.

compounds (the Rashba Effect) has a long-standing relevance to spintronic
applications and to the fundamental understanding of symmetry breaking in
solids, yet the knowledge of what controls its magnitude in different materials
is difficult to anticipate. Indeed, rare discoveries of compounds with large
Rashba coefficients are invariably greeted as pleasant surprises. We advance
the understanding of the ""Rashba Scale"" using the ""inverse design"" approach by
formulating theoretically the relevant design principle and then identifying
compounds that satisfy it. We show that the presence of energy band
anti-crossing provides a causal design principle of compounds with large Rashba
coefficients, leading to the identification via first-principles calculations
of 34 rationally designed strong-Rashba compounds. Since topological insulators
must have band anti crossing, this leads us to establish an interesting cross
functionality of ""Topological Rashba Insulators"" (TRI) that may provide a
platform for the simultaneous control of spin splitting and spin-polarization.

southern slope of Mt. Massico, in the territory of Mondragone (Caserta) in
Campania (southern Italy). Systematic excavation has been carried out since
2001, leading to the partial exploration of an important Pleistocene deposit,
extraordinarily rich in lithic and faunal remains. The aim of this paper is to
(1) present the stratigraphic sequence of Roccia San Sebastiano, and (2)
technologically describe the lithic materials of squares F14 t18, t19, t20; E16
t16, t17, t18 recently recognised as Uluzzian. The stratigraphic sequence is
more than 3 metres thick and dates from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic.
It contains different techno-complexes: Gravettian, Aurignacian, Uluzzian and
Mousterian. In the Uluzzian lithic assemblage mostly local pebbles of chert
were used in order to produce small-sized objects. The concept of debitage
mainly deals with unidirectional debitage with absent or fairly accurate
management of the convexities and angles; the striking platforms are usually
natural or made by one stroke. It is attested the use of both direct freehand
percussion and bipolar technique on anvil in the same reduction sequence.
Amongst the retouched tools the presence of two lunates is of note. This study
of the Roccia San Sebastiano Uluzzian lithic complexes is significant for
understanding the dynamics of the transition from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic
in the Tyrrhenian margin of southern Italy.

the proposed method accounts for possible hidden variables, such as
environmental variables or noise, and how it can be interpreted statistically
in terms of $p$-values. This interpretation, from category theory to
statistics, is implemented through a collection of propositions highlighting
the functorial properties of ANOVA. We use these properties in combination with
our category theoretical framework to provide solutions to causal inference
problems with both sound algebraic and statistical properties. As an
application, we show how the proposed method can be used to design a
combinatorial genome-wide association algorithm for the field of genetics.

vulnerability or not using machine learning. Such a line-level classification
task calls for a program representation which goes beyond reasoning from the
tokens present in the line. We seek a distributed representation in a latent
feature space which can capture the control and data dependencies of tokens
appearing on a line of program, while also ensuring lines of similar meaning
have similar features. We present a neural architecture, Vulcan, that
successfully demonstrates both these requirements. It extracts contextual
information about tokens in a line and inputs them as Abstract Syntax Tree
(AST) paths to a bi-directional LSTM with an attention mechanism. It
concurrently represents the meanings of tokens in a line by recursively
embedding the lines where they are most recently defined. In our experiments,
Vulcan compares favorably with a state-of-the-art classifier, which requires
significant preprocessing of programs, suggesting the utility of using deep
learning to model program dependence information.

they are extremely difficult to interpret. To enable interpretable NLP models,
we create vectors where each dimension is inherently interpretable. By
inherently interpretable, we mean a system where each dimension is associated
with some human understandable hint that can describe the meaning of that
dimension. In order to create more interpretable word embeddings, we transform
pretrained dense word embeddings into sparse embeddings. These new embeddings
are inherently interpretable: each of their dimensions is created from and
represents a natural language word or specific grammatical concept. We
construct these embeddings through sparse coding, where each vector in the
basis set is itself a word embedding. Therefore, each dimension of our sparse
vectors corresponds to a natural language word. We also show that models
trained using these sparse embeddings can achieve good performance and are more
interpretable in practice, including through human evaluations.
