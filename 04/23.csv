multiinformation about a target (tumor, organ or tissue). Segmentation using
multimodality consists of fusing multi-information to improve the segmentation.
Recently, deep learning-based approaches have presented the state-of-the-art
performance in image classification, segmentation, object detection and
tracking tasks. Due to their self-learning and generalization ability over
large amounts of data, deep learning recently has also gained great interest in
multi-modal medical image segmentation. In this paper, we give an overview of
deep learning-based approaches for multi-modal medical image segmentation task.
Firstly, we introduce the general principle of deep learning and multi-modal
medical image segmentation. Secondly, we present different deep learning
network architectures, then analyze their fusion strategies and compare their
results. The earlier fusion is commonly used, since it's simple and it focuses
on the subsequent segmentation network architecture. However, the later fusion
gives more attention on fusion strategy to learn the complex relationship
between different modalities. In general, compared to the earlier fusion, the
later fusion can give more accurate result if the fusion method is effective
enough. We also discuss some common problems in medical image segmentation.
Finally, we summarize and provide some perspectives on the future research.

their survival. Patch leaving is a canonical foraging behavior, but classic
theoretical conceptions of patch leaving decisions lack some key naturalistic
details. Optimal foraging theory provides general rules for when an animal
should leave a patch, but does not provide mechanistic insights about how those
rules change with the structure of the environment. Such a mechanistic
framework would aid in designing quantitative experiments to unravel behavioral
and neural underpinnings of foraging. To address these shortcomings, we develop
a normative theory of patch foraging decisions. Using a Bayesian approach, we
treat patch leaving behavior as a statistical inference problem. We derive the
animals' optimal decision strategies in both non-depleting and depleting
environments. A majority of these cases can be analyzed explicitly using
methods from stochastic processes. Our behavioral predictions are expressed in
terms of the optimal patch residence time and the decision rule by which an
animal departs a patch. We also extend our theory to a hierarchical model in
which the forager learns the environmental food resource distribution. The
quantitative framework we develop will therefore help experimenters move from
analyzing trial based behavior to continuous behavior without the loss of
quantitative rigor. Our theoretical framework both extends optimal foraging
theory and motivates a variety of behavioral and neuroscientific experiments
investigating patch foraging behavior.

for it can lead to spurious signal detections, especially in low
signal-to-noise conditions, which is often the context in which new discoveries
are pursued. For instance, in the realm of exoplanet detection with radial
velocity time series, stellar variability can induce false detections. However,
a white noise approximation is often used because accounting for correlated
noise when analyzing data implies a more complex analysis. Moreover, the
computational cost can be prohibitive as it typically scales as the cube of the
dataset size.
  For some restricted classes of correlated noise models, there are specific
algorithms that can be used to help bring down the computational cost. This
improvement in speed is particularly useful in the context of Gaussian process
regression, however, it comes at the expense of the generality of the noise
model.
  Here, we present the S+LEAF noise model, which allows us to account for a
large class of correlated noises with a linear scaling of the computational
cost with respect to the size of the dataset. The S+LEAF model includes, in
particular, mixtures of quasiperiodic kernels and calibration noise. This
efficient modeling is made possible by a sparse representation of the
covariance matrix of the noise and the use of dedicated algorithms for matrix
inversion, solving, determinant computation, etc.
  We applied the S+LEAF model to reanalyze the HARPS radial velocity time
series of HD 136352. We illustrate the flexibility of the S+LEAF model in
handling various sources of noise. We demonstrate the importance of taking
correlated noise into account, and especially calibration noise, to correctly
assess the significance of detected signals.

self-improving framework, where on the one hand the CNN-predicted depth is
leveraged to perform pseudo RGB-D feature-based SLAM, leading to better

hand, the bundle-adjusted 3D scene structures and camera poses from the more
principled geometric SLAM are injected back into the depth network through
novel wide baseline losses proposed for improving the depth prediction network,
which then continues to contribute towards better pose and 3D structure
estimation in the next iteration. We emphasize that our framework only requires
unlabeled monocular videos in both training and inference stages, and yet is
able to outperform state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular and stereo depth

spectra measured by DAMPE, Fermi-LAT, AMS-02, and CALET experiments. We study
the annihilations of possible TeV scale DM particles in a nearby subhalo, which
is proposed to explain the possible peak-like structure of the DAMPE CRE data.
We pay special attention to the possible non-resonant excess (besides the
possible peak-like structure) and demonstrate that such non-resonant excess can
mainly arise from the decay of muons produced by the DM annihilations in the
subhalo. With these we study the flavor composition of the lepton final states
from DM annihilations $\chi\chi\to e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-$ by fitting
the CRE data. We demonstrate that decays of the final states $\mu^+ \mu^-$ and
$\tau^+ \tau^-$ can provide the non-resonant excess, while the peak excess
arises from the $e^+ e^-$ final state. We further analyze the constraints on
the lepton flavor composition using the Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray measurements. We
find that the flavor composition is consistent with the Fermi-LAT data at
relatively low Galactic latitudes, while the fraction of the final state

inflation: Fading of the importance of quantum non-commutativity; the
phenomenon of quantum squeezing; and the ability to approximate the quantum
state by a distribution function on the classical phase space. In the standard
treatments, these features arise from properties of mode functions of quantum
fields in (near) de Sitter space-time. Therefore, the three notions are often
assumed to be essentially equivalent, representing different facets of the same
phenomenon. We analyze them in general Friedmann-Lemaitre- Robertson-Walker
space-times, through the lens of geometric structures on the classical phase
space. The analysis shows that: (i) inflation does not play an essential role;
classical behavior can emerge much more generally; (ii) the three notions are
conceptually distinct; classicality can emerge in one sense but not in another;
and, (iii) the third notion is realized in a surprisingly strong sense; there
is exact equality between completely general $n$-point functions in the
classical theory and those in the quantum theory, provided the quantum
operators are Weyl ordered. These features arise already for linear
cosmological perturbations by themselves: considerations such as mode-mode
coupling, decoherence, and measurement theory --although important in their own
right-- are not needed for emergence of classical behavior in any of the three
senses discussed. Generality of the results stems from the fact that they can
be traced back to geometrical structures on the classical phase space,
available in a wide class of systems. Therefore, this approach may also be
useful in other contexts.

increase with increasing x are also revealed from the chi(T) data. The magnetic
ground state for x >= 0.17 is a spin glass as indicated by hysteresis in chi(T)
between field-cooling and zero-field-cooling measurements and from the
relaxation of M in a small field that exhibits a stretched-exponential time

hence inferred to be comprised of small FM clusters. A logarithmic T dependence
of Cp at low T for x = 0.14 is consistent with the presence of significant FM
quantum fluctuations. This composition is near the T = 0 boundary at x = 0.16

penalization term added to momentum equation provides to get material
distribution. Every time material is added inside the computational domain,
there is creation of new fluid-solid interfaces and apparition of gradient of
porosity. However, at present, porosity variation is not taken account in
topology optimization and the penalization term used to locate the solid is
analogous to a Darcy term used for flows in porous media. With that in mind, in
this paper, we first develop an original one-domain macroscopic model for the
modelling of flow through spatially varying porous media that goes beyond the
scope of Darcy regime. Next, we numerically solve a topology optimization
problem and compare the results obtained with the standard model that does not
include effect of porosity variation with those obtained with our model. Among
our results, we show for instance that the designs obtained are different but

rotation of the SLAMS, and a subset of these current sheets can exhibit
reconnection features including the electron outflow jet and X-line-type
magnetic topology. The di-scale current sheet near the edge of a SLAMS
propagates much more slowly than the overall SLAMS, suggesting that it may
result from compression. The current structures also exist as magnetosonic
whistler waves with fci < f < flh, where fci and flh are the ion cyclotron

gravitational theories, possibly without a standard Lagrangian. We investigate
this claim by studying tree-level graviton scattering amplitudes, allowing us
to draw conclusions independently of the Lagrangian. By taking four-dimensional
limits of higher-dimensional scattering amplitudes of the Gauss--Bonnet theory,
we find four-dimensional amplitudes that are different from general relativity;
however, these amplitudes are not new since they all come from certain
scalar-tensor theories. The nontrivial limit that does not lead to infinite
strong coupling around flat space leads to $(\partial\phi)^4$ theory. We argue
that there cannot be any six-derivative purely gravitational four-point
amplitudes in any dimension other than those coming from Lovelock theory by
directly constructing the on-shell amplitudes. In particular, there can be no
new such amplitudes in four dimensions beyond those of general relativity. We
also present some new results on the spin-averaged cross section for
graviton-graviton scattering in general relativity and Gauss--Bonnet theory in

generation tool for investigating single molecule break junction
distance-conductance traces. In contrast to previous machine learning
approaches for single molecule data, Segment Clustering identifies groupings of
similar pieces of traces instead of entire traces. This offers a new and
advantageous perspective into dataset structure because it facilitates the
identification of meaningful local trace behaviors that may otherwise be
obscured by random fluctuations over longer distance scales. We illustrate the
power and broad applicability of this approach with two case studies that
address common challenges encountered in single molecule studies: First,
Segment Clustering is used to extract primary molecular features from a varying
background to increase the precision and robustness of conductance
measurements, enabling small changes in conductance in response to molecular
design to be identified with confidence. Second, Segment Clustering is applied
to a known data mixture to qualitatively separate distinct molecular features
in a rigorous and unbiased manner. These examples demonstrate two powerful ways

temporal resolution. A first step has been made in [G. Revet et al., Science
Advances 3, e1700982 (2017), arXiv:1708.02528]. in allowing such
investigations. It revealed the existence of a two components stream: a hot
shell surrounding a cooler inner stream. The shell was formed by matter
laterally ejected upon impact and refocused by the local magnetic field. That
laboratory investigation was limited tonormal incidence impacts. However, in
young stellar objects, complex structure of magnetic fields causes variability
of the incidentangles of the accretion columns. This led us to undertake an
investigation, using laboratory plasmas, of the consequence of having a slanted
accretion impacting a young star. Here we use high power laser interactions and
strong magnetic field generation in the laboratory, complemented by numerical
simulations, to study the asymmetry induced upon accretion structures when
columns of matter impact the surface of young stars with an oblique angle.
Compared to the scenario where matter accretes normal to the star surface, we
observe strongly asymmetric plasma structure, strong lateral ejecta of matter,
poor confinement of the accreted material and reduced heating compared to the
normal incidence case. Thus, slanted accretion is a configuration that seems to
be capable of inducing perturbations of the chromosphere and hence possibly
influence the level of activity of the corona.

main result is a sharp bound on the one-point height fluctuation, proving $e^{
- \Theta(x^{3/2})}$ upper tails reminiscent of the Tracy--Widom distribution,
capturing a tradeoff between the locally Brownian oscillations and the global
field effect. We further prove a concentration estimate for the number of
points above which the interface attains a large height. These are used to
deduce various geometric properties of the interface, including the order and
tails of the area it confines, and the poly-logarithmic pre-factor governing
its maximum height fluctuation. Our arguments combine classical inputs from the
random-line representation of the Ising interface, with novel local resampling
and coupling schemes.

giant radio relic around the galaxy cluster Abell 2249 ($z=0.0838$) using
LOFAR. It is special since it has the lowest surface brightness of all known

renormalization by quantum fluctuations allows to reconcile larger values of
the advocated bare parameters with their earlier assessments and provides a
consistent description of the field evolution of spin excitations in the
paramagnetic phase. We assert that large anisotropic terms inevitably result in
strong anharmonic coupling of magnons, necessarily leading to broad features in
their spectra due to decays, in accord with the observations in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using duality transformations, we explain the origin of the
pseudo-Goldstone mode that is ubiquitous to the studied parameter space and is

an extensive exploration of a highly degenerate and high-dimensional parameter
space to accurately constrain atmospheric parameters. Retrieval methods
commonly conduct Bayesian parameter estimation and statistical inference using
sampling algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Nested Sampling.
Recently several attempts have been made to use machine learning algorithms
either to complement or replace fully Bayesian methods. While much progress has
been made, these approaches are still at times unable to accurately reproduce
results from contemporary Bayesian retrievals. The goal of our present work is
to investigate the efficacy of machine learning for atmospheric retrieval. As a
case study, we use the Random Forest supervised machine learning algorithm
which has been applied previously with some success for atmospheric retrieval
of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b using its near-infrared transmission spectrum. We
reproduce previous results using the same approach and the same semi-analytic
models, and subsequently extend this method to develop a new algorithm that
results in a closer match to a fully Bayesian retrieval. We combine this new
method with a fully numerical atmospheric model and demonstrate excellent
agreement with a Bayesian retrieval of the transmission spectrum of another hot
Jupiter, HD 209458b. Despite this success, and achieving high computational
efficiency, we still find that the machine learning approach is computationally
prohibitive for high-dimensional parameter spaces that are routinely explored
with Bayesian retrievals with modest computational resources. We discuss the
trade offs and potential avenues for the future.

hours of Gemini/GMOS spectroscopy, and deep multi-band photometry taken with a
range of observatories, we probe the SMFs down to a stellar mass limit of
10^9.7 Msun (10^9.5 Msun for star-forming galaxies). At this early epoch, the
fraction of quiescent galaxies is already highly elevated in the clusters
compared to the field at the same redshift. The quenched fraction excess (QFE)
represents the fraction of galaxies that would be star-forming in the field,
but are quenched due to their environment. The QFE is strongly mass dependent,
and increases from ~30% at Mstar=10^9.7 Msun, to ~80% at Mstar=10^11.0 Msun.
Nonetheless, the shapes of the SMFs of the two individual galaxy types,
star-forming and quiescent galaxies, are identical between the clusters and the
field - to high statistical precision. Yet, along with the different quiescent
fractions is the total galaxy SMF environmentally dependent, with a relative
deficit of low-mass galaxies in the clusters. These results are in stark
contrast with findings in the local Universe, and thus require a substantially
different quenching mode to operate at early times. We discuss these results in

there are also quantized invariants capturing generalized Thouless pumps.
Consideration of these terms provides constraints on the phase diagram of
many-body systems, implying the existence of gapless points in the phase
diagram which are stable for topological reasons. We describe such diabolical
points, realized by free fermions and gauge theories in various dimensions,
which act as sources of ""higher Berry curvature"" and are protected by the
quantization of the corresponding WZW terms or Thouless pump terms. These are
analogous to Weyl nodes in a semimetal band structure. We argue that in the
presence of a boundary, there are boundary diabolical points---parameter values
where the boundary gap closes---which occupy arcs ending at the bulk diabolical
points. Thus the boundary has an ""anomaly in the space of couplings"" in the

forming galaxies on the main sequence at a redshift of ~4.4-5.8. Our analyses
are based on the far infrared continuum observations of 118 galaxies at
rest-frame 158{\mu}m obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)
Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE). We study the
connection between the ultraviolet (UV) spectral slope ($\beta$), stellar mass
(M_*), and infrared excess (IRX=L_IR/L_UV). Twenty-three galaxies are
individually detected in the continuum at >3.5 sigma significance. We perform a
stacking analysis using both detections and nondetections to study the average
dust attenuation properties at z~4.4-5.8. The individual detections and stacks
show that the IRX-$\beta$ relation at z~5 is consistent with a steeper dust
attenuation curve than typically found at lower redshifts (z<4). The
attenuation curve is similar to or even steeper than that of the extinction
curve of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). This systematic change of the
IRX-$\beta$ relation as a function of redshift suggests an evolution of dust
attenuation properties at z>4. Similarly, we find that our galaxies have lower
IRX values, up to 1dex on average, at a fixed mass compared to previously
studied IRX-M_* relations at z<4, albeit with significant scatter. This implies
a lower obscured fraction of star formation than at lower redshifts. Our
results suggest that dust properties of UV-selected star forming galaxies at
z>4 are characterised by (i) a steeper attenuation curve than at z<4, and (ii)
a rapidly decreasing dust obscured fraction of star formation as a function of
redshift. Nevertheless, even among this UV-selected sample, massive galaxies
(log M_*/$M_\odot$>10) at z~5-6 already exhibit an obscured fraction of star
formation of ~45%, indicating a rapid build-up of dust during the epoch of
reionization.

the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequate sampling of the population,

significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold.
We conclude that relying largely on automated contact tracing without

belongs to a very short list of highly irradiated exoplanets that were

WASP-33b is of delta Scuti-type and shows nonradial pulsations in the

signal-to-noise ratio higher than 4. After cleaning the light curve from the
stellar pulsations, we confidently report a secondary eclipse depth of 305.8

100.4 +/- 13.1 ppm and a corresponding westward offset between the region of

estimate the molecular gas content in a large sample of main-sequence
star-forming galaxies at z=4.4-5.9, with a median stellar mass of 10^9.7 Msun,
drawn from the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE)

luminosity, dynamical mass, and rest-frame 850um luminosity, extrapolated from
the rest-frame 158um continuum, supports [CII] as a reliable tracer of
molecular gas in our sample. We find a continuous decline of the molecular gas
depletion timescale from z=0 to z=5.9, which reaches a mean value of
(4.6+/-0.8)x10^8 yr at z~5.5, only a factor of 2-3 shorter than in present-day
galaxies. This suggests a mild enhancement of star formation efficiency toward
high redshifts, unless the molecular gas fraction significantly increases. Our
estimates show that the rise in molecular gas fraction as reported previously,
flattens off above z~3.7 to achieve a mean value of 63%+/-3 over z=4.4-5.9.
This redshift evolution of the gas fraction is in line with the one of the
specific star formation rate. We use multi-epoch abundance matching to follow
the gas fraction evolution over cosmic time of progenitors of z=0 Milky
Way-like galaxies in 10^13 Msun halos and of more massive z=0 galaxies in 10^14
Msun halos. Interestingly, the former progenitors show a monotonic decrease of
the gas fraction with cosmic time, while the latter show a constant gas
fraction from z=5.9 to z~2 and a decrease at z<2. We discuss three possible
effects, namely outflows, halt of gas supplying, and over-efficient star
formation, which may jointly contribute to the gas fraction plateau of the
latter massive galaxies.

uniformly-related machines in the presence of an arbitrary, fixed communication
delay $\rho$. We consider a model that allows job duplication, i.e. processing
of the same job on multiple machines, which, as we show, can reduce the length
of a schedule (i.e., its makespan) by a logarithmic factor. Our main result is
an $O(\log m \log \rho / \log \log \rho)$-approximation algorithm for
minimizing makespan, assuming the minimum makespan is at least $\rho$. Our
algorithm is based on rounding a linear programming relaxation for the problem,
which includes carefully designed constraints capturing the interaction among
communication delay, precedence requirements, varying speeds, and job
duplication. Our result builds on two previous lines of work, one with
communication delay but identical machines (Lepere, Rapine 2002) and the other
with uniformly-related machines but no communication delay (Chudak, Shmoys
1999). We next show that the integrality gap of our mathematical program is
$\Omega(\sqrt{\log \rho})$. Our gap construction employs expander graphs and
exploits a property of robust expansion and its generalization to paths of
longer length. Finally, we quantify the advantage of duplication in scheduling
with communication delay. We show that the best schedule without duplication
can have makespan $\Omega(\rho/\log \rho)$ or $\Omega(\log m/\log\log m)$ or
$\Omega(\log n/\log \log n)$ times that of an optimal schedule allowing
duplication. Nevertheless, we present a polynomial time algorithm to transform
any schedule to a schedule without duplication at the cost of a $O(\log^2 n
\log m)$ factor increase in makespan. Together with our makespan approximation
algorithm for schedules allowing duplication, this also yields a
polylogarithmic-approximation algorithm for the setting where duplication is
not allowed.

yet to be reached. Deep learning methods continue to excel in the fields of
object detection and image classification applied to natural imagery. However,
the application of such methodologies applied to binary imagery remains limited
due to lack of crucial features such as textures,color and intensity
information. This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based
search for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural
image repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not
identical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example,
both imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are
lacking in texture).
  We begin by using deep learning to generate sketches from natural images for
image retrieval and then train a second deep learning model on the sketches. We
then use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer
learning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams.
Our experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer
learning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying
similar images based on content.

This protocol lacks security mechanisms by design and is therefore vulnerable

Existing security mechanisms focus on the use of encryption, authentication and

limited availability of computational resources and real-time sensitivity. We
survey In-Vehicle Network (IVN) attacks which have been grouped under: direct

the dual of an appropriate Sobolev space, that the associated eigenvalues

applications to shape optimization. The main theme is studying sharp
isoperimetric inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues without any assumption on
the number of connected components of the boundary. In particular, we solve the
isoperimetric problem for each Steklov eigenvalue of planar domains: the best
upper bound for the $k$-th perimeter-normalised Steklov eigenvalue is
$8{\pi}k$, which is the best upper bound for the $k$-th area-normalised
eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the sphere. The proof involves realising a
weighted Neumann problem as a limit of Steklov problems on perforated domains.
For $k = 1$, the number of connected boundary components of a maximizing
sequence must tend to infinity, and we provide a quantitative lower bound on
the number of connected components. A surprising consequence of our analysis is
that any maximizing sequence of planar domains with fixed perimeter must
collapse to a point.

Twenty-one of the 29 counting methods are rank-dependent and fractionalized

equal shares, for example harmonic counting. The internal and external
validation of the counting methods are assessed. Three criteria for
well-constructed bibliometric indicators - adequacy, sensitivity, and
homogeneity - are used to assess the internal validity. Regarding the external

in the studies that introduced the 29 counting methods comply with the
subsequent use of the counting methods. This study has the potential to give a

mechanism by which the emission is generated, remain unknown. Many FRB models
predict prompt multi-wavelength counterparts, which can be used to refine our
knowledge of these fundamentals of the FRB phenomenon. However, several
previous targeted searches for prompt FRB counterparts have yielded no
detections, and have additionally not reached sufficient sensitivity with
respect to the predictions. In this work, we demonstrate a technique to
estimate the ratio, $\eta$, between the energy outputs of FRB counterparts at
various wavelengths and the radio-wavelength emission. Our technique combines
the fluence distribution of the FRB population with results from several
wide-field blind surveys for fast transients from the optical to the TeV bands.
We present constraints on $\eta$ that improve upon previous observations even
in the case that all unclassified transient events in existing surveys are FRB
counterparts. In some scenarios for the FRB engine and emission mechanism, we
find that FRB counterparts should have already been detected, thus
demonstrating that our technique can successfully test predictions for $\eta$.
However, it is possible that FRB counterparts are lurking amongst catalogs of
unclassified transient events. Although our technique is robust to the present
uncertainty in the FRB fluence distribution, its ultimate application to
accurately estimate or bound $\eta$ will require the careful analysis of all
candidate fast-transient events in multi-wavelength survey data sets.

objects in the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity (EiBI), a member of the
class of (metric-affine formulated) Ricci-based gravity theories (RBGs). We
include a detailed account of the RBGs/GR correspondence exploited to
analytically solve the field equations. The single parameter $\e$ of the EiBI
model defines two branches for the solution. The $\e>0$ branch may be described
as a `shell with no interior', and constitutes an ill-defined, geodesically
incomplete spacetime. The more interesting $\e<0$ branch admits the
interpretation of a `wormhole membrane', an exotic horizonless compact object
with the ability to transfer particles and light from any point on its surface
(located slightly below the would-be Schwarzschild radius) to its antipodal
point, in a vanishing fraction of proper time. This is a single example
illustrating how the structural modifications introduced by the metric-affine
formulation may lead to significant departures from GR even at astrophysically
relevant scales, giving rise to physically plausible objects radically
different from those we are used to think of in the metric approach, and that
could act as a black hole mimickers whose shadows might present distinguishable
signals.

events that might happen next, and the intents of the people at present. To
support research toward visual commonsense reasoning, we introduce the first
large-scale repository of Visual Commonsense Graphs that consists of over 1.4
million textual descriptions of visual commonsense inferences carefully
annotated over a diverse set of 60,000 images, each paired with short video

co-reference links) between people appearing in the image and people mentioned
in the textual commonsense descriptions, allowing for tighter integration
between images and text. We establish strong baseline performances on this task
and demonstrate that integration between visual and textual commonsense
reasoning is the key and wins over non-integrative alternatives.

suffer from uncontrolled systematic uncertainties in addition to the well-known

directly at finite $\mu = \mu_B/3$ and is yet free from any such uncontrolled
systematics. With this algorithm the {\em only} problem is the sign problem
itself. This approach involves the generation of configurations with the
positive fermionic weight $|{\rm Re\; det} D(\mu)|$ where $D(\mu)$ is the Dirac
matrix and the signs ${\rm sign} \; ( {\rm Re\; det} D(\mu) ) = \pm 1$ are
handled by a discrete reweighting. Hence there are only two sectors, $+1$ and
$-1$ and as long as the average $\langle\pm 1\rangle \neq 0$ (with respect to
the positive weight) this discrete reweighting by the signs carries no overlap
problem and the results are reliable. The approach is tested on $N_t = 4$
lattices with $2+1$ flavors and physical quark masses using the unimproved
staggered discretization. By measuring the Fisher (sometimes also called
Lee-Yang) zeros in the bare coupling on spatial lattices $L/a = 8, 10, 12$ we
conclude that the cross-over present at $\mu = 0$ becomes stronger at $\mu > 0$

user to improve the accuracy of standard lithium abundance determinations based
on 1D model atmospheres and the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
(LTE) by applying corrections that account for hydrodynamic (3D) and non-LTE
(NLTE) effects in FGK stars of different metallicity. Based on a grid of
CO5BOLD 3D models and associated 1D hydrostatic atmospheres, we computed three
libraries of synthetic spectra of the lithium line at 670.8 nm for a wide range
of lithium abundances, accounting for detailed line formation in 3D NLTE, 1D
NLTE, and 1D LTE, respectively. The resulting curves-of-growth were then used
to derive 3D NLTE and 1D NLTE lithium abundance corrections. We demonstrate
that 3D and NLTE effects are small for metal-poor stars on the Spite plateau,
leading to errors of at most +/-0.05 dex if ignored. The largest corrections
are found at the coolest effective temperature, Teff=5000 K, where they can
reach -0.4 dex for the strongest lines. We present analytical functions for
evaluating the corrections and for directly converting a given lithium
abundance into an equivalent width, or vice versa, a given equivalent width
(EW) into a lithium abundance. For convenience, a Python script is made
available that evaluates all fitting functions for given Teff, log g, [Fe/H],
and A(Li) or EW. By means of the fitting functions, the results of complex 3D

generally for undirected graphical models. Given sample access to the Gibbs
distribution corresponding to an unknown or hidden model $M^*$ and given an
explicit model $M$, can we distinguish if either $M = M^*$ or if they are
(statistically) far apart? Daskalakis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial-time
algorithm for identity testing for the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model.
In contrast, for the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) Ising model, Bez\'akov\'a et
al. (2019) proved that unless $RP=NP$ there is no identity testing algorithm
when $\beta d=\omega(\log{n})$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the visible
graph and $\beta$ is the largest edge weight in absolute value.
  We prove analogous hardness results for RBMs (i.e., mixed Ising models on
bipartite graphs), even when there are no latent variables or an external
field. Specifically, we show that if $RP \neq NP$, then when $\beta
d=\omega(\log{n})$ there is no polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing
for RBMs; when $\beta d =O(\log{n})$ there is an efficient identity testing
algorithm that utilizes the structure learning algorithm of Klivans and Meka
(2017). In addition, we prove similar lower bounds for purely ferromagnetic
RBMs with inconsistent external fields, and for the ferromagnetic Potts model.
Previous hardness results for identity testing of Bez\'akov\'a et al. (2019)
utilized the hardness of finding the maximum cuts, which corresponds to the
ground states of the antiferromagnetic Ising model. Since RBMs are on bipartite
graphs such an approach is not feasible. We instead introduce a general
methodology to reduce from the corresponding approximate counting problem and
utilize the phase transition that is exhibited by RBMs and the mean-field Potts

noise has a form invariant under coordinate transformations we obtain the power
spectrum close to the scale invariant one. In the diffusion approximation we go
beyond the slow variation assumption. We calculate the power spectrum exactly
in models with exponential inflation and polynomial potentials and with
power-law inflation and exponential potentials.

constant-density core in the resolved innermost radius. With one additional
core-radius parameter, $r_{c}$, this ""core-Einasto"" profile is able to
characterize the shape and normalization of our feedback-impacted dark matter
halos. In order to enable comparisons with observations, we provide fitting
functions for $r_{c}$ and other profile parameters as a function of both
$M_\star$ and $M_{\star}/M_{\rm halo}$. In agreement with similar studies done
in the literature, we find that dark matter core formation is most efficient at
the characteristic stellar-mass to halo-mass ratio $M_\star/M_{\rm halo} \simeq
5 \times 10^{-3}$, or $M_{\star} \sim 10^9 \, M_{\odot}$, with cores that are
roughly the size of the galaxy half-light radius, $r_{c} \simeq 1-5$ kpc.

often makes halos significantly more concentrated and dense at the stellar
half-light radius than dark matter only runs. However, even at the Milky Way
scale, FIRE-2 galaxy formation still produces small dark matter cores of
$\simeq 0.5-2$ kpc in size. Recent evidence for a ${\sim} 2$ kpc core in the
Milky Way's dark matter halo is consistent with this expectation.

These pump-probe experiments show sub-picosecond transient dynamics only within

dominated by photoinduced interband transitions resulting from ultrafast

electron-phonon coupling in TiN and ZrN is 25-100 times greater than in Au.
Strong electron-phonon coupling drives the sub-picosecond optical response and
facilitates greater lattice heating compared to Au, making TiN and ZrN
promising for photothermal applications. The spectral response and dynamics of
TiN and ZrN are only weakly sensitive to pump fluence and pump excitation
energy. However, the magnitude of the response is much greater at higher pump

planes of the hBN host material. In this work, we investigate the origins for
the mechanical decoupling. Improved sample preparation enabled a reduced
background and a 70-fold decrease of spectral diffusion which was so far the
major drawback of defect center in hBN and allowed us to reveal a gap in the
electron-phonon spectral density for low phonon frequencies. This decoupling
from phonons persists at room temperature and explains the observed Fourier
Transform limited lines up to 300K. Furthermore, we investigate the dipole
emission directionality and show a preferred photon emission through the side
of the hBN flakes supporting the claim for an out-of-plane distortion of the
defect center. Our work lays the foundation to a deeper understanding of the
underlying physics for the persistence of Fourier-Transform limit lines up to

characterize what functions are fractionally differentiable. Various calculus
rules including a fundamental theorem of calculus, product and chain rules, and

is based on the injection of short strain pulses into ferromagnetic films with
a strong magnetoelastic coupling between spins and strains. Here we report
micromagnetoelastic simulations of the magnetization and strain dynamics
excited in Fe$_{81}$Ga$_{19}$ films by picosecond and nanosecond acoustic
pulses created in a GaAs substrate by a transducer subjected to an optical or
electrical impulse. The simulations performed via the numerical solution of the
coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert and elastodynamic equations show that the
injected strain pulse induces an inhomogeneous magnetization precession in the
ferromagnetic film. The precession lasts up to 1 ns and can be treated as a
superposition of magnon modes having the form of standing spin waves. For
Fe$_{81}$Ga$_{19}$ films with nanoscale thickness, up to seven (six) distinct
modes have been revealed under free-surface (pinning) magnetic boundary
conditions. Remarkably, magnon modes with frequencies over 1 THz can be excited
by acoustic pulses with an appropriate shape and duration in the films
subjected to a moderate external magnetic field. This finding shows that short
strain pulses represent a promising tool for the generation of THz spin waves
necessary for the implementation of high-speed magnonic devices.

based on their scores in the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT).
These scores are known to be impacted by socioeconomic status of students and
test preparation received in ""feeder"" middle schools, leading to a massive
filtering effect in the education pipeline. For instance, around 50% (resp.
80%) of the students admitted to the top public high schools in New York City
come from only 5% (resp. 15%) of the middle schools. The classical mechanisms
for assigning students to schools do not naturally address problems like school
segregation and class diversity, which have worsened over the years. The
scientific community, including policy makers, have reacted by incorporating
group-specific quotas, proportionality constraints, or summer school
opportunities, but there is evidence that these can end up hurting minorities
or even create legal challenges. We take a completely different approach to
reduce this filtering effect of feeder middle schools, with the goal of
increasing the opportunity of students with high economic needs. We model a
two-sided market where a candidate may not be perceived at their true
potential, and is therefore assigned to a lower level than the one (s)he
deserves. We propose and study the effect of interventions such as additional
training and scholarships towards disadvantaged students, and challenge
existing mechanisms for scholarships. We validate these findings using SAT

qualitative takeaways remain the same even when some of the modeling
assumptions are relaxed.

Encryption (PDE) systems provide an effective manner to protect sensitive data

to overriding the hidden volume, waste physical storage because of the reserved
area used for avoiding data loss, and require device reboot when using the
hidden volume. This paper presents MobiGyges, a hidden volume-based mobile PDE
system, to fill the gap. MobiGyges addresses the problem of data loss by
restricting each storage block used only by one volume, and it improves storage
utilization by eliminating the reserved area. MobiGyges can also avoid device
reboot by mounting the hidden volume dynamically on-demand with the Dynamic
Mounting service. Moreover, we identify two novel PDE oriented attacks, the
capacity comparison attack and the fill-to-full attack. MobiGyges can defend
them by jointly leveraging the Shrunk U-disk method and multi-level
deniability. We implement the MobiGyges proof-of-concept system on a real

propagate stochastic waves from an input boundary to the location of an
offshore structure. Each wave realization is typically characterized by a
high-dimensional input time series, and a reliable determination of the extreme
events is associated with substantial computational effort. As the sea depth
decreases, extreme events become more difficult to evaluate. We here construct
a low-dimensional characterization of the candidate input time series to
circumvent the search for extreme wave events in a high-dimensional input
probability space. Each wave input is represented by a unique low-dimensional
set of parameters for which standard surrogate approximations, such as Gaussian
processes, can estimate the short-term exceedance probability efficiently and
accurately. We demonstrate the advantages of the new approach with a simple
shallow-water wave model based on the Korteweg-de Vries equation for which we
can provide an accurate reference solution based on the simple Monte Carlo
method. We furthermore apply the method to a fully nonlinear wave model for
wave propagation over a sloping seabed. The results demonstrate that the

proposed as a potential reason behind the tension in the expansion rate, H0, of

using electroweak precision observables, rare meson decays, and neutrinoless
double-\{beta} decay. In contrast to previous works, we emphasize the
importance of carrying out this study in a framework with full Standard-Model
gauge invariance. We implement this first by working with a relevant set of
Standard- Model-Effective-Field-Theory operators and subsequently by
considering a UV completion in the inverse See-Saw model. We find that the
scenario in which all flavors of neutrinos self-interact universally is
strongly constrained, disfavoring a potential solution to the H0 problem in
this case. The scenario with self-interactions only among tau neutrinos is the
least constrained and can potentially be consistent with a solution to the H0
problem.

caused by exposure to solar proton events (SPEs) from solar flares for the
airline industry. We also evaluate associated health risks from radiation, to
provide relevant alternative ways to minimize economic loss and opportunity.
The estimated radiation dose induced by each SPE for the passengers of each
flight is calculated using ExoKyoto and PHITS. We determine a few scenarios for
the estimated dose limit at 1 and 20mSv, corresponding to the effective dose
limit for the general public and occupational exposure, respectively, as well
as a higher dose induced an extreme superflare. We set a hypothetical airline
shutdown scenario at 1mSv for a single flight per passenger, due to legal
restrictions under the potential radiation dose. In such a scenario, we
calculate the potential loss in direct and opportunity cost under the
cancelation of the flight. At the same time, we considered that, even under
such a scenario, if the airplane flies at a slightly lower altitude (from 12 to
9.5km: atmospheric depth from 234 to 365g/cm$^{2}$), the total loss becomes
much smaller than flight cancelation, and the estimated total dose goes down
from 1.2 to 0.45mSv, which is below the effective dose limit for the general
public. In case of flying at an even lower altitude (7km: atmospheric depth
484g/cm$^{2}$), the estimated total dose becomes much smaller, 0.12 mSv. If we
assume the increase of fuel cost is proportional to the increase in atmospheric
depth, the increase in cost becomes 1.56 and 2.07 for the case of flying at 9.5
km and at 7 km, respectively. Lower altitude flights provide more safety for
the potential risk of radiation doses induced by severe SPEs. At the same time,
since there is total loss caused by flight cancelation, we propose that
considering lower flight altitude is the best protection against solar flares.

environment/reservoir is consigned to a classical description. As a proof of
concept, we apply the method to continuous wave (CW) magnetic resonance. We
make use of a perturbation scheme we have termed ""affine commutation
perturbation"" (ACP). Unlike traditional perturbation methods, ACP has the
advantage of incorporating some effects of the perturbation even at the
zeroth-order approximation. Indeed, we concentrate here on the zeroth-order,
and show how -- even at this lowest order -- the ACP scheme can still yield
non-trivial and equally important results. In contradistinction to the purely
quantum Markovian master equations in the literature, we explicitly keep the
term linear in the system-environment interaction -- at all orders of the
perturbation. At the zeroth-order, we show that this results in a dynamics
whose map is non-CP (Completely Positive) but approaches asymptotically a CP
map as $t \to +\infty$. We also argue that this linear term accounts for the
linear response of the system to the presence of the environment -- thus the
harbinger for a linear response theory (LRT) within the confines of such
(semiclassical) Lindblad-like master equations. The adiabatic process limit of
the dynamics is also defined, and considerably explored in the context of CW
magnetic resonance. Here, the same linear term emerges as the preeminent link
between standard (adiabatic process) LRT (as formulated by Kubo and co.) and
Lindblad-like master equations. And with it, we show how simple stick-plot CW

it is attractive to have an adaptive operator selection (AOS) mechanism that
automatically chooses the most appropriate operator on the fly according to the
current status. This paper proposes a new AOS mechanism for multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). More specifically, the
AOS is formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem where the dynamic Thompson
sampling (DYTS) is applied to adapt the bandit learning model, originally
proposed with an assumption of a fixed award distribution, to a non-stationary
setup. In particular, each arm of our bandit learning model represents a
reproduction operator and is assigned with a prior reward distribution. The
parameters of these reward distributions will be progressively updated
according to the performance of its performance collected from the evolutionary
process. When generating an offspring, an operator is chosen by sampling from
those reward distribution according to the DYTS. Experimental results fully
demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed AOS mechanism
compared with other four state-of-the-art MOEA/D variants.

temporally-extended multi-phase plans is an essential step for the advancement
of robotics and model-based reinforcement learning. The core problem of
long-range planning is finding an efficient way to search through the tree of
possible action sequences. Existing non-learned planning solutions from the
Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) literature rely on the existence of logical
descriptions for the effects and preconditions for actions. This constraint
allows TAMP methods to efficiently reduce the tree search problem but limits
their ability to generalize to unseen and complex physical environments. In
contrast, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods use flexible
neural-network-based function approximators to discover policies that
generalize naturally to unseen circumstances. However, DRL methods struggle to
handle the very sparse reward landscapes inherent to long-range multi-step
planning situations. Here, we propose the Curious Sample Planner (CSP), which
fuses elements of TAMP and DRL by combining a curiosity-guided sampling
strategy with imitation learning to accelerate planning. We show that CSP can
efficiently discover interesting and complex temporally-extended plans for
solving a wide range of physically realistic 3D tasks. In contrast, standard
planning and learning methods often fail to solve these tasks at all or do so
only with a huge and highly variable number of training samples. We explore the
use of a variety of curiosity metrics with CSP and analyze the types of
solutions that CSP discovers. Finally, we show that CSP supports task transfer
so that the exploration policies learned during experience with one task can
help improve efficiency on related tasks.

online in this repository: https://github.com/mchatton/w2s-tensorflow. On test
images, the model shows a visually-convincing denoising and increases the
resolution by a factor of two compared to the input image. For a 512 $\times$
512 image, the inference takes less than 1 second on a Titan X GPU and about 15
seconds on a common CPU. We further present the results of different variations

Recently, the concept of variable impedance control (VIC) was adopted into RL
with encouraging results. However, the more important issue of stability
remains unaddressed. To clarify the challenge in stable RL, we introduce the
term all-the-time-stability that unambiguously means that every possible
rollout will be stability certified. Our contribution is a model-free RL method
that not only adopts VIC but also achieves all-the-time-stability. Building on
a recently proposed stable VIC controller as the policy parameterization, we
introduce a novel policy search algorithm that is inspired by Cross-Entropy
Method and inherently guarantees stability. Our experimental studies confirm
the feasibility and usefulness of stability guarantee and also features, to the
best of our knowledge, the first successful application of RL with
all-the-time-stability on the benchmark problem of peg-in-hole.

involvement? We show that this is partially possible in many cases due to
advances in software testing and the structure of P4 programs. Our insight is
that runtime verification can detect bugs, even those that are not detected at
compile-time, with machine learning-guided fuzzing. This enables a more
automated and real-time localization of bugs in P4 programs using software
testing techniques like Tarantula. Once the bug in a P4 program is localized,
the faulty code can be patched due to the programmable nature of P4. In
addition, platform-dependent bugs can be detected. From P4_14 to P4_16 (latest
version), our observation is that as the programmable blocks increase, the
patchability of P4 programs increases accordingly. To this end, we design,
develop, and evaluate P6 that (a) detects, (b) localizes, and (c) patches bugs
in P4 programs with minimal human interaction. P6 tests P4 switch
non-intrusively, i.e., requires no modification to the P4 program for detecting
and localizing bugs. We used a P6 prototype to detect and patch seven existing
bugs in eight publicly available P4 application programs deployed on two
different switch platforms: behavioral model (bmv2) and Tofino. Our evaluation
shows that P6 significantly outperforms bug detection baselines while
generating fewer packets and patches bugs in P4 programs such as switch.p4
without triggering any regressions.

of the parity-violating (PV) weak-interaction amplitudes between nucleons. In
this paper we describe the design, construction and operation of the n$^3$He
experiment that was used to measure the PV asymmetry $A_{\mathrm{PV}}$ in the
direction of proton emission in the reaction $\vec{\mathrm{n}} +
{^3}\mathrm{He} \rightarrow {^3}\mathrm{H} + \mathrm{p}$, using the capture of
polarized cold neutrons in an unpolarized gaseous $^3\mathrm{He}$ target. This
asymmetry has was recently calculated \cite{Viviani,Viviani2}, both in the
traditional style meson exchange picture, and in effective field theory (EFT),
including two-pion exchange. The high precision result (published separately)
obtained with the experiment described herein forms an important benchmark for
hadronic PV (HPV) theory in few-body systems, where precise calculations are
possible. To this day, HPV is still one of the most poorly understood aspects
of the electro-weak theory. The calculations estimate the size of the asymmetry
to be in the range of $(-9.4 \rightarrow 3.5)\times 10^{-8}$, depending on the
framework or model. The small size of the asymmetry and the small overall goal
uncertainty of the experiment of $\delta A_{\mathrm{PV}} \simeq 1\times10^{-8}$
places strict requirements on the experiment, especially on the design of the
target-detector chamber. In this paper we describe the experimental setup and
the measurement methodology as well as the detailed design of the chamber,
including results of Garfield++ and Geant4 simulations that form the basis of
the chamber design and analysis. We also show data from commissioning and
production and define the systematic errors that the chamber contributes to the

unlabeled observations coming from multiple linear regressions, and each
observation corresponds to exactly one of the regression models. The goal is to
learn the linear regressors from the observations. Classically, Alternating
Minimization (AM) (which is a variant of Expectation Maximization (EM)) is used
to solve this problem. AM iteratively alternates between the estimation of
labels and solving the regression problems with the estimated labels.
Empirically, it is observed that, for a large variety of non-convex problems
including mixed linear regression, AM converges at a much faster rate compared
to gradient based algorithms. However, the existing theory suggests similar
rate of convergence for AM and gradient based methods, failing to capture this
empirical behavior. In this paper, we close this gap between theory and
practice for the special case of a mixture of $2$ linear regressions. We show
that, provided initialized properly, AM enjoys a \emph{super-linear} rate of
convergence in certain parameter regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that theoretically establishes such rate for AM. Hence, if we
want to recover the unknown regressors upto an error (in $\ell_2$ norm) of
$\epsilon$, AM only takes $\mathcal{O}(\log \log (1/\epsilon))$ iterations.
Furthermore, we compare AM with a gradient based heuristic algorithm
empirically and show that AM dominates in iteration complexity as well as
wall-clock time.

the degree of the spline, $d_0$ is the order of differentiability at each inner

form $\lfloor{(d+1)/(d-d_0)\rfloor} + 1$, demonstrates the critical role of the
regularity parameter $d_0$ in the separation between a faster $\log \log(16n)$

to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of
respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral
outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the
infected population based on a reaction mechanism - the final equations of
which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the
pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound
physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision
rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In
the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for
disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation
time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally
crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the
experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of
pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model.
Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature

the droplet evaporation time determines the infection rate constant, ambient
temperature and relative humidity are shown to impact the outbreak growth
rates.

Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ content, proportion of CaSiO$_{3}$ and bridgmanite (so that the
proportion of ferropericlase is implicitly investigated), Fe$^{3+}$/$\sum$Fe
and temperature contrast between far-field mantle and LLSVPs. From the 81
millions cases studied, only 79000 cases explain the seismic observations.
Nevertheless, these successful cases involve a large range of parameters with,
for instance, FeO content between 12--25~wt\% and Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ content
between 3--17~wt\%. We then apply a principal component analysis (PCA) to these
cases and find two robust results: (i) the proportion of ferropericlase should
be low ($<$6vol\%); (ii) the formation of Fe$^{3+}$-bearing bridgmanite is much
more favored than other iron-bearing phases. Following these results, we
identify two end-member compositions, Bm-rich and CaPv-rich, and discuss their
characteristics. Finally, we discuss different scenarios for the formation of
LLSVPs and propose that investigating the mineral proportion produced by each
scenario is the best way to evaluate their relevance. For instance, the
solidification of a primitive magma ocean may produce FeO and Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$
content similar to those suggested by our analysis. However, the mineral
proportion of such reservoirs is not well-constrained and may contain a larger
proportion of ferropericlase than what is allowed by our results.

wh-questions that could not be answered ""yes/no."" Each subject selected vowels

sequential way, by using a ""yes/no"" communication aid based on near-infrared
light. Then, a caregiver entered the selected vowels into a dictionary with
vowel entries, which returned candidate words having those vowels. When there
were no appropriate words, the caregiver changed one vowel and searched again
or started over from the beginning. When an appropriate word was selected, it
was confirmed by the subject via ""yes/no"" answers. Three subjects expressed
""yes"" for the selected word at least six times out of eight (reliability of
91.0% by a statistical measure), one subject (in CLIS) did so five times out of
eight (74.6%), and one subject three times out of four (81.3%). We have thus

PermDNN eliminates the drawbacks of indexing overhead, non-heuristic
compression effects and time-consuming retraining. Compared with circulant

access to public data. In this problem, the goal is to answer a large class
$\mathcal{H}$ of statistical queries with error no more than $\alpha$ using a
combination of public and private samples. The algorithm is required to satisfy
differential privacy only with respect to the private samples. We study the
limits of this task in terms of the private and public sample complexities.
  First, we show that we can solve the problem for any query class
$\mathcal{H}$ of finite VC-dimension using only $d/\alpha$ public samples and
$\sqrt{p}d^{3/2}/\alpha^2$ private samples, where $d$ and $p$ are the
VC-dimension and dual VC-dimension of $\mathcal{H}$, respectively. In
comparison, with only private samples, this problem cannot be solved even for
simple query classes with VC-dimension one, and without any private samples, a
larger public sample of size $d/\alpha^2$ is needed. Next, we give sample
complexity lower bounds that exhibit tight dependence on $p$ and $\alpha$. For
the class of decision stumps, we give a lower bound of $\sqrt{p}/\alpha$ on the
private sample complexity whenever the public sample size is less than
$1/\alpha^2$. Given our upper bounds, this shows that the dependence on
$\sqrt{p}$ is necessary in the private sample complexity. We also give a lower
bound of $1/\alpha$ on the public sample complexity for a broad family of query
classes, which by our upper bound, is tight in $\alpha$.

Instance Learning, and in recent years methods started adopting Multiple
Instance Detection Networks (MIDN), which allows training in an end-to-end

pool of candidates and then aggregating other instances based on similarity. In
this work, we claim that carefully selecting the aggregation criteria can
considerably improve the accuracy of the learned detector. We start by
proposing an additional refinement step to an existing approach (OICR), which
we call refinement knowledge distillation. Then, we present an adaptive
supervision aggregation function that dynamically changes the aggregation
criteria for selecting boxes related to one of the ground-truth classes,

widely used in hyperspectral images (HSIs) denoising or completion. However,
the uncertainty quantification of the restored HSI has not been addressed to
date. Accurate uncertainty quantification of the denoised HSI facilitates to
applications such as multi-source or multi-scale data fusion, data
assimilation, and product uncertainty quantification, since these applications
require an accurate approach to describe the statistical distributions of the
input data. Therefore, we propose a prior-free closed-form element-wise
uncertainty quantification method for LRMA-based HSI restoration. Our
closed-form algorithm overcomes the difficulty of the HSI patch mixing problem
caused by the sliding-window strategy used in the conventional LRMA process.
The proposed approach only requires the uncertainty of the observed HSI and
provides the uncertainty result relatively rapidly and with similar
computational complexity as the LRMA technique. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the estimation accuracy of the proposed closed-form
uncertainty approach. The method is robust to at least 10% random impulse noise
at the cost of 10-20% of additional processing time compared to the LRMA. The
experiments indicate that the proposed closed-form uncertainty quantification
method is more applicable to real-world applications than the baseline Monte
Carlo test, which is computationally expensive. The code is available in the
attachment and will be released after the acceptance of this paper.

monolayers of the two-dimensional semiconducting channel(SC) for spintronics,
the two most important issues are to ensure the formation of variable low
resistive tunnel ferromagnetic contacts(FC), and to preserve intrinsic
properties of the SC during fabrication. Large Schottky barriers lead to the
formation of high resistive contacts and methods adopted to control the
barriers often alter the intrinsic properties of the SC. This work aims at
addressing both issues in fully encapsulated monolayer WSe$_2$ FETs by using
bi-layer h-BN as a tunnel barrier at the FC/SC interface. We investigate the
electrical transport in monolayer WSe$_2$ FETs with current-in-plane geometry
that yields hole mobilities $\sim$ 38.3 $cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$ at 240 K and
On/Off ratios of the order of 10$^7$, limited by the contact regions. We have
achieved ultralow effective Schottky barrier ($\sim$ 5.34 meV) with

the barrier heights are considerably higher. These observations provide an
insight into the electrical behavior of the FC/h-BN/SC/h-BN heterostructures

WSe$_2$-based spintronic devices.

or spin-flip (magnetic) disorders. We show that, in the presence of nonmagnetic
disorders, the QAHEs in both two systems become Anderson insulating as expected
when the disorder strength is large enough. However, in the presence of
spin-flip disorders, the localization mechanisms in these two host materials
are completely distinct. For the ferromagnetic bilayer graphene with Rashba
spin-orbit coupling, the QAHE with $\mathcal{C}=4$ firstly enters a
Berry-curvature mediated metallic phase, and then becomes localized to be
Anderson insulator along with the increasing of disorder strength. While in
magnetic topological insulator thin films, the QAHE with $\mathcal{C=N}$
firstly enters a Berry-curvature mediated metallic phase, then transitions to
another QAHE with ${\mathcal{C}}={\mathcal{N}}-1$ along with the increasing of
disorder strength, and is finally localized to the Anderson insulator after
${\mathcal{N}}-1$ cycling between the QAHE and metallic phases. For the unusual
findings in the latter system, by analyzing the Berry curvature evolution, it
is known that the phase transitions originate from the exchange of Berry
curvature carried by conduction (valence) bands. At the end, we provide a
phenomenological picture related to the topological charges to help understand
the underlying physical origins of the two different phase transition

quite complex as phenomena like separation and transition are often involved.
For a highly loadedT106A blade at a high incidence and relatively low Reynolds
number(25, 000 < Re < 1, 00, 000), separation-induced transition is observed on
the suction side of the blade, making it a challenging problem for model-based
simulations. In this work, computations for this flow are carried out using
RANS and hybrid LES/RANS approaches. The RANS simulations are performed with
six popular low- Re turbulence models. While turbulence models by themselves
fail to predict any separation on the T106A blade, the four-equation
Langtry-Menter transition model predicts a short separation bubble. The
characteristic of this bubble, however, is very different from what is observed
in experiments and DNS, and therefore transition is not accurately predicted.
An embedded hybrid LES/RANS approach, Limited numerical scales(LNS), with an
automatic switch to LES in sufficiently resolved grids, is then used for
predictions on the sameRANS grid. With the statistical turbulence on fine
grids, LES-like behavior of LNS results in an unphysical drop in Reynolds
stresses as the turbulent fluctuations are not appropriately represented on the
resolved scale. Therefore, the LNS results are very similar to those obtained
with turbulence models. However, when synthetic turbulence with correct
statistical characteristics is used to stimulate the large eddies in the
embedded LES zone, LNS is able to predict separation and recovers a solution
very close to DNS and experimental results.

sequential nature of assigning sampling probabilities to each row only after
the previous iteration is completed. Surprisingly, we show this is not the case

While modern cosmological simulations capture the leading structures within
galaxies, they struggle to provide sufficient resolution to study small-scale
stellar feedback, such as the detailed evolution of SN remnants. It is thus
common practice to assume subgrid models that are rarely extended to low
metallicities, and which routinely use the standard solar abundance pattern.
With the aid of 1-d hydrodynamical simulations, we extend these models to
consider low metallicities and non-solar abundance patterns as derived from
spectra of Milky Way stars. For that purpose, a simple, yet effective framework
has been developed to generate non-solar abundance pattern cooling functions.
We find that previous treatments markedly over-predict SN feedback at low
metallicities and show that non-negligible changes in the evolution of SN
remnants of up to $\approx 50\%$ in $cooling\; mass$ and $\approx 27\%$ in
$momentum\; injection\; from\; SN\; remnants$ arise from non-solar abundance
patterns. We use our simulations to quantify these results as a function of
metallicity and abundance pattern variations and present analytic formulae to
accurately describe the trends. These formulae have been designed to serve as
subgrid models for SN feedback in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.

detection, and sensor fusion. A key aspect of our work is coupling the
perception (OF: optical flow) and planning (VO) components for reliable
navigation. Overall, our OF-VO algorithm using learning-based perception and
model-based planning methods offers better performance than prior algorithms in
terms of navigation time and success rate of collision avoidance. Our method

  Applications to Additive Manufacturing",,,,,"stat.AP cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of video-imaging data for in-line process monitoring applications has
become more and more popular in the industry. In this framework,
spatio-temporal statistical process monitoring methods are needed to capture
the relevant information content and signal possible out-of-control states.
Video-imaging data are characterized by a spatio-temporal variability structure
that depends on the underlying phenomenon, and typical out-of-control patterns
are related to the events that are localized both in time and space. In this
paper, we propose an integrated spatio-temporal decomposition and regression
approach for anomaly detection in video-imaging data. Out-of-control events are
typically sparse spatially clustered and temporally consistent. Therefore, the
goal is to not only detect the anomaly as quickly as possible (""when"") but also
locate it (""where""). The proposed approach works by decomposing the original
spatio-temporal data into random natural events, sparse spatially clustered and
temporally consistent anomalous events, and random noise. Recursive estimation
procedures for spatio-temporal regression are presented to enable the real-time
implementation of the proposed methodology. Finally, a likelihood ratio test
procedure is proposed to detect when and where the hotspot happens. The
proposed approach was applied to the analysis of video-imaging data to detect
and locate local over-heating phenomena (""hotspots"") during the layer-wise
process in a metal additive manufacturing process.

  Conditions",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major goal of machine learning is to create techniques that abstract away
irrelevant information. The generalisation property of standard Learning
Classifier System (LCS) removes such information at the feature level but not
at the feature interaction level. Code Fragments (CFs), a form of tree-based
programs, introduced feature manipulation to discover important interactions,
but they often contain irrelevant information, which causes structural
inefficiency. XOF is a recently introduced LCS that uses CFs to encode building
blocks of knowledge about feature interaction. This paper aims to optimise the
structural efficiency of CFs in XOF. We propose two measures to improve
constructing CFs to achieve this goal. Firstly, a new CF-fitness update
estimates the applicability of CFs that also considers the structural
complexity. The second measure we can use is a niche-based method of generating
CFs. These approaches were tested on Even-parity and Hierarchical problems,
which require highly complex combinations of input features to capture the data
patterns. The results show that the proposed methods significantly increase the
structural efficiency of CFs, which is estimated by the rule ""generality rate"".
This results in faster learning performance in the Hierarchical Majority-on
problem. Furthermore, a user-set depth limit for CF generation is not needed as
the learning agent will not adopt higher-level CFs once optimal CFs are
constructed.

poroelastic media to the case where the input transient signal at a boundary is
generated by a multimodal spectrum. By adding harmonic and anharmonic modal
frequencies as perturbations to a fundamental mode we examine how such
multimodal signals affect the Lagrangian complexity of poroelastic flow. While
the results apply to all poroelastic media (industrial, biological and
geophysical), for concreteness we couch the discussion in terms of unpumped
coastal groundwater systems having a discharge boundary forced by tides.
Particular local regions of the conductivity field generate saddles that hold
up and braid (mix) trajectories, resulting in unexpected behaviours of
groundwater residence time distributions and topological mixing manifolds near
the tidal boundary. While increasing spectral complexity can reduce the
occurrence of periodic points, especially for anharmonic spectra with long
characteristic periods, other signatures of Lagrangian complexity persist. The
action of natural multimodal tidal signals on confined groundwater flow in
heterogeneous aquifers can induce exotic flow topologies and mixing effects
that are profoundly different to conventional concepts of groundwater discharge
processes. Taken together, our results imply that increasing spectral
complexity results in more complex Lagrangian structure in flows through
poroelastic media.

To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a sparse generalized

of multiview data with sparse structures. Moreover, the introduced sparsity
could be considered as Laplace prior on the canonical variates. Specifically,
we convert the GCCA into a linear system of equations and impose $\ell_1$

probability distributions for relational structures over domains of different
sizes. In most existing statistical relational learning (SRL) frameworks, these
models are not projective in the sense that the marginal of the distribution
for size-$n$ structures on induced sub-structures of size $k<n$ is equal to the
given distribution for size-$k$ structures. Projectivity is very beneficial in
that it directly enables lifted inference and statistically consistent learning
from sub-sampled relational structures. In earlier work some simple fragments
of SRL languages have been identified that represent projective models.
However, no complete characterization of, and representation framework for
projective models has been given. In this paper we fill this gap: exploiting
representation theorems for infinite exchangeable arrays we introduce a class
of directed graphical latent variable models that precisely correspond to the
class of projective relational models. As a by-product we also obtain a
characterization for when a given distribution over size-$k$ structures is the
statistical frequency distribution of size-$k$ sub-structures in much larger
size-$n$ structures. These results shed new light onto the old open problem of
how to apply Halpern et al.'s ""random worlds approach"" for probabilistic

component is caused by the bar of the Galaxy. Calculations based on our model
suggest that the torque experienced by the region around the Sun is $\approx
2400\, km^2 s^{-2}$ per solar mass. The mass estimate for the bar is $\sim
1.6\pm0.3\times10^{10} M_\odot$. Using greatly improved data from Gaia DR2, we
have computed the acceleration field to great accuracy by adapting the oPDF
method (Han et al. 2016) locally and used the phase space coordinates of $\sim
4\times10^5$ stars within a distance of 0.5 kpc from the Sun. In the orbital
arc method, the first step is to guess an acceleration field and then
reconstruct the stellar orbits using this acceleration for all the stars within
a specified region. Next, the stars are redistributed along orbits to check if
the overall phase space distribution has changed. We repeat this process until
we find an acceleration field that results in a new phase space distribution
that is the same as the one that we started with; we have then recovered the
true underlying acceleration.

the dark soliton is unstable in a regime of strong quantum fluctuations

position dependence of the dynamical stability gradually diminishes and
eventually vanishes as the strength of quantum fluctuations increases. This

severely affect the performance of face recognition systems, it still remains
an open research problem in face anti-spoofing. Recently, a multi-ethnic face
anti-spoofing dataset, CASIA-SURF CeFA, has been released with the goal of
measuring the ethnic bias. It is the largest up to date cross-ethnicity face
anti-spoofing dataset covering $3$ ethnicities, $3$ modalities, $1,607$
subjects, 2D plus 3D attack types, and the first dataset including explicit
ethnic labels among the recently released datasets for face anti-spoofing. We
organized the Chalearn Face Anti-spoofing Attack Detection Challenge which
consists of single-modal (e.g., RGB) and multi-modal (e.g., RGB, Depth,
Infrared (IR)) tracks around this novel resource to boost research aiming to
alleviate the ethnic bias. Both tracks have attracted $340$ teams in the
development stage, and finally 11 and 8 teams have submitted their codes in the
single-modal and multi-modal face anti-spoofing recognition challenges,

performances with simple network structure and high efficiency. However, they
are behind in accuracy comparing with recent segmentation-based text detectors.
In this work, we discover that one important reason to this case is that
regression-based methods usually utilize a fixed feature selection way, i.e.
selecting features in a single location or in neighbor regions, to predict
components of the bounding box, such as the distances to the boundaries or the
rotation angle. The features selected through this way sometimes are not the
best choices for predicting every component of a text bounding box and thus
degrade the accuracy performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Location-Aware feature Selection text detection Network (LASNet). LASNet
selects suitable features from different locations to separately predict the
five components of a bounding box and gets the final bounding box through the
combination of these components. Specifically, instead of using the
classification score map to select one feature for predicting the whole
bounding box as most of the existing methods did, the proposed LASNet first
learn five new confidence score maps to indicate the prediction accuracy of the
bounding box components, respectively. Then, a Location-Aware Feature Selection
mechanism (LAFS) is designed to weightily fuse the top-$K$ prediction results
for each component according to their confidence score, and to combine the all
five fused components into a final bounding box. As a result, LASNet predicts
the more accurate bounding boxes by using a learnable feature selection way.
The experimental results demonstrate that our LASNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance with single-model and single-scale testing, outperforming all
existing regression-based detectors.

which the carriers of quantum information are photons and the gates are optical
transformations. Classically optimizing these circuits is challenging due to
the infinite dimensionality of the photon number vector space that is
associated to each optical mode. Truncating the space dimension is unavoidable,
and it can lead to incorrect results if the gates populate photon number states
beyond the cutoff. To tackle this issue, we present an algorithm that is orders
of magnitude faster than the current state of the art, to recursively compute
the exact matrix elements of Gaussian operators and their gradient with respect
to a parametrization. These operators, when augmented with a non-Gaussian
transformation such as the Kerr gate, achieve universal quantum computation.
Our approach brings two advantages: first, by computing the matrix elements of
Gaussian operators directly, we don't need to construct them by combining
several other operators; second, we can use any variant of the gradient descent
algorithm by plugging our gradients into an automatic differentiation framework
such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Our results will find applications in quantum

communications and is a strong candidate for the next generation of

""practical imperfections"" in realistic sources, channels, and detectors (such

misalignment in the channels, or dark counts in detectors). Addressing such
practical imperfections is a crucial part of implementing QKD protocols with
good performance in reality. There are two highly important future directions
for QKD: (1) QKD over free space, which can allow secure communications between
mobile platforms such as handheld systems, drones, planes, and even satellites,
and (2) fibre-based QKD networks, which can simultaneously provide QKD service
to numerous users at arbitrary locations. These directions are both highly
promising, but so far they are limited by practical imperfections in the
channels and devices, which pose huge challenges and limit their performance.
In this thesis, we develop adaptive techniques with innovative protocol and
algorithm design, as well as novel techniques such as machine learning, to
address some of these key challenges, including (a) atmospheric turbulence in
channels for free-space QKD, (b) asymmetric losses in channels for QKD network,
and (c) efficient parameter optimization in real time, which is important for
both free-space QKD and QKD networks. We believe that this work will pave the

astronomical observations. Here we are investigating the origin of small scale

stratospheric temperature distribution. Its spectral shape does not match
concurrent solar activity, or solar EUV emission, whose impact on the
atmosphere is unequivocal. This behavior points at an additional energy source
of exosolar origin. A viable concept behind such observations is based on
possible gravitational focusing by the solar system towards the Earth of low
speed invisible matter. We denote generic constituents from the dark Universe
as invisible matter, in order to distinguish them from ordinary dark matter
candidates like axions or WIMPs, which cannot have any noticeable impact on the
stratosphere. The observed peaking planetary relations exclude on their own any
conventional explanation. Only a somehow strongly interacting invisible
streaming matter with the little screened upper stratosphere (noverhead about 1
gr/cm 2) can be behind the occasionally observed temperature increases. We also
estimate an associated energy deposition O(W/m 2), which is variable over the
11 years solar cycle. For the widely assumed picture of a quasi not interacting
dark Universe, this new exosolar energy is enormous. Since the atmosphere is
uninterruptedly monitored since decades, it can serve also parasitically as a
novel low threshold detector for the dark Universe, with built-in
spatiotemporal resolution and the solar system acting temporally as signal
amplifier. In future, analyzing more observations, for example, from the
anomalous ionosphere, or, the transient sudden stratospheric warmings, the
nature of the assumed invisible streams could be deciphered.

polarized quantities are peaked at certain values of chemical potential and

thermopower and the charge figure of merit behave non monotonically with $\eta$

cascade. Subsequently, the indirect pressure dependence of the gamma-ray flux
can be anticipated.
  We examine this aspect in detail by studying the gamma-ray counts detected by
the NaI (Tl) detector. The present study confirms that there is no correlation
between the atmospheric pressure and the total gamma-ray counts collected from
all energies. However, the scenario differs when the gamma-ray fluxes of
different energies are investigated separately. The gamma rays of energy below
$\sim$3 MeV are primarily due to the radioactivity originating from the ground,
whereas gamma rays above 3 MeV are mainly produced in the CR cascade. It is
observed that the counts of energy above 3 MeV are well anti-correlated with
the atmospheric pressure and hence need to be corrected. It is demonstrated
that applying the barometric correction formula successfully removes the
pressure dependence in the gamma-ray flux above 3 MeV. Therefore, we suggest
that the gamma-ray data above 3 MeV needs to be corrected for the local
atmospheric pressure variations.

with the use of a non-Hermitian quasiparticle Hamiltonian formalism. This
formalism reveals that spin-dependent scattering rates induce the spectrum
collapse of Landau levels, i.e., the disappearance of the energy gaps between
n-th and -n-th levels under a finite external magnetic field. The spectrum
collapse occurs in both weak and strong magnetic field regimes, thus showing a
reentrant behavior. Particularly, in the strong magnetic field regime, in
contrast to naive expectation, the increase of a magnetic field stabilizes the
spectrum collapse of Dirac Landau levels. Furthermore, it is revealed that the
spectrum collapse is associated with the emergence of a vortex texture with a
topological winding number of a complex energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian

of cryptographic algorithms. State-of-the-art techniques such as template
attacks and stochastic models usually require a lot of manual preprocessing and
feature extraction by the attacker. Deep Learning (DL) methods have been
introduced to simplify SCAs and simultaneously lowering the amount of required
side-channel traces for a successful attack. However, the general success of DL
is largely driven by their capability to classify images, a field in which they
easily outperform humans. In this paper, we present a novel technique to
interpret 1D traces as 2D images. We show and compare several techniques to
transform power traces into images, and apply these on different
implementations of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). By allowing the
neural network to interpret the trace as an image, we are able to significantly
reduce the number of required attack traces for a correct key guess.We also
demonstrate that the attack efficiency can be improved by using multiple 2D
images in the depth channel as an input. Furthermore, by applying image-based
data augmentation, we show how the number of profiling traces is reduced by a
factor of 50 while simultaneously enhancing the attack performance. This is a
crucial improvement, as the amount of traces that can be recorded by an
attacker is often very limited in real-life applications.

incorporated to improve the search space exploration capability of GP. In this
paper, we propose a semantically-oriented mutation operator (SOMO) suitable for
the evolutionary design of combinational circuits. SOMO uses semantics to
determine the best value for each mutated gene. Compared to the common CGP and
its variants as well as the recent versions of Semantic GP, the proposed method
converges on common Boolean benchmarks substantially faster while keeping the

$X$ and $Y$ is quasi norm attaining if there is a sequence $(x_n)$ of norm one
elements in $X$ such that $(Tx_n)$ converges to some $u\in Y$ with
$\|u\|=\|T\|$. Norm attaining operators in the usual sense (i.e.\ operators for
which there is a point in the unit ball where the norm of its image equals the
norm of the operator) and compact operators satisfy this definition. The main
result of the paper is that strong Radon-Nikod\'ym operators such as weakly
compact operators can be approximated by quasi norm attaining operators (even
by a stronger version of the definition), which does not hold for norm
attaining operators. This allows us to give characterizations of the
Radon-Nikod\'ym property in term of the denseness of quasi norm attaining
operators for both domain spaces and range spaces, extending previous results
by Bourgain and Huff. We also present positive and negative results on the
denseness of quasi norm attaining operators, characterize both finite

discuss conditions to obtain that quasi norm attaining operators are actually

as following. Chiral interactions are unable to generate large enough $\Delta

$\Delta a_e$ and $\Delta a_\mu$ can be generated from non-chiral interactions,
but they are not contributed from the same source. The upper limit of $\mu\to

contributions in $\mu\to e$ transitions, but the situation may change in
considering future experimental sensitivities. The $Z$-penguin diagrams can
constrain chiral interaction better than photonic penguin diagrams in $\mu\to
e$ transitions. In most of the parameter space, box contributions to $\mu\to
3e$ decay are subleading. In $\tau\to e$ $(\mu)$ transitions, the present
$\tau\to e\gamma$ $(\mu \gamma)$ upper limit constrains the photonic penguin
contribution better than the $\tau\to 3 e$ $(3\mu)$ upper limit, and
$Z$-penguin amplitudes constrain chiral interaction better than photonic
penguin amplitudes. Box contributions to $\tau\to 3e$ and $\tau\to 3\mu$ decays
can sometime be comparable to $Z$-penguin contributions. The $\tau^-\to e^-

contemporary and challenging questions in applied mathematics. In this paper we
are interested in the question of spreading for a reaction-diffusion equation

at a given speed $c$. This problem arises in particular in the modelling of the
impact of climate change on population dynamics. By placing ourselves in the
appropriate moving frame, this leads us to consider a
reaction-diffusion-advection equation with a heterogeneous in space reaction
term, in dimension $N\geq1$. We investigate the behaviour of the solution $u$
depending on the value of the advection constant~$c$, which typically stands
for the velocity of climate change. We find that, when the initial datum is
compactly supported, there exists precisely three ranges for $c$ leading to
drastically different situations. In the lower speed range the solution always
spreads, while in the upper range it always vanishes. More surprisingly, we
find that that both spreading and vanishing may occur in an intermediate speed
range. The threshold between those two outcomes is always sharp, both with
respect to $c$ and to the initial condition. We also briefly consider the case

from of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples. Using the BOLD framework,
the programs can be automatically instrumented by using declarative

store the execution trace of the program also as RDF triples called
\textit{trace triples}. These triples can be queried to implement the common
debug operations. The novelty of the framework is to abstract these triples as
\textit{spans} for high-level reasoning. A span gives a way of examining the
values of a particular variable over certain portion of the program execution.
The properties of the spans are defined formally as a Web Ontology Language
(OWL) ontology called \textit{Program Debug (PD) Ontology}. Using the span
abstraction and PD ontology, end-users can debug a given buggy program in a
standard manner. A notable feature of using ontology is that users can
accurately debug in some cases of missing information, which can be practically
useful. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, we have
debugged the programs in a standard bug benchmark suite Software-artifact
Infrastructure Repository (SIR). Experiments show that the querying time is
almost the same as in \texttt{gdb}. The reasoning time depends on the
sub-language of OWL. We find that the expressibility offered by OWL-DL language
is sufficient for the bugs in SIR programs; but to achieve scalability in

even number of sites. The ground-state phase diagram depends sensitively on the
symmetry of the model. Charge-conjugation (particle-hole) symmetry is conserved
if hopping is only allowed between the two sublattices of even and odd sites.
In this case (of BDI symmetry) we find a variety of topologically non-trivial
phases, characterized by different numbers of edge states (or, equivalently,
different quantized Zak phases). The transitions between these phases are
clearly signalled by the entanglement entropy. Charge-conjugation symmetry is
broken if hopping within the sublattices is admitted (driving the system into
the AI symmetry class). We study specifically next-nearest-neighbor hopping
with amplitudes $t_a$ and $t_b$ for the $A$ and $B$ sublattices, respectively.
For $t_a=t_b$ parity is conserved, and also the quantized Zak phases remain
unchanged in the gapped regions of the phase diagram. However, metallic patches
appear due to the overlap between conduction and valence bands in some regions
of parameter space. The case of alternating next-nearest neighbor hopping,
$t_a=-t_b$, is also remarkable, as it breaks both charge-conjugation $C$ and
parity $P$ but conserves the product $CP$. Both the Zak phase and the
entanglement spectrum still provide relevant information, in particular about
the broken parity. Thus the Zak phase for small values of $t_a$ measures the
disparity between bond strengths on $A$ and $B$ sublattices, in close analogy
to the proportionality between the Zak phase and the polarization in the case
of the related Aubry-Andr\'e model.

for liquid $^4$He using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In recent years,
several studies have combined the vortex filament model (VFM), which describes
quantized vortices in superfluid components, with the Navier-Stokes equations,
which describe the motion of normal fluids. These studies led us to assume that
coupling both components of the two-fluid model instead of using the VFM to
describe the superfluid component enables us to approximate the system. In this
study, we formulated a new SPH model that simultaneously solves both equations
of motion of the two-fluid model. We then performed a numerical simulation of
the rotating liquid $^4$He using our SPH. The results showed that the two major
phenomena, the emergence of multiple independent vortices parallel to the
circular axis and that of the so-called rigid-body rotation, can be reproduced
by solving the two-fluid model using SPH. This finding is interesting because
it was previously assumed that only a single vortex emerges when addressing
similar problems without considering quantum mechanics. Our further analysis
found that the emergence of multiple independent vortices can be realized by
reformulating the viscosity term of the two-fluid model to conserve the angular
momentum of the particles around their axes. Consequently, our model succeeded
in reproducing the phenomena observed in quantum cases, even though we solve
the phenomenological governing equations of liquid $^4$He.

at a generic sublinear rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$, and it (or its variants)
enjoys accelerated convergence rates for two fundamental classes of
constraints: polytopes and strongly-convex sets. Uniformly convex sets
non-trivially subsume strongly convex sets and form a large variety of
\textit{curved} convex sets commonly encountered in machine learning and signal
processing. For instance, the $\ell_p$-balls are uniformly convex for all $p >

systematically induce accelerated convergence rates for the original

accelerated convergence rates when the set is only locally uniformly convex and

Guralnick and Kantor resolved a 1962 question of Steinberg by proving that in a
finite simple group every nontrivial element belongs to a generating pair.
Groups with this property are said to be $\frac{3}{2}$-generated.
  Which finite groups are $\frac{3}{2}$-generated? Every proper quotient of a
$\frac{3}{2}$-generated group is cyclic, and in 2008, Breuer, Guralnick and
Kantor made the striking conjecture that this condition alone provides a
complete characterisation of the finite groups with this property. This
conjecture has recently been reduced to the almost simple groups and results of
Piccard (1939) and Woldar (1994) show that the conjecture is true for almost
simple groups whose socles are alternating or sporadic groups. Therefore, the
central focus is now on the almost simple groups of Lie type.
  In this monograph we prove a strong version of this conjecture for almost
simple classical groups, building on earlier work of Burness and Guest (2013)
and the author (2017). More precisely, we show that every relevant almost
simple classical group has uniform spread at least two, unless it is isomorphic
to the symmetric group of degree six. We also prove that the uniform spread of
these groups tends to infinity if the size of the underlying field tends to
infinity.
  To prove these results, we are guided by a probabilistic approach introduced
by Guralnick and Kantor. This requires a detailed analysis of automorphisms,
fixed point ratios and subgroup structure of almost simple classical groups, so
the first half of this monograph is dedicated to these general topics. In
particular, we give a general exposition of the useful technique of Shintani
descent, which plays an important role throughout.

constrained determination made remotely, i.e. the carbon abundance measurement,

close to two orders of magnitude above that of the protosolar nebula. In the
framework of the core accretion model, only the delivery of volatiles in solid
forms (amorphous ice, clathrates, pure condensates) to these planets can
account for the apparent supersolar metallicity of their envelopes. In
contrast, because of the inward drift of icy particles through various
snowlines, all mechanisms invoking the delivery of volatiles in vapor forms
predict subsolar abundances in the envelopes of Uranus and Neptune.
Alternatively, even if the disk instability mechanism remains questionable in
our solar system, it might be consistent with the supersolar metallicities
observed in Uranus and Neptune, assuming the two planets suffered subsequent
erosion of their H-He envelopes. The enrichment patterns derived for each
delivery scenario considered should be useful to interpret future in situ
measurements by atmospheric entry probes.

destination node (DN), and FD-UAV relay to overcome the high path loss of
mmWave channels and to help mitigate the self-interference at the FD-UAV relay.
Specifically, we formulate a problem for maximization of the achievable rate
from the SN to the DN, where the UAV position, analog beamforming, and power
control are jointly optimized. Since the problem is highly non-convex and
involves high-dimensional, highly coupled variable vectors, we first obtain the
conditional optimal position of the FD-UAV relay for maximization of an
approximate upper bound on the achievable rate in closed form, under the
assumption of a line-of-sight (LoS) environment and ideal beamforming. Then,
the UAV is deployed to the position which is closest to the conditional optimal
position and yields LoS paths for both air-to-ground links. Subsequently, we
propose an alternating interference suppression (AIS) algorithm for the joint
design of the beamforming vectors and the power control variables. In each
iteration, the beamforming vectors are optimized for maximization of the
beamforming gains of the target signals and the successive reduction of the
interference, where the optimal power control variables are obtained in closed

AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is the most prevalent hardware-based
full memory encryption for VMs. Its newest extension, SEV-ES, also protects the
entire VM state during context switches, aiming to ensure that the host neither
learns anything about the data that is processed inside the VM, nor is able to
modify its execution state. Several previous works have analyzed the security
of SEV and have shown that, by controlling I/O, it is possible to exfiltrate
data or even gain control over the VM's execution. In this work, we introduce
two new methods that allow us to inject arbitrary code into SEV-ES secured
virtual machines. Due to the lack of proper integrity protection, it is
sufficient to reuse existing ciphertext to build a high-speed encryption
oracle. As a result, our attack no longer depends on control over the I/O,
which is needed by prior attacks. As I/O manipulation is highly detectable, our
attacks are stealthier. In addition, we reverse-engineer the previously

performance, less focus is put on training methods aiming at robustness towards
varying noise conditions or directed attacks by adversarial examples. In this
paper, we propose to improve robustness by a multi-task training, which extends
supervised semantic segmentation by a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation on unlabeled videos. This additional task is only performed during
training to improve the semantic segmentation model's robustness at test time
under several input perturbations. Moreover, we even find that our joint
training approach also improves the performance of the model on the original
(supervised) semantic segmentation task. Our evaluation exhibits a particular
novelty in that it allows to mutually compare the effect of input noises and
adversarial attacks on the robustness of the semantic segmentation. We show the
effectiveness of our method on the Cityscapes dataset, where our multi-task
training approach consistently outperforms the single-task semantic
segmentation baseline in terms of both robustness vs. noise and in terms of
adversarial attacks, without the need for depth labels in training.

particle pairs $h^{+}h^{-}$ ($h = \pi, K, p$) with the STAR detector at RHIC in
proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV. The charged particle pairs
produced in the reaction $pp\to p^\prime+h^{+}h^{-}+p^\prime$ are reconstructed
from the tracks in the central detector, while the forward-scattered protons
are measured in the Roman Pot system. Differential cross sections are measured
in the fiducial region, which roughly corresponds to the square of the
four-momentum transfers at the proton vertices in the range $0.04~\mbox{GeV}^2
< -t_1 , -t_2 < 0.2~\mbox{GeV}^2$, invariant masses of the charged particle
pairs up to a few GeV and pseudorapidities of the centrally-produced hadrons in
the range $|\eta|<0.7$. The measured cross sections are compared to
phenomenological predictions based on the Double Pomeron Exchange (DPE) model.
Structures observed in the mass spectra of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $K^{+}K^{-}$
pairs are consistent with the DPE model, while angular distributions of pions
suggest a dominant spin-0 contribution to $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ production. The
fiducial $\pi^+\pi^-$ cross section is extrapolated to the Lorentz-invariant
region, which allows decomposition of the invariant mass spectrum into
continuum and resonant contributions. The extrapolated cross section is well
described by the continuum production and at least three resonances, the
$f_0(980)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $f_0(1500)$, with a possible small contribution
from the $f_0(1370)$. Fits to the extrapolated differential cross section as a
function of $t_1$ and $t_2$ enable extraction of the exponential slope
parameters in several bins of the invariant mass of $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs. These
parameters are sensitive to the size of the interaction region.

mitigating trade-offs, such as the reduction of the associativity of memory

store and retrieve information covering several domains has increased. However,
very few ontologies are able to cope with the ever-growing need of frequently
updated semantic information or specific user requirements in specialized
domains. As a result, a critical issue is related to the unavailability of
relational information between concepts, also coined missing background
knowledge. One solution to address this issue relies on the manual enrichment
of ontologies by domain experts which is however a time consuming and costly
process, hence the need for dynamic ontology enrichment. In this paper we
present an automatic coupled statistical/semantic framework for dynamically
enriching large-scale generic ontologies from the World Wide Web. Using the
massive amount of information encoded in texts on the Web as a corpus, missing
background knowledge can therefore be discovered through a combination of
semantic relatedness measures and pattern acquisition techniques and
subsequently exploited. The benefits of our approach are: (i) proposing the
dynamic enrichment of large-scale generic ontologies with missing background
knowledge, and thus, enabling the reuse of such knowledge, (ii) dealing with
the issue of costly ontological manual enrichment by domain experts.
Experimental results in a precision-based evaluation setting demonstrate the

accurate identification of main query concepts to ensure the intended search

motion of the heavy quark with respect to the direction of the magnetic field,
five momentum diffusion coefficients of heavy quark have been estimated in the
magnetized thermal medium. Specifically, we have focussed our attention to
temperature range and strength of magnetic field satisfying the condition,
$\it{i.e.}$ $M\gg\sqrt{eB}\gg T$, $M$ being the mass of heavy quark. The light
quarks/antiquarks follow $1+1-$dimensional lowest Landau level (LLL)
kinematics, and heavy quark dynamics are not directly affected by the magnetic
field in the medium. The thermal gluon contribution to the diffusion
coefficient is proportions to $T^3$, whereas, the contribution of light quarks
in the lowest Landau state to the same is seen to be proportional to $T|eB|$.
Furthermore, it is observed that for the case of heavy quark motion parallel to
the magnetic field, the component of diffusion coefficient transverse both to
the field and the heavy quark velocity $(\kappa^{\parallel}_{TT})$ turns out to
be dominant as compared to the component longitudinal to both the field and
motion $(\kappa^{\parallel}_{LL})$, $i.e.$, $\kappa^{\parallel}_{TT}\gg

perpendicular to the magnetic field, it is seen that the diffusion coefficients

the laboratory frame for 1D systems, where $q$ is the relative momentum. This
tail can be observed through time-of-flight measurement as a direct
manifestation of the SOC effects on the many-body level. Besides the
traditional 1D even-wave scattering length, we find that two new physical
quantities must be introduced due to the SOC. Consequently, two new adiabatic
energy relations with respect to the two SOC parameters are obtained.
Furthermore, we derive the pressure relation and virial theorem at short

SOC should be much smaller than the corresponding strength scale of the
interatomic interactions. In addition, by using the operator product expansion
method, we derive the asymptotic behavior of the large-momentum distribution

the off-diagonal term is beyond the subleading term and is corrected by the SOC

perturb Hamiltoni-ans by adding potentials (functions depending only on the
base point). This led to the definition of Ma{\~n}{\'e} genericity: a property
is generic if, given a Hamiltonian H, the set of potentials u such that H + u
satisfies the property is generic. This notion is mostly used in the context of
Hamiltonians which are convex in p, in the sense that $\partial$ 2 pp H is
positive definite at each points. We will also restrict our study to this
situation. There is a close relation between perturbations of Hamiltonians by a
small additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one.
Indeed, the Hamiltonians H + u and H/(1 -- u) have the same level one energy
surface, hence their dynamics on this energy surface are reparametrisation of
each other, this is the Maupertuis principle. This remark is particularly
relevant when H is homogeneous in the fibers (which corresponds to Finsler
metrics) or even fiberwise quadratic (which corresponds to Riemannian metrics).
In these cases, perturbations by potentials of the Hamiltonian correspond, up
to parametrisation, to conformal perturbations of the metric. One of the widely
studied aspects is to understand to what extent the return map associated to a
periodic orbit can be perturbed by adding a small potential. This kind of
question depend strongly on the context in which they are posed. Some of the
most studied contexts are, in increasing order of difficulty, perturbations of
general vector fields, perturbations of Hamiltonian systems inside the class of
Hamiltonian systems, perturbations of Riemannian metrics inside the class of
Riemannian metrics, Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians. It is
for example well-known that each vector field can be perturbed to a vector
field with only hyperbolic periodic orbits, this is part of the Kupka-Smale
theorem, see [5, 13]. There is no such result in the context of Hamiltonian
vector fields, but it remains true that each Hamiltonian can be perturbed to a
Hamiltonian with only non-degenerate periodic orbits (including the iterated
ones), see [11, 12]. The same result is true in the context of Riemannian
metrics: every Riemannian metric can be perturbed to a Riemannian metric with
only non-degenerate closed geodesics, this is the bumpy metric theorem, see [4,
2, 1]. The question was investigated only much more recently in the context of
Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians, see [9, 10]. It is proved in
[10] that the same result holds : If H is a convex Hamiltonian and a is a
regular value of H, then there exist arbitrarily small potentials u such that
all periodic orbits (including iterated ones) of H + u at energy a are
non-degenerate. The proof given in [10] is actually rather similar to the ones
given in papers on the perturbations of Riemannian metrics. In all these
proofs, it is very useful to work

radio galaxy NGC 6251. This paper presents the most sensitive and
highest-resolution images of NGC 6251 at these frequencies to date, revealing
for the first time a low-surface-brightness extension to the northern lobe, and
a possible backflow associated with the southern lobe. The integrated spectra
of components of NGC 6251 are consistent with previous measurements at higher
frequencies, similar to results from other LOFAR studies of nearby radio
galaxies. We find the outer structures of NGC 6251 to be either at
equipartition or slightly electron dominated, similar to those of FRII sources
rather than FRIs; but this conclusion remains tentative because of
uncertainties associated with the geometry and the extrapolation of X-ray
measurements to determine the external pressure distribution on the scale of
the outer lobes. We place lower limits on the ages of the extension of the
northern lobe and the backflow of the southern lobe of $t \gtrsim 250$ Myr and
$t \gtrsim 210$ Myr respectively. We present the first detection of
polarisation at 150 MHz in NGC 6251. Taking advantage of the high Faraday
resolution of LOFAR, we place an upper limit on the magnetic field in the group
of $B < 0.2 (\Lambda_B / 10 {\rm kpc})^{-0.5} \mu$G for a coherence scale of
$\Lambda_B < 60 {\rm kpc}$ and $B < 13 \mu$G for $\Lambda_B = 240$ kpc.

the interstellar extinction towards the source and characteristic color
temperatures of the accretion disk. We show that various spectral states of
regular outbursts occupy similar regions on the color-magnitude diagrams, and
that transitions between the states proceed along the same tracks despite
substantial differences in the observed light curves morphology. We determine
the typical duration of the hard-to-soft and soft-to-hard state transitions and
the hard state at the decaying stage of the outburst to be one, two and four
weeks, respectively. We find that the failed outbursts cannot be easily
distinguished from the regular ones at their early stages, but if the source
reaches 16 mag in $V$-band, it will transit to the soft state. By subtracting
the contribution of the accretion disk, we obtain the spectra of the
non-thermal component, which have constant, nearly flat shape during the
transitions between the hard and soft states. In contrast to the slowly
evolving non-thermal component seen at optical and near-infrared wavelengths,
the mid-infrared spectrum is strongly variable on short timescales and

properties of magnetic materials, grounded on the identification of the
relevant underlying magnetic interactions. The huge development in the field of
magnetic skyrmions and other noncollinear magnetic structures is largely due to
our understanding of the chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Recently,
various works have proposed new types of chiral interactions, with seemingly
different forms, but the big picture is still missing. Here, we present a
systematic construction of a generalized spin model containing isotropic and
chiral multi-site interactions. These are motivated by a microscopic model that
incorporates local spin moments and the spin-orbit interaction, and their
symmetry properties are established. We show that the chiral interactions arise
solely from the spin-orbit interaction and that the multi-site interactions do
not have to follow Moriya's rules, unlike the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and chiral
biquadratic interactions. The chiral multi-site interactions do not vanish due
to inversion symmetry, and comply with a generalized Moriya rule: If all sites
connected by the interaction lie in the same mirror plane, the chiral
interaction vector must be perpendicular to this plane. We then illustrate our
theoretical considerations with density functional theory calculations for
prototypical magnetic systems. These are triangular trimers built out of Cr,
Mn, Fe and Co adatoms on the Re(0001), Pt(111) and Au(111) surfaces, for which
$C_\mathrm{3v}$ symmetry applies, and Cr and Fe square tetramers on Pt(001)
with $C_\mathrm{4v}$ symmetry. The multi-site interactions are substantial in
magnitude and cannot be neglected when comparing the energy of different
magnetic structures. Finally, we discuss the recent literature in light of our
findings, and clarify several unclear or confusing points.

from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, they are
widely seen as uninterpretable ""black boxes"", as it can be difficult to
discover what input information is used by the DNN in the process, something
important in both cognitive neuroscience and clinical applications. A saliency
map is a common approach for producing interpretable visualizations of the
relative importance of input features for a prediction. However, methods for
creating maps often fail due to DNNs being sensitive to input noise, or by
focusing too much on the input and too little on the model. It is also
challenging to evaluate how well saliency maps correspond to the truly relevant
input information, as ground truth is not always available. In this paper, we
review a variety of methods for producing gradient-based saliency maps, and
present a new adversarial training method we developed to make DNNs robust to
input noise, with the goal of improving interpretability. We introduce two
quantitative evaluation procedures for saliency map methods in fMRI, applicable
whenever a DNN or linear model is being trained to decode some information from
imaging data. We evaluate the procedures using a synthetic dataset where the
complex activation structure is known, and on saliency maps produced for DNN
and linear models for task decoding in the Human Connectome Project (HCP)
dataset. Our key finding is that saliency maps produced with different methods
vary widely in interpretability, in both in synthetic and HCP fMRI data.
Strikingly, even when DNN and linear models decode at comparable levels of
performance, DNN saliency maps score higher on interpretability than linear
model saliency maps (derived via weights or gradient). Finally, saliency maps
produced with our adversarial training method outperform those from other
methods.

parallel evolution experiment with two Bacillus subtilis lineages of 7%
sequence divergence. We observe rapid evolution of hybrid organisms: gene
transfer swaps ~12% of the core genome in just 200 generations, and 60% of core
genes are replaced in at least one population. By genomics, transcriptomics,
fitness assays, and statistical modeling, we show that transfer generates
adaptive evolution and functional alterations in hybrids. Specifically, our
experiments reveal a strong, repeatable fitness increase of evolved populations
in the stationary growth phase. By genomic analysis of the transfer statistics
across replicate populations, we infer that selection on HGT has a broad
genetic basis: 40% of the observed transfers are adaptive. At the level of
functional gene networks, we find signatures of negative and positive
selection, consistent with hybrid incompatibilities and adaptive evolution of
network functions. Our results suggest that gene transfer navigates a complex
cross-lineage fitness landscape, bridging epistatic barriers along multiple
high-fitness paths.

emerging wireless applications such as allowing spectrum regulatory agencies to
enforce their access policies and enabling network administrators to control
access and prevent impersonation attacks to their wireless networks. Leveraging
spectrum distortions of transmitted RF signals, caused by transceiver hardware
impairments created during manufacture and assembly stages, to provide device
classification has been the focus of many recent works. These prior works
essentially apply deep learning to extract features of the devices from their
hardware-impaired signals and rely on feature variations across the devices to
distinguish devices from one another. As technology advances, the manufacturing
impairment variations across devices are becoming extremely insignificant,
making these prior classification approaches inaccurate. This paper proposes a
novel, deep learning-based technique that provides scalable and highly accurate
classification of wireless devices, even when the devices exhibit insignificant
variation across their hardware impairments and have the same hardware,
protocol, and software configurations. The novelty of the proposed technique
lies in leveraging both the {\em in-band} and {\em out-of-band} signal
distortion information by oversampling the captured signals at the receiver and
feeding IQ samples collected from the RF signals to a deep neural network for
classification. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we show that
our proposed technique, when applied to high-end, high-performance devices with
minimally distorted hardware, doubles the device classification accuracy when

holonomic quantum gates on superconducting circuits with experimentally
demonstrated techniques, which can remove the two main challenges by
introducing the time-optimal control into the construction of quantum gates.
Remarkably, our scheme is also based on a decoherence-free subspace encoding,
with minimal physical qubit resource, which can further immune to error caused
by qubit-frequency drift, which is regarded as the main error source for large
scale superconducting circuits. Meanwhile, we deliberately design the quantum
evolution to eliminate gate error caused by unwanted leakage sources.
Therefore, our scheme is more robust than the conventional ones, and thus
provides a promising alternative strategy for scalable fault-tolerant quantum
computation.

of things (IoT) systems. Timely status updates are essential for many IoT
applications; however, they are subject to strict constraints related on the
available energy and unreliability of underlying information sources. Hence,
the scheduling of status updates must be carefully planned to preserve energy,
but at the same time, it may happen that when a status update is needed, there
is no reliable up-to-date information content to refresh. As a solution to
overcome these unpredictabilities, one can employ multiple sources that track
the same signal of interest, but with different energy costs and reliabilities,
which we call information source diversity. We consider an energy-harvesting
monitoring node equipped with a finite-size battery and collecting status
updates from multiple heterogeneous information sources. We investigate the
policies that minimize the average AoI, and evaluate the role of information
source diversity on the system performance. To do so, we formulate the problem
as a Markov decision process (MDP). The optimal policy represents the
scheduling of actions, such as an update from one of the sources or remaining
idle, based on the current energy level and the AoI at the monitoring node. We
analyze the structure of the optimal solution for different cost/AoI
distribution combinations, and compare the performance of the optimal policy
with an aggressive strategy that transmits whenever possible.

Although adding beam search to the ACO heuristic search process is effective,
it also increases the amount of work (in terms of partial paths) done by the

that uses a greedy path selection heuristic. The exploitation of the greedy
path selection is offset by the exploration required in maintaining the beam of

to parallelize. Our experiments demonstrate that not only is our greedy
Beam-ACO (gBeam-ACO) faster than traditional Beam-ACO, in some cases by an
order of magnitude, but it does not sacrifice quality of the found solution,

that a plasmonic bubble during its shrinkage undergoes two different phases:
first, a rapid partial bubble shrinkage governed by vapor condensation and,
second, a slow diffusion-controlled bubble dissolution. The history of the
bubble formation plays an important role in the shrinkage dynamics during the
first phase, as it determines the gas-vapor ratio in the bubble composition.
Higher laser powers lead to more vaporous bubbles, while longer pulses and
higher dissolved air concentrations lead to more gaseous bubbles. The dynamics
of the second phase barely depends on the history of bubble formation, i.e.
laser power and pulse duration, but strongly on the dissolved air
concentration, which defines the concentration gradient at the bubble
interface. Finally, for the bubble dissolution in the second phase, with
decreasing dissolved air concentration, we observe a gradual transition from a
$R(t) \propto (t_0 - t) ^{1/3}$ scaling law to a $R(t) \propto (t_0 - t)
^{1/2}$ scaling law, where $t_0$ is the lifetime of the bubble and

The body of work on random features has grown rapidly, and hence it is
desirable to have a comprehensive overview on this topic explaining the
connections among various algorithms and theoretical results. In this survey,
we systematically review the work on random features from the past ten years.
First, the motivations, characteristics and contributions of representative
random features based algorithms are summarized according to their sampling
schemes, learning procedures, variance reduction properties and how they
exploit training data. Second, we review theoretical results that center around
the following key question: how many random features are needed to ensure a
high approximation quality or no loss in the empirical/expected risks of the
learned estimator. Third, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of popular
random features based algorithms on several large-scale benchmark datasets and
discuss their approximation quality and prediction performance for
classification. Last, we discuss the relationship between random features and
modern over-parameterized deep neural networks (DNNs), including the use of
high dimensional random features in the analysis of DNNs as well as the gaps
between current theoretical and empirical results. This survey may serve as a
gentle introduction to this topic, and as a users' guide for practitioners
interested in applying the representative algorithms and understanding
theoretical results under various technical assumptions. We hope that this
survey will facilitate discussion on the open problems in this topic, and more
importantly, shed light on future research directions.

investigated. The goal of this community is to find the best pro and con
arguments for a user given topic either to form an opinion for oneself, or to
persuade others to adopt a certain standpoint. While existing argument mining
methods can find appropriate arguments for a topic, a correct classification
into pro and con is not yet reliable. The same side stance classification task
provides a dataset of argument pairs classified by whether or not both
arguments share the same stance and does not need to distinguish between
topic-specific pro and con vocabulary but only the argument similarity within a
stance needs to be assessed. The results of our contribution to the task are
build on a setup based on the BERT architecture. We fine-tuned a pre-trained
BERT model for three epochs and used the first 512 tokens of each argument to
predict if two arguments share the same stance.

optimization problem. Our approach not only returns a diverse set of
counterfactuals with different trade-offs between the proposed objectives, but
also maintains diversity in feature space. This enables a more detailed
post-hoc analysis to facilitate better understanding and also more options for
actionable user responses to change the predicted outcome. Our approach is also
model-agnostic and works for numerical and categorical input features. We show
the usefulness of MOC in concrete cases and compare our approach with
state-of-the-art methods for counterfactual explanations.

multivariate shot noise _intensity_ processes which are connected with the help

Interpretability (PHIs) can be learned from human feedback, then this model can
be incorporated within an ML training process to directly optimize for

experiments on five synthetic and eight real-world symbolic regression

(SHARDS) over the GOODS-N field. This work focuses on the differences between
the three different observational subfamilies of our sample: LAE-LBGs,
no-Ly$\alpha$ LBGs and pure LAEs. Single and double SP synthetic spectra were
used to model the SEDs, adopting a Bayesian information criterion to analyse
under which situations a second SP is required. We find that the sources are
well modelled using a single SP in $\sim79\%$ of the cases. The best models
suggest that pure LAEs are typically young low mass galaxies
($t\sim26^{+41}_{-25}$ Myr;
$M_{\mathrm{star}}\sim5.6^{+12.0}_{-5.5}\times10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$), undergoing
one of their first bursts of star formation. On the other hand, no-Ly$\alpha$
LBGs require older SPs ($t\sim71\pm12$ Myr), and they are substantially more
massive ($M_{\mathrm{star}}\sim3.5\pm1.1\times10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$). LAE-LBGs
appear as the subgroup that more frequently needs the addition of a second SP,
representing an old and massive galaxy caught in a strong recent star-forming
episode. The relative number of sources found from each subfamily at each $z$
supports an evolutionary scenario from pure LAEs and single SP LAE-LBGs to more
massive LBGs. Stellar Mass Functions are also derived, finding an increase of
$M^{*}$ with cosmic time and a possible steepening of the low mass slope from
$z\sim6$ to $z\sim5$ with no significant change to $z\sim4$. Additionally, we
have derived the SFR-$M_{\mathrm{star}}$ relation, finding a

state-of-the-art results in many computer vision applications. These
architectures consist of stages, which are sets of layers that operate on
representations in the same resolution. It has been demonstrated that
increasing the number of layers in each stage improves the prediction ability
of the network. However, the resulting architecture becomes computationally
expensive in terms of floating point operations, memory requirements and
inference time. Thus, significant human effort is necessary to evaluate
different trade-offs between depth and performance. To handle this problem,
recent works have proposed to automatically design high-performance
architectures, mainly by means of neural architecture search (NAS). Current NAS
strategies analyze a large set of possible candidate architectures and, hence,
require vast computational resources and take many GPUs days. Motivated by
this, we propose a NAS approach to efficiently design accurate and low-cost
convolutional architectures and demonstrate that an efficient strategy for
designing these architectures is to learn the depth stage-by-stage. For this
purpose, our approach increases depth incrementally in each stage taking into
account its importance, such that stages with low importance are kept shallow
while stages with high importance become deeper. We conduct experiments on the
CIFAR and different versions of ImageNet datasets, where we show that
architectures discovered by our approach achieve better accuracy and efficiency
than human-designed architectures. Additionally, we show that architectures
discovered on CIFAR-10 can be successfully transferred to large datasets.
Compared to previous NAS approaches, our method is substantially more
efficient, as it evaluates one order of magnitude fewer models and yields
architectures on par with the state-of-the-art.

this end, we consider part of $5f$ uranium electrons as mostly itinerant and
other ones as mostly localized. The main feature that distinguishes the
localized from the itinerant electrons is the effect of the pressure on them.
The pressure strongly screens the itinerant electrons while the localized ones
are almost unaffected. The screening of itinerant electrons leads to decreasing
of their Coulomb repulsion, therefore to formation of doubly occupied and empty
states. These states are spin-singlet and the effective spin of itinerant
electrons, the zero-temperature magnetization in units of Bohr magneton,
decreases. We obtain an effective two-spin Heisenberg model, which explains the
magnetization-temperature diagram of $UGe_2$. It is shown that the
experimentally observed characteristic temperature $T_x$, is a partial order
transition temperature. Below the Curie temperature $(T_x<T_C)$ the system
undergoes a transition from high temperature phase, were only localized
electrons contribute the magnetization, to the low temperature one, where both
itinerant and localized electrons contribute the magnetization. The
characteristic temperature decreases when pressure increases. At the quantum
partial order point $T_x=0$, the Zeeman splitting of the itinerant electrons is
zero. This permits formation of Cooper pairs and an onset of superconductivity
induced by the transversal fluctuations of the localized electrons. Small
deviation from the quantum partial ordered state leads to suppression of
superconductivity. This explains the dome form of the superconducting
transition temperature. The very low superconducting critical temperature is a
consequence of the Ising ferromagnetism.

by idempotents, called axes, with adjoint action semi-simple and satisfying a
prescribed fusion law. Axial algebras were introduced by Hall, Rehren and
Shpectorov \cite{hrs,hrs1} as a broad generalisation of Majorana algebras of
Ivanov, whose axioms were derived from the properties of the Griess algebra for
the Monster sporadic simple group. The class of axial algebras of Monster type
includes Majorana algebras for the Monster and many other sporadic simple
groups, Jordan algebras for classical and some exceptional simple groups, and
Matsuo algebras corresponding to $3$-transposition groups. Thus, axial algebras
of Monster type unify several strands in the theory of finite simple groups.
  It is shown here that double axes, i.e., sums of two orthogonal axes in a
Matsuo algebra, satisfy the fusion law of Monster type $(2\eta,\eta)$.
Primitive subalgebras generated by two single or double axes are completely
classified and $3$-generated primitive subalgebras are classified in one of the
three cases. These classifications further lead to the general flip
construction outputting a rich variety of axial algebras of Monster type. An
application of the flip construction to the case of Matsuo algebras related to

the local interaction is present, including the study of sensitivity near the

non-local interactions can compensate the degradation of the sensitivity
induced by local interactions, so that they may be used to restore optimal

With industry 4.0 comes increased integration between IT systems and the
factory floor from the customer order system to final delivery of the product.
One benefit of this integration is mass production of individually customized
products. However, this has proven challenging to implement into existing
factories, considering that their lifetime can be up to 30 years. The single
most important parameter to measure in a factory is the operating hours of each

and requires very large error correcting codes to be effective. In this work,
we present new hybrid decoders that combine the belief propagation (BP)
algorithm with the SSF decoder. We present the results of numerical simulations
when codes are subject to independent bit-flip and phase-flip errors. We
provide evidence that the threshold of these codes is roughly 7.5% assuming an
ideal syndrome extraction, and remains close to 3% in the presence of syndrome
noise. This result subsumes and significantly improves upon an earlier work by
Grospellier and Krishna (arXiv:1810.03681). The low-complexity high-performance
of these heuristic decoders suggests that decoding should not be a substantial
difficulty when moving from zero-rate surface codes to constant-rate LDPC codes

optimization pipeline in a naval architecture application. We adopt reduced
order models (ROMs) in order to improve the efficiency of the overall
optimization, keeping a modular and equation-free nature to target the
industrial demand. We applied the above mentioned pipeline to a realistic
cruise ship in order to reduce the total drag. We begin by defining the design
space, generated by deforming an initial shape in a parametric way using free
form deformation (FFD). The evaluation of the performance of each new hull is
determined by simulating the flux via finite volume discretization of a
two-phase (water and air) fluid. Since the fluid dynamics model can result very
expensive -- especially dealing with complex industrial geometries -- we
propose also a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) enhancement to reduce the
computational cost of a single numerical simulation. The real--time computation
is finally achieved by means of proper orthogonal decomposition with Gaussian
process regression (POD-GPR) technique. Thanks to the quick approximation, a
genetic optimization algorithm becomes feasible to converge towards the optimal
shape.

method to interpret the information interactions inside Transformer. We take
BERT as an example to conduct extensive studies. Firstly, we apply
self-attention attribution to identify the important attention heads, while
others can be pruned with marginal performance degradation. Furthermore, we
extract the most salient dependencies in each layer to construct an attribution

we show that the attribution results can be used as adversarial patterns to
implement non-targeted attacks towards BERT.

common feature among early light curves of long gamma-ray bursts are X-ray
flares, which have been shown to arise from sites internal to the jet.
Ascribing these events to the prompt emission, we take an established Swift XRT
flare sample and apply a magnetically-dominated wind model to make predictions
for the timing and flux density of corresponding radio pulses in the ~100-200
MHz band observable with radio facilities such as LOFAR. We find that 44 per
cent of the X-ray flares studied would have had detectable radio emission under
this model, for typical sensitivities reached using LOFAR's rapid response mode
and assuming negligible absorption and scattering effects in the interstellar
and intergalactic medium. We estimate the rate of Swift gamma-ray bursts
displaying X-ray flares with detectable radio pulses, accessible to LOFAR, of
order seven per year. We determine that LOFAR triggered observations can play a

The key idea behind our work is a new method to draw inter-modal and spatially

angle-of-arrival correlation by Basu, McCrae and Fiorino (2015) and the
multi-aperture correlation by Chanan (1992), we show that the Zernike

a sampling problem, hence making the new simulator significantly faster than
existing ones. Experimental results show that the simulator has an excellent
match with the theory and real turbulence data.

are excellent objects for N-body modeling that takes into account visible and
dark matter halo components. In order to model the dark matter halo inferred
from the analysis of the measured velocities of Fornax's stars, we constructed
several self-consistent quasi-equilibrium models based on two source code sets.
One of them (GalactICS Software, NEMO) deals with the self-consistent
distribution function modeling which depends on energy $E$ and vertical
component of the angular momentum $L_z$. The other is included in the AGAMA

reproduce the non-spherical self-consistent structure of Fornax as the weighted
sum of orbit contributions to the galactic density even though the inferred
dark halo parameters come from Jeans analysis which does not require that any
distribution functions should be positive. To guess the parameters which make
the N-body models close to the visible object we use the stellar-dark matter
model of the Fornax galaxy based on hydrodynamic axisymmetric Jeans equations
taking into account the velocity anisotropy parameter. Then we studied the
evolution of the models by performing N-body simulations with the falcON code

common denominator of strategic games on the one hand, and dynamic games with

configuration with only spacelike-separated decisions (""different rooms"").
Dynamic games with perfect information, on the other hand, correspond to
timelike-separated decisions (""in turn""). We show how to compute the strategic

existing solution concepts, such as Nash equilibria, rationalizability,
individual rationality, etc, apply naturally to spacetime games. We introduce a
canonical injection of the class of spacetime games with perfect information
into the class of games in extensive form with imperfect information; we
provide a counterexample showing that this is a strict superset. This provides
a novel interpretation of a large number of games in extensive form with
imperfect information in terms of the theory of special relativity, where
non-singleton information sets arise from the finite speed of light. This
framework can be a useful tool for reasoning in quantum foundations, where it
is important whether decisions such as the choice of a measurement axis or the
outcome of a measurement are spacelike- or timelike- separated. We look in
particular at the special case of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment with

bistability and essential extinction, a spatially structured population can
exhibit numerous coexisting attractors. We identify mechanisms and parameter
ranges that can protect the spatially structured population from essential
extinction, whereas it is inevitable in the local system. In the case of weak
coupling, a state where one subpopulation density lies above and the other one
below the Allee threshold can prevent essential extinction. Strong coupling, on
the other hand, enables both populations to persist above the Allee threshold
when dynamics are (approximately) out-of-phase. In both cases, attractors have
fractal basin boundaries. Outside of these parameter ranges, dispersal was not
found to prevent essential extinction. We also demonstrate how spatial
structure can lead to long transients of persistence before the population goes

effective force that holds the atomic nucleus together. This force stems from
fundamental interactions between quarks and gluons (the constituents of
nucleons) that are described by the equations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
However, as these equations cannot be solved directly, physicists resort to
describing nuclear interactions using effective models that are well
constrained at typical inter-nucleon distances in nuclei but not at shorter
distances. This limits our ability to describe high-density nuclear matter such
as in the cores of neutron stars. Here we use high-energy electron scattering
measurements that isolate nucleon pairs in short-distance, high-momentum
configurations thereby accessing a kinematical regime that has not been
previously explored by experiments, corresponding to relative momenta above 400
MeV/c. As the relative momentum between two nucleons increases and their
separation thereby decreases, we observe a transition from a spin-dependent
tensor-force to a predominantly spin-independent scalar-force. These results
demonstrate the power of using such measurements to study the nuclear
interaction at short-distances and also support the use of point-like nucleons
with two- and three-body effective interactions to describe nuclear systems up
to densities several times higher than the central density of atomic nuclei.

during the radiation-dominated era. The radiation produced by accretion onto
primordial black holes leaves characteristic signatures on the properties of
the medium at high redshift, before and after Hydrogen recombination.
Therefore, reliable modelling of accretion onto these objects is required to
obtain robust constraints on their abundance. We investigate the effect of
mechanical feedback, i.e. the impact of outflows (winds and/or jets) on the
medium, on primordial black hole accretion, and thereby on the associated
radiation. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we study for the first
time whether outflows can reduce the accretion rate of primordial black holes
with masses similar to those detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Despite
the complexity of the accretion rate evolution, mechanical feedback is able to
significantly reduce the primordial black hole accretion rate, at least by an
order of magnitude, when outflows are aligned with the motion of the compact
object. If the outflow is perpendicular to the direction of motion, the effect
is less important but still non-negligible. Outflows from primordial black
holes, even rather weak ones, can significantly decrease the accretion rate,
effectively weakening abundance constraints on these objects. Our results
motivate further numerical simulations with a more realistic setup, which would
yield more precise quantitative predictions.

Gathering CSI data is expensive both from the timing and equipment perspective.
In this paper, we use synthetic data to reduce the need for real measured CSI.
We present a semi-supervised learning method for CSI-based activity recognition

the features in the frequency domain. At first, we train the LSTM network with
entirely raw CSI data, which takes much more processing time. To this end, we
aim to generate data by using 50% of raw data in conjunction with a generative

it suffers from two issues when applied to federated non-IID data. First, the
variance of these estimates increases significantly. Second, delaying
communication causes the Markov chains to diverge from the true posterior even
for very simple models. To alleviate both these problems, we propose conducive
gradients, a simple mechanism that combines local likelihood approximations to
correct gradient updates. Notably, conducive gradients are easy to compute, and
since we only calculate the approximations once, they incur negligible
overhead. We apply conducive gradients to distributed stochastic gradient
Langevin dynamics (DSGLD) and call the resulting method federated stochastic
gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD). We demonstrate that our approach can handle
delayed communication rounds, converging to the target posterior in cases where
DSGLD fails. We also show that FSGLD outperforms DSGLD for non-IID federated

onset of its most recent outburst, with the Chandra ACIS-S camera and High
Energy Transmission Gratings (HETG). A rich emission line spectrum was
detected, due to transitions of Fe-L and K-shell ions ranging from neon to
iron. The measured absorbed flux is $\approx 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
in the 1.4-15 Angstrom range (0.77-8.86 keV). The line profiles are asymmetric,
blue-shifted and skewed towards the blue side, as if the ejecta moving towards
us are less absorbed than the receding ones. The full width at half maximum of
most emission lines is 1000-1200 km s$^{-1}$, with some extended blue wings.
The spectrum is thermal and consistent with a plasma in collisional ionization
equilibrium with column density 1.3 $\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and at least two
components at temperatures of about 1 keV and 4 keV, possibly a forward and a
reverse shock, or regions with differently mixed ejecta and red giant wind. The
spectrum is remarkably similar to the symbiotic RNe V745 Sco and RS Oph, but we
cannot distinguish whether the shocks occurred at a distance of few AU from the
red giant, or near the giant's photosphere, in a high density medium containing
only a small mass. The ratios of the flux in lines of aluminum, magnesium and
neon relative to the flux in lines of silicon and iron probably indicate a
carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD).

Here, we try to disentangle our thinking about clocks as used in actual

relativity, which already differ between each other. Special relativity
intertwines the concept of time with a particular definition of the
synchronization of clocks, which precludes synchronizing every clock to every
other clock. General relativity imposes additional barriers to synchronization,
barriers that invite seeking an alternative depending on any global concept of
time. To this end, we focus on how clocks are actually used in some

remarkably well, they are plagued by exposure bias due to the greedy nature of

order to make training tractable, we first work in the residual of a pretrained
locally normalized language model and second we train using noise contrastive

leverage pretrained bi-directional contextual representations, such as BERT and

framework of the background gravitational metric which is of

consistency of the model with the accelerating phase of the Universe has been
shown, when we restrict ourselves to consider the value of the dark energy
density, as $\dot\phi^{2}=\frac{8}{9}=0.888 <1$, which indicates that the
present Universe is dark energy dominated. Graphical plots for the energy
density ($\rho$), pressure ($p$) and equation of state parameter ($\omega$)

the dark energy domination and hence accelerating features. We also put some
light on the corresponding energy conditions and constraints of the $f(\bar{R},

an image with low pixels using damaged photos of human eye-inspection. Also, we
tried to create a deep convolutional network from scratch with the

injected into forward external shock, however we propose here that most of the
power will be dissipated behind the GRB jet through larger amplitude
electromagnetic wave (LAEMW). Based on this proposal, the relevant physical
conditions and observational implications are analyzed and discussed, and
various kinds of X-ray light curves could be reproduced. Although it is still a
matter of debate about the chromatic multi-band afterglow in the standard
external afterglow fireball model, we can explain naturally this feature under
this proposal, i.e., the electrons generating the X-ray plateau and emitting
the optical afterglow are accelerated by different mechanisms. %Furthermore, we
predict that the X-ray emission of spin-down wind could possibly precede the
prompt emission of GRB jet if the energy of LAEMW is dissipated first but
shock-induced radiation in the jet is produced later. It is emphasized that
both the GRB jet and the spin-down wind should have significant observational
consequences in the magnetar scenario, and should be focused equally in GRB
physics.

but preserve the network targets calculated; the loss of the network target for
the training data and the test data is much less than the loss of the original

estimate the numerous channel parameters, resulting in low spectral efficiency.
In this paper, by exploiting temporal correlation of practical wireless
channels, we propose a highly efficient structured distributed compressive
sensing (SDCS) based joint multi-symbol channel estimation scheme.
Specifically, by using the complex exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM)
and exploiting the sparsity in the delay domain within multiple OFDM symbols,
we turn to estimate jointly sparse CE-BEM coefficient vectors rather than
numerous channel taps. Then a sparse pilot pattern within multiple OFDM symbols
is designed to obtain an ICI-free structure and transform the channel
estimation problem into a joint-block-sparse model. Next, a novel block-based
simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (BSOMP) algorithm is proposed to
jointly recover coefficient vectors accurately. Finally, to reduce the CE-BEM
modeling error, we carry out smoothing treatments of already estimated channel
taps via piecewise linear approximation.Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed channel estimation scheme can achieve higher estimation accuracy than
conventional schemes, although with a smaller number of pilot subcarriers.

sliding threshold of observation for numeric evaluation (STONE) curve. It is
based on the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve technique, but
instead of sorting all observations in a categorical classification, the STONE
tool uses the continuous nature of the observations. Rather than defining
events in the observations and then sliding the threshold only in the
classifier (model) data set, the threshold is changed simultaneously for both
the observational and model values, with the same threshold value for both data
and model. This is only possible if the observations are continuous and the
model output is in the same units and scale as the observations, that is, the
model is trying to exactly reproduce the data. The STONE curve has several
similarities with the ROC curve, plotting probability of detection against
probability of false detection, ranging from the (1,1) corner for low
thresholds to the (0,0) corner for high thresholds, and values above the
zero-intercept unity-slope line indicating better than random predictive
ability. The main difference is that the STONE curve can be nonmonotonic,
doubling back in both the x and y directions. These ripples reveal asymmetries
in the data-model value pairs. This new technique is applied to modeling output
of a common geomagnetic activity index as well as energetic electron fluxes in
the Earth's inner magnetosphere. It is not limited to space physics
applications but can be used for any scientific or engineering field where
numerical models are used to reproduce observations.

frequency accelerates the neuronal adaptation processes. This mechanism was
implemented on artificial neural networks, where a local learning step-size
increases for coherent consecutive learning steps and tested on a simple
dataset of handwritten digits, MNIST. Based on our online learning results with
a few handwriting examples, success rates for brain-inspired algorithms
substantially outperform the commonly used machine learning algorithms. We
speculate this emerging bridge from slow brain function to machine learning
will promote ultrafast decision making under limited examples, which is the
reality in many aspects of human activity, robotic control, and network
optimization.

  Experimental Design Considerations",,,,,"cs.HC stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) are time-varying adaptive
interventions that use frequent opportunities for the intervention to be
adapted such as weekly, daily, or even many times a day. This high intensity of
adaptation is facilitated by the ability of digital technology to continuously
collect information about an individual's current context and deliver
treatments adapted to this information. The micro-randomized trial (MRT) has
emerged for use in informing the construction of JITAIs. MRTs operate in, and
take advantage of, the rapidly time-varying digital intervention environment.
MRTs can be used to address research questions about whether and under what
circumstances particular components of a JITAI are effective, with the ultimate
objective of developing effective and efficient components. The purpose of this
article is to clarify why, when, and how to use MRTs; to highlight elements
that must be considered when designing and implementing an MRT; and to discuss
the possibilities this emerging optimization trial design offers for future
research in the behavioral sciences, education, and other fields. We briefly
review key elements of JITAIs, and then describe three case studies of MRTs,
each of which highlights research questions that can be addressed using the MRT
and experimental design considerations that might arise. We also discuss a
variety of considerations that go into planning and designing an MRT, using the
case studies as examples.

research and industry communities due to their applicability in the landscape
of connected and autonomous vehicles. Such applications have stringent
performance requirements in terms of complex data processing and low latency
communications which are utilized to ensure road safety and improve road
conditions. To address these challenges, the placement of V2X applications
through leveraging of edge computing paradigm, that distributes the computing
capabilities to access points in proximity to the vehicles, presents itself as
a viable solution. However, the realistic implementation of the edge enabled
V2X applications is hindered by the limited computational power provided at the
edge and the nature of V2X applications that are composed of multiple
independent V2X basic services. To address these challenges, this work targets
the efficient placement of V2X basic services in a highway scenario subject to
the delay constraints of V2X applications using them and the limited
computational resources at the edge. To that end, this work formulates a binary
integer linear programming model that minimizes the delay of V2X applications
while satisfying the resource requirements of V2X basic services. To
demonstrate the soundness of the approach, simulations with varying vehicle
densities were conducted, and the results reported show that it can satisfy the
delay requirements of V2X applications.
