high dimensional data. The learning objective of GANs usually minimizes some
measure discrepancy, \textit{e.g.}, $f$-divergence~($f$-GANs) or Integral
Probability Metric~(Wasserstein GANs). With $f$-divergence as the objective
function, the discriminator essentially estimates the density ratio, and the
estimated ratio proves useful in further improving the sample quality of the
generator. However, how to leverage the information contained in the
discriminator of Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) is less explored. In this paper, we
introduce the Discriminator Contrastive Divergence, which is well motivated by
the property of WGAN's discriminator and the relationship between WGAN and
energy-based model. Compared to standard GANs, where the generator is directly
utilized to obtain new samples, our method proposes a semi-amortized generation
procedure where the samples are produced with the generator's output as an
initial state. Then several steps of Langevin dynamics are conducted using the
gradient of the discriminator. We demonstrate the benefits of significant
improved generation on both synthetic data and several real-world image
generation benchmarks.

between insect species, some studies suggest that ant attendance is not always
advantageous for the aphids because they may pay a physiological cost. In this
study, we propose a new mathematical model of an ant--aphid system considering
the costs of ant attendance. It includes both mutualism and predation. In the
model, we incorporate not only the trade-off between the intrinsic growth rate
of aphids and the honeydew reward for ants, but also the facultative predation
of aphids by ants. The analysis and computer simulations of the two-dimensional
nonlinear dynamical system with functional response produces fixed points and
also novel and complex bifurcations. These results suggest that a higher degree
of dependence of the aphids on the ants does not always enhance the abundance
of the aphids. In contrast, the model without facultative predation gives a
simple prediction, that is, the higher the degree of dependence, the more
abundant the aphids are. The present study predicts two overall scenarios for
an ant--aphid system with mutualism and facultative predation: (1) aphids with
a lower intrinsic growth rate and many attending ants and (2) aphids with a
higher intrinsic growth rate and fewer attending ants. This seems to explain
why there are two lineages of aphids: one is associated with ants and the other
is not.

to become an information producer and to offer online content for potentially
global consumption. By increasing the amount of globally accessible real-time
information, today's ubiquitous producers contribute to a world, where an
individual consumes vanishingly smaller fractions of all produced content. In
general, consumers preferentially select information that closely matches their
individual views and values. The bias inherent in such selection is further
magnified by today's information curation services that maximize user
engagement (and thus service revenue) by filtering new content in accordance
with observed consumer preferences. Consequently, individuals get exposed to
increasingly narrower bands of the ideology spectrum. Societies get fragmented
into increasingly ideologically isolated enclaves. These enclaves (or
echo-chambers) then become vulnerable to misinformation spread, which in turn
further magnifies polarization and bias. We call this dynamic the paradox of
information access; a growing ideological fragmentation in the age of sharing.

In particular, a QIP thus holds for random walks on long-range percolation

feature extraction methods. In this paper, we propose a novel emotion-relevant
critical subnetwork selection algorithm and investigate three EEG functional
connectivity network features: strength, clustering coefficient, and
eigenvector centrality. The discrimination ability of the EEG connectivity
features in emotion recognition is evaluated on three public emotion EEG
datasets: SEED, SEED-V, and DEAP. The strength feature achieves the best
classification performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art differential
entropy feature based on single-channel analysis. The experimental results
reveal that distinct functional connectivity patterns are exhibited for the
five emotions of disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, and neutrality.
Furthermore, we construct a multimodal emotion recognition model by combining
the functional connectivity features from EEG and the features from eye
movements or physiological signals using deep canonical correlation analysis.
The classification accuracies of multimodal emotion recognition are 95.08/6.42%
on the SEED dataset, 84.51/5.11% on the SEED-V dataset, and 85.34/2.90% and
86.61/3.76% for arousal and valence on the DEAP dataset, respectively. The
results demonstrate the complementary representation properties of the EEG

accepted as a powerful computational tool for making inference with dynamical
systems. A key step in SMC is resampling, which plays the role of steering the
algorithm towards the future dynamics. Several strategies have been proposed
and used in practice, including multinomial resampling, residual resampling
(Liu and Chen 1998), optimal resampling (Fearnhead and Clifford 2003),
stratified resampling (Kitagawa 1996), and optimal transport resampling (Reich
2013). We show that, in the one dimensional case, optimal transport resampling
is equivalent to stratified resampling on the sorted particles, and they both
minimize the resampling variance as well as the expected squared energy
distance between the original and resampled empirical distributions; in the
multidimensional case, the variance of stratified resampling after sorting
particles using Hilbert curve (Gerber et al. 2019) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is
$O(m^{-(1+2/d)})$, an improved rate compared to the original $O(m^{-(1+1/d)})$,
where $m$ is the number of resampled particles. This improved rate is the
lowest for ordered stratified resampling schemes, as conjectured in Gerber et
al. (2019). We also present an almost sure bound on the Wasserstein distance
between the original and Hilbert-curve-resampled empirical distributions. In
light of these theoretical results, we propose the stratified
multiple-descendant growth (SMG) algorithm, which allows us to explore the
sample space more efficiently compared to the standard i.i.d.
multiple-descendant sampling-resampling approach as measured by the Wasserstein

random quantum state is an elementary task in quantum information theory that
has both computational and physical uses. This is often referred to as
pseudorandom (quantum) state generator, or PRS generator for short.
  In existing constructions of PRS generators, security scales with the number
of qubits in the states, i.e.\ the (statistical) security parameter for an
$n$-qubit PRS is roughly $n$. Perhaps counter-intuitively, $n$-qubit PRS are
not known to imply $k$-qubit PRS even for $k<n$. Therefore the question of
\emph{scalability} for PRS was thus far open: is it possible to construct
$n$-qubit PRS generators with security parameter $\lambda$ for all $n,
\lambda$. Indeed, we believe that PRS with tiny (even constant) $n$ and large
$\lambda$ can be quite useful.
  We resolve the problem in this work, showing that any quantum-secure one-way
function implies scalable PRS. We follow the paradigm of first showing a
\emph{statistically} secure construction when given oracle access to a random
function, and then replacing the random function with a quantum-secure
(classical) pseudorandom function to achieve computational security. However,
our methods deviate significantly from prior works since scalable pseudorandom
states require randomizing the amplitudes of the quantum state, and not just
the phase as in all prior works. We show how to achieve this using Gaussian
sampling.

BitChute joins an ecosystem of alternative, low content moderation platforms,

Our analysis reveals several key characteristics of the platform. We find that
only a handful of channels receive any engagement, and almost all of those

the platform as a whole, much of which is anti-Semitic, is particularly

  Varying Topology","11 Pages",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we equip the conventional discrete-time queueing network with
a Markovian input process, that, in addition to the usual short-term
stochastics, governs the mid- to long-term behavior of the links between the
network nodes. This is reminiscent of so-called Jump-Markov systems in control
theory and allows the network topology to change over time. We argue that the
common back-pressure control policy is inadequate to control such network
dynamics and propose a novel control policy inspired by the paradigms of
model-predictive control. Specifically, by defining a suitable but arbitrary
prediction horizon, our policy takes into account the future network states and
possible control actions. This stands in clear contrast to most other policies
which are myopic, i.e. only consider the next state. We show numerically that
such an approach can significantly improve the control performance and
introduce several variants, thereby trading off performance versus
computational complexity. In addition, we prove so-called throughput optimality
of our policy which guarantees stability for all network flows that can be
maintained by the network. Interestingly, in contrast to general stability
proofs in model-predictive control, our proof does not require the assumption
of a terminal set (i.e. for the prediction horizon to be large enough).
Finally, we provide several illustrating examples, one of which being a network
of synchronized queues. This one in particular constitutes an interesting
system class, in which our policy exerts superiority over general back-pressure
policies, that even lose their throughput optimality in those networks.

modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made.
We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation
in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently
probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational
nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and
regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as
medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different
possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to
small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with
different scenarios.
  This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an
epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR).
It is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model,
are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used
with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent
uncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw
insights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources,
including agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based
models.

increases the atomic emission to be comparable to the probe. Examining the
second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ of the total field in the
probe direction, we find that the addition of the pump formally plays the same
role as increasing the coupling efficiency. We show that one can tune the
correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ from zero (perfect anti-bunching) to infinite
(extreme bunching) by a proper choice of pump amplitude. We further elucidate
the origin of these correlations in terms of the transient atomic state

two dimensions, where the self-propulsion speed of a colloid is regulated
according to the local density sensed by it. The role of
concentration-dependent motility on the phase-separation of colloids and their
dynamics is investigated in detail. Interestingly, the system phase separates
at a very low packing fraction ($\Phi\approx 0.125$) at higher self-propulsion
speeds ($\text{Pe}$), which coexists with a homogeneous phase and attains
long-range crystalline order beyond a transition point. The transition point is
quantified here from the local density profiles, local and global-bond order
parameters. We have shown that the phase diagram's characteristics are
qualitatively akin to the active Brownian particle (ABP) model. Moreover, our
investigation reveals that the density-dependent motility amplifies the
slow-down of the directed speed, which facilitates phase-separation even at low
packing fractions. The effective diffusivity shows a crossover from quadratic
rise to a power-law behavior of exponent $3/2$ with $\text{Pe}$ in the
phase-separated regime. Furthermore, we have shown that the effective diffusion
decreases exponentially with packing fraction in the phase-separated regime
while linear decrease in the single phase regime.

some cases the complications derived from this disease, such as central nervous

across related studies and has been utilised to combine evidence from clinical
studies to evaluate treatment efficacy on two outcomes. It has also been used
to investigate surrogacy patterns between treatment effects on the surrogate
endpoint and the final outcome. Surrogate endpoints play an important role in
drug development when they can be used to measure treatment effect early
compared to the final outcome and to predict clinical benefit or harm. The
standard bivariate meta-analytic approach models the observed treatment effects
on the surrogate and the final outcome outcomes jointly, at both the
within-study and between-studies levels, using a bivariate normal distribution.
For binomial data, a normal approximation on log odds ratio scale can be used.
However, this method may lead to biased results when the proportions of events
are close to one or zero, affecting the validation of surrogate endpoints. In
this paper, we explore modelling the two outcomes on the original binomial
scale. Firstly, we present a method that uses independent binomial likelihoods
to model the within-study variability avoiding to approximate the observed
treatment effects. However, the method ignores the within-study association. To
overcome this issue, we propose a method using a bivariate copula with binomial
marginals, which allows the model to account for the within-study association.

cluster grows linearly with the number of data points. While this is appealing
for some applications, this assumption is not appropriate for other tasks such
as entity resolution, modeling of sparse networks, and DNA sequencing tasks.
Such applications require models that yield clusters whose sizes grow
sublinearly with the total number of data points -- the microclustering
property. Motivated by these issues, we propose a general class of random
partition models that satisfy the microclustering property with
well-characterized theoretical properties. Our proposed models overcome major
limitations in the existing literature on microclustering models, namely a lack
of interpretability, identifiability, and full characterization of model
asymptotic properties. Crucially, we drop the classical assumption of having an
exchangeable sequence of data points, and instead assume an exchangeable
sequence of clusters. In addition, our framework provides flexibility in terms
of the prior distribution of cluster sizes, computational tractability, and
applicability to a large number of microclustering tasks. We establish
theoretical properties of the resulting class of priors, where we characterize
the asymptotic behavior of the number of clusters and of the proportion of
clusters of a given size. Our framework allows a simple and efficient Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm to perform statistical inference. We illustrate our
proposed methodology on the microclustering task of entity resolution, where we
provide a simulation study and real experiments on survey panel data.

convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved a remarkable performance in
brain tumor segmentation, but this task is still difficult owing to high
varying intensity and appearance of gliomas. Most of the existing methods,
especially UNet-based networks, integrate low-level and high-level features in
a naive way, which may result in confusion for the model. Moreover, most
approaches employ 3D architectures to benefit from 3D contextual information of
input images. These architectures contain more parameters and computational
complexity than 2D architectures. On the other hand, using 2D models causes not
to benefit from 3D contextual information of input images. In order to address
the mentioned issues, we design a low-parameter network based on 2D UNet in
which we employ two techniques. The first technique is an attention mechanism,
which is adopted after concatenation of low-level and high-level features. This
technique prevents confusion for the model by weighting each of the channels
adaptively. The second technique is the Multi-View Fusion. By adopting this
technique, we can benefit from 3D contextual information of input images

Menger property of the remainder of a compactification of $X$. Subsequently, we
use topological games to study hereditary Baire property in spaces of

this end, we introduce a notion of strong $P$-filter $\mathcal{F}$ and prove
that it is equivalent to $K(\mathcal{F})$ being hereditarily Baire. We also
show that if $X$ is separable metrizable and $K(X)$ is hereditarily Baire, then
the space $P_r(X)$ of Borel probability Radon measures on $X$ is hereditarily
Baire too. It follows that there exists (in ZFC) a separable metrizable space

a large-scale conversion experiment where crowdworkers submit search queries
they would use when looking for equivalent information. We provide a careful
analysis of this data, accounting for possible sources of bias during
conversion, along with insights into user-specific linguistic patterns and

detectors for dark matter searches to record (in the gas phase) the ionization
signal induced by particle scattering in the liquid phase. The ""standard"" EL
mechanism is considered to be due to noble gas excimer emission in the vacuum
ultraviolet (VUV). In addition, there are two alternative mechanisms, producing
light in the visible and near infrared (NIR) ranges. The first is due to
bremsstrahlung of electrons scattered on neutral atoms (""neutral
bremsstrahlung"", NBrS). The second, responsible for electron avalanche
scintillation in the NIR at higher electric fields, is due to transitions
between excited atomic states. In this work, we have for the first time
demonstrated two alternative techniques of the optical readout of two-phase
argon detectors, in the visible and NIR range, using a silicon photomultiplier
matrix and electroluminescence due to either neutral bremsstrahlung or
avalanche scintillation. The amplitude yield and position resolution were
measured for these readout techniques, which allowed to assess the detection
threshold for electron and nuclear recoils in two-phase argon detectors for
dark matter searches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical
application of the NBrS effect in detection science.

These rates inform about suitable strategies for discretization of the

In particular, discretizing the detector in the same magnitude as the image

asymptotically smaller pixels than detectors lead to convergence. Possible
adjustments to limited-angle and sparse-angle Radon transforms are discussed,
and similar convergence results are shown. In the same vein, convergence

combines a computational substructure with a numerical model for
well-understood components and an experimental substructure for other parts of
the structure that are physically tested. One challenge for fast HS or
real-time HS (RTHS) is associated with the analytical substructures of
relatively complex structures, which could have large number of degrees of
freedoms (DOFs), for instance. These large DOFs computations could be hard to
perform in real-time, even with the all current hardware capacities. In this
study, a metamodeling technique is proposed to represent the structural dynamic
behavior of the analytical substructure. A preliminary study is conducted where
a one-bay one-story concentrically braced frame (CBF) is tested under
earthquake loading by using a compact HS setup at the University of Nevada,
Reno. The experimental setup allows for using a small-scale brace as the
experimental substructure combined with a steel frame at the prototype
full-scale for the analytical substructure. Two different machine learning
algorithms are evaluated to provide a valid and useful metamodeling solution
for analytical substructure. The metamodels are trained with the available data
that is obtained from the pure analytical solution of the prototype steel
frame. The two algorithms used for developing the metamodels are: (1) linear
regression (LR) model, and (2) basic recurrent neural network (RNN). The
metamodels are first validated against the pure analytical response of the
structure. Next, RTHS experiments are conducted by using metamodels. RTHS test
results using both LR and RNN models are evaluated, and the advantages and
disadvantages of these models are discussed.

widths (EWs) in a various timescale from $<10$~days to a few years in the
quasar rest-frame. We use the data sets of BAL EWs taken by the Sloan Digital

by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) in $g$ and $R$-bands and
the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) in

flux variability versus BAL variability show weak, moderate, or a strong
positive correlation, (2) there is no significant difference in flux
variability amplitudes between BAL quasar with significant short timescale EW
variability (called class S1) and without (class S2), (3) in all time scales
considered in this paper, the class S1 quasars show systematically larger BAL
variability amplitudes than those of the class S2 quasars, and (4) there are
possible correlations between BAL variability and physical parameters of the
quasars such as black hole masses (moderate positive), Eddington ratios, and
accretion disk temperature (strong negative) in the class S2 quasars. These
results indicate that the BAL variability requires changing in the ionizing
continuum and an ancillary mechanism such as variability in X-ray shielding gas
located at the innermost region of an accretion disk.

of flavor is similar to other successful ones based on the double tetrahedral

presence of a flavorful axion. Here we gauge that U(1) symmetry and introduce a
heavy sector that includes (1) the fermions necessary to cancel anomalies and
(2) a second scalar flavon field that spontaneously breaks the U(1) symmetry.
The full theory has an accidental U(1)$\times$U(1)$'$ global symmetry,
anomalous with respect to QCD; U(1)$_\text{PQ}$ emerges as a linear
combination. The gauged flavor symmetry restricts the possible PQ
symmetry-breaking higher-dimension operators so that sufficient axion quality
is preserved. We provide a model of the quark sector, as a proof of principle,
and then a model which incorporates the standard model charged leptons as well.
In both cases, the charge assignments that lead to acceptable axion quality
also lead to a multiplicity of some of the heavy sector states; we check that
the Landau pole for hypercharge remains above the cut off of the effective
theory. We consider relevant phenomenological constraints on these models
including those on the predicted axion couplings.

enable both the Dyakonov-Shur instability (when the electron drift velocity

drifting current could be provided by an RF signal leading to RF to THz and THz
to RF frequency conversion using the source and drain antennas and reducing
losses associated with ohmic contacts. We show that narrow regions protruding

conditions at the contacts and/or at the interfaces between different device
sections. These sections could be combined into plasmonic crystals yielding
enhanced power and a better impedance matching. The mathematics of the problems
is treated using the transmission line analogy. We show that the combination of
the stubs and the variable width channels is required for the instability rise

inscrutable for many decades. Multidimensional simulations suggest that the
growth of fluid instabilities and the development of turbulent convection will
determine the morphology of the explosion. We have performed 3D simulations
using spherical-polar coordinates covering a reduced angular extent (90 degree
computational domain), and with angular resolutions of 2 degrees, 1 degree, 1/2
degree, and 1/4 degree, to study the development of turbulence in core-collapse
supernova explosions on a time scale of order 100 ms. We have employed the
multi-physics Chimera code that includes detailed nuclear physics and spectral
neutrino transport. Coarse resolution models do not develop an inertial range,
presumably due to the bottleneck effect, such that the energy is prevented from
cascading down to small scales and tends to accumulate at large scales.
High-resolution models instead, start to recover the k^{-5/3} scaling of
Kolmogorov's theory. Stochasticity and few simulation samples limit our ability
to predict the development of explosions. Over the simulated time period, our
models show no clear trend in improving (or diminishing) conditions for
explosion as the angular resolution is increased. However, we find that
turbulence provides an effective pressure behind the shock (approx. 40 - 50 %
of the thermal pressure), which can contribute to the shock revival and be
conducive for the development of the explosion. Finally, we show that the
turbulent energy power spectrum of reduced angular extent and full 4 pi models
are consistent, thus indicating that a 90 degree computational domain is an
adequate configuration to study the character of turbulence in CCSNe.

integrating high-quality graphene p-n junctions within two types of planar
transmission line circuits to modulate and emit picosecond pulses. In a
coplanar stripline geometry, we demonstrate electrical modulation of THz signal
transmission by 95%. In a Goubau waveguide geometry, we achieve complete

These studies inform the development of on-chip signal manipulation and
highlight prospects for 2D materials in THz applications.

estimated means and corresponding standard deviations from the selected studies
are key inputs to obtain a pooled estimate of the mean and its confidence
interval. We often encounter the situation that these quantities are not
directly reported in the literatures. Instead, other summary statistics are
reported such as median, minimum, maximum, quartiles, and study sample size.
Based on available summary statistics, we need to estimate estimates of mean
and standard deviation for meta-analysis. Methods: We developed a R Shiny code
based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), ABCMETA, to deal with this
situation. Results: In this article, we present an interactive and
user-friendly R Shiny application for implementing the proposed method (named
ABCMETAapp). In ABCMETAapp, users can choose an underlying outcome distribution
other than the normal distribution when the distribution of the outcome
variable is skewed or heavy tailed. We show how to run ABCMETAapp with

method is more flexible than the existing analytical methods since estimation
can be based on five different distribution (Normal, Lognormal, Exponential,
Weibull, and Beta) for the outcome variable.

multimedia and television services, raw opinion scores collected from test

scores (MOS), recommendations such as ITU-R BT.500, ITU-T P.910 and ITU-T P.913
standardize post-test screening procedures to clean up the raw opinion scores,
using techniques such as subject outlier rejection and bias removal. In this
paper, we analyze the prior standardized techniques to demonstrate their
weaknesses. As an alternative, we propose a simple model to account for two of
the most dominant behaviors of subject inaccuracy: bias and inconsistency. We
further show that this model can also effectively deal with inattentive
subjects that give random scores. We propose to use maximum likelihood
estimation to jointly solve the model parameters, and present two numeric
solvers: the first based on the Newton-Raphson method, and the second based on
an alternating projection (AP). We show that the AP solver generalizes the
ITU-T P.913 post-test screening procedure by weighing a subject's contribution
to the true quality score by her consistency (thus, the quality scores
estimated can be interpreted as bias-subtracted consistency-weighted MOS). We
compare the proposed methods with the standardized techniques using real
datasets and synthetic simulations, and demonstrate that the proposed methods
are the most valuable when the test conditions are challenging (for example,
crowdsourcing and cross-lab studies), offering advantages such as better
model-data fit, tighter confidence intervals, better robustness against subject
outliers, the absence of hard coded parameters and thresholds, and auxiliary

both of them are applied in our method but with different modules in two
supervised branches which can make a complementary to each other. Moreover,
effective spatial and channel attention mechanisms are introduced to eliminate
background noise and extract valid foreground information. Finally, a simple
rectified network is implemented to rectify irregular text. The ReADS can be

the user partition multicast (UPM) (Shanmugam \textit{et al.}, 2015) is in
removing redundancies in the UPM solution by eliminating the linearly dependent
coded packets. We also prove that the UPM scheme subsumes the packet partition
multicast (PPM) scheme (Tehrani \textit{et al.}, 2012). Hence, the IUPM scheme
is a generalization of both PPM and UPM schemes. Furthermore, inspired by
jointly considering users and packets, we modify the approximation partition

polynomial-time algorithm for solving the general GIC problem. We characterize
a class of GIC problems with $\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ packets, for any integer $k\geq

correlation between $L_{\nu}$ and $w_{\rm int,rest}$. These results suggest
essentially different physical origins of the two. The faint ends of the LFs of
repeating and non-repeating FRBs are higher than volumetric occurrence rates of
neutron-star mergers and accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs, and
are consistent with those of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), type Ia
supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf mergers. This indicates two
possibilities: either (i) faint non-repeating FRBs originate in neutron-star
mergers or AIC and are actually repeating during the lifetime of the
progenitor, or (ii) faint non-repeating FRBs originate in any of SGRs, type Ia
supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf mergers. The bright ends of LFs of
repeating and non-repeating FRBs are lower than any candidates of progenitors,
suggesting that bright FRBs are produced from a very small fraction of the
progenitors regardless of the repetition. Otherwise, they might originate in
unknown progenitors.

Existing work has shown that it can be asymptotically achieved by using the
celebrated Power-of-$d$-choices (pod) policy with a probe overhead $d =
\omega\left(\frac{\log N}{1-\lambda}\right)$, and it is impossible when $d =
O\left(\frac{1}{1-\lambda}\right)$, where $N$ is the number of servers and
$\lambda$ is the load of the system. However, these results are based on the
model where each job is an indivisible unit, which does not capture the
parallel structure of jobs in today's predominant parallel computing paradigm.
  This paper thus considers a model where each job consists of a batch of
parallel tasks. Under this model, we propose a new notion of zero (asymptotic)
queueing delay that requires the job delay under a policy to approach the job
delay given by the max of its tasks' service times, i.e., the job delay
assuming its tasks entered service right upon arrival. This notion quantifies
the effect of queueing on a job level for jobs consisting of multiple tasks,
and thus deviates from the conventional zero queueing delay for single-task
jobs in the literature.
  We show that zero queueing delay for parallel jobs can be achieved using the
batch-filling policy (a variant of the celebrated pod policy) with a probe
overhead $d = \omega\left(\frac{1}{(1-\lambda)\log k}\right)$ in the
sub-Halfin-Whitt heavy-traffic regime, where $k$ is the number of tasks in each
job { and $k$ properly scales with $N$ (the number of servers)}. This result
demonstrates that for parallel jobs, zero queueing delay can be achieved with a
smaller probe overhead. We also establish an impossibility result: we show that
zero queueing delay cannot be achieved if $d = \exp\left({o\left(\frac{\log
N}{\log k}\right)}\right)$.

Super-Resolution for medical images. By using this network to perform arbitrary

approximation whereas in the Boltzmann simulation it becomes perpendicular in
some transition regions, where the mean free path is 0.1 times the radius. In
three spatial dimensions, the convective motions make it difficult to predict

study one of the simplest examples of the glass-glass phase separation. We
consider a mixture composed of type A and B particles, in which the A-A and B-B
interactions are the identical Lennard-Jones interactions and the A-B
interaction is repulsive only. To avoid crystallization, we also introduce the
polydispersity in the particle sizes for each component. We study the phase
separation kinetics of this model at a 50:50 concentration at various
temperatures. We find that hydrodynamic coarsening takes place when the
temperature is higher than the onset temperature of the glassy dynamics. At
lower temperatures, diffusive coarsening is observed over a long duration, and
a further slower coarsening appears within a shorter time. Below the glass
transition temperature, the domain growth does not stop but becomes
logarithmically slow or even slower than logarithmic. By analyzing two-time
correlation functions, we show that these slow coarsening processes are
accompanied by a slowing down of the microscopic dynamics, which has
qualitative similarities with the aging dynamics without phase separation.
Based on the results, we discuss a possible link between the slow coarsening
and the aging-like microscopic slowing down in the glass-glass phase
separation.

difference to topological properties and their breakdown, we introduce a
Faraday line representation where loops carry the energy and magnetization of
the system. Because of the absence of monopoles in the F-model, its loops have
distinct topological properties, absent in square ice, and which allow for a
natural partition of its phase space into topological sectors. Then the N\'eel
temperature corresponds to a transition from trivial to non-trivial topological
sectors. Moreover, its zero susceptibility below a critical field is explained
by the homotopy invariance of its magnetization. In spin ices, instead,
monopoles destroy the homotopy invariance of the magnetization, and thus erase
this rich topological structure. Consequently, even trivial loops can be
magnetized, and their susceptibility is never zero.

facial landmarks, it suffers from huge spatial complexity and is prone to
quantization error. To address this, we propose a novel attentive
one-dimensional heatmap regression method for facial landmark localization.
First, we predict two groups of 1D heatmaps to represent the marginal
distributions of the x and y coordinates. These 1D heatmaps reduce spatial
complexity significantly compared to current heatmap regression methods, which
use 2D heatmaps to represent the joint distributions of x and y coordinates.
With much lower spatial complexity, the proposed method can output
high-resolution 1D heatmaps despite limited GPU memory, significantly
alleviating the quantization error. Second, a co-attention mechanism is adopted
to model the inherent spatial patterns existing in x and y coordinates, and
therefore the joint distributions on the x and y axes are also captured. Third,
based on the 1D heatmap structures, we propose a facial landmark detector
capturing spatial patterns for landmark detection on an image; and a tracker
further capturing temporal patterns with a temporal refinement mechanism for
landmark tracking. Experimental results on four benchmark databases demonstrate
the superiority of our method.

relevant issue nowadays. Video content creators and automatic movie directors
benefit from maintaining their viewers engaged, which can be facilitated by
producing novel material eliciting stronger emotions in them. Moreover, there's
currently a demand for more empathetic computers to aid humans in applications
such as augmenting the perception ability of visually and/or hearing impaired
people. Current approaches overlook the video's emotional characteristics in
the music generation step, only consider static images instead of videos, are
unable to generate novel music, and require a high level of human effort and
skills. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep neural network that uses
an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to predict a video's emotion from its
visual features and a deep Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network to
generate its corresponding audio signals with similar emotional inkling. The
former is able to appropriately model emotions due to its fuzzy properties, and
the latter is able to model data with dynamic time properties well due to the
availability of the previous hidden state information. The novelty of our
proposed method lies in the extraction of visual emotional features in order to
transform them into audio signals with corresponding emotional aspects for
users. Quantitative experiments show low mean absolute errors of 0.217 and
0.255 in the Lindsey and DEAP datasets respectively, and similar global
features in the spectrograms. This indicates that our model is able to
appropriately perform domain transformation between visual and audio features.
Based on experimental results, our model can effectively generate audio that
matches the scene eliciting a similar emotion from the viewer in both datasets,
and music generated by our model is also chosen more often.

achieved notable success in dealing with large-scale optimization problems

generally requires a high-precision decomposition of the optimization problem,
which is still a challenging task for existing decomposition methods. This
study attempts to address the above issue from a different perspective and
proposes an eigenspace divide-and-conquer (EDC) approach. Different from
existing DC-based algorithms that perform decomposition and optimization in the
original decision space, EDC first establishes an eigenspace by conducting
singular value decomposition on a set of high-quality solutions selected from
recent generations. Then it transforms the optimization problem into the
eigenspace, and thus significantly weakens the dependencies among the
corresponding eigenvariables. Accordingly, these eigenvariables can be
efficiently grouped by a simple random strategy and each of the resulting
subproblems can be addressed more easily by a traditional EA. To verify the
efficiency of EDC, comprehensive experimental studies were conducted on two
sets of benchmark functions. Experimental results indicate that EDC is robust
to its parameters and has good scalability to the problem dimension. The
comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms further confirms that EDC
is pretty competitive and performs better on complicated LSOPs.

intersection, the most prominent examples being epistemic and doxastic logics
with distributed knowledge. Completeness proofs for such logics tend to be
complicated, in particular on model classes such as S5 like in standard
epistemic logic, mainly due to the undefinability of intersection of modalities
in standard modal logics. A standard proof method for the S5 case was outlined
in [8] and later explicated in more detail in [13], using an
""unraveling-folding method"" case to achieve a treelike model to deal with the
problem of undefinability. This method, however, is not easily adapted to other
logics, due to the level of detail and reliance on S5. In this paper we propose
a simpler proof technique by building a treelike canonical model directly,
which avoids the complications in the processes of unraveling and folding. We
demonstrate the technique by showing completeness of the normal modal logics K,
D, T, B, S4 and S5 extended with intersection modalities. Furthermore, these
treelike canonical models are compatible with Fischer-Ladner-style closures,
and we combine the methods to show the completeness of the mentioned logics
further extended with transitive closure of union modalities known from PDL or
epistemic logic. Some of these completeness results are new.

take advantage of the 3D context to model various objects or stuffs with severe

propose a novel module called anisotropic convolution, which properties with
flexibility and power impossible for the competing methods such as standard 3D
convolution and some of its variations. In contrast to the standard 3D
convolution that is limited to a fixed 3D receptive field, our module is
capable of modeling the dimensional anisotropy voxel-wisely. The basic idea is
to enable anisotropic 3D receptive field by decomposing a 3D convolution into
three consecutive 1D convolutions, and the kernel size for each such 1D
convolution is adaptively determined on the fly. By stacking multiple such
anisotropic convolution modules, the voxel-wise modeling capability can be
further enhanced while maintaining a controllable amount of model parameters.

Here, we employ Markovian quantum measurement theory, including the readout

Majorana qubits via continuous charge sensing of a tunnel-coupled quantum dot
by a quantum point contact. We show that projective measurements of Majorana
products $\prod_i\hat{\gamma}_i$ can be implemented by continuous charge
sensing under quite general circumstances. Essential requirements are that a
combined local parity $\hat{\pi}$, involving the quantum dot charge along with
the Majorana product of interest, be conserved, and that the two eigenspaces of
the combined parity $\hat{\pi}$ generate distinguishable measurement signals.
We find that qubit readout may have to rely on measuring noise correlations of
the quantum-point-contact current. The average current encodes the qubit
readout only transiently for fine-tuned parameters or in the presence of
relaxation processes. We also discuss the corresponding measurement and
decoherence times and consider processes such as residual Majorana
hybridizations which are detrimental to the measurement protocol. Finally, we
emphasize that the underlying mechanism -- which we term symmetry-protected
readout -- is quite general and has further implications for both, Majorana and

phenomena and have potentially important applications. It is relatively easy to
find a few EPs for a structure with parameters, but isolated EPs provide no
information about their formation and variation in parameter space, and it is
always difficult to ensure that all EPs in a domain of the parameter space are

periodic array of circular cylinders. By tuning the periodic structure towards
a uniform slab and following the EPs continuously, we are able to obtain a
precise condition about the limiting uniform slab, and thereby order and
classify EPs as tracks with their endpoints determined analytically. It is
found that along each track, a second order EP of resonant states (with a

This presents statistically as a discrepancy between the real text and

stereo matching. Our first intuition is stereo matching can be modeled as a
special case of optical flow, and we can leverage 3D geometry behind
stereoscopic videos to guide the learning of these two forms of
correspondences. We then enroll this knowledge into the state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning framework, and train one single network to estimate
both flow and stereo. Second, we unveil the bottlenecks in prior
self-supervised learning approaches, and propose to create a new set of
challenging proxy tasks to boost performance. These two insights yield a single
model that achieves the highest accuracy among all existing unsupervised flow
and stereo methods on KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks. More remarkably, our
self-supervised method even outperforms several state-of-the-art fully
supervised methods, including PWC-Net and FlowNet2 on KITTI 2012.

using this technique were statistics limited, and new measurements would
benefit tremendously from the efficient 2S production at a low energy muon
($<20$ keV) facility. Such a source of abundant low energy $\mathrm{\mu^+}$ has
only become available in recent years, e.g. at the Low-Energy Muon beamline at
the Paul Scherrer Institute. Using this source, we report on the successful
creation of an intense, directed beam of metastable Muonium. We find that even
though the theoretical Muonium fraction is maximal in the low energy range of
$2-5$ keV, scattering by the foil and transport characteristics of the beamline
favor slightly higher $\mathrm{\mu^+}$ energies of $7-10$ keV. We estimate that
an event detection rate of a few events per second for a future Lamb shift
measurement is feasible, enabling an increase in precision by two orders of
magnitude over previous determinations.

categorical semantics separately to achieve high accuracy and high efficiency
for realtime semantic segmentation. To this end, we propose an efficient and
effective architecture with a good trade-off between speed and accuracy, termed
Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet V2). This architecture involves: (i) a
Detail Branch, with wide channels and shallow layers to capture low-level
details and generate high-resolution feature representation; (ii) a Semantic
Branch, with narrow channels and deep layers to obtain high-level semantic
context. The Semantic Branch is lightweight due to reducing the channel
capacity and a fast-downsampling strategy. Furthermore, we design a Guided

representation. Besides, a booster training strategy is designed to improve the
segmentation performance without any extra inference cost. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed
architecture performs favourably against a few state-of-the-art real-time
semantic segmentation approaches. Specifically, for a 2,048x1,024 input, we
achieve 72.6% Mean IoU on the Cityscapes test set with a speed of 156 FPS on

on the best fit value of the absolute magnitude $M$ and/or Hubble constant
$H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM indicates a local variation ($z\lesssim
0.2$) at $2\sigma$ level, with respect to the best fit of the full dataset. If
this variation is physical, it can be interpreted either as a locally higher
value of $H_0$, corresponding to a local matter underdensity $\delta
\rho_0/\rho_0 \simeq -0.10 \pm 0.04$ or as a time variation of Newton's
constant which implies an evolving Chandrasekhar mass and thus an evolving
absolute magnitude $M$ of SnIa. The local void scenario would predict an
anisotropy in the best fit value of $H_0$ since it is unlikely that we are
located at the center of a local spherical underdensity. Using a hemisphere
comparison method we find an anisotropy level consistent with simulated
isotropic datasets. We show however, that the anisotropic sky distribution of
the Pantheon SnIa data induces a preferred range of directions even in
simulated Pantheon data obtained in the context of isotropic $\Lambda$CDM. We
thus construct a more isotropically distributed subset of the Pantheon SnIa and
show that the preferred range of directions disappears. Using this subset we
again find no evidence for anisotropy using either the hemisphere comparison
method or the dipole fit method. In the context of the modified gravity
scenario, we allow for an evolving normalized Newton's constant consistent with
General Relativity (GR) at early and late times $\mu(z)=1+g_a z^2/(1+z)^2-g_a
z^4/(1+z)^4$ and fit for $g_a$ assuming $L\sim G_{\rm{eff}}^b$. For $b=-3/2$
indicated by previous studies we find $g_a=-0.47 \pm 0.36$ which is more than
$1.5\sigma$ away from the GR value of $g_a=0$. This weak hint for weaker

considerable progress recently. YIG thin film have spin wave (magnon) modes
with low dissipation and reliable control for quantum information processing.
However, the coherent coupling between a quantum device and YIG thin film has
yet been demonstrated. Here, we propose a scheme to achieve strong coupling
between superconducting flux qubits and magnon modes in YIG thin film. Unlike
the direct $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement factor in coupling to the Kittel mode or
other spin ensembles, with N the total number of spins, an additional spatial
dependent phase factor needs to be considered when the qubits are magnetically
coupled with the magnon modes of finite wavelength. To avoid undesirable
cancelation of coupling caused by the symmetrical boundary condition, a CoFeB
thin layer is added to one side of the YIG thin film to break the symmetry. Our
numerical simulation demonstrates avoided crossing and coherent transfer of
quantum information between the flux qubits and the standing spin waves in YIG
thin films. We show that the YIG thin film can be used as a tunable switch
between two flux qubits, which have modified shape with small direct inductive
coupling between them. Our results manifest that it is possible to couple flux
qubits while suppressing undesirable cross-talk.

factor, the number of processors, and the delay factor. We show that our
asynchronous parallel SGD algorithm also enjoys a global linear convergence
rate, similar to the {\em basic} method and the synchronous parallel method in
[35] for solving any arbitrary consistent linear system via stochastic
reformulation. We also show that our asynchronous parallel SGD improves upon
the {\em basic} method with a better convergence rate when the number of
processors is larger than four. We further show that this asynchronous approach
performs asymptotically better than its synchronous counterpart for certain
linear systems. Moreover, for certain linear systems, we compute the minimum
number of processors required for which our asynchronous parallel SGD is
better, and find that this number can be as low as two for some ill-conditioned

budgeted pruning, how to distribute the resources across layers (i.e., sparsity

searching for the layer-wise pruning ratios, which lacks efficiency. In this
paper, we propose Differentiable Sparsity Allocation (DSA), an efficient

process, DSA finds the layer-wise pruning ratios with gradient-based
optimization. It allocates sparsity in continuous space, which is more
efficient than methods based on discrete evaluation and search. Furthermore,
DSA could work in a pruning-from-scratch manner, whereas traditional budgeted
pruning methods are applied to pre-trained models. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that DSA could achieve superior performance than
current iterative budgeted pruning methods, and shorten the time cost of the
overall pruning process by at least 1.5x in the meantime.

novel design of protocols and receivers to enable efficient data transmission

reconstruction in dynamical systems that operates on spaces of probability
measures induced by observables of the system rather than directly in the
original data space of the observables themselves as in more conventional
methods. Our approach is based on the fact that orbits of a dynamical system
induce probability measures over the measurable space defined by (partial)
observations of the system. We equip the space of these probability measures
with a divergence, i.e., a distance between probability distributions, and use
this divergence to define a kernel integral operator. The eigenfunctions of
this operator create an orthonormal basis of functions that capture different
timescales of the dynamical system. One of our main results shows that the
evolution of the moments of the dynamics-dependent probability measures can be
related to a time-averaging operator on the original dynamical system. Using
this result, we show that the moments can be expanded in the eigenfunction
basis, thus opening up the avenue for nonparametric forecasting of the moments.
If the collection of probability measures is itself a manifold, we can in
addition equip the statistical manifold with the Riemannian metric and use
techniques from information geometry. We present applications to ergodic
dynamical systems on the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system, and show on a
real-world example that a small number of eigenvectors is sufficient to
reconstruct the moments (here the first four moments) of an atmospheric time
series, i.e., the realtime multivariate Madden-Julian oscillation index.

that includes quadratic cone programming as a special case. In this work we
consider a homogeneous embedding of the LCP, which encodes both the optimality
conditions of the original LCP as well as certificates of infeasibility. The
resulting problem can be expressed as a monotone inclusion problem involving
the sum of two maximal monotone operators, to which we apply Douglas-Rachford
splitting. The resulting algorithm has almost identical per-iteration cost as
applying the splitting to the LCP directly. Specifically, each iteration
requires solving a linear system and projecting onto a convex cone.
  The resulting algorithm has no explicit hyper-parameters and is able to
return a primal-dual solution should one exist or a certificate of
infeasibility otherwise. If a sequence of related problems are solved it can
easily be warm-started and make use of factorization caching of the linear

feasible problems our approach tends to be somewhat faster than applying
operator splitting directly to the LCP, and in cases of infeasibility our
approach can be significantly faster than alternative approaches based on

adversarial networks (GANs) and capsule network. In our model, generative and
discriminative networks play a novel competitive game, in which the generator
generates samples towards specific classes from multivariate probabilities
distribution. The discriminator of our model is designed in a way that while
recognizing the real and fake samples, it is also requires to assign classes to
the inputs. Since GAN approaches require fully observed data during training,
when the training samples are imbalanced, the approaches might generate similar
samples which leading to data overfitting. This problem is addressed by
providing all the available information from both the class components jointly
in the adversarial training. It improves learning from imbalanced data by
incorporating the majority distribution structure in the generation of new
minority samples. Furthermore, the generator is trained with feature matching
loss function to improve the training convergence. In addition, prevents
generation of outliers and does not affect majority class space. The
evaluations show the effectiveness of our proposed methodology; in particular,
the coalescing of capsule-GAN is effective at recognizing highly overlapping
classes with much fewer parameters compared with the convolutional-GAN.

to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak without increasing without control
its timescale. We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic
dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak $I_P$ can be achieved only
at the price of increasing the time $t_P$ of its occurrence and its entire
time-span $t_E$. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the
equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in
the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale
and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate $\alpha$ and by
increasing the removal rate $\beta$ by a factor of $\lambda$. We show that for
a given value of the size ($I_P$, the total, $I_E$ and average $\hat I_P$
number of infected), its occurrence time $t_P$ and entire time-span $t_E$ can
be reduced by a factor $1/\lambda$ if the reduction of $I$ is achieved by
increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus,
epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by
prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on
social distancing. We apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern
Italy. We show that the peak time $t_P$ and the entire time span $t_E$ could
have been reduced by a factor $0.9 \le 1/\lambda\le 0.34$ with containment

tight-binding system subject to environments are studied in this paper. We
identify specifically three kinds of bound states. The first is a discrete
bound state (DBS), of which the energy level exhibits a gap from the continuum.
The DBS exhibits the similar features of localization as the edge states in the
system and thus can suppress the decay of system. The second is a bound state
in the continuum (BIC), which can suppress the system decay too. It is found
that the BIC is intimately connected to the edge mode of the system since both
of them show almost the same features of localization and energy. The third one
displays a large gap from the continuum and behaves extendible (not localized).
Moreover the population of the system on this state decays partly but not all
of them does. This is different from the two former bound states. The time
evolution of a single excitation in the system is studied in order to
illustrate the influence of the bound states. We found that both DBS and BIC
play an important role in the time evolution, for example, the excitation
becomes localized and not decay depending on the overlap between the initial
state and the DBS or BIC. Furthermore we observe that the single excitation
takes a long-range hopping when the system falls into the regime of strong
localizations. This feature can be understood as the interplay of system
localizations and the bath-induced long-range correlation.

Ising machine based on spatial light modulation. We investigate the device
performance on systems with hundreds of individually-addressable spins with
all-to-all couplings and we found an increased success probability at a
specific noise level. The optimal noise amplitude depends on graph properties

complex energy landscapes and in avoiding trapping into local minima. The
result points out noise as a resource for optical computing. This concept,

energetically more advantageous structure when they are covalently attached on
one side of the sheet to carbon atoms forming opposite vertices of one hexagon
of valence bonds of the sheet. Attaching of OH groups to carbon atoms located
at the opposite vertices of hexagons of valence bonds leads to the emergence of
hydroxygraphene C$_4$(OH). In such sheet lying on a flat substrate, attached
oxygen atoms on its outer surface form a hexagonal lattice, and hydroxyl groups
due to their turns can in various ways form chains of hydrogen bonds. The
modification of the sheet from two sides results in forming of hydroxygraphene
C$_2$(OH) with HB networks on both sides of the graphene sheet. Simulation of
the dynamics of these sheets shows that their heat capacity at low temperatures
$T<T_0$ increases monotonously when the temperature rises, reaches its maximum
at $T=T_0$ and then decreases monotonically. The initial growth is caused by
the accumulation of orientational defects in the lattice of hydrogen bonds
whereas the decrease at $T>T_0$ is explained by the ""melting"" of the lattice.

indispensable part of the LF camera processing pipeline. The
high-dimensionality characteristic and complex geometrical structure of LF

performance of existing methods is still limited as they fail to thoroughly
explore the coherence among LF views and are insufficient in accurately
preserving the parallax structure of the scene. In this paper, we propose a
novel learning-based LF spatial SR framework, in which each view of an LF image
is first individually super-resolved by exploring the complementary information
among views with combinatorial geometry embedding. For accurate preservation of
the parallax structure among the reconstructed views, a regularization network
trained over a structure-aware loss function is subsequently appended to
enforce correct parallax relationships over the intermediate estimation. Our
proposed approach is evaluated over datasets with a large number of testing

the initial convolution layers of the CNN architecture. X-Vectors are used to
take advantage of the fact that this embedding is an efficient method to churn
out fixed dimension features from variable length speech utterances, something
which is challenging in plain CNN techniques, making it efficient both in terms
of speed and accuracy. Our approach uses the best of both worlds by combining
X-vector in the later layers while using SincNet filters in the initial layers
of our deep model. This approach allows the network to learn better embedding
and converge quicker. Previous works use either X-Vector or SincNet Filters or
some modifications, however we introduce a novel fusion architecture wherein we
have combined both the techniques to gather more information about the speech

represent gravitational field as principal bundle connection, and the other is
to represent gauge field as affine connection. Poincar\'{e} gauge theory and
metric-affine gauge theory adopt the first approach. This paper adopts the
second. In this approach:
  (i) Gauge field and gravitational field can both be represented by affine
connection; they can be described by a unified spatial frame.
  (ii) Time can be regarded as the total metric with respect to all dimensions
of internal coordinate space and external coordinate space. On-shell can be
regarded as gradient direction. Quantum theory can be regarded as a geometric
theory of distribution of gradient directions. Hence, gauge theory,
gravitational theory, and quantum theory all reflect intrinsic geometric
properties of manifold.
  (iii) Coupling constants, chiral asymmetry, PMNS mixing and CKM mixing arise
spontaneously as geometric properties in affine connection representation, so
they are not necessary to be regarded as direct postulates in the Lagrangian
anymore.
  (iv) The unification theory of gauge fields that are represented by affine
connection can avoid the problem that a proton decays into a lepton in theories
such as SU(5).
  (v) There exists a geometric interpretation to the color confinement of
quarks.
  In the affine connection representation, we can get better interpretations to
the above physical properties, therefore, to represent gauge fields by affine
connection is probably a necessary step towards the ultimate theory of physics.

applications like group expression recognition in crowd scenarios(station,
classroom etc.). Classifying a small size facial image into the right
expression category is still a challenging task. The main cause of this problem
is the loss of discriminative feature due to reduced resolution.
Super-resolution method is often used to enhance low-resolution images, but the
performance on FER task is limited when on images of very low resolution. In
this work, inspired by feature super-resolution methods for object detection,
we proposed a novel generative adversary network-based feature level
super-resolution method for robust facial expression recognition(FSR-FER). In
particular, a pre-trained FER model was employed as feature extractor, and a
generator network G and a discriminator network D are trained with features
extracted from images of low resolution and original high resolution. Generator
network G tries to transform features of low-resolution images to more
discriminative ones by making them closer to the ones of corresponding
high-resolution images. For better classification performance, we also proposed
an effective classification-aware loss re-weighting strategy based on the
classification probability calculated by a fixed FER model to make our model
focus more on samples that are easily misclassified. Experiment results on
Real-World Affective Faces (RAF) Database demonstrate that our method achieves
satisfying results on various down-sample factors with a single model and has
better performance on low-resolution images compared with methods using image

struggle to recognize rare classes in the presence of frequent classes. Often,
classes can be accompanied by side information like textual descriptions, but
it is not fully clear how to use them for learning with unbalanced long-tail
data. Such descriptions have been mostly used in (Generalized) Zero-shot
learning (ZSL), suggesting that ZSL with class descriptions may also be useful
for long-tail distributions. We describe DRAGON, a late-fusion architecture for
long-tail learning with class descriptors. It learns to (1) correct the bias
towards head classes on a sample-by-sample basis; and (2) fuse information from
class-descriptions to improve the tail-class accuracy. We also introduce new
benchmarks CUB-LT, SUN-LT, AWA-LT for long-tail learning with
class-descriptions, building on existing learning-with-attributes datasets and
a version of Imagenet-LT with class descriptors. DRAGON outperforms
state-of-the-art models on the new benchmark. It is also a new SoTA on existing

the whole ensemble will grow like $\sigma\sim t^{1/3}$ in a certain time

This thesis investigates the challenges of provisioning network security

The study is approached from the perspective of the telecom operator, whose

maximize the number of provisioned services, and thereby revenue. Specifically,
the overall aim of the research presented in this thesis is proposing novel
techniques for optimising the resource usage of software-based security
services, hence for increasing the chances for the operator to accommodate more
service requests while respecting the desired level of network security of its
customers. In this direction, the contributions of this thesis are the
following: (i) a solution for the dynamic provisioning of security services
that minimises the utilisation of computing and network resources, and (ii)
novel methods based on Deep Learning and Linux kernel technologies for reducing
the CPU usage of software-based security network functions, with specific focus
on the defence against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

question of how far we can reach with deep learning tools and tricks. Here, by
employing 2 state-of-the-art object detection benchmarks, and analyzing more
than 15 models over 4 large scale datasets, we I) carefully determine the upper
bound in AP, which is 91.6% on VOC (test2007), 78.2% on COCO (val2017), and
58.9% on OpenImages V4 (validation), regardless of the IOU threshold. These
numbers are much better than the mAP of the best model (47.9% on VOC, and 46.9%
on COCO; IOUs=.5:.05:.95), II) characterize the sources of errors in object
detectors, in a novel and intuitive way, and find that classification error
(confusion with other classes and misses) explains the largest fraction of
errors and weighs more than localization and duplicate errors, and III) analyze
the invariance properties of models when surrounding context of an object is
removed, when an object is placed in an incongruent background, and when images
are blurred or flipped vertically. We find that models generate a lot of boxes
on empty regions and that context is more important for detecting small objects
than larger ones. Our work taps into the tight relationship between object
detection and object recognition and offers insights for building better

maintaining strong privacy for vehicles prior to revocation events, even with
honest-but-curious system entities, (iii) and catering to computation and
communication constraints of on-board units with intermittent connectivity to

scheme radically reduces CRL distribution overhead: each vehicle receives CRLs
corresponding only to its region of operation and its actual trip duration.
Moreover, a ""fingerprint"" of CRL 'pieces' is attached to a subset of
(verifiable) pseudonyms for fast CRL 'piece' validation (while mitigating
resource depletion attacks abusing the CRL distribution). Our experimental
evaluation shows that our scheme is efficient, scalable, dependable, and
practical: with no more than 25 KB/s of traffic load, the latest CRL can be
delivered to 95% of the vehicles in a region (15 x 15 KM) within 15s, i.e.,

a crucial problem in both research and practice. In this paper, we address this
problem by building a probabilistic framework to model individual
spatiotemporal travel behavior data (e.g., trip records and trajectory data).
We develop a two-dimensional latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to
characterize the generative mechanism of spatiotemporal trip records of each
traveler. This model introduces two separate factor matrices for the spatial
dimension and the temporal dimension, respectively, and use a two-dimensional
core structure at the individual level to effectively model the joint
interactions and complex dependencies. This model can efficiently summarize
travel behavior patterns on both spatial and temporal dimensions from very
sparse trip sequences in an unsupervised way. In this way, complex travel
behavior can be modeled as a mixture of representative and interpretable
spatiotemporal patterns. By applying the trained model on future/unseen
spatiotemporal records of a traveler, we can detect her behavior anomalies by
scoring those observations using perplexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed modeling framework on a real-world license plate recognition
(LPR) data set. The results confirm the advantage of statistical learning
methods in modeling sparse individual travel behavior data. This type of
pattern discovery and anomaly detection applications can provide useful

presence of constant axial magnetic flux is explored. By extending the class of
fermionic solutions of the Dirac equation in the curved space of wormhole
surface to include normal modes with real energy and momentum, we found a
quantum selection rule for the scattering of fermion waves to the wormhole. The
newly found {\it momentum-angular momentum relation} implies that only fermion
with the quantized momentum $k=m'/a\sqrt{q}$ can be transmitted through the
hole. The allowed momentum is proportional to an effective angular momentum
quantum number $m'$ and inversely proportional to the radius of the throat of
the wormhole $a$. Flux dependence of the effective angular momentum quantum
number permits us to select fermions that can pass through according to their
momenta. A conservation law is also naturally enforced in terms of the
unitarity condition among the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. The
scattering involving quasinormal modes~(QNMs) of fermionic states in the
wormhole is subsequently explored. It is found that the transmitted waves
through the wormhole for all scenarios involving QNMs are mostly suppressed and
decaying in time. In the case of QNMs scattering, the unitarity condition is
violated but a more generic relation of the scattering coefficients is
established. When the magnetic flux $\phi=mhc/e$, i.e., quantized in units of
the magnetic flux quantum $hc/e$, the fermion will tunnel through the wormhole
with zero reflection.

privacy concerns when using private and sensitive data for training. A
conventional deep learning model is prone to privacy attacks that can recover
the sensitive information of individuals from either model parameters or
accesses to the target model. Recently, differential privacy that offers
provable privacy guarantees has been proposed to train neural networks in a
privacy-preserving manner to protect training data. However, many approaches
tend to provide the worst case privacy guarantees for model publishing,
inevitably impairing the accuracy of the trained models. In this paper, we
present a novel private knowledge transfer strategy, where the private teacher
trained on sensitive data is not publicly accessible but teaches a student to
be publicly released. In particular, a three-player
(teacher-student-discriminator) learning framework is proposed to achieve
trade-off between utility and privacy, where the student acquires the distilled
knowledge from the teacher and is trained with the discriminator to generate
similar outputs as the teacher. We then integrate a differential privacy
protection mechanism into the learning procedure, which enables a rigorous
privacy budget for the training. The framework eventually allows student to be
trained with only unlabelled public data and very few epochs, and hence
prevents the exposure of sensitive training data, while ensuring model utility
with a modest privacy budget. The experiments on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10
datasets show that our students obtain the accuracy losses w.r.t teachers of
0.89%, 2.29%, 5.16%, respectively with the privacy bounds of (1.93, 10^-5),
(5.02, 10^-6), (8.81, 10^-6). When compared with the existing works
