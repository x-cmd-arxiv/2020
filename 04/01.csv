general hybrid systems with a subset of safety and reachability specifications.
The framework uses genetic programming to automatically co-synthesize
controllers and candidate Lyapunov-like functions. These candidate
Lyapunov-like functions are used to formally verify the control specification,
and their correctness is proven using a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver.
The advantages of this approach are: no restriction is made to polynomial
systems, the synthesized controllers are expressed as compact expressions, and
no explicit solution structure has to be specified beforehand. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework in several case studies, including
nonpolynomial systems, sampled-data systems, systems with bounded
uncertainties, switched systems, and systems with jumps. osed framework in

pretraining for vision. We investigate what factors may play a role in the
utility of these pretraining methods for practitioners. To do this, we evaluate
various self-supervised algorithms across a comprehensive array of synthetic
datasets and downstream tasks. We prepare a suite of synthetic data that
enables an endless supply of annotated images as well as full control over
dataset difficulty. Our experiments offer insights into how the utility of
self-supervision changes as the number of available labels grows as well as how
the utility changes as a function of the downstream task and the properties of
the training data. We also find that linear evaluation does not correlate with

  Machine Translation",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  New machine translations (MT) technologies are emerging rapidly and with
them, bold claims of achieving human parity such as: (i) the results produced
approach ""accuracy achieved by average bilingual human translators"" (Wu et al.,
2017b) or (ii) the ""translation quality is at human parity when compared to
professional human translators"" (Hassan et al., 2018) have seen the light of
day (Laubli et al., 2018). Aside from the fact that many of these papers craft
their own definition of human parity, these sensational claims are often not
supported by a complete analysis of all aspects involved in translation.
Establishing the discrepancies between the strengths of statistical approaches
to MT and the way humans translate has been the starting point of our research.
By looking at MT output and linguistic theory, we were able to identify some
remaining issues. The problems range from simple number and gender agreement
errors to more complex phenomena such as the correct translation of aspectual
values and tenses. Our experiments confirm, along with other studies
(Bentivogli et al., 2016), that neural MT has surpassed statistical MT in many
aspects. However, some problems remain and others have emerged. We cover a
series of problems related to the integration of specific linguistic features
into statistical and neural MT, aiming to analyse and provide a solution to
some of them. Our work focuses on addressing three main research questions that
revolve around the complex relationship between linguistics and MT in general.
We identify linguistic information that is lacking in order for automatic
translation systems to produce more accurate translations and integrate
additional features into the existing pipelines. We identify overgeneralization
or 'algorithmic bias' as a potential drawback of neural MT and link it to many
of the remaining linguistic issues.

proposed to quantify the information freshness in time-critical IoT
applications. Due to a large number of devices in future IoT networks, the
decentralized channel access protocols (e.g. random access) are preferable
thanks to their low network overhead. Built on the AoI concept, some recent
efforts have developed several AoI-oriented ALOHA-like random access protocols
for boosting the network-wide information freshness. However, all relevant

implementation of a working prototype to evaluate and further improve these

such, we build a software-defined radio (SDR) prototype for testing and
comparing the performance of recently proposed AoI-oriented random access
protocols. To this end, we implement a time-slotted wireless system by devising
a simple yet effective over-the-air time synchronization scheme, in which
beacons that serve as reference timing packets are broadcast by an access point
from time to time. For a complete working prototype, we also design the frame
structures of various packets exchanged within the system. Finally, we design a

effectiveness for several computer vision tasks. A good augmentation produces
an augmented dataset that adds variability while retaining the statistical
properties of the original dataset. Some techniques, such as AutoAugment and
Fast AutoAugment, have introduced a search phase to find a set of suitable
augmentation policies for a given model and dataset. This comes at the cost of
great computational overhead, adding up to several thousand GPU hours. More
recently RandAugment was proposed to substantially speedup the search phase by
approximating the search space by a couple of hyperparameters, but still
incurring non-negligible cost for tuning those. In this paper we show that,
under the assumption that the augmentation space is approximately distribution
invariant, a uniform sampling over the continuous space of augmentation
transformations is sufficient to train highly effective models. Based on that
result we propose UniformAugment, an automated data augmentation approach that
completely avoids a search phase. In addition to discussing the theoretical

we explore a novel approach, based on a state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning
(RL) algorithm, which is capable of significantly reducing the heat transport
in a two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard system by applying small temperature
fluctuations to the lower boundary of the system. By using numerical
simulations, we show that our RL-based control is able to stabilize the
conductive regime and bring the onset of convection up to a Rayleigh number

$Ra_{c}=1708$. Additionally, for $Ra > 3 \cdot 10^4$, our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art control algorithms reducing the heat flux by a factor of
about $2.5$. In the last part of the manuscript, we address theoretical limits
connected to controlling an unstable and chaotic dynamics as the one considered
here. We show that controllability is hindered by observability and/or
capabilities of actuating actions, which can be quantified in terms of

deletion of the final vector from the frame, and selection of the first vector.
The long homotopy sequence for this fibration implies that the equivalence
classes of loops form the group of two elements. One generator of this group is
a circle of Givens rotations. Dimension three is critical for the proof. It is
handled by the Rodrigues formula, together with Invariance of Domain. Another
explicit proof that the mapping from unit quaternions is surjective to the main

connected, using the Homotopy Lifting Theorem for coverings. But the Givens
loop performs an identity lifting, so it cannot be the group generator. As an
application we review how quoted algorithms from the astronautical literature,

covering a total of 8600 $km$ using a 300 $kHz$ Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler (ADCP). The cruises are distributed over multiple seasons and regions
of the Bay. Horizontal wavenumber spectra of these currents over depths of
12--54 m and wavelengths from 2--400 km were decomposed into vortical and
divergent components assuming isotropy. An average of across and along track
spectra over all cruises shows that the spectral slope of horizontal kinetic
energy for wavelengths of 10--80 $km$ scales with an exponent of $-1.7 \pm
0.05$, which transitions to steeper scaling for wavelengths above 80 $km$. The
rotational component is significantly larger than the divergent component at
scales greater than 80 $km$, while the two are comparable for smaller
wavelengths. The measurements show a fair amount of variability and spectral
levels vary between cruises by about a factor of 5 over 10--100 $km$. Velocity
differences over 10--80 $km$ show probability density functions and structure
functions with stretched exponential behavior and anomalous scaling.
Comparisons with the Garrett-Munk internal wave spectrum indicate that
inertia-gravity waves account for only a small fraction of the kinetic energy
except at the smallest scales. These constraints suggest that the near-surface

  Nonconvex Optimization",,,,,"cs.MA cs.LG eess.SP math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rapid advances in data collection and processing capabilities have allowed
for the use of increasingly complex models that give rise to nonconvex
optimization problems. These formulations, however, can be arbitrarily
difficult to solve in general, in the sense that even simply verifying that a
given point is a local minimum can be NP-hard [1]. Still, some relatively
simple algorithms have been shown to lead to surprisingly good empirical
results in many contexts of interest. Perhaps the most prominent example is the
success of the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks. Several
recent works have pursued rigorous analytical justification for this phenomenon
by studying the structure of the nonconvex optimization problems and
establishing that simple algorithms, such as gradient descent and its
variations, perform well in converging towards local minima and avoiding
saddle-points. A key insight in these analyses is that gradient perturbations
play a critical role in allowing local descent algorithms to efficiently
distinguish desirable from undesirable stationary points and escape from the
latter. In this article, we cover recent results on second-order guarantees for
stochastic first-order optimization algorithms in centralized, federated, and
decentralized architectures.

solutions to real-world challenges including forecasting epidemics and planning

enabling the analysis of large-scale data-sets of digital traces. One of the
challenges when pre-processing spatial trajectories is the so-called stop
location detection, that entails the reduction of raw time series to sequences
of destinations where an individual was stationary. The most widely adopted
solution to this problem was proposed by Hariharan and Toyama (2004) and
involves filtering out non-stationary measurements, then applying agglomerative
clustering on the stationary points. This state-of-the-art solution, however,
suffers of two limitations: (i) frequently visited places located very close
(such as adjacent buildings) are likely to be merged into a unique location,
due to inherent measurement noise, (ii) traces for multiple users can not be
analysed simultaneously, thus the definition of destination is not shared
across users. In this paper, we describe the Infostop algorithm that overcomes
the limitations of the state-of-the-art solution by leveraging the flow-based
network community detection algorithm Infomap. We test Infostop for a
population of $\sim 1000$ individuals with highly overlapping mobility. We show
that the size of locations detected by Infostop saturates for increasing number
of users and that time complexity grows slower than for previous solutions. We
demonstrate that Infostop can be used to easily infer social meetings. Finally,
we provide an open-source implementation of Infostop, written in Python and

in which a defect is attributed to an artifact, e.g., a class of a given
release. However, the creation of such datasets is far from being perfect. It
can happen that a defect is discovered several releases after its introduction:
this phenomenon has been called ""dormant defects"". This means that, if we
observe today the status of a class in its current version, it can be
considered as defect-free while this is not the case. We call ""snoring"" the
noise consisting of such classes, affected by dormant defects only. We
conjecture that the presence of snoring negatively impacts the classifiers'
accuracy and their evaluation. Moreover, earlier releases likely contain more
snoring classes than older releases, thus, removing the most recent releases
from a dataset could reduce the snoring effect and improve the accuracy of
classifiers. In this paper we investigate the impact of the snoring noise on
classifiers' accuracy and their evaluation, and the effectiveness of a possible
countermeasure consisting in removing the last releases of data. We analyze the
accuracy of 15 machine learning defect prediction classifiers on data from more
than 4,000 bugs and 600 releases of 19 open source projects from the Apache
ecosystem. Our results show that, on average across projects: (i) the presence
of snoring decreases the recall of defect prediction classifiers; (ii)
evaluations affected by snoring are likely unable to identify the best
classifiers, and (iii) removing data from recent releases helps to
significantly improve the accuracy of the classifiers. On summary, this paper
provides insights on how to create a software defect dataset by mitigating the
effect of snoring.

under-/over-utilization on the component services, which can consequently
affect the overall Quality of Service (QoS), such as latency. Self-adaptive
services composition rectifies this problem, but poses several challenges: (i)
the effectiveness of adaptation can deteriorate due to over-optimistic
assumptions on the latency and utilization constraints, at both local and
global levels; and (ii) the benefits brought by each composition plan is often
short term and is not often designed for long-term benefits -- a natural
prerequisite for sustaining the system. To tackle these issues, we propose a
two levels constraint reasoning framework for sustainable self-adaptive
services composition, called DATESSO. In particular, DATESSO consists of a re
ned formulation that differentiates the ""strictness"" for latency/utilization
constraints in two levels. To strive for long-term benefits, DATESSO leverages
the concept of technical debt and time-series prediction to model the utility
contribution of the component services in the composition. The approach embeds
a debt-aware two level constraint reasoning algorithm in DATESSO to improve the
efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of self-adaptive service
composition. We evaluate DATESSO on a service-based system with real-world
WS-DREAM dataset and comparing it with other state-of-the-art approaches. The
results demonstrate the superiority of DATESSO over the others on the
utilization, latency and running time whilst likely to be more sustainable.

supersymmetric partition functions of SCFTs on curved manifolds via
localization. The twisted partition function on product manifolds of the form
$S^1 \times \Sigma_g$, where $\Sigma_g$ is a two-dimensional Riemann surface,
is of particular relevance due to its role in the microstate counting for
magnetic static AdS$_4$ black holes realizing the topological twist. We review
here supergravity solutions having as conformal boundary more general 3d
manifolds. We first focus on solutions (AdS-Taub-NUT and AdS-Taub-Bolt) having
as boundary a circle bundle over $\Sigma_g$, showing the matching of their
on-shell action with the large $N$ limit of the partition function of the dual
CFT. We then discuss some recent results for a challenging example, which
involves the refinement by angular momentum. The gravitational backgrounds in
this case are rotating supersymmetric AdS$_4$ black holes. We review the
salient features of two different classes of such solutions in theories of
supergravity with uplift in M-theory, and comment on the current status of
their entropy counting in the dual CFT.

studies investigating the statistics of these explosive events. In this study,
we present a statistical analysis of stellar flares on solar-type stars made
using photometric data in 2-min cadence from $\it TESS$ of the whole southern
hemisphere (sectors 1 - 13). We derive rotational periods for all stars in our
sample from rotational modulations present in the lightcurve as a result of
large starspot(s) on the surface. We identify 1980 stellar flares from 209
solar-type stars with energies in the range of $10^{31} - 10^{36}$erg (using
the solar flare classification, this corresponds to X1 - X100,000) and conduct
an analysis into their properties. We investigate the rotational phase of the
flares and find no preference for any phase suggesting the flares are randomly
distributed. As a benchmark, we use GOES data of solar flares to detail the
close relationship between solar flares and sunspots. In addition, we also
calculate approximate spot areas for each of our stars and compare this to
flare number, rotational phase, and flare energy. Additionally, two of our
stars were observed in the continuous viewing zone with lightcurves spanning
one year, as a result, we examine the stellar variability of these stars in
more detail.

Many of these solutions threaten individual rights and privacy. Our goal is to
break past the false dichotomy of effective versus privacy-preserving contact
tracing. We offer an alternative approach to assess and communicate users' risk

proposal uses recent GPS location histories, which are transformed and
encrypted, and a private set intersection protocol to interface with a
semi-trusted authority.
  There have been other recent proposals for privacy-preserving contact
tracing, based on Bluetooth and decentralization, that could further eliminate
the need for trust in authority. However, solutions with Bluetooth are
currently limited to certain devices and contexts while decentralization adds
complexity. The goal of this work is two-fold: we aim to propose a
location-based system that is more privacy-preserving than what is currently
being adopted by governments around the world, and that is also practical to
implement with the immediacy needed to stem a viral outbreak.

the design of data representation process which includes (1) a learnable

optimization of parameters used for extracting the arrival time of waveforms,
in particular those generated by the detection of 511 keV annihilation
gamma-rays by a 60 cm3 coaxial high purity germanium detector (HPGe). The
method utilizes a type of artificial neural network (ANN) called a
self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster the HPGe waveforms based on the shape of
their rising edges. The optimal timing parameters for HPGe waveforms belonging
to a particular cluster are found by minimizing the time difference between the
HPGe signal and a signal produced by a BaF2 scintillation detector. Applying
these variable timing parameters to the HPGe signals achieved a
gamma-coincidence timing resolution of ~ 4.3 ns at the 511 keV photo peak
(defined as 511 +- 50 keV) and a timing resolution of ~ 6.5 ns for the entire
gamma spectrum--without rejecting any valid pulses. This timing resolution
approaches the best obtained by analog nuclear electronics, without the
corresponding complexities of analog optimization procedures. We further
demonstrate the universality and efficacy of the machine learning approach by
applying the method to the generation of secondary electron time-of-flight
spectra following the implantation of energetic positrons on a sample.

noise to the output of a function evaluated on a sensitive dataset.
Unfortunately, using a continuous distribution presents several practical
challenges. First and foremost, finite computers cannot exactly represent
samples from continuous distributions, and previous work has demonstrated that
seemingly innocuous numerical errors can entirely destroy privacy. Moreover,
when the underlying data is itself discrete (e.g., population counts), adding
continuous noise makes the result less interpretable.
  With these shortcomings in mind, we introduce and analyze the discrete
Gaussian in the context of differential privacy. Specifically, we theoretically
and experimentally show that adding discrete Gaussian noise provides
essentially the same privacy and accuracy guarantees as the addition of
continuous Gaussian noise. We also present an simple and efficient algorithm
for exact sampling from this distribution. This demonstrates its applicability
for privately answering counting queries, or more generally, low-sensitivity
integer-valued queries.

star can fuel unstable thermonuclear flashes known as Type I X-ray bursts.
Simulating these events using computational models can provide valuable
information about the nature of the accreting system. One-dimensional (1D)
astrophysics codes with large nuclear reaction networks are the current
state-of-the-art for simulating X-ray bursts. These codes can track the
evolution of isotopes through thousands of nuclear reaction pathways, to
predict the released nuclear energy and final composition of the ashes. In this
thesis, I make extensive use of KEPLER, a 1D code at the forefront of these
efforts. I first present improvements to the setup and analysis of KEPLER burst
models. By accounting for nuclear heating in the initial conditions, I shorten
the thermal burn-in time, thereby reducing computational expense and producing
more consistent burst trains. To model bursts fueled by transient accretion
events, I perform the first such simulations with fully time-dependent
accretion rates. Building upon previous efforts to model the ""Clocked Burster"",
GS 1826$-$238, I precompute a grid of 3840 simulations and sample the
interpolated results using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. By
comparing the predictions to multi-epoch observations, I obtain posterior
probability distributions for the system parameters. I then extend these MCMC
methods to the pure-helium burster, 4U 1820$-$30, using a grid of 168
simulations. Finally, I discuss potential improvements for future studies, to
further develop the computational modelling of accreting neutron stars.

attempt to measure the 21cm transition of neutral hydrogen during the epochs of
reionization and the cosmic dawn (and potentially the tail end of the dark

$-4^{\circ}\pm 7^{\circ}$ at $4.5~\mu$m. The discrepancy in circulation
patterns between these three otherwise similar planets points to the importance

presence or absence of clouds, in determining atmospheric conditions on hot

majority of N132D's optically bright oxygen ejecta are arranged in a torus-like
geometry tilted approximately 28$^{\circ}$ with respect to the plane of the
sky. The torus has a radius of 4.4 pc ($D_{\rm LMC}$/50 kpc), exhibits a
blue-shifted radial velocity asymmetry of $-3000$ to $+2300$ km s$^{-1}$, and
has a conspicuous break in its circumference. Assuming homologous expansion
from the geometric center of O-rich filaments, the average expansion velocity
of 1745 km s$^{-1}$ translates to an age since explosion of 2450 $\pm$ 195 yr.
A faint, spatially-separated ""runaway knot"" (RK) with total space velocity of
3650 km s$^{-1}$ is nearly perpendicular to the torus plane and coincident with
X-ray emission that is substantially enhanced in Si relative to the LMC and
N132D's bulk ejecta. These kinematic and chemical signatures suggest that the
RK may have had its origin deep within the progenitor star. Overall, the main
shell morphology and high-velocity, Si-enriched components of N132D have
remarkable similarity with that of Cassiopeia A, which was the result of a Type
IIb supernova explosion. Our results underscore the need for further
observations and simulations that can robustly reconcile whether the observed
morphology is dominated by explosion dynamics or shaped by interaction with the

star population and Galactic globular clusters (GCs) using a dataset that
combines information from the $\rm{\it Gaia}$ space mission and the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV, DR14). Moreover, we incorporated a sample of halo
giant stars with a distinct chemical signature (strong CN bandheads) that
resembles the light-elements anomaly otherwise only seen in the second
generation of GC stellar populations. Using three different tagging techniques,
we could successfully establish unique associations between 151 extratidal
stars in the neighborhood of eight GCs. In addition, we traced the possible
origin of about $62\%$ of the sample of CN-strong giants to their potential
host clusters. Several of the involved GCs have been brought into connection
with the Gaia-Enceladus and Sequoia merger events. By establishing kinematic
and chemical connections between 17 CN-strong stars and their surrounding
fields, we could identify co-moving groups of stars at the same [Fe/H] with a
possible cluster origin. We found strong evidence that four CN-strong stars and
their associates are connected to the Sagittarius stream whilst their tightly
confined [Fe/H] may hint to a birth site in M 54. Finally, we provide tentative
estimates for the fraction of first-generation cluster stars among all stars
lost to the halo. In the immediate cluster vicinity, this value amounts to
$50.0\pm16.7\%$ while the associations in the halo field rather imply
$80.2_{-5.2}^{+4.9}\%$. We speculate that -- if proven real by spectroscopic
follow-up -- the disparity between these numbers could indicate a major
contribution of low-mass clusters to the overall number of stars escaped to the
halo or, alternatively, point toward a strong mass loss from the first
generation during early cluster dissolution. [abridged]

of compact binaries and binary mergers. Common envelope (CE) evolution, which
plays a major role in the evolution of compact binary systems, can similarly
play a key role in the evolution of triples. Here we use hydrodynamical
simulations coupled with few-body dynamics to provide the first detailed models
of triple common envelope (TCE) evolution. We focus on the circumstellar case,
where the envelope of an evolved giant engulfs a compact binary orbiting the
giant, which then in-spirals into the core of the evolved star. Through our
exploratory modeling we find several possible outcomes of such TCE: (1) The
merger of the binary inside the third star's envelope; (2) The disruption of
the in-spiraling binary following its plunge, leading to a chaotic triple
dynamics of the stellar-core and the two components of the former disrupted
binary. The chaotic evolution typically leads to the in-spiral and merger of at
least one of the former binary components with the core, and sometimes to the
ejection of the second, or alternatively its further now-binary common-envelope
evolution. The in-spiral in TCE leads to overall slower in-spiral, larger mass
ejection and the production of more aspherical remnant, compared with a
corresponding binary case of similar masses, due to the energy/momentum
extraction from the inner-binary. We expect TCE to play a key role in producing
various types of stellar-mergers and unique compact binary systems, and
potentially induce transient electromagnetic and gravitational-wave sources.

Hubble time, condensation of the ambient central gas is regulated by a heating
mechanism, probably an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Previous analytical work
has suggested that certain radial distributions of heat input may result in
convergence to a quasi-steady global state that does not substantively change
on the timescale for radiative cooling, even if the heating and cooling are not
locally in balance. To test this hypothesis, we simulate idealized galaxy
cluster halos using the \ENZO code with an idealized, spherically symmetric
heat-input kernel intended to emulate. Thermal energy is distributed with
radius according to a range of kernels, in which total heating is updated to
match total cooling every $10 ~\text{Myr}$. Some heating kernels can maintain
quasi-steady global configurations, but no kernel we tested produces a
quasi-steady state with central entropy as low as those observed in cool-core
clusters. The general behavior of the simulations depends on the proportion of
heating in the inner $10 ~\text{kpc}$, with low central heating leading to
central cooling catastrophes, high central heating creating a central
convective zone with an inverted entropy gradient, and intermediate central
heating resulting in a flat central entropy profile that exceeds observations.
The timescale on which our simulated halos fall into an unsteady multiphase
state is proportional to the square of the cooling time of the lowest entropy
gas, allowing more centrally concentrated heating to maintain a longer lasting
steady state.

regardless of morphology. Thus, at fixed stellar mass, spheroids and discs
share similar assembly histories, both in terms of the frequency of mergers and
the distribution of their mass ratios. Since mergers are the principal drivers
of disc-to-spheroid morphological transformation, and the most massive galaxies
typically have the richest merger histories, it is surprising that discs exist
at all at the highest stellar masses (e.g. beyond the knee of the mass
function). Using Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydro-dynamical simulation, we
show that extremely massive (M*> 10^11.4 MSun) discs are created via two
channels. In the primary channel (accounting for ~70% of these systems and ~8%
of massive galaxies) the most recent, significant merger (stellar mass ratio >
1:10) between a massive spheroid and a gas-rich satellite `spins up' the
spheroid by creating a new rotational stellar component, leaving a massive disc
as the remnant. In the secondary channel (accounting for ~30% of these systems
and ~3% of massive galaxies), a system maintains a disc throughout its
lifetime, due to an anomalously quiet merger history. Not unexpectedly, the
fraction of massive discs is larger at higher redshift, due to the Universe
being more gas-rich. The morphological mix of galaxies at the highest stellar
masses is, therefore, a strong function of the gas fraction of the Universe.
Finally, these massive discs have similar black-hole masses and accretion rates
to massive spheroids, providing a natural explanation for why a minority of
powerful AGN are surprisingly found in disc galaxies.

As a prime example, it remains a pressing open question to decipher the
$X(3872)$ state between two popular exotic configurations: a loose hadronic
molecule or a compact tetraquark. We demonstrate a novel approach to help
address this problem by studying the $X(3872)$ production in heavy ion
collisions, where a hot fireball with ample light as well as charm
(anti-)quarks is available for producing the exotics. Adopting a multiphase
transport model (AMPT) for describing such collisions and implementing
appropriate production mechanism of either molecule or tetraquark picture, we
compute and compare a series of observables for $X(3872)$ in Pb-Pb collisions
at the Large Hadron Collider. We find the fireball volume plays a crucial role,
leading to a 2-order-of-magnitude difference in the $X(3872)$ yield and a
markedly different centrality dependence between hadronic molecules and compact
tetraquarks, thus offering a unique opportunity for distinguishing the two
scenarios. We also make the first prediction of $X(3872)$ elliptic flow
coefficient to be tested by future experimental measurements.

(volumetric) coverage using test light curves of on- and off-axis gamma-ray
bursts and kilonovae. In cases where the source region was observable
immediately, GOTO-4 was able to respond to a GW alert in less than a minute.
The average time of first observation was $8.79$ hours after receiving an alert
($9.90$ hours after trigger). A mean of $732.3$ square degrees were tiled per
event, representing on average $45.3$ per cent of the LVC probability map, or
$70.3$ per cent of the observable probability. This coverage will further
improve as the facility scales up alongside the localisation performance of the
evolving gravitational-wave detector network. Even in its 4-telescope prototype

200~Mpc in favourable observing conditions. We cannot currently place

classified as observationally hostless due to their lack of strong host
associations. It has been argued that these hostless SGRBs could be an
indication of the large distances traversed by the binary neutron star system
(due to natal kicks) between its formation and its merger (leading to a SGRB).
The distances of GRBs from their host galaxies can be indirectly probed by the
surrounding circumburst densities. We show that a lower limit on those

$\lesssim16\%$ of short GRBs in our sample took place at densities

values at distances greater than the host galaxy's virial radii. We find that

character whose facial expression can be adjusted with simple controller
gestures according to the perceived affective state to capture valence and
arousal scores. It was tested against the questionnaires Pick-A-Mood (PAM) and
Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) in an experiment in which the participants (N =
32) watched several one-minute excerpts from music videos of the DEAP database
within a virtual environment and assessed their mood after each clip. The
experiment showed a high correlation with regard to valence, but only a
moderate one with regard to arousal. No statistically significant differences
were found between the SAM ratings of this experiment and MAM, but between the
valence values of MAM and the DEAP database and between the arousal values of
MAM and PAM. In terms of user experience, MAM and PAM hardly differ.
Furthermore, the experiment showed that assessments inside virtual environments
are significantly faster than with paper-pencil methods, where media devices
such as headphones and display goggles must be put on and taken off.

estimation in the discrete orbit recovery model with Gaussian noise. This model
is motivated by applications in molecular microscopy and image processing,
where each measurement of an unknown object is subject to an independent random
rotation from a rotational group. Equivalently, it is a Gaussian mixture model
where the mixture centers belong to a group orbit.
  We show that fundamental properties of the likelihood landscape depend on the
signal-to-noise ratio and the group structure. At low noise, this landscape is
""benign"" for any discrete group, possessing no spurious local optima and only
strict saddle points. At high noise, this landscape may develop spurious local
optima, depending on the specific group. We discuss several positive and
negative examples, and provide a general condition that ensures a globally
benign landscape. For cyclic permutations of coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^d$
(multi-reference alignment), there may be spurious local optima when $d \geq
6$, and we establish a correspondence between these local optima and those of a
surrogate function of the phase variables in the Fourier domain.
  We show that the Fisher information matrix transitions from resembling that
of a single Gaussian in low noise to having a graded eigenvalue structure in
high noise, which is determined by the graded algebra of invariant polynomials
under the group action. In a local neighborhood of the true object, the
likelihood landscape is strongly convex in a reparametrized system of variables
given by a transcendence basis of this polynomial algebra. We discuss
implications for optimization algorithms, including slow convergence of
expectation-maximization, and possible advantages of momentum-based
acceleration and variable reparametrization for first- and second-order descent

luminosity are both efficiently enhanced by the MC process. In this paper, we
study the structure, luminosity, MeV neutrinos, and gravitational waves (GWs)

mechanisms are present. The results indict that the BZ mechanism will compete
with the neutrino annihilation luminosity to trigger jets under the different
partitions of the two magnetic mechanisms. The typical neutrino luminosity and
annihilation luminosity of MNDAFs are definitely higher than those of NDAFs.
The typical peak energy of neutrino spectra of MNDAFs is higher than that of
NDAFs, but similar to those of core-collapse supernovae. Moreover, if the MC
process is dominant, then the GWs originating from the anisotropic neutrino
emission will be stronger particularly for discs with high accretion rates.

We argue
that the path to developing artificial human-like-intelligence will pass
through mimicking the evolutionary process in a nature-like simulation. In
Nature, there are two processes driving the development of the brain: evolution
and learning. Evolution acts slowly, across generations, and amongst other
things, it defines what agents learn by changing their internal reward
function. Learning acts fast, across one's lifetime, and it quickly updates
agents' policy to maximise pleasure and minimise pain. The reward function is
slowly aligned with the fitness function by evolution, however, as agents
evolve the environment and its fitness function also change, increasing the
misalignment between reward and fitness. It is extremely computationally
expensive to replicate these two processes in simulation. This work proposes
Evolution via Evolutionary Reward (EvER) that allows learning to
single-handedly drive the search for policies with increasingly evolutionary
fitness by ensuring the alignment of the reward function with the fitness
function. In this search, EvER makes use of the whole state-action trajectories
that agents go through their lifetime. In contrast, current evolutionary
algorithms discard this information and consequently limit their potential
efficiency at tackling sequential decision problems. We test our algorithm in
two simple bio-inspired environments and show its superiority at generating
more capable agents at surviving and reproducing their genes when compared with
a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm.

of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) when being trained to synthesize
images. However, it is difficult to use these learned semantics for real image
editing. A common practice of feeding a real image to a trained GAN generator
is to invert it back to a latent code. However, existing inversion methods
typically focus on reconstructing the target image by pixel values yet fail to
land the inverted code in the semantic domain of the original latent space. As
a result, the reconstructed image cannot well support semantic editing through
varying the inverted code. To solve this problem, we propose an in-domain GAN
inversion approach, which not only faithfully reconstructs the input image but
also ensures the inverted code to be semantically meaningful for editing. We
first learn a novel domain-guided encoder to project a given image to the
native latent space of GANs. We then propose domain-regularized optimization by
involving the encoder as a regularizer to fine-tune the code produced by the
encoder and better recover the target image. Extensive experiments suggest that
our inversion method achieves satisfying real image reconstruction and more
importantly facilitates various image editing tasks, significantly
outperforming start-of-the-arts.

representations, while preserving important semantic information about the
inputs. Pre-training embeddings on a large amount of unlabeled data and
fine-tuning them for downstream tasks is now a de facto standard in achieving
state of the art learning in many domains.
  We demonstrate that embeddings, in addition to encoding generic semantics,
often also present a vector that leaks sensitive information about the input
data. We develop three classes of attacks to systematically study information
that might be leaked by embeddings. First, embedding vectors can be inverted to
partially recover some of the input data. As an example, we show that our
attacks on popular sentence embeddings recover between 50\%--70\% of the input
words (F1 scores of 0.5--0.7). Second, embeddings may reveal sensitive
attributes inherent in inputs and independent of the underlying semantic task
at hand. Attributes such as authorship of text can be easily extracted by
training an inference model on just a handful of labeled embedding vectors.
Third, embedding models leak moderate amount of membership information for
infrequent training data inputs. We extensively evaluate our attacks on various
state-of-the-art embedding models in the text domain. We also propose and
evaluate defenses that can prevent the leakage to some extent at a minor cost

external forces in complex modular networks. The motivation is the neuronal
dynamics that takes place during information processing in the neural cortex.
The neuron organization is modular, with clusters associated to different
functions and brain structures, and need to constantly respond to external
stimuli. We study the behavior of forced Kuramoto oscillators where only a
fraction of them is subjected to a periodic external force. When all
oscillators receive the external drive the system always synchronize with the
periodic force if its intensity is sufficiently large. We show that the
conditions for global synchronization depend on the fraction of nodes being
forced and on network topology, strength of internal couplings and intensity of
external forcing. We develop numerical and analytical calculations for the
critical force for global synchronization as a function of the fraction of
forced oscillators. As an application we study the response of the electric
junction \textit{C. elegans} network to external stimuli using the partially
forced Kuramoto model. Stimuli were applied to topological modules, to ganglia,
specified by their anatomical localization, and to the functional groups
(sensory and motoneurons). We found that topological modules do not contain
purely anamotical groups or functional classes, and that stimulating different
classes of neurons lead to very different responses, measured in terms of
synchronization and phase velocity correlations. In all cases the modular
structure hindered full synchronization, protecting the system from seizures.
The responses to stimuli applied to topological and functional modules showed
pronounced patterns of correlation or anti-correlation with other modules that
were not observed when the stimulus was applied to a ganglion with mixed
functional neurons.

complex, dynamical systems are typically deemed convenient, but ultimately
reducible to a complete causal account of the underlying micro constituents.
Yet, such a reductionist perspective is hard to square with several issues
related to autonomy and agency: (1) agents require (causal) borders that
separate them from the environment, (2) at least in a biological context,
agents are associated with macroscopic systems, and (3) agents are supposed to
act upon their environment. Integrated information theory (IIT) (Oizumi et al.,
2014) offers a quantitative account of causation based on a set of causal
principles, including notions such as causal specificity, composition, and
irreducibility, that challenges the reductionist perspective in multiple ways.
First, the IIT formalism provides a complete account of a system's causal
structure, including irreducible higher-order mechanisms constituted of
multiple system elements. Second, a system's amount of integrated information
($\Phi$) measures the causal constraints a system exerts onto itself and can
peak at a macro level of description (Hoel et al., 2016; Marshall et al.,
2018). Finally, the causal principles of IIT can also be employed to identify
and quantify the actual causes of events (""what caused what""), such as an
agent's actions (Albantakis et al., 2019). Here, we demonstrate this framework
by example of a simulated agent, equipped with a small neural network, that
forms a maximum of $\Phi$ at a macro scale.

electrons with independently distributed random hopping and no on-site
potential (i.e. off-diagonal disorder with particle-hole symmetry, leading to
sub-lattice symmetry, for each realization). For non-singular distributions of
the hopping, it is known that the model exhibits a universal, singular behavior
of the density of states $\rho(E) \sim 1/|E \ln^3|E||$ and of the localization
length $\xi(E) \sim |\ln|E||$, near the band center $E = 0$. (This singular
behavior is also applicable to random XY and Heisenberg spin chains; it was
first obtained by Dyson for a specific random harmonic oscillator chain).
Simultaneously, the state at $E = 0$ shows a universal, sub-exponential decay
at large distances $\sim \exp [ -\sqrt{r/r_0} ]$. In this study, we consider
singular, but normalizable, distributions of hopping, whose behavior at small
$t$ is of the form $\sim 1/ [t \ln^{\lambda+1}(1/t) ]$, characterized by a
single, continuously tunable parameter $\lambda > 0$. We find, using a
combination of analytic and numerical methods, that while the universal result
applies for $\lambda > 2$, it no longer holds in the interval $0 < \lambda <
2$. In particular, we find that the form of the density of states singularity
is enhanced (relative to the Dyson result) in a continuous manner depending on
the non-universal parameter $\lambda$; simultaneously, the localization length
shows a less divergent form at low energies, and ceases to diverge below
$\lambda = 1$. For $\lambda < 2$, the fall-off of the $E = 0$ state at large
distances also deviates from the universal result, and is of the form $\sim
\exp [-(r/r_0)^{1/\lambda}]$, which decays faster than an exponential for
$\lambda < 1$.

the metal-poor dwarf galaxies is approximately twice that found in the

population of BSS with increasing metallicity mirrors that found for the

the dominant mode of BSS formation in low-density environments is likely to be
mass transfer in close-binary systems. It then follows that the similarity
between the trends for BSS in the dSph and field stars in our Galaxy supports
the proposal that the small-scale fragmentation during star formation is driven

However, numerous questions remain regarding the chemical mechanisms of the

these properties, thin film SrTiO$_{3}$ (STO) was prepared by hMBE using a
titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) precursor for Ti delivery and an elemental Sr

The films were transferred in vacuo to an x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

reported measurements of the bulk of the films in the literature. Ex situ
studies by atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and low

find that a surface exhibiting a mixture of SrO and TiO$_{2}$ termination, or a

adsorption-controlled growth. These results indicate that surface Sr is
necessary to maintain chemical equilibrium for stoichiometric growth during the
hMBE process, which is important for the design of future interfacial systems

hot spots are neither uniformly warmer nor ammonia-depleted compared to their
surroundings at $p<1$ bar. At 0.7 bar, the microwave brightness at the edges of
hot spots is comparable to other features within the NEB. Conversely, hot spots
are brighter at 1.5 bar, signifying either warm temperatures and/or depleted
NH$_3$ at depth. Temperatures and ammonia are spatially variable within the hot
spots, so the precise location of the observations matters to their
interpretation. Reflective plumes sometimes have enhanced NH$_3$, cold
temperatures, and elevated aerosol opacity, but each plume appears different.
Neither plumes nor hot spots had microwave signatures in channels sensing
$p>10$ bars, suggesting that the hot-spot/plume wave is a relatively shallow
feature.

  Segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The varying cortical geometry of the brain creates numerous challenges for
its analysis. Recent developments have enabled learning surface data directly
across multiple brain surfaces via graph convolutions on cortical data.
However, current graph learning algorithms do fail when brain surface data are
misaligned across subjects, thereby affecting their ability to deal with data
from multiple domains. Adversarial training is widely used for domain
adaptation to improve the segmentation performance across domains. In this
paper, adversarial training is exploited to learn surface data across
inconsistent graph alignments. This novel approach comprises a segmentator that
uses a set of graph convolution layers to enable parcellation directly across
brain surfaces in a source domain, and a discriminator that predicts a graph
domain from segmentations. More precisely, the proposed adversarial network
learns to generalize a parcellation across both, source and target domains. We
demonstrate an 8% mean improvement in performance over a non-adversarial
training strategy applied on multiple target domains extracted from MindBoggle,
the largest publicly available manually-labeled brain surface dataset.

a direct application of PT or STFT might not be suitable. However, we show that

first combine the Ramanujan sums and $l_1$ penalization to implement the PT. We
call the algorithm Ramanujan PT (RPT). The RPT is of its own interest for other
applications, like analyzing short signal composed of components with integer
periods, but that is not the focus of this paper. Second, the RPT is applied to
modify the STFT and generate a novel TF representation of the complicated time

oscillatory components. We coin the proposed TF analysis the Ramanujan de-shape

tensile testing after electrochemical hydrogen pre-charging and compared to
conventionally available 304L ASSs with two different processing histories, (i)
casting plus annealing (CA) and (ii) CA plus thermomechanical treatment (TMT).
It was revealed that hydrogen-charging led to a significant reduction in
ductility for the CA sample, but only a small effect of hydrogen was observed
for the LPBF and CA-TMT samples. Hydrogen-assisted cracking behavior was found
to be strongly linked to strain-induced martensitic transformation. In
addition, the amount of alpha' martensite was much higher in the CA sample than
in other samples, suggesting that severe hydrogen embrittlement can be
correlated with the low mechanical stability of austenite. Detailed
microstructural characterization showed that low austenite stability of the CA
sample was mainly attributed to the retained content of delta ferrite and the
chemical inhomogeneity inside the gamma matrix (gamma close to delta has ~2
wt.% higher Cr but ~2 wt.% lower Ni), but TMT enhanced the chemical homogeneity
and thus austenite stability. By contrast, the LPBF process led directly, i.e.
without any thermomechanical treatment, to a fully austenitic structure with
homogeneous elemental distribution in the ASS. These results confirmed that the
presence of delta and the chemical inhomogeneity inside gamma matrix, which
promoted the deformation-induced martensitic transformation and the associated
H enrichment at the gamma-alpha' interface, was the primary reason for the
severe H-assisted failure.

to the development of topological materials which, in combination with
magnetism and superconductivity, are predicted to host chiral Majorana

quantum anomalous Hall system, makes it challenging to induce
superconductivity. Here, we report two different emergent quantum Hall effects
in HgTe quantum wells dilutely alloyed with Mn. Firstly, a novel quantum Hall
state emerges from the quantum spin Hall state at an exceptionally low magnetic
field of $\sim 50$ mT. Secondly, tuning towards the bulk $p$-regime, we resolve
multiple quantum Hall plateaus at fields as low as $20 - 30$ mT, where
transport is dominated by a van Hove singularity in the valence band. These
emergent quantum Hall phenomena rely critically on the topological band
structure of HgTe and their occurrence at very low fields make them an ideal
candidate for interfacing with superconductors to realize chiral Majorana
fermions.

Cahn--Hilliard equation subject to a nonlocal dynamic boundary condition that
is also of Cahn--Hilliard type and contains an additional boundary penalization
term. We rigorously derive our model as the gradient flow of a nonlocal total
free energy with respect to a suitable inner product of order $H^{-1}$ which
contains both bulk and surface contributions. The total free energy is
considered as nonlocal since it comprises convolutions in the bulk and on the
surface of the phase-field variables with certain interaction kernels. The main
difficulties arise from defining a suitable kernel on the surface and from
handling the resulting boundary convolution. In the main model, the chemical
potentials in the bulk and on the surface are coupled by a Robin type boundary
condition depending on a specific relaxation parameter related to the rate of
chemical reactions. We prove weak and strong well-posedness of this system, and
we investigate the singular limits attained when the relaxation parameter tends
to zero or infinity. By this approach, we also obtain weak and strong
well-posedness of the corresponding limit systems.

properties compared with skyrmions in corresponding ferromagnets (FMs). The
rates of skyrmion collapse and escape through the boundary of a track, as well
as the binding to and collapse at a non-magnetic impurity, are calculated as a
function of applied magnetic field. The activation energy for skyrmion
annihilation is the same in AFMs and corresponding FMs in the absence of an
applied magnetic field. The pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius rate law
is, however, different because skyrmion dynamics is different in the two
systems. An applied magnetic field has opposite effects on skyrmions in the two
types of materials. In AFMs the rate of collapse of skyrmions as well as the
rate of escape through the edge of a magnetic strip decreases slightly with
increasing field, while these rates increase strongly for a skyrmion in the
corresponding FMs when the field is directed antiparallel to the magnetization
in the center of the skyrmion. A non-magnetic impurity is less likely to trap a
skyrmion in AFMs especially in the presence of a magnetic field. This, together
with the established fact that a spin polarized current moves skyrmions in AFMs
in the direction of the current, while in FMs skyrmions move at an angle to the
current, demonstrates that skyrmions in AFMs have several advantageous
properties over skyrmions in FMs for memory and spintronic devices.

The conditional time-marginals of the solutions to these SDEs satisfy
non-linear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of the second
order, whereas the laws of the conditional time-marginals follow Fokker-Planck
equations on the space of probability measures. We prove two superposition

that any solution of the Fokker-Planck equation on the space of probability
measures can be lifted to a solution of the SPDE. We use these results to
obtain a mimicking theorem which shows that the conditional time-marginals of
an Ito process can be emulated by those of a solution to a conditional

advertiser observes a censored market price which makes direct evaluation
infeasible on batch test datasets. Previous works ignore the losing auctions to
alleviate the difficulty with censored states; thus significantly modifying the
test distribution. We address the challenge of lacking a clear evaluation
procedure as well as the error propagated through batch reinforcement learning
methods in RTB systems. We exploit two conditional independence structures in
the sequential bidding process that allow us to propose a novel practical
framework using the maximum entropy principle to imitate the behavior of the
true distribution observed in real-time traffic. Moreover, the framework allows
us to train a model that can generalize to the unseen budget conditions than
limit only to those observed in history. We compare our methods on two

improved performance under various budget settings.

the ejecta masses inferred from observations around the peak brightness are
uncertain by at least an order of magnitude. Mixed two-component models with

subset of mixed models shows very strong viewing angle dependence due to
lanthanide ""curtaining,"" which persists even if the relative mass of

be convex and optimality conditions can be obtained through Lagrange duality
theory. A waterfilling-like interpretation for the size of the computing load
assigned to each edge-device is given. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
benefits of the proposed optimal collaborative-computing scheme over various
other schemes in several respects. Most notably, the proposed scheme exhibits
increased probability of successfully dealing with heavier computations and/or
smaller latency along with energy-efficiency gains of up to two orders of
magnitude. Both improvements come from the scheme ability to optimally leverage
edge-devices diversity.

the Tully--Fisher relation and of globular cluster and planetary nebula
luminosity functions. We recommend `best' weighted relative distance moduli for
the Fornax and Coma clusters with respect to the Virgo cluster of $\Delta
(m-M)_0^{\rm Fornax - Virgo} = 0.18 \pm 0.28 $ mag and $\Delta (m-M)_0^{\rm
Coma - Virgo} = 3.75 \pm 0.23$ mag. The set of weighted mean distance moduli
(distances) we derived as most representative of the clusters' distances is,
\begin{eqnarray} (m-M)_0^{\rm Fornax} &=& 31.41 \pm 0.15 \mbox{ mag } (D =

of our analysis of the direct distance moduli, while the second modulus is
based on distance moduli relative to the Virgo cluster. The absolute and
relative distance moduli for both clusters are mutually consistent within the

$\sim$1$\sigma$. Lingering uncertainties in the underlying absolute distance

estimated velocity of the agent generating this continuum boundary is about 400
km/s, similar to that of the rising filament. In association with this filament
rise, transient X-ray sources and extreme ultaviolet (EUV) brightenings are

different components: micron-sized dust and grown dust of evolving size. For
the dust component, we considered the dust coagulation, fragmentation, momentum
exchange with the gas, and dust self-gravity. We found that the micron-sized
dust particles grow rapidly in the circumstellar disk, reaching a few cm in
size in the inner 100 au of the disk during less than 100 kyr after the disk
formation, provided that fragmentation velocity is $30\rm~ms^{-1}$. Due to the
accretion of micron dust particles from the surrounding envelope, which serves
as a micron dust reservoir, the approximately cm-sized dust particles continue
to be present in the disk for more than 900 kyr after the disk formation and
maintain a dust-to-gas ratio close to 0.01. We show that a strong correlation
exists between the gas and pebble fluxes in the disk. We find that radial
surface density distribution of pebbles in the disk shows power-law
distribution with an index similar to that of the Minimum-mass solar nebula
(MMSN) regardless the disk mass. We also show that the gas surface density in
our models agrees well with measurements of dust in protoplanetary disks of AS

these are different from the ""canonical"" exponents previously conjectured to
hold for ""immortal"" flocks (i.e., those without birth and death) and shown to
hold for incompressible flocks with spatial dimensions in the range of $2 < d

transverse and longitudinal velocity and density fluctuations in these systems.
Furthermore, we find a universal separatrix in real (${\bf r}$) space between
two regions in which the equal time density correlation $\langle\delta\rho({\bf
r}, t)\delta\rho(0, t)\rangle$ has opposite signs. Our expansion should be
quite accurate in $d=3$, allowing precise quantitative comparisons between our

  Database Management Systems",,,,,"cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Graph database management systems (GDBMSs) are highly optimized to perform
fast traversals, i.e., joins of vertices with their neighbours, by indexing the
neighbourhoods of vertices in adjacency lists. However, existing GDBMSs have
system-specific and fixed adjacency list structures, which makes each system
efficient on only a fixed set of workloads. We describe a new tunable indexing
subsystem for GDBMSs, we call A+ indexes, with materialized view support. The
subsystem consists of two types of indexes: (i) vertex-partitioned indexes that
partition 1-hop materialized views into adjacency lists on either the source or
destination vertex IDs; and (ii) edge-partitioned indexes that partition 2-hop
views into adjacency lists on one of the edge IDs. As in existing GDBMSs, a
system by default requires one forward and one backward vertex-partitioned
index, which we call the primary A+ index. Users can tune the primary index or
secondary indexes by adding nested partitioning and sorting criteria. Our
secondary indexes are space-efficient and use a technique we call offset lists.
Our indexing subsystem allows a wider range of applications to benefit from
GDBMSs' fast join capabilities. We demonstrate the tunability and space
efficiency of A+ indexes through extensive experiments on three workloads.

blended solutions of entangled ring and linear DNA with varying mass fractions
of linear DNA. We use optical tweezers microrheology to measure the linear and
nonlinear viscoelastic response of these blends. Our measurements reveal a
strong non-monotonic dependence of linear viscoelastic properties on linear DNA
fraction, with a pronounced maximum when the mass fraction of rings and linear
chains are comparable, suggestive of pervasive threading of rings by linear
chains. We observe a similar non-monotonicity in the nonlinear regime; however,
a comparatively higher fraction of linear chains (0.5-0.7) is required for a
substantial increase in resisitive force and slowing of relaxation dynamics to
emerge. This nonlinear response also appears to be rate dependent, which we
argue arises from force-induced de-threading of rings at high strain rates. Our
results fill a longstanding gap in knowledge regarding the microrheology and
nonlinear response of ring-linear polymer blends. Moreover, the uniquely strong
mechanical response that ring-linear blends exhibit, along with the ability to
finely tune these blends by varying the blend composition, provides new

this, a key thread of research in the field has always been the development of
new and improved nonlinear materials to empower these applications. Recently,
epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials have emerged as a potential platform to
enhanced nonlinear interactions, bolstered in large part due to the extreme
refractive index tuning ({\Delta}n~ 0.1 - 1) of sub-micron thick films that has
been demonstrated in literature. Despite this experimental success, the theory
has lagged and is needed to guide future experimental efforts. Here, we
construct a theoretical framework for the intensity-dependent refractive index
of the most popular ENZ materials, heavily doped semiconductors. We demonstrate
that the nonlinearity when excited below bandgap, is due to the modification of
the effective mass of the electron sea which produces a shift in the plasma
frequency. We discuss trends and trade-offs in the optimization of excitation
conditions and material choice (such material loss, band structure, and index
dispersion), and provide a figure of merit through which the performance of
future materials may be evaluated. By illuminating the framework of the

  of Generative Adversarial Networks","GECCO 2020",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an emerging form of indirect
encoding. The GAN is trained to induce a latent space on training data, and a
real-valued evolutionary algorithm can search that latent space. Such Latent
Variable Evolution (LVE) has recently been applied to game levels. However, it
is hard for objective scores to capture level features that are appealing to
players. Therefore, this paper introduces a tool for interactive LVE of
tile-based levels for games. The tool also allows for direct exploration of the
latent dimensions, and allows users to play discovered levels. The tool works
for a variety of GAN models trained for both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend
of Zelda, and is easily generalizable to other games. A user study shows that
both the evolution and latent space exploration features are appreciated, with
a slight preference for direct exploration, but combining these features allows
users to discover even better levels. User feedback also indicates how this
system could eventually grow into a commercial design tool, with the addition
of a few enhancements.

vulnerable to extrapolation. This vulnerability manifests itself whenever a
queried parameter point lies in an unexplored region of the parameter space.
This paper addresses this issue by presenting an in-situ, adaptive framework
for nonlinear model reduction where computations are performed by default
online, and shifted offline as needed. The framework is based on the concept of
a database of local Reduced-Order Bases (ROBs), where locality is defined in
the parameter space of interest. It achieves accuracy by updating on-the-fly a
pre-computed ROB, and approximating the solution of a dynamical system along
its trajectory using a sequence of most-appropriate local ROBs. It achieves
efficiency by managing the dimension of a local ROB, and incorporating
hyperreduction in the process. While sufficiently comprehensive, the framework
is described in the context of dynamic multiscale computations in solid
mechanics. In this context, even in a nonparametric setting of the macroscale
problem and when all offline, online, and adaptation overhead costs are
accounted for, the proposed computational framework can accelerate a single
three-dimensional, nonlinear, multiscale computation by an order of magnitude,
without compromising accuracy.

understood. To address this question, we applied a recently developed
computational method, Random Circuit Perturbation (RACIPE), to a nine-component
gene regulatory network (GRN) governing stemness, from which we identified
fifteen robust gene states. Among them, four out of the five most probable gene
states exhibit gene expression patterns observed in single mouse embryonic
cells at 32-cell and 64-cell stages. These gene states can be robustly
predicted by the stemness GRN but not by randomized versions of the stemness
GRN. Strikingly, we found a hierarchical structure of the GRN with the
Oct4/Cdx2 motif functioning as the first decision-making module followed by
Gata6/Nanog. We propose that stem cell populations, instead of being viewed as
all having a specific cellular state, can be regarded as a heterogeneous
mixture including cells in various states. Upon perturbations by external
signals, stem cells lose the capacity to access certain cellular states,
thereby becoming differentiated. The findings demonstrate that the functions of
the stemness GRN is mainly determined by its well-evolved network topology
rather than by detailed kinetic parameters.

communication systems are subject to cyber-physical disruptions. Cyber
disruptions compromise sensing and/or actuating which closed-loop control

develops a novel approach to analysis and design of traffic control for dynamic
flow networks subject to a rather broad class of disruptions. We consider a
single-origin-single-destination acyclic network with possibly finite link
storage spaces. Both cyber and physical disruptions are modeled as a set of
discrete modes that modify the control and/or the network flow dynamics. The
network switches between various modes according to a Markov process. By
considering switched, piecewise polynomial Lyapunov functions and exploiting
monotonicity of the network flow dynamics, we analyze network throughput under
various disruption scenarios and show that cyber-physical disruptions can
significantly reduce network throughput. For control design, we derive two
results analogous to the classical max-flow min-cut theorem: (i) for a network
with observable disruption modes, there exist mode-dependent controls that
attain the expected-min-cut capacity; (ii) for a network with infinite link
storage spaces, there exists an open-loop control that attains the
min-expected-cut capacity. We also design a closed-loop control for general
cases and derive an explicit relation from the control to a lower-bound for
throughput. Our approach is illustrated by a series of numerical examples.

modeling the movements of predators with long inactive periods such as many

its application in practice. Here we incorporate measurement errors in the MR

composite likelihood using the Markov property of the chain composed by every

data, a problem which self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently been very
popular and successful at tackling. Leveraging auxiliary tasks such as rotation
prediction or generative colorization, SSL can produce better and more robust
representations in a low data regime. Training such tasks along an I2IT task is
however computationally intractable as model size and the number of task grow.
On the other hand, learning sequentially could incur catastrophic forgetting of
previously learned tasks. To alleviate this, we introduce Lifelong
Self-Supervision (LiSS) as a way to pre-train an I2IT model (e.g., CycleGAN) on
a set of self-supervised auxiliary tasks. By keeping an exponential moving
average of past encoders and distilling the accumulated knowledge, we are able
to maintain the network's validation performance on a number of tasks without
any form of replay, parameter isolation or retraining techniques typically used
in continual learning. We show that models trained with LiSS perform better on
past tasks, while also being more robust than the CycleGAN baseline to color
bias and entity entanglement (when two entities are very close).

dilution effect of cluster member and foreground galaxies on weak lensing
signals from clusters of galaxies; we adopt the globally normalized weak
lensing estimator which is least affected by cluster member galaxies, and we
select source galaxies by using photometric redshift information to mitigate
the effect of foreground galaxies. We produce six samples of source galaxies
with different low-$z$ galaxy cuts, construct weak lensing mass maps for each
of the source sample, and search for high peaks in the mass maps that cover an
effective survey area of $\sim$120 deg$^2$. We combine six catalogs of high
peaks into a sample of cluster candidates which contains 124 high peaks with
signal-to-noise ratios greater than five. We cross-match the peak sample with
the public optical cluster catalog constructed from the same HSC survey data to
identify cluster counterparts of the peaks. We find that 107 out of 124 peaks
have matched clusters within 5 arcmin from peak positions. Among them, we
define a sub-sample of 64 secure clusters that we use to examine dilution
effects on our weak lensing cluster search. We find that source samples with
the low-$z$ galaxy cuts mitigate the dilution effect on weak lensing signals of
high-$z$ clusters ($z > 0.3$), and thus combining multiple peak catalogs from
different source samples improves the efficiency of weak lensing cluster
searches.

tasks, self-supervised depth estimation and semantic segmentation from images.
For example, to help unsupervised monocular depth estimation, constraints from
semantic segmentation has been explored implicitly such as sharing and
transforming features. In contrast, we propose to explicitly measure the border
consistency between segmentation and depth and minimize it in a greedy manner
by iteratively supervising the network towards a locally optimal solution.
Partially this is motivated by our observation that semantic segmentation even
trained with limited ground truth (200 images of KITTI) can offer more accurate
border than that of any (monocular or stereo) image-based depth estimation.
Through extensive experiments, our proposed approach advances the state of the

images but has received very little attention for manifold-valued data such as
in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The non-Euclidean nature of DTI prevents
current generative adversarial networks (GANs) from generating plausible images
and has mainly limited their application to diffusion MRI scalar maps, such as
fractional anisotropy (FA) or mean diffusivity (MD). Even if these scalar maps
are clinically useful, they mostly ignore fiber orientations and therefore have
limited applications for analyzing brain fibers. Here, we propose a
manifold-aware CycleGAN that learns the generation of high-resolution DTI from
unpaired T1w images. We formulate the objective as a Wasserstein distance
minimization problem of data distributions on a Riemannian manifold of
symmetric positive definite 3x3 matrices SPD(3), using adversarial and
cycle-consistency losses. To ensure that the generated diffusion tensors lie on
the SPD(3) manifold, we exploit the theoretical properties of the exponential
and logarithm maps of the Log-Euclidean metric. We demonstrate that, unlike
standard GANs, our method is able to generate realistic high-resolution DTI
that can be used to compute diffusion-based metrics and potentially run fiber
tractography algorithms. To evaluate our model's performance, we compute the
cosine similarity between the generated tensors principal orientation and their
ground-truth orientation, the mean squared error (MSE) of their derived FA
values and the Log-Euclidean distance between the tensors. We demonstrate that
our method produces 2.5 times better FA MSE than a standard CycleGAN and up to
30% better cosine similarity than a manifold-aware Wasserstein GAN while
synthesizing sharp high-resolution DTI.

widely studied for voice-driven applications over the past few years. Most of
previous works assume known number of speakers in advance, however, which is
not easily accessible through monaural mixture in practice. In this paper, we
propose a novel model of single-channel multi-speaker separation by jointly
learning the time-frequency feature and the unknown number of speakers.
Specifically, our model integrates the time-domain convolution encoded feature
map and the frequency-domain spectrogram by attention mechanism, and the
integrated features are projected into high-dimensional embedding vectors which
are then clustered with deep attractor network to modify the encoded feature.
Meanwhile, the number of speakers is counted by computing the Gerschgorin disks
of the embedding vectors which are orthogonal for different speakers. Finally,
the modified encoded feature is inverted to the sound waveform using a linear
decoder. Experimental evaluation on the GRID dataset shows that the proposed
method with a single model can accurately estimate the number of speakers with
96.7 % probability of success, while achieving the state-of-the-art separation
results on multi-speaker mixtures in terms of scale-invariant signal-to-noise

in machine learning. However, its theoretical generalization guarantee is
missing in literature. In this paper, we propose an efficient boosting method
with theoretical generalization guarantees for binary classification. Three key
ingredients of the proposed boosting method are: a) the
\textit{fully-corrective greedy} (FCG) update in the boosting procedure, b) a
differentiable \textit{squared hinge} (also called \textit{truncated
quadratic}) function as the loss function, and c) an efficient alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for the associated FCG
optimization. The used squared hinge loss not only inherits the robustness of
the well-known hinge loss for classification with outliers, but also brings
some benefits for computational implementation and theoretical justification.
Under some sparseness assumption, we derive a fast learning rate of the order
${\cal O}((m/\log m)^{-1/4})$ for the proposed boosting method, which can be
further improved to ${\cal O}((m/\log m)^{-1/2})$ if certain additional noise
assumption is imposed, where $m$ is the size of sample set. Both derived
learning rates are the best ones among the existing generalization results of
boosting-type methods for classification. Moreover, an efficient early stopping
scheme is provided for the proposed method. A series of toy simulations and
real data experiments are conducted to verify the developed theories and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

overparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure. We
develop a theoretical framework to address this challenging situation by
defining a weaker form of identifiability, based on the principle of
independence of mechanisms. We demonstrate on toy examples that classical
stochastic gradient descent can hinder the model's extrapolation capabilities,
suggesting independence of mechanisms should be enforced explicitly during
training. Experiments on deep generative models trained on real world data
support these insights and illustrate how the extrapolation capabilities of

Some methods propose localizing 3D objects directly from raw point clouds to
avoid information loss. However, these methods come with complex structures and
significant computational overhead, limiting its broader application in
real-time scenarios. Some methods choose to transform the point cloud data into
compact tensors first and leverage off-the-shelf 2D detectors to propose 3D
objects, which is much faster and achieves state-of-the-art results. However,
because of the inconsistency between 2D and 3D data, we argue that the
performance of compact tensor-based 3D detectors is restricted if we use 2D
detectors without corresponding modification. Specifically, the distribution of
point clouds is uneven, with most points gather on the boundary of objects,
while detectors for 2D data always extract features evenly. Motivated by this
observation, we propose DENse Feature Indicator (DENFI), a universal module
that helps 3D detectors focus on the densest region of the point clouds in a
boundary-aware manner. Moreover, DENFI is lightweight and guarantees real-time
speed when applied to 3D object detectors. Experiments on KITTI dataset show
that DENFI improves the performance of the baseline single-stage detector

the early detection of cervical carcinoma relies heavily upon screening and
pre-clinical testing, digital cervicography has great potential as a primary or
auxiliary screening tool, especially in low-resource regions due to its low
cost and easy access. Although an automated cervical dysplasia detection system
has been desirable, traditional fully-supervised training of such systems
requires large amounts of annotated data which are often labor-intensive to
collect. To alleviate the need for much manual annotation, we propose a novel
graph convolutional network (GCN) based semi-supervised classification model
that can be trained with fewer annotations. In existing GCNs, graphs are
constructed with fixed features and can not be updated during the learning
process. This limits their ability to exploit new features learned during graph
convolution. In this paper, we propose a novel and more flexible GCN model with
a feature encoder that adaptively updates the adjacency matrix during learning
and demonstrate that this model design leads to improved performance. Our
experimental results on a cervical dysplasia classification dataset show that
the proposed framework outperforms previous methods under a semi-supervised
setting, especially when the labeled samples are scarce.

deterministic case, stability analysis of this model needs the information of
Hessian matrix of the line integral Lyapunov function which is related to
partial derivatives of the basis functions. By introducing a new method to
handle these partial derivatives and using the property of state-dependent
matrix with rank one, the stability conditions of the underlying system can be
established via a line integral Lyapunov function. These conditions obtained
are more general than the ones which are based on quadratic Lyapunov functions.
Based on the stability conditions, a controller is developed by cone
complementarity linerization algorithm. A non-quadratic Lyapunov function
approach is thus proposed for the stabilization problem of the It\^o stochastic
T-S models. It has been shown that the problem can be solved by optimizing sum
of traces for a group of products of matrix variables with linear constraints.
Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed

existing equilibrium concepts cannot provide predictions on the outcomes of

in our scenario are different from those in conventional credit card service.
The first one is scalability. The huge volume of users and their behaviors in

Different from the manual review for credit card application in conventional

markedly different between the two sets. The fixed-entropy-gradient simulations
have strong differential rotation contrast and isocontours tilted along radial

particularly suitable to be implemented in conjunction with microwave driving.
To obtain a nontrivial two-qubit gate, we introduce a hybrid system with charge
qubits coupled by a superconducting resonator. When each charge qubit is in
resonance with the resonator, it is possible to construct an entangling
geometric gate with fidelity higher than that of the dynamical gate for
experimentally relevant noise levels. Therefore, our results suggest that
geometric quantum gates are powerful tools to achieve high-fidelity
manipulation for the charge qubit.

Efficiently synthesizing realistic, editable and high resolution US images can

synthesis. Particularly, we firstly adopt a sketch generative adversarial
networks (Sgan) to introduce background sketch upon object mask in a
conditioned generative adversarial network. With enriched sketch cues, Sgan can
generate realistic US images with editable and fine-grained structure details.
Although effective, Sgan is hard to generate high resolution US images. To
achieve this, we further implant the Sgan into a progressive growing scheme
(PGSgan). By smoothly growing both generator and discriminator, PGSgan can
gradually synthesize US images from low to high resolution. By synthesizing
ovary and follicle US images, our extensive perceptual evaluation, user study

probabilistic description of the solution nonuniqueness and data noise
sensitivity. Setting seismic imaging into a Bayesian framework allows for a
principled way of studying uncertainty by solving for the model posterior
distribution. Imaging, however, typically constitutes only the first stage of a
sequential workflow, and UQ becomes even more relevant when applied to
subsequent tasks that are highly sensitive to the inversion outcome. In this
paper, we focus on how UQ trickles down to horizon tracking for the
determination of stratigraphic models and investigate its sensitivity with
respect to the imaging result. As such, the main contribution of this work
consists in a data-guided approach to horizon tracking uncertainty analysis.
This work is fundamentally based on a special reparameterization of
reflectivity, known as ""deep prior"". Feasible models are restricted to the
output of a convolutional neural network with a fixed input, while weights and
biases are Gaussian random variables. Given a deep prior model, the network
parameters are sampled from the posterior distribution via a Markov chain Monte
Carlo method, from which the conditional mean and point-wise standard deviation
of the inferred reflectivities are approximated. For each sample of the
posterior distribution, a reflectivity is generated, and the horizons are
tracked automatically. In this way, uncertainty on model parameters naturally
translates to horizon tracking. As part of the validation for the proposed
approach, we verified that the estimated confidence intervals for the horizon
tracking coincide with geologically complex regions, such as faults.

Given its importance, the precise size and location of the habitable zone
remains a hot topic, as many studies, using a hierarchy of models, have
assessed various factors including: atmospheric composition, time, and
planetary mass. However, little work has assessed how the habitable zone
changes with variations in background nitrogen pressure, which is directly
connected to the habitability and life bearing potential of planets. Here, I
use an advanced energy balance model with clouds to show that our solar system
habitable zone is about 0.9 to 1.7 AU, assuming a 5 bar nitrogen background
pressure and a maximum 100 percent cloud cover at the inner edge. This width is
about 20 percent wider than the conservative habitable zone estimate. Similar
extensions are calculated for A to M stars. I also show that cooling clouds and
hazes and high background pressures can decrease the runaway greenhouse
threshold temperature to approximately 300 K (or less) for planets orbiting any
star type. This is because the associated increase in planetary albedo enables
stable climates closer to the star, where rapid destabilization can be
triggered from a lower mean surface temperature. Enhanced longwave emission for
planets with very high stratospheric temperatures also permits stable climates
at smaller orbital distances. The model predicts a runaway greenhouse above
approximately 330 K for planets orbiting the Sun, which is consistent with
previous work. However, moist greenhouses only occur for planets orbiting
A-stars.

varies substantially with various obstacles, especially in the crowd scenario.
To address this issue, we propose a Pose-guided Visible Part Matching (PVPM)
method that jointly learns the discriminative features with pose-guided
attention and self-mines the part visibility in an end-to-end framework.
Specifically, the proposed PVPM includes two key components: 1) pose-guided
attention (PGA) method for part feature pooling that exploits more
discriminative local features; 2) pose-guided visibility predictor (PVP) that
estimates whether a part suffers the occlusion or not. As there are no ground
truth training annotations for the occluded part, we turn to utilize the
characteristic of part correspondence in positive pairs and self-mining the
correspondence scores via graph matching. The generated correspondence scores
are then utilized as pseudo-labels for visibility predictor (PVP). Experimental
results on three reported occluded benchmarks show that the proposed method
achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods. The source codes

confidence intervals can be difficult to solve in these situations, because the
likelihood function may exhibit unfavorable properties. As a result, existing
methods may be inefficient and yield misleading results. In this paper, we
address this problem by computing profile likelihood confidence intervals via a
trust-region approach, where steps computed based on local approximations are
constrained to regions where these approximations are sufficiently precise. As
our algorithm also accounts for numerical issues arising if the likelihood
function is strongly non-linear or parameters are not estimable, the method is
applicable in many scenarios where earlier approaches are shown to be
unreliable. To demonstrate its potential in applications, we apply our
algorithm to benchmark problems and compare it with 6 existing approaches to
compute profile likelihood confidence intervals. Our algorithm consistently
achieved higher success rates than any competitor while also being among the
quickest methods. As our algorithm can be applied to compute both confidence
intervals of parameters and model predictions, it is useful in a wide range of
scenarios.

Furthermore, adversarial multi-task learning is introduced to learn task

representation stability using actions coming from the cohomology of $X$ and
prove that all the modules involved are finitely generated over the
corresponding TCAs. More quantitatively, we compute explicit bounds for the
derived indecomposables in the sense of Galatius-Kupers-Randal-Williams.
Secondly, when certain $C_\infty$-operations on the cohomology of $X$ vanish,
we prove that the cohomology of its configuration spaces forms a free module
over a TCA built out of the configuration spaces of the affine space. This
generalizes a result of Church-Ellenberg-Farb on the freeness of
$\mathrm{FI}$-modules arising from the cohomology of configuration spaces of
open manifolds and, moreover, resolves the various conjectures of Miller-Wilson
under these conditions.

designed to detect the gravitational wave signals in the frequency range of 0.1
mHz -- 1 Hz. At a geocentric distance of $10^5$ km, the plasma in the earth
magnetosphere will contribute as the main source of environmental noises. Here,
we analyze the acceleration noises that are caused by the magnetic field of
space plasma for the test mass of TianQin. The real solar wind data observed by
the Advanced Composition Explorer are taken as the input of the
magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The Space Weather Modeling Framework is used to
simulate the global magnetosphere of the earth, from which we obtain the plasma
and magnetic field parameters on the detector's orbits. We calculate the time
series of the residual accelerations and the corresponding amplitude spectral
densities on these orbit configurations. We find that the residual acceleration
produced by the interaction between the TM's magnetic moment induced by the
space magnetic field and the spacecraft magnetic field ($\bm{a}_{\rm M1}$) is
the dominant term, which can approach $10^{-15}$ m/s$^2$/Hz$^{1/2}$ at $f
\approx$ 0.2 mHz for the nominal values of the magnetic susceptibility
($\chi_{\rm m} = 10^{-5}$) and the magnetic shielding factor ($\xi_{\rm m} =

acceleration noise caused by the space magnetic field and the preliminary goal
of the inertial sensor are 0.38 and 0.08 at 1 mHz and 10 mHz, respectively. We
discuss the further reduction of this acceleration noise by decreasing

strategies for direct reciprocity fall into one of two classes, `partners' or
`rivals'. A `partner' is a generous strategy achieving mutual cooperation, and
a `rival' never lets the co-player become better off. They have different
working conditions: For example, partners show good performance in a large
population, whereas rivals do in head-to-head matches. By means of exhaustive
enumeration, we demonstrate the existence of strategies that act as both
partners and rivals. Among them, we focus on a human-interpretable strategy,
named `CAPRI' after its five characteristic ingredients, i.e., cooperate,

are satisfied by the systems with provable statistical guarantees by drawing
sufficient numbers of independent and identically distributed samples. During
the process of statistical model checking, the values of the samples (e.g., a

concerns in consumer-level applications (e.g., automobiles and medical
devices). This paper addresses the privacy of statistical model checking
algorithms from the point of view of differential privacy. These algorithms are
sequential, drawing samples until a condition on their values is met. We show
that revealing the number of the samples drawn can violate privacy. We also
show that the standard exponential mechanism that randomizes the output of an
algorithm to achieve differential privacy fails to do so in the context of
sequential algorithms. Instead, we relax the conservative requirement in
differential privacy that the sensitivity of the output of the algorithm should
be bounded to any perturbation for any data set. We propose a new notion of
differential privacy which we call expected differential privacy. Then, we
propose a novel expected sensitivity analysis for the sequential algorithm and
proposed a corresponding exponential mechanism that randomizes the termination
time to achieve the expected differential privacy. We apply the proposed
mechanism to statistical model checking algorithms to preserve the privacy of
the samples they draw. The utility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in

jointly infer fine-grained correspondence by fusing neighborhood associations

environments. This uncertainty is typically modeled using a finite number of
parameters or input signals. Given a system specification in Signal Temporal
Logic (STL), we would like to verify that for all (infinite) values of the
model parameters/input signals, the system satisfies its specification.
Unfortunately, this problem is undecidable in general. {\em Statistical model
checking} (SMC) offers a solution by providing guarantees on the correctness of
CPS models by statistically reasoning on model simulations. We propose a new
approach for statistical verification of CPS models for user-provided
distribution on the model parameters. Our technique uses model simulations to
learn {\em surrogate models}, and uses {\em conformal inference} to provide
probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of a given STL property.
Additionally, we can provide prediction intervals containing the quantitative
satisfaction values of the given STL property for any user-specified confidence
level. We also propose a refinement procedure based on Gaussian Process
(GP)-based surrogate models for obtaining fine-grained probabilistic guarantees
over sub-regions in the parameter space. This in turn enables the CPS designer
to choose assured validity domains in the parameter space for safety-critical
applications. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on several

quasiparticle excitations. To resolve this issue, we analyze a realistic
three-band model with effective intraband and interband phonon-mediated
interactions estimated from first-principles together with nonmagnetic impurity
scatterings. Using the estimated pairing interactions with multiband impurity
scattering rates being varied from clean to dirty regimes, we calculate the THG
susceptibility for NbN in a channel-resolved manner by means of the BCS and
self-consistent Born approximations. In the dirty regime, which is close to the
experimental situation, the leading contribution is given by the paramagnetic
channel of the Higgs mode having almost no polarization-angle dependence, while
the second leading contribution comes from the paramagnetic channel of
quasiparticles generally showing significant polarization-angle dependence. The
result is consistent with the recent experimental observation of no
polarization-angle dependence of THG, giving firm evidence that the Higgs mode
dominantly contributes to the THG resonance in NbN superconductors.

interactions, arranged on a two-dimensional square lattice in presence of two
kinds of noise - annealed and quenched. We focus on both the steady state and
relaxation dynamics of the model. The bare model with annealed noise on finite
$2D$ lattice, in the stationary state, exhibits a crossover from
synchronization to desynchronization as noise strength varies. Finite-size
scaling (FSS) analysis reveals that, in the thermodynamic limit, this crossover
becomes a true phase transition, which is Kosterlitz-Thouless ($KT$)-type
analogous to that of $2D$ $XY$ model. On the other hand, when the noise is
quenched, it does not show any kind of synchronization-desynchronization phase
transition in the thermodynamic limit. But we do observe a crossover from low
noise-strength synchronization to high noise-strength desynchronization in
finite lattices. We analyze the crossover phenomena through the linear
stability of the stationary state solutions and obtain the crossover
noise-strength from the onset of local instability of the unsynchronized one.
The relaxation dynamics also differs for these two types of noise. In case of
annealed noise, the system, in the critically ordered phase, exhibits algebraic
relaxation which is described by the phenomenological Edwards-Wilkinson (EW)
model of growing surface, yielding the same dynamic exponent $z =2$. In
disordered phase, the system shows an exponential decay. On the contrary, the
system with quenched noise, as opposed to the annealed one, always relaxes to
the stationary state exponentially. Both the system-size and noise-strength
dependency of the average relaxation time in the synchronized regime are also
investigated.

lattice fermions (naive fermions and SLAC fermions) to simulate the GN model

modeling and characterizing various stochastic signals for the ensuing

a new framework to analyze the high-dimensional graph structured stochastic
signals by taking the underlying structure into account. To this end, looking
through the lens of operator theory, we first propose a new bivariate isometric
joint translation operator (JTO) consistent with the structural characteristic
of translation operators in other signal domains. Moreover, we characterize
time-vertex filtering based on the proposed JTO. Thereupon, we put forth a new
definition of joint wide-sense stationary (JWSS) signals in time-vertex domain
using the proposed isometric JTO together with its spectral characterization.
Then a new joint power spectral density (JPSD) estimator, called generalized
Welch method (GWM), is presented. Simulation results are provided to show the
efficacy of this JPSD estimator. Furthermore, to show the usefulness of JWSS
modeling, we focus on the classification of time-series on graph. To that end,
by modeling the brain Electroencephalography (EEG) signals as JWSS processes,
we use JPSD as the feature for the Emotion and Alzheimer's disease (AD)
recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that JPSD yields superior Emotion

allowing coordination among the BSs. This paper proposes the first distributed
framework for cooperative precoding design in cell-free massive MIMO (and, more
generally, in joint transmission coordinated multi-point) systems that entirely

over-the-air (OTA) signaling mechanism is introduced such that each BS can
obtain the same cross-term information that is traditionally exchanged among
the BSs via backhaul signaling. The proposed distributed precoding design
enjoys desirable flexibility and scalability properties, as the amount of OTA
signaling does not scale with the number of BSs or user equipments. Numerical
results show fast convergence and remarkable performance gains as compared with
non-cooperative precoding design. The proposed scheme can also outperform the
centralized precoding design under realistic CSI acquisition.

structure, giving rise to anomalies in electronic properties of materials. Such
a transition does not necessarily rely on symmetry-breaking and thus is
topological. It holds a key to understand the origin of many exotic quantum
phenomena, for example the mechanism of extremely large magnetoresistance (MR)
in topological Dirac/Weyl semimetals. Here, we report studies of the
angle-dependent MR (ADMR) and the thermoelectric effect in W2As3 single
crystal. The compound shows a large unsaturated MR (of about 70000% at 4.2 K
and 53 T). The most striking finding is that the ADMR significantly deforms
from the horizontal dumbbell-like shape above 40 K to the vertical lotus-like
pattern below 30 K. The window of 30-40 K also corresponds substantial changes
in Hall effect, thermopower and Nernst coefficient, implying an abrupt change
of Fermi surface topology. Such a temperature-induced Lifshitz transition
results in a compensation of electron-hole transport and the large MR as well.
We thus suggest that the similar method can be applicable in detecting a
Fermi-surface change of a variety of quantum states when a direct Fermi-surface
measurement is not possible.

  Problems with Unknown Structure","To appear in IEEE Transactions of Evolutionary Computation",,,,"cs.NE q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A key challenge to make effective use of evolutionary algorithms is to choose
appropriate settings for their parameters. However, the appropriate parameter
setting generally depends on the structure of the optimisation problem, which
is often unknown to the user. Non-deterministic parameter control mechanisms
adjust parameters using information obtained from the evolutionary process.
Self-adaptation -- where parameter settings are encoded in the chromosomes of
individuals and evolve through mutation and crossover -- is a popular parameter
control mechanism in evolutionary strategies. However, there is little
theoretical evidence that self-adaptation is effective, and self-adaptation has
largely been ignored by the discrete evolutionary computation community.
  Here we show through a theoretical runtime analysis that a non-elitist,
discrete evolutionary algorithm which self-adapts its mutation rate not only
outperforms EAs which use static mutation rates on \leadingones, but also
improves asymptotically on an EA using a state-of-the-art control mechanism.
The structure of this problem depends on a parameter $k$, which is \emph{a
priori} unknown to the algorithm, and which is needed to appropriately set a
fixed mutation rate. The self-adaptive EA achieves the same asymptotic runtime
as if this parameter was known to the algorithm beforehand, which is an
asymptotic speedup for this problem compared to all other EAs previously
studied. An experimental study of how the mutation-rates evolve show that they
respond adequately to a diverse range of problem structures.
  These results suggest that self-adaptation should be adopted more broadly as
a parameter control mechanism in discrete, non-elitist evolutionary algorithms.

electronic Raman scattering compared to the topologically trivial

evidences a crossover in the topological phase from marginal quasiparticles to
a coherent low temperature regime. In contrast, the non-topological
$\alpha$-phase shows more pronounced signatures of electron-phonon interaction.
Here there exist generally enlarged phonon linewidths and deviations from
conventional anharmonicity in an intermediate temperature regime. These effects
provide evidence for an interesting interplay of electronic correlations and
electron-phonon coupling. Both interband and intraband electronic fluctuations
are involved in these effects. Their dependence on symmetry as well as momentum

Thus LN has been seen not only as scalability but also as privacy solution for
Bitcoin. The protocol guarantees that only the latest channel state can be
confirmed on channel closure. LN nodes gossip about channels available for
routing and their total capacities. To issue a (multi-hop) payment, the sender
creates a route based on its local knowledge of the graph. As local channel
balances are not public, payments often fail due to insufficient balance at an
intermediary hop. In that case, the payment is attempted along multiple routes
until it succeeds. This constitutes a privacy-efficiency tradeoff: hidden
balances improve privacy but hinder routing efficiency. In this work, we show
that an attacker can easily discover channel balances using probing. This takes
under a minute per channel and requires moderate capital commitment and no
expenditures. We describe the algorithm and test our proof-of-concept
implementation on Bitcoin's testnet. We argue that LN's balance between privacy
and routing efficiency is suboptimal: channel balances are neither well
protected nor utilized. We outline two ways for LN to evolve in respect to this
issue. To emphasize privacy, we propose a modification of error handling that
hides details of the erring channel from the sending node. This would break our
probing technique but make routing failures more common, as the sender would
not know which channel from the attempted route has failed. To improve
efficiency, we propose a new API call that would let the sender query balances
of channels that it is not a party of. We argue that combining these approaches
can help LN take the best of both worlds: hide private data when feasible, and
utilize public data for higher routing efficiency.

a $Q$-ball type potential for the scalar field, we dub these configurations
$Q$-clouds, in the test field approximation. The clouds exist under a resonance

stationary clouds supported by Kerr BHs, which exist for a synchronisation
condition, at the threshold of (rotational) superradiance. In contrast with the

self-interacting; no similar clouds exist for massive but free scalar fields.
First, considering a decoupling limit, we construct $Q$-clouds around

Explicitly, we find that the spatial correlation function decays as

$\exp(-(t/\tau_L)^{1/2})$, where $t$ is the time and $\tau_L$ proportional to

constraining the source modeling.
  Using the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT), we compare the sensitivity and
robustness of three methods applied to the detection of faint radio sources
from raster maps around a known source position: the smart quick-look method,
the source extraction method (typical of high-energy astronomy), and the fit

data. Here, we build a set of models that combine thermodynamic parameters,

enlightening their structural information content and the contribution of local

improve transferability. The most transferable model is selected through a
cross-validation strategy that estimates the performance of models on systems

masses. Various seesaw mechanisms attempt to explain this fact. In this work
applying insights from matrix theory we are in a position to treat variants of
seesaw mechanisms in a general manner. Specifically, using Weyl's inequalities
we discuss and rigorously prove under which conditions the seesaw framework
leads to a mass spectrum with exactly three light neutrinos. We find an
estimate on the mass of heavy neutrinos to be the mass obtained by neglecting
light neutrinos shifted at most by the maximal strength of the coupling to the
light neutrino sector. We provide analytical conditions allowing to prescribe
that precisely two out of five neutrinos are heavy. For higher-dimensional
cases the inverse eigenvalue methods are used. In particular, for the CP
invariant scenarios we show that if the neutrino sector has a valid mass matrix
after neglecting the light ones, i.e. the respective mass submatrix is positive
definite, then large masses are provided by matrices with large elements
accumulated on the diagonal. Finally, the Davis-Kahan theorem is used to show
how masses affect the rotation of light neutrino eigenvectors from the standard
Euclidean basis. This general observation concerning neutrino mixing together
with results on the mass spectrum properties opens directions for further
neutrino physics studies using matrix analysis.

shows a correlation between the local structural changes and enthalpy.

packets in which each wavelength is associated with a prescribed spatial
bandwidth enable the realization of optical acceleration and deceleration in
free space. Endowing the field with precise spatio-temporal structure leads to
group-velocity changes as high as $\sim c$ observed over a distance of $\sim20$
mm in free space, which represents a boost of at least $\sim4$ orders of
magnitude over X-waves and Airy pulses. The acceleration implemented is in
principle independent of the initial group velocity, and we have verified this
effect in both the subluminal and superluminal regimes.

in a spatio-temporal framework, tailored to big datasets containing important
gaps. In this setting, direct calculation of summaries from data, such as the
minimum over a space-time domain, is not possible. To obtain predictive
distributions for such cluster summaries, we propose a two-step approach. We
first model marginal distributions with a focus on accurate modeling of the
right tail and then, after transforming the data to a standard Gaussian scale,
we estimate a Gaussian space-time dependence model defined locally in the time
domain for the space-time subregions where we want to predict. In the first
step, we detrend the mean and standard deviation of the data and fit a
spatially resolved generalized Pareto distribution to apply a correction of the
upper tail. To ensure spatial smoothness of the estimated trends, we either
pool data using nearest-neighbor techniques, or apply generalized additive
regression modeling. To cope with high space-time resolution of data, the local
Gaussian models use a Markov representation of the Mat\'ern correlation
function based on the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE)
approach. In the second step, they are fitted in a Bayesian framework through
the integrated nested Laplace approximation implemented in R-INLA. Finally,
posterior samples are generated to provide statistical inferences through
Monte-Carlo estimation. Motivated by the 2019 Extreme Value Analysis data
challenge, we illustrate our approach to predict the distribution of local
space-time minima in anomalies of Red Sea surface temperatures, using a gridded
dataset (11315 days, 16703 pixels) with artificially generated gaps. In

However, the grounding accuracy of existing captioners is far from

knowledge distillation for more grounded image captioning. The benefits are
two-fold: 1) given a sentence and an image, POS-SCAN can ground the objects
more accurately than SCAN; 2) POS-SCAN serves as a word-region alignment

benchmark experimental results, we demonstrate that conventional image

to regulate the voltage magnitude of each distributed generators (DGs) in order
to achieve a better trade-off between the control performance and communication

can be easily embedded into the DMPC for the application of MG control, the
computation and communication burdens are significantly reduced with negligible
compromise of control performance. In addition, to reduce the sensor cost and
to eliminate the negative effects of non-linearity, an adaptive non-asymptotic
observer is utilized to estimate the internal and output signals of each DG.
Thanks to the deadbeat observation property, the observer can be applied
periodically to cooperate with the DMPC-based voltage regulator. Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed control method has been tested on a simple

emerged as an appealing approach to create lattices and complex networks. In
such a scheme, the internal states or modes of a physical system are regarded
as lattice sites or network nodes in an abstract space whose dimensionality may
exceed the systems' apparent (geometric) dimensionality. This introduces the
notion of synthetic dimensions, thus providing entirely novel pathways for
fundamental research and applications. Here, we analytically show that the
propagation of multi-photon states through multi-port waveguide arrays gives
rise to synthetic dimensions where a single waveguide system generates a
multitude of synthetic lattices. Since these synthetic lattices exist in
photon-number space, we introduce the concept of pseudo-energy and demonstrate
its utility for studying multi-photon interference processes. Specifically, the
spectrum of the associated pseudo-energy operator generates a unique ordering
of the relevant states. Together with generalized pseudo-energy ladder
operators, this allows for representing the dynamics of multi-photon states by
way of pseudo-energy term diagrams that are associated with a synthetic atom.
As a result, the pseudo-energy representation leads to concise analytical
expressions for the eigensystem of $N$ photons propagating through $M$
nearest-neighbor coupled waveguides. In the regime where $N>2$ and $M>2$,
non-local coupling in Fock space gives rise to hitherto unknown all-optical
dark states which display intriguing non-trivial dynamics.

epidemiology. For the parameters (e.g., the transmission rate) characterizing
these models, the majority of researchers simplify them as constants, while
some others manage to detect their continuous variations. In this paper, we aim
at capturing, on the other hand, discontinuous variations, which better
describe the impact of many noteworthy events, such as city lockdowns, the
opening of field hospitals, and the mutation of the virus, whose effect should
be instant. To achieve this, we balance the model's likelihood by total
variation, which regulates the temporal variations of the model parameters. To
infer these parameters, instead of using Monte Carlo methods, we design a novel
yet straightforward optimization algorithm, dubbed Iterated Nelder--Mead, which
repeatedly applies the Nelder--Mead algorithm. Experiments conducted on the
simulated data demonstrate that our approach can reproduce these
discontinuities and precisely depict the epidemics.

Here we conduct symmetry-dictated investigations into scattering properties of

reveal that far-field scattering patterns are invariant under duality
transformations, which in particular means that scattering patterns of
self-dual clusters with random particle distributions are polarization
independent. Based on this revelation, it is further discovered that scattering
bodies of combined duality-(n-fold) rotation symmetry, for any polarizations of
incident waves, exhibit also n-fold rotationally symmetric scattering patterns
with zero backward components, satisfying the first Kerker condition
automatically. We employ both coupled dipole theory and full numerical
simulations to demonstrate those scattering properties, solely based upon
nonmagnetic core-shell particles that support optically-induced dipolar
resonances. Those substantiated scattering properties are fully induced by
fundamental symmetry principles, and thus can survive any non-symmetry-breaking
perturbations, which may find applications in a wide range of optical devices

of classes to be classified. During training, the network has only access to
data of one task at a time, where each task contains several classes. In this
setting, networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting which refers to the
drastic drop in performance on previous tasks. The vast majority of methods
have studied this scenario for classification networks, where for each new task
the classification layer of the network must be augmented with additional
weights to make room for the newly added classes. Embedding networks have the
advantage that new classes can be naturally included into the network without
adding new weights. Therefore, we study incremental learning for embedding
networks. In addition, we propose a new method to estimate the drift, called
semantic drift, of features and compensate for it without the need of any
exemplars. We approximate the drift of previous tasks based on the drift that
is experienced by current task data. We perform experiments on fine-grained
datasets, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-Subset. We demonstrate that embedding networks
suffer significantly less from catastrophic forgetting. We outperform existing
methods which do not require exemplars and obtain competitive results compared

performance gain. However, they usually involve heuristic steps and require
numerous overlapped subgraphs, severely restricting their accuracy and
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a fully learnable clustering framework
without requiring a large number of overlapped subgraphs. Instead, we transform
the clustering problem into two sub-problems. Specifically, two graph
convolutional networks, named GCN-V and GCN-E, are designed to estimate the
confidence of vertices and the connectivity of edges, respectively. With the
vertex confidence and edge connectivity, we can naturally organize more
relevant vertices on the affinity graph and group them into clusters.
Experiments on two large-scale benchmarks show that our method significantly
improves clustering accuracy and thus performance of the recognition models
trained on top, yet it is an order of magnitude more efficient than existing
supervised methods.

features too much hamper the image restoration, where the spatial relationship
is very important. Based on our analyses, we propose CutBlur that cuts a
low-resolution patch and pastes it to the corresponding high-resolution image
region and vice versa. The key intuition of CutBlur is to enable a model to
learn not only ""how"" but also ""where"" to super-resolve an image. By doing so,
the model can understand ""how much"", instead of blindly learning to apply
super-resolution to every given pixel. Our method consistently and
significantly improves the performance across various scenarios, especially
when the model size is big and the data is collected under real-world

attributed to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Very
recently, however, it has been reported that the chirality induced by the DMI
can be affected by dipolar interactions. These dipolar fields tend to form
N\'eel caps, which entails the formation of a clockwise chirality at the top of
the film and a counterclockwise chirality at the bottom. Here, we show that
engineering an alternating DMI that changes sign across the film thickness,
together with the tendency to form N\'eel caps, leads to an enhanced stability
of chiral spin-structures. Micromagnetic simulations for skyrmions demonstrate
that this can increase the effective DMI in a prototypical [Pt/Co/Ir]
multilayer system by at least \SI{0.6}{mJ.m^{-2}}. These gains are comparable
to what has been achieved using additive DMI, but more flexible as we are not
limited to a select set of material combinations. We also present experimental
results: by measuring equilibrium domain widths we quantify the effective DMI
in [Pt/Co/Ir] multilayer systems typically used for skyrmion stabilization.
Upon introducing an alternating DMI we demonstrate changes in the effective DMI
that agree with our simulations. Our results provide a route towards enhancing
the stability of chiral spin-structures that does not rely on enlarging the

primarily form two conflicting requirements; accurate predictions require large

focuses on holistic reasoning. This provides context to an fine level which

interpretation of spectral lines from targeted and survey-mode observations
with radio interferometers. Bandpass correction is typically performed by
comparing measurements of a strong calibrator source to an assumed model,
typically an isolated point source. The wide field-of-view and high sensitivity
of modern interferometers means that additional sources are often detected in
observations of calibrators. This can introduce errors into bandpass
corrections and subsequently the target data if not properly accounted for.
Focusing on the standard calibrator PKS B1934-638, we perform simulations to
asses this effect by constructing a wide-field sky model. The cases of ASKAP
(0.7-1.9 GHz), MeerKAT (UHF: 0.58-1.05 GHz; L-band: 0.87-1.67 GHz) and Band 2
(0.95-1.76 GHz) of SKA-MID are examined. The use of a central point source
model during bandpass calibration is found to impart amplitude errors into
spectra measured by the precursor instruments at the ~0.2-0.5% level dropping
to ~0.01% in the case of SKA-MID. This manifests itself as ripples in the
source spectrum, the behaviour of which is coupled to the distribution of the
array baselines, the solution interval, the primary beam size, the hour-angle
of the calibration scan, as well as the weights used when imaging the target.
Calibration pipelines should routinely employ complete field models for
standard calibrators to remove this potentially destructive contaminant from
the data, a recommendation we validate by comparing our simulation results to a
MeerKAT scan of PKS B1934-638, calibrated with and without our expanded sky

$\frac{1}{2}(\bar{\rho}-1)$, where $\bar{\rho}$ is the average charge per site

of the known half-integer quantization of $Q_B$ for systems with local
inversion or local chiral symmetries to any rational value. Quite remarkably,
this rational quantization remains valid even in the presence of short-ranged
electron-electron interactions as well as static random disorder (breaking
translational invariance). This striking stability can be traced back to the
fact that local perturbations in insulators induce only local charge
redistributions. We establish this result with complementary methods including
density matrix renormalization group calculations, bosonization methods, and
exact solutions for particular lattice models. Furthermore, for the special

lower-limb wearable robots, which are required to be lightweight, highly
backdrivable, and with high bandwidth. State-of-the-art actuators, e.g., series
elastic actuators (SEAs), have to compromise bandwidth to improve compliance
(i.e., backdrivability). In this paper, we describe the design and human-robot
interaction modeling of a portable hip exoskeleton based on our custom
quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuation (i.e., a high torque density motor with low
ratio gear). We also present a model-based performance benchmark comparison of
representative actuators in terms of torque capability, control bandwidth,
backdrivability, and force tracking accuracy. This paper aims to corroborate
the underlying philosophy of ""design for control"", namely meticulous robot
design can simplify control algorithms while ensuring high performance.
Following this idea, we create a lightweight bilateral hip exoskeleton (overall
mass is 3.4 kg) to reduce joint loadings during normal activities, including
walking and squatting. Experimental results indicate that the exoskeleton is
able to produce high nominal torque (17.5 Nm), high backdrivability (0.4 Nm
backdrive torque), high bandwidth (62.4 Hz), and high control accuracy (1.09 Nm
root mean square tracking error, i.e., 5.4% of the desired peak torque). Its
controller is versatile to assist walking at different speeds (0.8-1.4 m/s) and
squatting at 2 s cadence. This work demonstrates significant improvement in
backdrivability and control bandwidth compared with state-of-the-art
exoskeletons powered by the conventional actuation or SEA.

  Using the statistically complete MOJAVE-1 sample, we aim to determine the
hard X-ray properties of radio-selected blazars, including the enigmatic
gamma-ray-faint type. Also, we aim to determine the contribution of
radio-selected low-peaked blazars to the diffuse CXB.
  We determined photon indices, fluxes, and luminosities in the range of 20 keV
- 100 keV of blazars and other extragalactic jets from the MOJAVE-1 sample,
derived from the 105-month Swift/BAT survey. We calculated log N-log S
distributions and the luminosity functions.
  The majority of the MOJAVE-1 blazars are found to be hard X-ray emitters
albeit many at low count rates. The log N-log S distribution for the hard X-ray
emission of radio-selected blazars is clearly non-Euclidean, in contrast to the
radio flux density distribution. Approximately 0.2% of the CXB in the 20 keV -
100 keV band can be resolved into MOJAVE-1 blazars.
  The peculiar log N-log S distribution disparity might be attributed to
different evolutionary paths in the X-ray and radio bands, as tested by
luminosity-function modeling. X-ray variability can be ruled out as the
dominant contributor. Low-peaked blazars constitute an intrinsically different
source population in terms of CXB contribution compared to similar studies of
X-ray-selected blazars. The hard X-ray flux and spectral index can serve as a
good proxy for the gamma-ray detection probability of individual sources.
Future observations combining deep X-ray survey, for example, with eROSITA, and
targeted gamma-ray observations with CTA can benefit strongly from the tight
connection between these high-energy bands for the different blazar
sub-classes.

equivalence helps eliminate redundant computation in the form of overlapping
sub-queries. Researchers have proposed two pragmatic techniques to tackle this
problem. The first approach consists of reducing the queries to algebraic
expressions and proving their equivalence using an algebraic theory. The
limitations of this technique are threefold. It cannot prove the equivalence of
queries with significant differences in the attributes of their relational
operators. It does not support certain widely-used SQL features. Its
verification procedure is computationally intensive. The second approach
transforms this problem to a constraint satisfaction problem and leverages a
general-purpose solver to determine query equivalence. This technique consists
of deriving the symbolic representation of the queries and proving their
equivalence by determining the query containment relationship between the
symbolic expressions. While the latter approach addresses all the limitations
of the former technique, it only proves the equivalence of queries under set
semantics. However, in practice, database applications use bag semantics. In
this paper, we introduce a novel symbolic approach for proving query
equivalence under bag semantics. We transform the problem of proving query
equivalence under bag semantics to that of proving the existence of a
bijective, identity map between tuples returned by the queries on all valid
inputs. We implement this symbolic approach in SPES and demonstrate that SPES
proves the equivalence of a larger set of query pairs (95/232) under bag
semantics compared to the state-of-the-art tools based on algebraic (30/232)
and symbolic approaches (67/232) under set and bag semantics, respectively.
Furthermore, SPES is 3X faster than the symbolic tool that proves equivalence

electrodes separated by an insulating non-magnetic barrier have become
intensely studied and used in non-volatile spintronic devices. Since ballistic
tunnel of spin-polarized electrons sensitively depends on the chemical
composition and the atomic geometry of the lead/barrier interfaces their proper
design is a key issue for achieving the required functionality of the devices
such as e.g. a high tunnel magneto resistance. An important leap in the
development of novel spintronic devices is to replace the insulating barrier by
a ferroelectric which adds new additional functionality induced by the
polarization direction in the barrier giving rise to the tunnel electro
resistance (TER). The multiferroic tunnel junction
Co/PbZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_{3}$/La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (Co/PZT/LSMO)
represents an archetype system for which - despite intense studies - no
consensus exists for the interface geometry and their effect on transport
properties. Here we provide the first analysis of the Co/PZT interface at the
atomic scale using complementary techniques, namely x-ray diffraction and
extended x-ray absorption fine structure in combination with x-ray magnetic
circular dichroism and ab-initio calculations. The Co/PZT interface consists of
one perovskite-type cobalt oxide unit cell [CoO$_{2}$/CoO/Ti(Zr)O$_{2}$] on
which a locally ordered cobalt film grows. Magnetic moments (m) of cobalt lie
in the range between m=2.3 and m=2.7$\mu_{B}$, while for the interfacial
titanium atoms they are small (m=+0.005 $\mu_{B}$) and parallel to cobalt which
is attributed to the presence of the cobalt-oxide interface layers. These
insights into the atomistic relation between interface and magnetic properties
is expected to pave the way for future high TER devices.

local data jointly train a neural network by communicating learning updates
with an access point without exchanging their data samples. With very limited
communication resources, it is beneficial to schedule the most informative
local learning updates. In this paper, a novel scheduling policy is proposed to
exploit both diversity in multiuser channels and diversity in the ""importance""
of the edge devices' learning updates. First, a new probabilistic scheduling
framework is developed to yield unbiased update aggregation in FEEL. The
importance of a local learning update is measured by its gradient divergence.
If one edge device is scheduled in each communication round, the scheduling
policy is derived in closed form to achieve the optimal trade-off between
channel quality and update importance. The probabilistic scheduling framework
is then extended to allow scheduling multiple edge devices in each
communication round. Numerical results obtained using popular models and
learning datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheduling policy can achieve
faster model convergence and higher learning accuracy than conventional
scheduling policies that only exploit a single type of diversity.

parameters, strict measures fare better than a hands-off policy. Strategies
based on current case numbers lead to substantially higher total costs than

crystals (Fe5-xGeTe2 with x~0.3) were studied and the impact of thermal
processing was explored. Quenching crystals from the growth temperature has
been previously shown to produce a metastable state that undergoes a strongly
hysteretic first-order transition upon cooling below ~100K. The first-order
transition impacts the magnetic properties, yielding an enhancement in the
Curie temperature T_C from 270 to 310K. In the present work, T_HT ~550K has
been identified as the temperature above which metastable crystals are obtained
via quenching. Diffraction experiments reveal a structural change at this
temperature, and significant stacking disorder occurs when samples are slowly
cooled through this temperature range. The transport properties are
demonstrated to be similar regardless of the crystal's thermal history. The
scattering of charge carriers appears to be dominated by moments fluctuating on
the Fe(1) sublattice, which remain dynamic down to 100-120K. Maxima in the
magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall resistance are observed near 120K. The
Hall and Seebeck coefficients are also impacted by magnetic ordering on the
Fe(1) sublattice. The data suggest that both electrons and holes contribute to
conduction above 120K, but that electrons dominate at lower temperature when
all of the Fe sublattices are magnetically ordered. This study demonstrates a
strong coupling of the magnetism and transport properties in Fe5-xGeTe2 and
complements the previous results that demonstrated strong magnetoelastic
coupling as the Fe(1) moments order. The published version of this manuscript

schemes based on priority, delay requirements and history of the dropped flows
metrics. Forwarding schemes schedule the flows in real time by choosing either
satellite or direct air to ground link depending on the delay and capacity
requirements of flows to maximize the number of accepted flows with required
QoS guarantees in terms of dropped packets and delay. Also, the effect of local
caching is studied to fully satisfy the QoS requirement of flows in simulated
flights. We implement the forwarding procedures and caching in ns-3 and test
their performance in a current connectivity scenario of 100 Mbps capacity for
both the satellite spot and ground base station in a one-hour flight. Our study
shows that although the forwarding procedure based on a combination of priority
and delay requirement has relatively better performance than the other schemes,
which are based on priority only and weighted average of all metrics, in
dropped packet percentage and delay, the current connectivity setup is not able
to satisfy all QoS requirements. Furthermore, at least 0.9 cache hit rate is
required to satisfy all flows for at least 50% of simulated flights.

of scheduling parallel-task jobs with heterogeneous resource requirements in a
cluster of machines. Each job consists of a set of tasks that can be processed
in parallel, however, the job is considered completed only when all its tasks
finish their processing, which we refer to as ""synchronization"" constraint.
Further, assignment of tasks to machines is subject to ""placement"" constraints,
i.e., each task can be processed only on a subset of machines, and processing
times can also be machine dependent. Once a task is scheduled on a machine, it
requires a certain amount of resource from that machine for the duration of its
processing. A machine can process (""pack"") multiple tasks at the same time,
however the cumulative resource requirement of the tasks should not exceed the
machine's capacity.
  Our objective is to minimize the weighted average of the jobs' completion
times. The problem, subject to synchronization, packing and placement
constraints, is NP-hard, and prior theoretical results only concern much
simpler models. For the case that migration of tasks among the
placement-feasible machines is allowed, we propose a preemptive algorithm with
an approximation ratio of $(6+\epsilon)$. In the special case that only one
machine can process each task, we design an algorithm with improved
approximation ratio of $4$. Finally, in the case that migrations (and
preemptions) are not allowed, we design an algorithm with an approximation
ratio of $24$. Our algorithms use a combination of linear program relaxation
and greedy packing techniques. We present extensive simulation results, using a
real traffic trace, that demonstrate that our algorithms yield significant

the region where condensation of TiC is expected to occur, suggesting that the
assembly of large TixCy clusters could be related to the formation of the first

description of the neural network controller and use a mixed-integer linear
programming formulation to perform output range analysis of neural networks. We
also propose a novel method to modify a neural network controller such that it
performs optimally in the LQR sense in a region surrounding the equilibrium.
The proposed method enables the analysis and design of neural network
controllers with formal safety guarantees as we illustrate with simulation
results.

quarks, and in particular of the Collins effect used for the extraction of the
quark transversity distribution. The aim is to include the spin degree of
freedom in the hadronization part of Monte Carlo event generators by using the
string+${}^3P_0$ model. The model is reviewed here and the relevant functions
have been written in a form suitable for a Monte Carlo implementation. Two main
variants of the model for pseudoscalar meson production are formulated and both
of them have been implemented in stand alone Monte Carlo programs. After tuning
one single parameter, the simulation results are compared with the measured
Collins and dihadron transverse spin asymmetries showing a satisfactory
qualitative agreement. Given this encouraging outcome, one of them has been
interfaced with the hadronization part of the PYTHIA event generator. The quark
transversity distribution has been implemented in the generator allowing to
simulate for the first time the polarized SIDIS process. The comparison of the
simulated transverse spin asymmetries with the experimental data is found to be
very promising. As final development, vector meson production and decays have
been included in a consistent way with the rules of quantum mechanics. The
effect of vector meson production on transverse spin asymmetries has been
studied in detail with a stand alone Monte Carlo program showing that the new
model is a promising and powerful model for the description of the polarized
quark fragmentation process.

problem of non-cooperative games in dynamic environments. Each player in the

inequality constraint. Each player can only have access to its own cost
function, its own set constraint and a local block of the inequality
constraint, and can only communicate with its neighbours via a connected graph.
Moreover, players do not have prior knowledge of their future cost functions.
To address this problem, an online distributed algorithm is proposed based on
consensus algorithms and a primal-dual strategy. Performance of the algorithm
is measured by using dynamic regrets. Under mild assumptions on graphs and cost
functions, we prove that if the deviation of variational generalized Nash

on many complex sequential decision-making problems. However, heavy dependence

learns effectively in sparse-rewarded tasks by leveraging the existing expert

(near) optimal performance given only a limited number of sub-optimal
demonstrations for highly challenging sparse reward tasks. SAIL bridges the
advantages of IL and RL to reduce the sample complexity substantially, by
effectively exploiting sup-optimal demonstrations and efficiently exploring the

results show that not only does SAIL significantly improve the

differential equations can be posed as a nonlinear Bayesian inference problem,
which can be approximately solved via Gaussian filtering and smoothing,

differentiable linear time invariant Gauss--Markov priors is considered. A
taxonomy of Gaussian estimators is established, with the maximum a posteriori
estimate at the top of the hierarchy, which can be computed with the iterated
extended Kalman smoother. The remaining three classes are termed explicit,
semi-implicit, and implicit, which are in similarity with the classical notions

produces a local maximum a posteriori estimate. The maximum a posteriori
estimate corresponds to an optimal interpolant in the reproducing Hilbert space
associated with the prior, which in the present case is equivalent to a Sobolev
space of smoothness $\nu+1$. Consequently, using methods from scattered data
approximation and nonlinear analysis in Sobolev spaces, it is shown that the
maximum a posteriori estimate converges to the true solution at a polynomial
rate in the fill-distance (maximum step size) subject to mild conditions on the

planetary collisions are known to be capable of altering their optical
properties. Thus, one can hypothesize that a significant portion of the
ordinary chondrite material may be hidden within the observed dark C/X asteroid
population. The exact pressure-temperature conditions of the shock-induced
darkening are not well constrained. Thus, we experimentally investigate the
gradual changes in the chondrite material optical properties as a function of
the shock pressure. A spherical shock experiment with Chelyabinsk LL5 was
performed in order to study the changes in its optical properties. The
spherical shock experiment geometry allows for a gradual increase of shock
pressure from $\sim$15 GPa at a rim toward hundreds of gigapascals in the
center. Four distinct zones were observed with an increasing shock load. The
optical changes are minimal up to $\sim$50 GPa. In the region of $\sim$50--60
GPa, shock darkening occurs due to the troilite melt infusion into silicates.
This process abruptly ceases at pressures of $\sim$60 GPa due to an onset of
silicate melting. At pressures higher than $\sim$150 GPa, recrystallization
occurs and is associated with a second-stage shock darkening due to fine
troilite-metal eutectic grains. The shock darkening affects the ultraviolet,
visible, and near-infrared (UV, VIS, and NIR) region while changes to the MIR
spectrum are minimal. Shock darkening is caused by two distinct mechanisms with
characteristic pressure regions, which are separated by an interval where the
darkening ceases. This implies a reduced amount of shock-darkened material
produced during the asteroid collisions.

Till date, well
tested medication or antidote is not available to cure this disease. According
to WHO reports, COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is
transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this
disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in
reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this
disease has been analysed for India till 30th March 2020 and predictions have
been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and
Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected
from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30th January 2020
to 30th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and
achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error
rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the
value of R0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02.
Expected cases may rise between 5000-6000 in the next two weeks of time. This
study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the
next two weeks. Based on the predictions for short-term interval, these models
can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals.

outperforms state-of-the-art methods for data of 180 countries and can be a
useful tool for such risk categorization. We have also experimented with the

the weather does not have a significant role. The tool can be used to predict

descriptions of source code behavior during run time. Such summaries are
extremely useful for software development and maintenance but are expensive to
manually author,hence it is done for small fraction of the code that is
produced and is often ignored. Automatic code documentation can possibly solve
this at a low cost. This is thus an emerging research field with further
applications to program comprehension, and software maintenance. Traditional
methods often relied on cognitive models that were built in the form of
templates and by heuristics and had varying degree of adoption by the developer
community. But with recent advancements, end to end data-driven approaches
based on neural techniques have largely overtaken the traditional techniques.
Much of the current landscape employs neural translation based architectures
with recurrence and attention which is resource and time intensive training
procedure. In this paper, we employ neural techniques to solve the task of
source code summarizing and specifically compare NMT based techniques to more
simplified and appealing Transformer architecture on a dataset of Java methods
and comments. We bring forth an argument to dispense the need of recurrence in
the training procedure. To the best of our knowledge, transformer based models
have not been used for the task before. With supervised samples of more than
2.1m comments and code, we reduce the training time by more than 50% and
achieve the BLEU score of 17.99 for the test set of examples.

consider a feedback vertex set of the graph. However, these methods do not take
into account the type of action (activation, inhibition) between its
components.
  In this paper we propose a new algorithm for finding the set of fixed points
of a Boolean network, based on a positive feedback vertex set $P$ of its
interaction graph and which works, by applying a sequential update schedule, in
time $O(2^{|P|} \cdot n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of components. The
theoretical foundation of this algorithm is due a nice characterization, that
we give, of the dynamical behavior of the Boolean networks without positive
cycles and with a fixed point.

  Code","Presented in the 10th Workshop on Systems for Post-Moore
  Architectures (SPMA), April 27, 2020",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Approximate memory is a technique to mitigate the performance gap between
memory subsystems and CPUs with its reduced access latency at a cost of data
integrity. To gain benefit from approximate memory for realistic applications,
it is crucial to partition applications' data to approximate data and critical
data and apply different error rates. However, error rates cannot be controlled
in a fine-grained manner (e.g., per byte) due to fundamental limitations of how
approximate memory can be realized. Due to this, if approximate data and
critical data are interleaved in a data structure (e.g., a C struct that has a
pointer and an approximatable number as its members), data partitioning may
degrade the application's performance because the data structure must be split
to separate memory regions that have different error rates. This paper is the
first to conduct an analysis of realistic C/C++ code to assess the impact of
this problem. First, we find the type of data (e.g., ""int"", ""struct point"")
that is assessed by the instruction that incurs the largest number of cache
misses in a benchmark, which we refer to as the target data type. Second, we
qualitatively estimate if the target data type of an application has
approximate data and critical data interleaved. To this end, we set up three
criteria to analyze it because definitively distinguishing a piece of data as
approximate data or critical data is infeasible since it depends on each
use-case. We analyze 11 memory intensive benchmarks from SPEC CPU 2006 and 2
graph analytics frameworks, and show that the target data types of 9 benchmarks
are either a C struct or a C++ class (criterion 1). Among them, two have a
pointer and a non-pointer member together (criterion 2) and three have a
floating point number and other members together (criterion 3).

analysis and the hierarchical clustering of visually salient sub-image blocks.
The similarity clustering of images was automatically identified by
hierarchical clustering based on the hue,saturation,value (HSV) spatial color

two-dimensional lattice of particles and calculated its time evolution by using
a rules system derived from our experience in swarm robotics. The new position
of a particle, like the element of a swarm, is determined by the spatial
position of the other particles. No dynamic is considered, but it can be

collaborative training of a shared model without the need to exchange any
private data with a centralized server. Rather, an abstraction of the data in
the form of a machine learning model update is sent. Recent studies showed that
such model updates may still very well leak private information and thus more
structured risk assessment is needed. In this paper, we analyze existing
vulnerabilities of FL and subsequently perform a literature review of the
possible attack methods targetingFL privacy protection capabilities. These
attack methods are then categorized by a basic taxonomy. Additionally, we

turns in the dialog. Existing systems for this task employ the transformers or
recurrent neural network-based architecture with the encoder-decoder framework.
Even though these techniques show superior performance for this task, they have
significant limitations: the model easily overfits only to memorize the
grammatical patterns; the model follows the prior distribution of the
vocabularies in a dataset. To alleviate the problems, we propose a Multimodal
Semantic Transformer Network. It employs a transformer-based architecture with
an attention-based word embedding layer that generates words by querying word
embeddings. With this design, our model keeps considering the meaning of the
words at the generation stage. The empirical results demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed model that outperforms most of the previous works
for the AVSD task.

  Pars Compacta in Parkinson's Disease",,,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.TO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic
cells in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The root cause of this cell loss
in PD is still not decisively elucidated. A recent line of thinking traces the
cause of PD neurodegeneration to metabolic deficiency. Due to exceptionally
high energy demand, SNc neurons exhibit a higher basal metabolic rate and
higher oxygen consumption rate, which results in oxidative stress. Recently, we
have suggested that the excitotoxic loss of SNc cells might be due to energy
deficiency occurring at different levels of neural hierarchy. Levodopa (LDOPA),
a precursor of dopamine, which is used as a symptom-relieving treatment for PD,
leads to outcomes that are both positive and negative. Several researchers
suggested that LDOPA might be harmful to SNc cells due to oxidative stress. The
role of LDOPA in the course of PD pathogenesis is still debatable. We
hypothesize that energy deficiency can lead to LDOPA-induced toxicity (LIT) in
two ways: by promoting dopamine-induced oxidative stress and by exacerbating
excitotoxicity in SNc. We present a multiscale computational model of
SNc-striatum system, which will help us in understanding the mechanism behind
neurodegeneration postulated above and provides insights for developing
disease-modifying therapeutics. It was observed that SNc terminals are more
vulnerable to energy deficiency than SNc somas. During LDOPA therapy, it was
observed that higher LDOPA dosage results in increased loss of somas and
terminals in SNc. It was also observed that co-administration of LDOPA and
glutathione (antioxidant) evades LDOPA-induced toxicity in SNc neurons. We show
that our proposed model was able to capture LDOPA-induced toxicity in SNc,
caused by energy deficiency.

  Human Mobility Data: a Bayesian Causal Inference Approach",,,,,"q-fin.GN cs.CE cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, extreme shocks, such as natural disasters, are increasing in
both frequency and intensity, causing significant economic loss to many cities
around the world. Quantifying the economic cost of local businesses after
extreme shocks is important for post-disaster assessment and pre-disaster
planning. Conventionally, surveys have been the primary source of data used to
quantify damages inflicted on businesses by disasters. However, surveys often
suffer from high cost and long time for implementation, spatio-temporal
sparsity in observations, and limitations in scalability. Recently, large scale
human mobility data (e.g. mobile phone GPS) have been used to observe and
analyze human mobility patterns in an unprecedented spatio-temporal granularity
and scale. In this work, we use location data collected from mobile phones to
estimate and analyze the causal impact of hurricanes on business performance.
To quantify the causal impact of the disaster, we use a Bayesian structural
time series model to predict the counterfactual performances of affected
businesses (what if the disaster did not occur?), which may use performances of
other businesses outside the disaster areas as covariates. The method is tested
to quantify the resilience of 635 businesses across 9 categories in Puerto Rico
after Hurricane Maria. Furthermore, hierarchical Bayesian models are used to
reveal the effect of business characteristics such as location and category on
the long-term resilience of businesses. The study presents a novel and more
efficient method to quantify business resilience, which could assist policy
makers in disaster preparation and relief processes.

Service Function Chain (SFC), -- an end-to-end service is presented by a chain
of virtual network functions (VNFs), is a complex function of placement,
configuration and deployment requirements, both in hardware and software.
Previous reliability analysis models cannot be directly applied to SFC because
they do not consider aspects of system component sharing, heterogeneity of
system components and their interdependency in case of failures. In this paper,
we analyze service reliability of complex SFC configurations, including serial
and parallel VNF chaining, as well as their related backup protection
components. Our analysis is based on combinatorial analysis and a reduced
binomial theorem, and this simple approach can be utilized to analyzing rather
complex SFC configurations. We consider, for the first time, failure
dependences among VNF components placed in data centers, racks, and servers. We
show that our analysis can easily consider different VNF placement strategies
in data center networks in arbitrary configurations and, thus, be effectively
used for optimizations of the reliable SFC placement.
