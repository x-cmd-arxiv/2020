owing to the superiority of changing the wireless propagation environment
intelligently. Channel feedback is essential in frequency division duplex (FDD)
RIS-assisted wireless communications, since the downlink channel state
information (CSI) needs to be acquired by the base station (BS) from the user
equipment (UE) for the joint beamforming at the BS and the RIS. In this paper,
we exploit the single-structured sparsity of RIS channel, which means that the
sparse angular-domain channels of different users share the same structured
sparsity only in the column dimension, but not in the row dimension. Based on
this characteristic, we propose a dimension reduced channel feedback scheme
with the low overhead. Specifically, the downlink CSI can be expressed with the
structured information and unstructured information. The structured information
of the multi-user channels can be fed back to the BS only by one user according
to the single-structured sparsity, then the unstructured information can be fed
back with a fairly low overhead by different users, respectively. Moreover, by
utilizing the angle coherence time, the per-user overhead can be reduced
further, while the near-optimal performance can still be guaranteed. Simulation
results show that, the proposed scheme can reduce the channel feedback overhead
by 80% compared to the conventional method.

sub-Gaussian measurements under the assumption of a synthesis-based sparsity
model. Solving the $\ell^1$-synthesis basis pursuit allows for a simultaneous
estimation of a coefficient representation as well as the sought-for signal.
However, due to linear dependencies within redundant dictionary atoms it might
be impossible to identify a specific representation vector, although the actual
signal is still successfully recovered. The present manuscript studies both
estimation problems from a non-uniform, signal-dependent perspective. By
utilizing recent results on the convex geometry of linear inverse problems, the
sampling rates describing the phase transitions of each formulation are
identified. In both cases, they are given by the conic Gaussian mean width of
an $\ell^1$-descent cone that is linearly transformed by the dictionary. In
general, this expression does not allow a simple calculation by following the
polarity-based approach commonly found in the literature. Hence, two upper
bounds involving the sparsity of coefficient representations are provided: The
first one is based on a local condition number and the second one on a
geometric analysis that makes use of the thinness of high-dimensional
polyhedral cones with not too many generators. It is furthermore revealed that
both recovery problems can differ dramatically with respect to robustness to
measurement noise -- a fact that seems to have gone unnoticed in most of the
related literature. All insights are carefully undermined by numerical
simulations.

gradient descent with random subsampling within the target functional. In this
work, we introduce the stochastic gradient process as a continuous-time
representation of stochastic gradient descent. The stochastic gradient process
is a dynamical system that is coupled with a continuous-time Markov process
living on a finite state space. The dynamical system -- a gradient flow --
represents the gradient descent part, the process on the finite state space
represents the random subsampling. Processes of this type are, for instance,
used to model clonal populations in fluctuating environments. After introducing
it, we study theoretical properties of the stochastic gradient process: We show
that it converges weakly to the gradient flow with respect to the full target
function, as the learning rate approaches zero. We give conditions under which
the stochastic gradient process with constant learning rate is exponentially
ergodic in the Wasserstein sense. Then we study the case, where the learning
rate goes to zero sufficiently slowly and the single target functions are
strongly convex. In this case, the process converges weakly to the point mass
concentrated in the global minimum of the full target function; indicating
consistency of the method. We conclude after a discussion of discretisation
strategies for the stochastic gradient process and numerical experiments.

This appears to be at odds with the double copy for scattering amplitudes, in
which the non-abelian nature of the gauge theory plays a crucial role.
Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether or not global properties of classical
fields - such as non-trivial topology - can be matched between gauge and

demonstrating how magnetic monopoles associated with arbitrary gauge groups can
be double copied to the same solution (the pure NUT metric) in gravity. We
further describe how to match up topological information on both sides of the

This information is neatly expressed in terms of Wilson line operators, and we
argue through specific examples that they provide a useful bridge between the

distribution of SgrA* turns over at a median flux density of (1.1\pm0.3)mJy. We
measure the percentiles of the flux distribution and use them to constrain the
NIR K-band SED. Furthermore, we find that the flux distribution is
intrinsically right-skewed to higher flux density in log space. Flux densities
below 0.1mJy are hardly ever observed. In consequence, a single powerlaw or
lognormal distribution does not suffice to describe the observed flux
distribution in its entirety. However, if one takes into account a power law
component at high flux densities, a lognormal distribution can describe the
lower end of the observed flux distribution. We confirm the RMS-flux relation
for Sgr~A* and find it to be linear for all flux densities in our observation.
We conclude that Sgr~A* has two states: the bulk of the emission is generated

metrology, we find the ultimate bounds for the receiver performance, proving
that quantum correlations can enhance the SNR by up to $6$ dB. These bounds
rule out any quantum illumination advantage when the source is strongly
amplified, and show that a relevant gain is possible only in the low
photon-number regime. We show how the protocol can be used for covert
communication, where the carrier signal is indistinguishable from the thermal
noise in the environment. We complement our information-theoretic results with
a feasible experimental proposal in a circuit-QED platform. This work makes a
decisive step toward implementing secure quantum communication concepts in the
previously uncharted $1$-$10$ GHz frequency range, in the scenario when the
disposable power of one party is severely constrained.

accounts of long-term object appearance. In addition, our method requires few
additional computational overhead, and runs at a fast $\sim$37 fps speed. Our

  Inference",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model inference aims to extract accurate models from the execution logs of
software systems. However, in reality, logs may contain some ""noise"" that could
deteriorate the performance of model inference. One form of noise can commonly
be found in system logs that contain not only transactional messages---logging
the functional behavior of the system---but also operational
messages---recording the operational state of the system (e.g., a periodic
heartbeat to keep track of the memory usage). In low-quality logs,
transactional and operational messages are randomly interleaved, leading to the
erroneous inclusion of operational behaviors into a system model, that ideally
should only reflect the functional behavior of the system. It is therefore
important to remove operational messages in the logs before inferring models.
In this paper, we propose LogCleaner, a novel technique for removing
operational logs messages. LogCleaner first performs a periodicity analysis to
filter out periodic messages, and then it performs a dependency analysis to
calculate the degree of dependency for all log messages and to remove
operational messages based on their dependencies. The experimental results on
two proprietary and 11 publicly available log datasets show that LogCleaner, on
average, can accurately remove 98% of the operational messages and preserve 81%
of the transactional messages. Furthermore, using logs pre-processed with
LogCleaner decreases the execution time of model inference (with a speed-up
ranging from 1.5 to 946.7 depending on the characteristics of the system) and
significantly improves the accuracy of the inferred models, by increasing their
ability to accept correct system behaviors (+43.8 pp on average, with
pp=percentage points) and to reject incorrect system behaviors (+15.0 pp on
average).

Compared to orientation samples in the literature this approach yields less
bias with redshift, relatively more lobe-dominated sources including those with
radio lobes and no visible core, and a distribution of radio core dominance
that is consistent with expectations from a uniform distribution of
inclinations with solid angle. We measure properties of the optical spectra,
and use the sample to investigate the orientation dependence of the velocity
width of the broad H$\beta$ emission line. We recover the known orientation
dependence, but the sharp envelope of previous studies where only edge-on

attributable solely to black hole mass, Eddington ratio, or contamination in
the sample from compact steep spectrum sources. A physical framework for quasar
beaming and a disk-like broad-line region can describe the representative

by processes that occur at Earth's magnetopause (MP). Magnetic reconnection is
one process responsible for solar wind entry into and global convection within
the MSP, and the MP location, orientation, and motion have an impact on the
dynamics. Statistical studies that focus on these and other MP phenomena and
characteristics inherently require MP identification in their event search
criteria, a task that can be automated using machine learning. We introduce a
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network model to detect MP
crossings and assist studies of energy transfer into the MSP. As its first
application, the LSTM has been implemented into the operational data stream of
the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. MMS focuses on the electron
diffusion region of reconnection, where electron dynamics break magnetic field
lines and plasma is energized. MMS employs automated burst triggers onboard the
spacecraft and a Scientist-in-the-Loop (SITL) on the ground to select intervals
likely to contain diffusion regions. Only low-resolution data is available to
the SITL, which is insufficient to resolve electron dynamics. A strategy for
the SITL, then, is to select all MP crossings. Of all 219 SITL selections
classified as MP crossings during the first five months of model operations,
the model predicted 166 (76%) of them, and of all 360 model predictions, 257

MP crossings by the SITL were still MP-like; the intervals contained mixed
magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasmas. The LSTM model and its predictions
are public to ease the burden of arduous event searches involving the MP,

Task replication repeats a task n-times and executes them asynchronously. Task
replay will reschedule a task up to n-times until a valid output is returned.
Furthermore, we introduce an API that allows the application to verify the

artificial workloads and a dataflow based stencil application. We demonstrate
that only minor overheads are incurred when utilizing these resiliency features

direct numerical simulations (DNS) are used both to train deep ANN models as a

Next, \textit{a-posteriori} solutions are obtained with each model over several

with greater accuracy compared to other subfilter flux models for a given

offline training is not viable. We work towards General Continual Learning
(GCL), where task boundaries blur and the domain and class distributions shift

knowledge distillation and regularization; our simple baseline, Dark Experience
Replay, matches the network's logits sampled throughout the optimization

extensive analysis on both standard benchmarks and a novel GCL evaluation
setting (MNIST-360), we show that such a seemingly simple baseline outperforms
consolidated approaches and leverages limited resources. We further explore the

graphs whose underlying posets have bounded dimension. Through a different
proof technique, we also provide an output-polynomial algorithm for their
complements, i.e., for comparability graphs of bounded dimension posets.
  Our algorithm for incomparability graphs is based on flashlight search and
relies on the geometrical representation of incomparability graphs with bounded
dimension, as given by Golumbic et al. in 1983. It runs with polynomial delay
and only needs polynomial space. Our algorithm for comparability graphs is
based on the flipping method introduced by Golovach et al. in 2015. It performs
in incremental-polynomial time and requires exponential space.
  In addition, we show how to improve the flipping method so that it requires
only polynomial space. Since the flipping method is a key tool for the best
known algorithms enumerating minimal dominating sets in a number of graph
classes, this yields direct improvements on the state of the art.

revisited and extended to include non-hydrostatic effects. This systematic
study compares transient and modal growth rates of submesoscale instabilities

different Richardson number regimes. Selection criteria were derived to remove
spurious and unresolved instability modes that arise from the eigenvalue
problem and we generalize the study of the hydrostatic Eady problem by Heifetz
and Farrell (2003, 2007, 2008) to thin fronts, characterized by large aspect
ratios. Such fronts are commonly found at the early stages of frontogenesis,
for example, in the ocean mesoscale eddies and near the eye wall of hurricanes.
In particular, we show that transient energy growth rates are up to two orders
of magnitude larger than modal counterparts for a wide range of Richardson
number and that the effects of transient energy gain become even greater when
non-hydrostatic effects become important and/or for large Richardson numbers.
This study also compares the dominant energy pathways contributing to the
energy growth at short and long times. For symmetric modes, we recover the
inertia-gravity instability described in Xu et al. (2007). These mechanisms are
shown to be the most powerful mediator of vertical transport when compared with
the fastest growing baroclinic and symmetric modes. These results highlight the

km s$^{-1}$), non-gravitational accelerations, and tumbles on a few hours
timescale. The inferred number density ($\sim 3.5 \times 10^{13} - 2 \times

ISOs by $\geq 10^3$, in contrast to the much lower ratio ($\lesssim 10^{-2}$)
of rocky/icy Kuiper belt objects. Although some scenarios can cause the
ejection of asteroidal ISOs, a unified formation theory has yet to
comprehensively link all `Oumuamua's puzzling characteristics and to account
for the population. Here we show by numerical simulations that `Oumuamua-like
ISOs can be prolifically produced through extensive tidal fragmentation and
ejected during close encounters of their volatile-rich parent bodies with their
host stars. Material strength enhanced by the intensive heating during
periastron passages enables the emergence of extremely elongated triaxial ISOs
with shape $c/a \lesssim 1/10$, sizes $a \sim 100$ m, and rocky surfaces.
Although volatiles with low sublimation temperature (such as CO) are
concurrently depleted, H$_2$O buried under surfaces is preserved in these ISOs,
providing an outgassing source without measurable cometary activities for
`Oumuamua's non-gravitational accelerations during its passage through the
inner Solar System. We infer that the progenitors of `Oumuamua-like ISOs may be
km-sized long-period comets from Oort clouds, km-sized residual planetesimals
from debris disks, or planet-size bodies at a few AU, orbiting around low-mass
main-sequence stars or white dwarfs. These provide abundant reservoirs to
account for `Oumuamua's occurrence rate.

log-concave polynomials of homogeneous degree $k$ on $n$ variables, we show
that the down-up random walk, started from an arbitrary point in the support,
mixes in time $O(k\log k)$. Our bound has no dependence on $n$ or the starting

factors. The main new ingredient is a property we call approximate exchange, a
generalization of well-studied exchange properties for matroids and valuated
matroids, which may be of independent interest. In particular, given function
$\mu: {[n] \choose k} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0},$ our approximate exchange
property implies that a simple local search algorithm gives a
$k^{O(k)}$-approximation of $\max_{S} \mu(S)$ when $\mu$ is generated by a
log-concave polynomial, and that greedy gives the same approximation ratio when
$\mu$ is strongly Rayleigh.
  As an application, we show how to leverage down-up random walks to
approximately sample random forests or random spanning trees in a graph with
$n$ edges in time $O(n\log^2 n).$ The best known result for sampling random
forest was a FPAUS with high polynomial runtime recently found by \cite{ALOV19,
CGM19}. For spanning tree, we improve on the almost-linear time algorithm by
[Sch18]. Our analysis works on weighted graphs too, and is the first to achieve
nearly-linear running time for these problems.

By taking account of the temporal operators used in the ontology and
distinguishing between ontologies given in full LTL and its core, Krom and Horn

rewritability into either FO(<), first-order logic with the built-in linear

algorithms must be designed that can quantify the privacy loss of each outcome
that is released. However, private algorithms that inject noise into the
computation are not sufficient to ensure individuals' data is protected due to
many noisy results ultimately concentrating to the true, non-privatized result.
Hence there have been several works providing precise formulas for how the
privacy loss accumulates over multiple interactions with private algorithms.
However, these formulas either provide very general bounds on the privacy loss,
at the cost of being overly pessimistic for certain types of private
algorithms, or they can be too narrow in scope to apply to general privacy
systems. In this work, we unify existing privacy loss composition bounds for
special classes of differentially private (DP) algorithms along with general DP
composition bounds. In particular, we provide strong privacy loss bounds when
an analyst may select pure DP, bounded range (e.g. exponential mechanisms), or
concentrated DP mechanisms in any order. We also provide optimal privacy loss
bounds that apply when an analyst can select pure DP and bounded range
mechanisms in a batch, i.e. non-adaptively. Further, when an analyst selects
mechanisms within each class adaptively, we show a difference in privacy loss
between different, predetermined orderings of pure DP and bounded range
mechanisms. Lastly, we compare the composition bounds of Laplace and Gaussian

women. I show that these variations correlate strongly with the level of the
viral receptor protein ACE2 in rat lungs, which is consistent with the still
limited and apparently contradictory data on human ACE2. Surprisingly, lower
levels of the receptor correlate with higher fatality. However, a previous
mathematical model predicts that the speed of viral progression in the organism
has a maximum and then declines with the receptor level. Moreover, many
manifestations of severe CoViD-19, such as severe lung injury, exacerbated
inflammatory response and thrombotic problems may derive from increased
Angiotensin II (Ang-II) level that results from degradation of ACE2 by the
virus. I present here a mathematical model based on the influence of ACE2 on
viral propagation and disease severity. The model fits Covid-19 fatality rate
across age and sex with high accuracy ($r^2>0.9$) under the hypothesis that
SARS-CoV-2 infections are in the dynamical regimes in which increased receptor
slows down viral propagation. Moreover, rescaling the model parameters by the
ratio of the binding rates of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
allows predicting the fatality rate of SARS-CoV across age and sex, thus
linking the molecular and epidemiological levels. The presented model opposes
the fear that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), suggested as a therapy
against the most adverse effects of CoViD-19, may favour viral propagation, and
suggests that Ang-II and ACE2 are candidate prognostic factors for detecting
population that needs stronger protection.

mode decomposition can overcome the precision of diffraction-limited direct
imaging. However, realistic measurement devices always introduce finite
crosstalk in any such mode decomposition. Here, we show that any nonzero
crosstalk leads to a breakdown of superresolution when the number $N$ of

obtain the scaling of the precision limits for weak, generic crosstalk from a
device-independent model as a function of the crosstalk probability and $N$.
The scaling of the smallest distance that can be distinguished from noise
changes from $N^{-1/2}$ for an ideal measurement to $N^{-1/4}$ in the presence

been mostly used to constrain models for Type Ia SN. Here we expand this
methodology to core-collapse SNe, including stripped envelope (SE; Type
Ib/Ic/IIb) and Type IIP SNe. We construct bolometric light curves using
photometry from the literature and we use the Katz integral to extract the
$\gamma$-ray deposition history. We recover the tight range of $\gamma$-ray
escape times, $t_0\approx30-45\,\textrm{d}$, for Type Ia SNe, and we find a new
tight range $t_0\approx80-140\,\textrm{d}$, for SE SNe. Type IIP SNe are
clearly separated from other SNe types with $t_0\gtrsim400\,\textrm{d}$, and
there is a possible negative correlation between $t_0$ and the synthesized
$^{56}$Ni mass. We find that the typical masses of the synthesized $^{56}$Ni in
SE SNe are larger than those in Type IIP SNe, in agreement with the results of
Kushnir. This disfavours progenitors with the same initial mass range for these
explosions. We recover the observed values of $ET$, the time-weighted
integrated luminosity from cooling emission, for Type IIP, and we find hints of
non-zero $ET$ values in some SE SNe. We apply a simple $ \gamma$-ray radiation
transfer code to calculate the $\gamma$-ray deposition histories of models from
the literature, and we show that the observed histories are a powerful tool for
constraining models.

quasi-one-dimensional fermion systems due to a diffusive, non-Markovian noise
bath. Such a bath is self-generated by the fermions, via inelastic scattering
mediated by short-ranged interactions. We calculate the dephasing of weak
localization perturbatively through second order in the bath coupling. However,
the expansion breaks down at long times, and is not stabilized by including a
mean-field decay rate, signaling a failure of the self-consistent Born
approximation. We also consider a many-channel quantum wire where short-ranged,
spin-exchange interactions coexist with screened Coulomb interactions. We
calculate the dephasing rate, treating the short-ranged interactions
perturbatively and the Coulomb interaction exactly. The latter provides a
physical infrared regularization that stabilizes perturbation theory at long
times, giving the first controlled calculation of quasi-1D dephasing due to
diffusive noise. At first order in the diffusive bath coupling, we find an
enhancement of the dephasing rate, but at second order we find a rephasing
contribution. Our results differ qualitatively from those obtained via
self-consistent calculations and are relevant in two different contexts. First,
in the search for precursors to many-body localization in the ergodic phase.
Second, our results provide a mechanism for the enhancement of dephasing at low
temperatures in spin SU(2)-symmetric quantum wires, beyond the
Altshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitsky result. The enhancement is possible due to the
amplification of the triplet-channel interaction strength, and provides an
additional mechanism that could contribute to the experimentally observed
low-temperature saturation of the dephasing time.

hole growth, as a function of redshift ($0<z<10$) and black hole mass ($ 10^3

for the black hole spin (with gas accretion leading to higher spin values), we
test our model against $\sim 20$ robust spin measurements available thus far.
As expected, the spin tends to decline toward the merger-dominated regime,
thereby supporting our model. The next generation of X-ray and
gravitational-wave observatories (e.g. Lynx, AXIS, Athena and LISA) will map
out populations of black holes up to very high redshift ($z\sim 20)$, covering

this observed effect. For a sample of 10 disks from the Lupus survey we
investigate how well dust-based models without radial dust evolution reproduce
the observed 12CO outer radius, and determine whether radial dust evolution is
required to match the observed gas-dust size difference. We used the
thermochemical code DALI to obtain 12CO synthetic emission maps and measure gas
and dust outer radii (Rco, Rmm) using the same methods as applied to the
observations, which were compared to observations on a source-by-source basis.
For 5 disks we find that the observed gas-dust size difference is larger than
the gas-dust size difference due to optical depth, indicating that we need both
dust evolution and optical depth effects to explain the observed gas-dust size
difference. For the other 5 disks the observed gas-dust size difference can be
explained using only line optical depth effects. We also identify 6 disks not

region that show significant 12CO emission beyond 4 x Rmm. These disks, for
which no Rco is available, likely have gas-dust size differences greater than 4
and are difficult to explain without substantial dust evolution. Our results
suggest that radial drift and grain growth are common features among both
bright and fain disks. The effects of radial drift and grain growth can be
observed in disks where the dust and gas radii are significantly different,
while more detailed models and deeper observations are needed to see this

representative sample of radiatively-efficient, non- or weakly-jetted AGN

hypothesis that the systems simply scale with mass. On the other hand we also
find that GX339-4 and our AGN sample show different $\dot{m}$ and $\Gamma$

$\sim0.16$ cf. $\sim0.08$ for AGN). GX339-4 also shows an overall softer slope,

sample overlaps nicely with GX339-4 observations in the mass-normalised $\log

be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe at low redshift.
Standard BAO analyses return a model-independent measurement of the expansion
rate and the comoving angular diameter distance as function of redshift,
normalized by the sound horizon at radiation drag. However, this methodology
relies on anisotropic distance distortions of a fixed, pre-computed template
(obtained in a given fiducial cosmology) in order to fit the observations.
Therefore, it may be possible that extensions to the consensus $\Lambda$CDM add
contributions to the BAO feature that cannot be captured by the template
fitting. We perform mock BAO fits to power spectra computed assuming
cosmological models which modify the growth of perturbations prior to
recombination in order to test the robustness of the standard BAO analysis. We
find no significant bias in the BAO analysis for the models under study
($\Lambda$CDM with a free effective number of relativistic species, early dark
energy, and a model with interactions between neutrinos and a fraction of the
dark matter), even for cases which do not provide a good fit to \textit{Planck}
measurements of the cosmic microwave background power spectra. This result
supports the use of the standard BAO analysis and its measurements to perform
cosmological parameter inference and to constrain exotic models. In addition,
we provide a methodology to reproduce our study for different models and

designed to embed the entities and relations of the knowledge graphs into a
continuous vector space. A generative network (GN) takes two elements of a

triple to distinguish a positive triple from those generated by GN. The
training goal for GN is to deceive DN to make wrong classification. When
arriving at a convergence, GN recovers the training data and can be used for
knowledge graph completion, while DN is trained to be a good triple classifier.
Unlike few previous studies based on generative adversarial architectures, our
GN is able to generate unseen instances while they just use GN to better choose
negative samples (already existed) for DN. Experiments demonstrate our method
can improve classical relational learning models (e.g.TransE) with a

a decreased strain senstivity away from the fibre's axis. In this study, the
directional senstivity is enhanced via sinusoidally shaping the fibre that is
embedded in a polyurethane strip. First, the directional senstivity is
quantified via a relatively simple analytical model. Second, static-strain
measurements using a Brillouin Optical Frequency Domain Analysis (BOFDA) system
are carried out on a physical sample of the strip. Two different directions are
examined, namely in-line and broadside orientations. The former involves
deforming parallel to the plane where the fibre is sinusoidally embedded,
whereas the latter means deforming the plane normal to it. It can be observed
that the response to the deformation in these orientations is opposite, i.e.
the fibre experiences negative strain, so shortening, an in-line deformation,
and a positive strain, so stretching, for a broadside deformation. It can be
found that the fibre is slightly more senstive in the in-line direction which
agrees with the behaviour as predicted by the model. Also, we see that the
measured strain along the optical fibre is mainly influenced by the elastic
properties of the embedding material due to, most importantly, the Poisson's

theory, which is often interpreted as nonlocality of the nature. This result
has led to this belief that nonlocality and entanglement are the same
resources. However, this belief has been critically challenged in the
literature. Here, we reexamine the relation between nonlocality and
entanglement in light of the Brassard-Cleve-Tapp (BCT) model, which was
originally proposed for simulating quantum correlation of Bell's states by
using shared random variables augmented by classical communications. We derive
a new criterion for distinguishing quantum mechanics from the BCT model through
suggesting an observable event based on the perfect correlations
(anti-correlations) relation. In particular, we show that in the BCT model one
can obtain equal outputs for two opposite input settings with the nonzero
probability 0.284. Hence, in this sense we argue that the BCT model can give
rise to an unphysical result. We also show the same problem with a nonlocal
version of the BCT model.

evolution code, we examine the effects of efficient angular momentum transport
on the main sequence and post-main sequence rotational evolution of massive
stars. In rapid rotators, angular momentum transported from the contracting
core to the expanding envelope can spin up the surface layers past the breakup

in low-metallicity environments. We also demonstrate that centrifugal
instabilities could arise in rapidly rotating massive stars, potentially
triggering the S Doradus outbursts observed in luminous blue variable stars.
Prior mass accretion from a binary companion increases both the likelihood and
the intensity of centrifugal mass loss. We discuss implications for massive
stellar evolution, Be stars, and luminous blue variables.

evaluating the time average of the signals. The interaction Hamiltonian can be
effectively built using only two-local operators, based on techniques from

the lowest similarity.

with little dependence on the Galactic longitude. We also measure the
microlensing optical depth and event rate as a function of Galactic longitude

The average optical depth decreases from $0.5\times 10^{-6}$ at l=10 deg to
$1.5\times 10^{-8}$ in the Galactic anticenter. We also find that the optical

the existing approaches achieve high accuracy by relying on domain-specific
features and architectures, making it harder to benefit from advances in other
fields (e.g., the image domain). Additionally, some of the past successes have
been attributed to a discrepancy of how results are evaluated (i.e., on
unofficial splits of the UrbanSound8K (US8K) dataset), distorting the overall
progression of the field.
  The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we present a model that is
inherently compatible with mono and stereo sound inputs. Our model is based on
simple log-power Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms and combines
them with several well-known approaches from the image domain (i.e., ResNet,
Siamese-like networks and attention). We investigate the influence of

Horizontal Visibility Graph method -- which recently was shown to quantify such

possibility of exploring such properties in the context of musical

display clear signatures of time irreversibility. Since by construction
stochastic processes with a linear correlation structure (such as 1/f noise)
are time reversible, we conclude that musical compositions have a considerably
richer structure, that goes beyond the traditional properties retrieved by the
power spectrum or similar approaches. We also show that musical compositions
display strong signs of nonlinear correlations, that nonlinearity is correlated
to irreversibility, and that these are also related to asymmetries in the
abundance of musical intervals, which we associate to the narrative
underpinning a musical composition. These findings provide tools for the study

that the emitting particles are isotropic. By means of large-scale two- and
three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that the
dissipation of magnetically-dominated ($\sigma_0\gg1$) turbulence in pair
plasmas leads to strongly anisotropic particle distributions. At Lorentz
factors $\sim \sigma_0 \gamma_{th0}$ (here, $\gamma_{th0}$ is the initial
Lorentz factor), the particle velocity is preferentially aligned with the local
magnetic field; instead, the highest energy particles are roughly isotropic.
This energy-dependent anisotropy leads to a synchrotron spectral flux $\nu
F_\nu\propto \nu^s$ that is much harder than for isotropic particles.
Remarkably, for $\sigma_0\gg1$ we find that the solid-angle-averaged spectral
slope in the slow cooling regime is $s\sim 0.5-0.7$ for a wide range of
turbulence fluctuations, $0.25\lesssim \delta B_{\rm rms0}^2/B_0^2\lesssim 4$,
despite significant variations in the power-law energy spectrum of nonthermal
particles. This is because weaker turbulence levels imprint a stronger degree
of anisotropy, thereby counteracting the effect of the steeper particle
spectrum. The synchrotron spectral slope may be even harder, $s\gtrsim 0.7$, if
the observer is in the plane perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Our
results are independent of domain size and dimensionality. Our findings may
help explaining the origin of hard synchrotron spectra of astrophysical

a starting point for hardness reductions in theory, while in practice heuristic
SAT solving algorithms can solve large-scale industrial SAT instances very
efficiently. This disparity between theory and practice is believed to be a
result of inherent properties of industrial SAT instances that make them
tractable. Two characteristic properties seem to be prevalent in the majority
of real-world SAT instances, heterogeneous degree distribution and locality. To
understand the impact of these two properties on SAT, we study the proof
complexity of random k-SAT models that allow to control heterogeneity and
locality. Our findings show that heterogeneity alone does not make SAT easy as
heterogeneous random k-SAT instances have superpolynomial resolution size. This
implies intractability of these instances for modern SAT-solvers. On the other
hand, modeling locality with an underlying geometry leads to small
unsatisfiable subformulas, which can be found within polynomial time.
  A key ingredient for the result on geometric random k-SAT can be found in the
complexity of higher-order Voronoi diagrams. As an additional technical
contribution, we show a linear upper bound on the number of non-empty Voronoi
regions, that holds for points with random positions in a very general setting.
In particular, it covers arbitrary p-norms, higher dimensions, and weights
affecting the area of influence of each point multiplicatively. This is in
stark contrast to quadratic lower bounds for the worst case.

generalizing the Thiele equation with a transverse velocity component and is

function of position. We show that the maser action and superradiance are not
competing phenomena but are rather complementary, and define two distinct
limits for the intensity of radiation. Masers characterise the quasi-steady
state limit, when the population inversion density and the polarisation
amplitude vary on time-scales longer than those of non-coherent processes
affecting their evolution (e.g., collisions), while superradiance defines the
fast transient regime taking place when these conditions are reversed. We show
how a transition from a maser regime to superradiance will take place whenever
a critical threshold for the column density of the population inversion is
reached, at which point a strong level of coherence is established in the
system and a powerful burst of radiation can ensue during the transient regime.
This critical level also determines the spatial region where a transition from
the unsaturated to the saturated maser regimes will take place; superradiance
can thus be seen as the intermediary between the two. We also quantify the gain
in radiation intensity attained during the superradiance phase relative to the
two maser regimes, and show how the strong coherence level during superradiance
is well suited to explain observations that reveal intense and fast radiation

estimates requires special methods because such stars are typically farther
away and scarce. We apply the reduced proper motion (RPM) method to identify
halo main sequence stars on the basis of Gaia photometry and proper motions.
Using the colour-absolute-magnitude relation for this type of stars, we
calculate photometric distances. Our selection results in a set of $\sim10^7$
tentative main sequence halo stars with typical distance uncertainties of $7\%$
and with median velocity errors of 20 km/s. The median distance of our sample
is $\sim 4.4$ kpc, with the faintest stars located at $\sim 16$ kpc. The
spatial distribution of the stars in our sample is centrally concentrated.
Visual inspection of the mean velocities of stars on the sky reveals
large-scale patterns as well as clear imprints of the GD-1 stream and tentative

limit our ability to interpret the patterns reliably as well as to identify new

matrix from its spectrum. While there exists a large literature on the
existence of solutions for special settings, there are only few numerical
solution methods available so far. Recently, Zhao et al. (2016) proposed a
constrained optimization model on the manifold of so-called isospectral
matrices and adapted a modified Polak-Ribi\`ere-Polyak conjugate gradient
method to the geometry of this manifold. However, not every stochastic matrix
is an isospectral one and the model from Zhao et al. is based on the assumption
that for each stochastic matrix there exists a (possibly different)
isospectral, stochastic matrix with the same spectrum. We are not aware of such
a result in the literature, but will see that the claim is at least true for $3
\times 3$ matrices. In this paper, we suggest to extend the above model by
considering matrices which differ from isospectral ones only by multiplication
with a block diagonal matrix with $2 \times 2$ blocks from the special linear
group $SL(2)$, where the number of blocks is given by the number of pairs of
complex-conjugate eigenvalues. Every stochastic matrix can be written in such a
form, which was not the case for the form of the isospectral matrices. We prove
that our model has a minimizer and show how the Polak-Ribi\`ere-Polyak
conjugate gradient method works on the corresponding more general manifold. We
demonstrate by numerical examples that the new, more general method performs
similarly as the one from Zhao et al.

analogous biomimetic systems is a key prerequisite for creating active matter

understanding of how motor-generated stresses tune the mechanics of filamentous
networks[8-11]. In microtubule-based active matter, kinesin motors generate
extensile motion that leads to persistent breaking and reforming of the network
links[12]. We study how such microscopic dynamics modifies the network's
mechanical properties, uncovering that the network viscosity first increases
with the imposed shear rate before transitioning back to a low-viscosity state.
The non-monotonic shear-dependent viscosity can be controlled by tuning the
speed of molecular motors. A two-state phenomenological model that incorporates
liquid- and solid-like elements quantitatively relates the non-monotonic
shear-rate-dependent viscosity to locally-measured flows. These studies show
that rheology of extensile networks are different from previously studied
active gels[13], where contractility enhances mechanical stiffness. Moreover,
the flow induced gelation is not captured by continuum models of
hydrodynamically interacting swimmers[14-21]. Observation of activity-dependent
viscoelasticity necessitates the development of models for self-yielding of
soft active solids whose intrinsic active stresses fluidize or stiffen the

the concept of a parasitic method of monitoring the beam which can be used for
neutron chopper phasing. This is achieved by placing a gamma detector close to
a rotating chopper and measures a signal proportional to the flux absorbed by
the chopper. Neutrons interact with the Boron absorber on the chopper disc lead
to gamma emission at 480 keV. Detection of these gamma rays is used to
determine the chopper phasing and timing. Potentially information on the flux
of the beamline can be extracted. Results from a proof of concept

tissue changes compared to conventional anatomical imaging but also presents
limited specificity. To tackle this problem, the DIAMOND model subdivides the
voxel content into diffusion compartments and draws from diffusion-weighted
data to estimate compartmental non-central matrix-variate Gamma distribution of
diffusion tensors, thereby resolving crossing fascicles while accounting for
their respective heterogeneity. Alternatively, tensor-valued diffusion encoding
defines new acquisition schemes tagging specific features of the intra-voxel
diffusion tensor distribution directly from the outcome of the measurement.
However, the impact of such schemes on estimating brain microstructural
features has only been studied in a handful of parametric single-fascicle
models. In this work, we derive a general Laplace transform for the non-central
matrix-variate Gamma distribution, which enables the extension of DIAMOND to
tensor-valued encoded data. We then evaluate this ""Magic DIAMOND"" model in
silico and in vivo on various combinations of tensor-valued encoded data.
Assessing uncertainty on parameter estimation via stratified bootstrap, we
investigate both voxel-based and fixel-based metrics by carrying out multi-peak
tractography. We show that our estimated metrics can be mapped along tracks
robustly across regions of fiber crossing, which opens new perspectives for
tractometry and microstructure mapping along specific white-matter tracts.

  Autoencoder-based Knowledge Graph Embeddings",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interaction between pharmacological agents can trigger unexpected adverse
events. Capturing richer and more comprehensive information about drug-drug
interactions (DDI) is one of the key tasks in public health and drug
development. Recently, several knowledge graph embedding approaches have
received increasing attention in the DDI domain due to their capability of
projecting drugs and interactions into a low-dimensional feature space for
predicting links and classifying triplets. However, existing methods only apply
a uniformly random mode to construct negative samples. As a consequence, these
samples are often too simplistic to train an effective model. In this paper, we
propose a new knowledge graph embedding framework by introducing adversarial
autoencoders (AAE) based on Wasserstein distances and Gumbel-Softmax relaxation
for drug-drug interactions tasks. In our framework, the autoencoder is employed
to generate high-quality negative samples and the hidden vector of the
autoencoder is regarded as a plausible drug candidate. Afterwards, the
discriminator learns the embeddings of drugs and interactions based on both
positive and negative triplets. Meanwhile, in order to solve vanishing gradient
problems on the discrete representation--an inherent flaw in traditional
generative models--we utilize the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the Wasserstein
distance to train the embedding model steadily. We empirically evaluate our
method on two tasks, link prediction and DDI classification. The experimental
results show that our framework can attain significant improvements and
noticeably outperform competitive baselines.

$\kappa_{L}$ in Cu$_{12}$Sb$_{4}$S$_{13}$ by explicitly treating anharmonicity
up to quartic terms for both phonon energies and phonon scattering rates. We
show that the strongly unstable phonon modes associated with trigonally
coordinated Cu atoms are anharmonically stabilized above approximately $100$ K
and continue hardening with increasing temperature, in accord with experimental
data. This temperature induced hardening effect reduces scattering of heat
carrying acoustic modes by reducing the available phase space for three-phonon
processes, thereby balancing the conventional $\propto T$ increase in
scattering due to phonon population and yielding nearly temperature-independent
$\kappa_{L}$. Furthermore, we find that very strong phonon broadening lead to a
qualitative breakdown of the conventional phonon-gas model and modify the
dominant heat transport mechanism from the particle-like phonon wave packet
propagation to incoherent tunneling described by off-diagonal terms in the
heat-flux operator, which are typically prevailing in glasses and disordered

tongues, are mostly visible during their emergence phase. AR tilts have been
measured thoroughly using long-term white-light (WL) databases, sometimes
combined with magnetic field information. Since the influence of magnetic
tongues on WL tilt measurements has not been taken into account before, we aim
to investigate their role in tilt-angle values and to compare them with those
derived from LOS magnetograms. We apply four methods to compute the tilt angle
of generally bipolar ARs: one applies the k-means algorithm to WL data, a
second one includes the magnetic field sign of the polarities to WL data, and a
third one uses the magnetic flux-weighted center of each polarity. The tilt
values computed in any of these ways are affected by the presence of magnetic
tongues. Therefore, we apply the newly developed Core Field Fit Estimator
(CoFFE) method to separate the magnetic flux in the tongues from that in the AR
core. We compare the four computed tilt-angle values, as well as these with the
ones reported in long-term WL databases. For ARs with low magnetic flux tongues
the different methods report consistent tilt-angle values. But for ARs with
high flux tongues there are noticeable discrepancies between all methods
indicating that magnetic tongues affect differently WL and magnetic data.
However, in general, CoFFE achieves a better estimation of the main bipole tilt
because it removes both the effect of tongues as well as the emergence of
secondary bipoles when it occurs in between the main bipole magnetic
polarities.

regret minimization in the realm of online convex optimization. There, too, a
much rougher landscape emerges for $k > 1$. While it is possible to achieve
vanishing regret, unlike the top-one action case the rate of vanishing does not
speed up for strongly convex functions. Moreover, vanishing regret necessitates
both intractable computations and randomness. Finally we leave open whether

vertices correspond to positions in a latent Euclidean space and edge
probabilities are determined by the dot products of the latent positions. We
consider RDPGs for which the latent positions are randomly sampled from an

restricted inference, i.e., procedures that exploit the structure of the
submanifold, should be more effective than unrestricted inference; however, it
is not clear how to conduct restricted inference when the submanifold is
unknown. We submit that techniques for manifold learning can be used to learn
the unknown submanifold well enough to realize benefit from restricted
inference. To illustrate, we test $1$- and $2$-sample hypotheses about the
Fr\'{e}chet means of small communities of vertices, using the complete set of
vertices to infer latent structure. We propose test statistics that deploy the
Isomap procedure for manifold learning, using shortest path distances on
neighborhood graphs constructed from estimated latent positions to estimate arc
lengths on the unknown $1$-dimensional submanifold. Unlike conventional
applications of Isomap, the estimated latent positions do not lie on the
submanifold of interest. We extend existing convergence results for Isomap to
this setting and use them to demonstrate that, as the number of auxiliary

corresponding test when the submanifold is known. Finally, we apply our methods
to an inference problem that arises in studying the connectome of the

essential problem for the mobile devices is to select appropriate local

achieve a desired balance between the overall learning performance and their
energy consumption. Two optimization problems are formulated and solved, which
optimize the learning performance given the energy consumption requirement, and
vice versa. Furthermore, considering that the data may be distributed across

Adjunctions are the common denominator of Galois connections, representation
theories, spectra, and generalized quantifiers. We call an adjunction nuclear
when its categories determine each other. We show that every adjunction can be
resolved into a nuclear adjunction. This resolution is idempotent in a strong
sense. The nucleus of an adjunction displays its conceptual core, just as the
singular value decomposition of an adjoint pair of linear operators displays
their canonical bases.
  The two composites of an adjoint pair of functors induce a monad and a
comonad. Monads and comonads generalize the closure and the interior operators
from topology, or modalities from logic, while providing a saturated view of
algebraic structures and compositions on one side, and of coalgebraic dynamics
and decompositions on the other. They are resolved back into adjunctions over
the induced categories of algebras and of coalgebras. The nucleus of an
adjunction is an adjunction between the induced categories of algebras and
coalgebras. It provides new presentations for both, revealing the meaning of
constructing algebras for a comonad and coalgebras for a monad.
  In his seminal early work, Ross Street described an adjunction between monads
and comonads in 2-categories. Lifting the nucleus construction, we show that
the resulting Street monad on monads is strongly idempotent, and extracts the
nucleus of a monad. A dual treatment achieves the same for comonads. Applying a

verification and validation of robotic systems. Recent studies have shown that
simulation may be used as a cheaper, safer, and more reliable alternative to
manual, and widely used, process of field testing. This is particularly
important in the context of continuous integration pipelines, where integrated
automated testing is key to reducing costs while maintaining system safety.
However, simulation and automated testing are not seeing the degree of
widespread adoption in practice that their potential would motivate. Our goal
in this paper is to develop a principled understanding of the ways developers
use simulation in their process, and the challenges they face in doing so. This
type of understanding can guide the development of more effective simulators
and testing techniques for modern robotics development.
  To that end, we conduct a survey of 82 robotics developers from a diversity
of backgrounds that addresses the current capabilities and limits of simulation
technology in practice. We find that simulation is used by 85% of our
participants for testing, and that many participants desire to use simulation
as part of their test automation. We identify 10 high-level challenges that
impede developers from using simulation for manual and automated testing, and
general purposes. These challenges include the gap between simulation and
reality, a lack of reproducibility, and considerable resource costs associated
with using simulators. Finally, we outline avenues for improvement in the
development of new simulators that can help simulation reach its potential as a
means of verification and validation.

longer trajectories and larger system sizes relative to ab initio methods,

disentangled from speech content, a significant amount of prosodic information,
such as source F0, leaks through the bottleneck, causing target F0 to fluctuate
unnaturally. Furthermore, AutoVC has no control of the converted F0 and thus
unsuitable for many applications. In the paper, we modified and improved
autoencoder-based voice conversion to disentangle content, F0, and speaker
identity at the same time. Therefore, we can control the F0 contour, generate
speech with F0 consistent with the target speaker, and significantly improve
quality and similarity. We support our improvement through quantitative and

  Quantum Tunneling Escape in Quantum Simulators","14 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum tunneling remains unexplored in many regimes of many-body quantum
physics, including the effect of quantum phase transitions on tunneling
dynamics. In general, the quantum phase is a statement about the ground state
and has no relation to far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Although tunneling is a
highly dynamical process involving many excited states, we find that the
quantum phase of the Bose-Hubbard model determines phase-dependent tunneling
outcomes for the quantum tunneling escape, or quasi-bound problem. Superfluid
and Mott insulator correlations lead to a new quantum tunneling rate, the
quantum fluctuation rate. This rate shows surprising and highly dynamical
features, such as oscillatory interference between trapped and escaped atoms
and a completely different macroscopic quantum tunneling behavior for
superfluid and Mott insulator phases. In the superfluid phase we find that
escape dynamics are wave-like and coherent, leading to interference patterns in
the density with a rapid decay process which is non-exponential. Quantum
entropy production peaks when about half the atoms have escaped. In the Mott
phase, despite stronger repulsive interactions, tunneling is significantly
slowed by the presence of a Mott gap, creating an effective extra barrier to
overcome. Only one atom can tunnel at a time, yet the decay process is nearly
linear, completely defying the single-particle exponential model. Moreover,
quantum entropy peaks when only about one quarter of the atoms have escaped.
These and many other such effects go beyond the usual notions of
single-particle quantum tunneling, quantum statistical effects on tunneling,
and well-known semi-classical approaches from WKB to instanton theory. These
results thus open up a new regime of exploration of far-from-equilibrium
dynamics for quantum simulators and quantum dynamics.

prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that
facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally

allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with
no other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for
scalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called
'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data
platform 'Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our

verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and
digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive
digital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly
in the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For
the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and

association uncertainty, i.e., the associations between measurements and target
tracks are unknown. Existing CS and tracking algorithms either make the
assumption of no data association uncertainty or employ a hard-decision rule
for measurement-to-target associations. We propose a novel decentralized
SCS-MTT method for an unknown and time-varying number of targets under
association uncertainty. Marginal posterior densities for agents and targets
are obtained by an efficient belief propagation (BP) based scheme while data
association is handled by marginalizing over all target-to-measurement
association probabilities. Decentralized single Gaussian and Gaussian mixture
implementations are provided based on average consensus schemes, which require
communication only with one-hop neighbors. An additional novelty is a
decentralized Gibbs mechanism for efficient evaluation of the product of
Gaussian mixtures. Numerical experiments show the improved CS and MTT

Among them, the V P of the intra-valley bright-dark biexcitons increases with
increasing magnetic field and reaches nearly 50% at B=65 T. The brightened dark

relaxation time. Remarkably, the inter-valley bright-dark biexciton shows
unconventional behavior with an inverted VP. The opposite VP for intra- and

well with the observed masses, mass ratios, effective spin parameters, and
final spins of the LVC O1/O2 merger events, provided BHs are born with low or

not possible because of cost considerations. Assuming adequate source sampling
is available, which is achievable by virtue of reciprocity and the use of
modern randomized (simultaneous-source) marine acquisition technology, we are
in a position to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bring the
receiver sampling to the same spatial grid as the dense source sampling. To
accomplish this task, we form training pairs consisting of densely sampled data
and artificially subsampled data using a reciprocity argument and the
assumption that the source-site sampling is dense. While this approach has
successfully been used on the recovery monochromatic frequency slices, its
application in practice calls for wavefield reconstruction of time-domain data.
Despite having the option to parallelize, the overall costs of this approach
can become prohibitive if we decide to carry out the training and recovery
independently for each frequency. Because different frequency slices share
information, we propose the use the method of transfer training to make our
approach computationally more efficient by warm starting the training with CNN
weights obtained from a neighboring frequency slices. If the two neighboring
frequency slices share information, we would expect the training to improve and
converge faster. Our aim is to prove this principle by carrying a series of
carefully selected experiments on a relatively large-scale five-dimensional

are able t significantly speedup in the training, specially at relatively

focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing,
contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We
develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of
these mitigation strategies. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to
COVID-19 transmission in New York state and the entire US, show that the
pandemic will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario
projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of
anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) in New
York State and the entire US decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%,
respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are
maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. This study shows that early
termination of strict social-distancing could trigger a devastating second wave
with burden similar to that projected before the onset of strict
social-distance. The use of efficacious face-masks (efficacy greater than 70%)
could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents
of New York state use such masks consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at
least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks,
such as cloth masks (of efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant
reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to
elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of other
anti-COVID-19 intervention measures can lead to elimination of the pandemic.
The mask coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if mask-use is
combined with strict social-distancing.

  In this paper, we present a visual servoing method using an event camera and
a switching control strategy to explore, reach and grasp to achieve a
manipulation task. We devise three surface layers of active events to directly
process stream of events from relative motion. A purely event based approach is
adopted to extract corner features, localize them robustly using heat maps and
generate virtual features for tracking and alignment. Based on the visual
feedback, the motion of the robot is controlled to make the temporal upcoming
event features converge to the desired event in spatio-temporal space. The
controller switches its strategy based on the sequence of operation to
establish a stable grasp. The event based visual servoing (EVBS) method is
validated experimentally using a commercial robot manipulator in an eye-in-hand
configuration. Experiments prove the effectiveness of the EBVS method to track
and grasp objects of different shapes without the need for re-tuning.

requires theoretical input in the form of non-perturbative nuclear matrix

step toward providing a general lattice QCD framework for computing
long-distance \(0 \nu \beta \beta\) matrix elements in the case where the decay

a novel learning architecture, called Detail-Oriented Capsule Networks

scans. Our network combines the strength of Capsule Networks with several
architecture improvements meant to boost classification accuracies. First,
DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism which increases model
stability by preventing the passage of information from non-descriptive
regions. Second, DECAPS employs a Peekaboo training procedure which uses a
two-stage patch crop and drop strategy to encourage the network to generate
activation maps for every target concept. The network then uses the activation
maps to focus on regions of interest and combines both coarse and fine-grained
representations of the data. Finally, we use a data augmentation method based
on conditional generative adversarial networks to deal with the issue of data
scarcity. Our model achieves 84.3% precision, 91.5% recall, and 96.1% area
under the ROC curve, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We
compare the performance of the DECAPS model with three experienced,
well-trained thoracic radiologists and show that the architecture significantly
outperforms them. While further studies on larger datasets are required to
confirm this finding, our results imply that architectures like DECAPS can be
used to assist radiologists in the CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID-19.

co-evolution of black holes and galaxies. It has been characterized
observationally up to redshift $z\sim6$ with clear evidence of a double
power-law shape, in contrast to the Schechter-like form of the underlying
dark-matter halo mass function. We investigate a physical origin for the
difference in these distributions by considering the impact of stochasticity
induced by the processes that determine the quasar luminosity for a given host
halo and redshift. We employ a conditional luminosity function and construct
the relation between median quasar magnitude versus halo mass
$M_{UV,\rm{c}}(M_{\rm{h}})$ with log-normal in luminosity scatter $\Sigma$, and
duty-cycle $\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}$, and focus on high redshift $z\gtrsim4$. We
show that, in order to reproduce the observed QLF, the $\Sigma=0$ abundance
matching requires all of the brightest quasars to be hosted in the rarest most
massive dark-matter halos (with an increasing $M_{UV,\rm{c}}/M_{\rm{h}}$ in
halo mass). Conversely, for $\Sigma>0$ the brightest quasars can be
over-luminous outliers hosted in relatively common dark-matter halos. In this
case, the median quasar magnitude versus halo mass relation, $M_{UV,\rm{c}}$,
flattens at the high-end, as expected in self-regulated growth due to feedback.
We sample the parameter space of $\Sigma$ and $\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}$ and show
that $M_{UV,\rm{c}}$ flattens above $M_{\rm{h}}\sim 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ for
$\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}<10^{-2}$. Models with $\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}\sim1$ instead
require a high mass threshold close to $M_{\rm{h}}\gtrsim10^{13}M_{\odot}$. We
investigate the impact of $\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}$ and $\Sigma$ on measurements of
clustering and find there is no luminosity dependence on clustering for
$\Sigma>0.3$, consistent with recent observations from Subaru HSC.

scientific application for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.
Due to their high gate-error rates and short decoherence times, however, NISQ
computers can only produce high-fidelity results for those quantum circuits
smaller than some given circuit size. Dynamic simulations, therefore, pose a
challenge as current algorithms produce circuits that grow in size with each
subsequent time-step of the simulation. This underscores the crucial role of
quantum circuit compilers to produce executable quantum circuits of minimal
size, thereby maximizing the range of physical phenomena that can be studied
within the NISQ fidelity budget. Here, we present two domain-specific quantum
circuit compilers for the Rigetti and IBM quantum computers, specifically
designed to compile circuits simulating dynamics under a special class of
time-dependent Hamiltonians. The compilers outperform state-of-the-art
general-purpose compilers in terms of circuit size reduction by around 25-30%
as well as wall-clock compilation time by around 40% (dependent on system size
and simulation time-step). Drawing on heuristic techniques commonly used in
artificial intelligence, both compilers scale well with simulation time-step
and system size. Code for both compilers is included to enhance the results of
dynamic simulations for future researchers. We anticipate that our
domain-specific compilers will enable dynamic simulations of quantum materials
on near-future NISQ computers that would not otherwise be possible with
general-purpose compilers.

disruptions in human and economic activities all over the globe. The recovery
process is also expected to be rough. Economic activities impact social
behaviors, which leave signatures in satellite images that can be automatically
detected and classified. Satellite imagery can support the decision-making of
analysts and policymakers by providing a different kind of visibility into the
unfolding economic changes. In this work, we use a deep learning approach that
combines strategic location sampling and an ensemble of lightweight
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize specific elements in
satellite images that could be used to compute economic indicators based on it,
automatically. This CNN ensemble framework ranked third place in the US
Department of Defense xView challenge, the most advanced benchmark for object
detection in satellite images. We show the potential of our framework for
temporal analysis using the US IARPA Function Map of the World (fMoW) dataset.

regional assessment of pulmonary diseases. Recent works based on convolution
neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are
still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of
convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their
borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways,
and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a
critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are
affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD.
  In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages
structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network
module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships
among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights.
  With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we
initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the
COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models
pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate
RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation).
Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and
performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.

when there exist gapless Weyl nodes in the bulk single-particle spectrum.
However, in the presence of electronic correlations, it is not clear whether
this bulk-boundary correspondence still holds or not. Recently, novel
correlated phases are predicted to appear in WSMs with long-ranged
interactions, in which the bulk Weyl nodes can be gapped but without destroying
their topological properties. Here, we explore the fate of the Fermi-arc states
under the influence of such long-ranged interactions. After mapping the system
onto a one-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with two
open ends, we employ numerical exact diagonalizations to address the issue
whether the Fermi-arc states will be modified. By extrapolating our data to the
thermodynamic limit, we find that the zero-energy edge states of the
corresponding SSH model still exist for those momenta giving the noninteracting
Fermi-arc states. Moreover, this observation applies to both the
single-particle and the collective edge excitations. Since the locus of these
edge states constitutes the Fermi arcs, the robustness of the Fermi-arc states
against long-ranged interactions is thus demonstrated. In particular, the Fermi
arcs of single-particle nature can survive even when the single-particle gaps
at the Weyl nodes are opened by interactions. Our results illustrate the
subtlety in identifying the topological phases of interacting WSMs and show the
limitation of the approaches simply by examining the nodal structure of the
single-particle spectrum.

of points, $V$ and $C$, that lie in the same metric space, and our goal is to
choose a point in $C$ whose total distance from the points in $V$ is as small
as possible. However, rather than having access to the underlying distance
metric, we only know, for each point in $V$, a ranking of its distances to the
points in $C$. We propose algorithms that choose a point in $C$ using only
these rankings as input and we provide bounds on their \emph{distortion}
(worst-case approximation ratio). A prominent motivation for this problem comes
from voting theory, where $V$ represents a set of voters, $C$ represents a set
of candidates, and the rankings correspond to ordinal preferences of the
voters. A major conjecture in this framework is that the optimal deterministic
algorithm has distortion $3$. We resolve this conjecture by providing a
polynomial-time algorithm that achieves distortion $3$, matching a known lower
bound. We do so by proving a novel lemma about matching voters to candidates,
which we refer to as the \emph{ranking-matching lemma}. This lemma induces a
family of novel algorithms, which may be of independent interest, and we show
that a special algorithm in this family achieves distortion $3$. We also
provide more refined, parameterized, bounds using the notion of
$\alpha$-decisiveness, which quantifies the extent to which a voter may prefer
her top choice relative to all others. Finally, we introduce a new randomized
algorithm with improved distortion compared to known results, and also provide
improved lower bounds on the distortion of all deterministic and randomized

we successfully measured global galaxy properties, modeled stellar populations,
and created dynamical models, and support the results using detailed dynamical
models of 16 galaxies, including the two most massive cluster galaxies, using
data taken with the SAURON IFU. By design, the study provides minimal scatter
in derived scaling relations due to the small uncertainty in the relative
distances of galaxies compared to the cluster distance. Our results demonstrate
low ($\leq$55% for 90$^{th}$ percentile) dark matter fractions in the inner
1$R_{\rm e}$ ~of galaxies. Owing to the study design, we produce the tightest,
to our knowledge, IMF-$\sigma_e$ relation of galaxies, with a slope consistent
with that seen in local galaxies. Leveraging our dynamical models, we transform
the classical Fundamental Plane of the galaxies to the Mass Plane. We find that
the coefficients of the mass plane are close to predictions from the virial
theorem, and have significantly lower scatter compared to the Fundamental
plane. We show that Coma galaxies occupy similar locations in the (M$_*$ -

example, we are able to suggest an explanation for how one approach, String
Theory, has become so dominant. Second, our application of theories of social
reproduction to the substance of scientific inquiry merits some substantive
generalizations to Daston and Galison's framework. Most significantly, we

single-person pose estimation. For use in human-machine cooperative operations,
this paper proposes a single-person upper limb pose estimation method based on
an end-to-end approach for accurate and real-time limb pose estimation. Using
the stacked hourglass network model, a single-person upper limb skeleton key
point detection model was designed.Deconvolution was employed to replace the
up-sampling operation of the hourglass module in the original model, solving
the problem of rough feature maps. Integral regression was used to calculate
the position coordinates of key points of the skeleton, reducing quantization
errors and calculations. Experiments showed that the developed single-person
upper limb skeleton key point detection model achieves high accuracy and that
the pose estimation method based on the end-to-end approach provides high
accuracy and real-time performance.

  We prove some general sufficient conditions in terms of $\Delta_A$,
$\Delta_B$, $k_A$, $k_B$ to be guaranteed a proper colouring such that each

nearly sharp in the very asymmetric cases. We establish one sufficient

and $k_B=(1+o(1))\Delta/\log\Delta$ as $\Delta\to\infty$. This amounts to
partial progress towards a conjecture from 1998 of Krivelevich and the first

  We also derive some necessary conditions through an intriguing connection
between the complete case and the extremal size of approximate Steiner systems.
We show that for complete bipartite graphs these conditions are asymptotically
nearly sharp in a large part of the parameter space. This has provoked the
following.
  In the setup above, we conjecture that a proper list colouring is always

in mechanics. However, many of the investigations on this topic to date have
focused on peeling from substrates with flat surfaces. In this paper, we study
the problem of peeling an elastic thin film from a rigid substrate that has
periodic surface undulations. We allow for contact between the detached part of
the film with the substrate. We give analytical results for computing the
equilibrium force given the true peeling angle, which is the angle at which the
detached part of the film leaves the substrate. When there is no contact we
present explicit results for computing the true peeling angle from the
substrate's profile and for determining an equilibrium state's stability solely
from the substrate's surface curvature. The general results that we derive for
the case involving contact allow us to explore the regime of peeling at large
surface roughnesses. Our analysis of this regime reveals that the peel-off
force can be made to become independent of the peeling direction by roughening
the surface. This result is in stark contrast to results from peeling on flat
surfaces, where the peel-off force strongly depends on the peeling direction.
Our analysis also reveals that in the large roughness regime the peel-off force
achieves its theoretical upper bound, irrespective of the other particulars of
the substrate's surface profile.

from nearby APs, and dynamic blockages caused by moving humans. Then, we
develop a novel easy-to-use analytical framework based on the dominant
interferer analysis to evaluate the coverage probability, the novelty of which
lies in the incorporation of the instantaneous interference and the vertical
height of THz devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our
analysis and reveal that the coverage probability significantly decreases when
the transmission distance increases. We also show the increasing blocker
density and increasing AP density impose different impacts on the coverage
performance when the UE-AP link of interest is in line-of-sight. We further
show that the coverage performance improvement brought by increasing the
antenna directivity at APs is higher than that brought by increasing the

Hawking flux. However, after a series of field re-definitions, we can
disentangle the mode-mixings into canonical normal modes, but the reduced
metrics for these normal modes are mode-dependent. Despite of this, the
resultant Hawking flux turns out to be mode-independent and remains the same as
the Schwarzschild's one. Thus, one cannot tell the black holes with nonlinear
supertranslation hairs from the Schwarzschild's one by examining the Hawking
flux, so that the nonlinear soft hairs can be thought as the microstates.

construct the related source 2-form. We also obtain the consistency relation

satisfy in order that spinor-matter coupled MMG equation be consistent.

While migration sometimes occurs in the supersonic regime, wherein the relative
velocity between the planetary embryo and the gas is higher than the sound
speed, migration prescriptions proposed thus far describing the planet-disc
interaction force and the timescales of orbital change in the supersonic regime
are inconsistent with one another. Here we discuss the details of existing

variations with radial scales less than the disc scale height). Our
prescription will reduce the uncertainty originating from different literature
formulations of planet migration and will be an important tool to study planet
accretion processes, especially when studying the formation of close-in
low-mass planets that are commonly found in exoplanetary systems.

directly measuring the likelihood that a tracklet represents natural motion.
One key property of our model is its ability to generate multiple likely

score tracklets but also effectively maintain existing tracklets when the
detector fails to detect some objects even for a long time, e.g., due to
occlusion, by sampling trajectories so as to inpaint the gaps caused by
misdetection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to
scoring and inpainting tracklets on several MOT benchmark datasets. We
additionally show the generality of our generative model by using it to produce

thereby always cast a closed photon ring or a shadow silhouette for $a\leq M$.
For $a>M$, it is a no-horizon spacetime (naked singularity) wherein prograde
orbits spiral into the central singularity, and retrograde orbits produce an
arc-like shadow with a dark spot at the center. We compare Kerr black holes'
photon ring structure with those produced by three rotating regular spacetimes,
viz. Bardeen, Hayward, and nonsingular. These are non-Kerr black hole metrics
with an additional deviation parameter of $g$ related to the nonlinear
electrodynamics charge. It turns out that for a given $ a $, there exists a
critical value of $ g $, $g_E$ such that $\Delta=0$ has no zeros for $ g >
g_E$, one double zero at $ r = r_E $ for $ g = g_E $, respectively,
corresponding to a no-horizon regular spacetime and extremal black hole with
degenerate horizon. We demonstrate that, unlike the Kerr naked singularity,
no-horizon regular spacetimes can possess closed photon ring when $g_E< g \leq

results confirm that the mere existence of a closed photon ring does not prove

satisfy $\Delta C\leq 0.10$ as per the M87* black hole shadow observations. We

separation depends on the physical modeling on all scales internal to that
separation, systematic uncertainties in the modeling of non-linear small scales
are propagated outwards to larger scales. Even in the absence of other limiting
factors, this systematic effect alone can necessitate conservative small-scale
cuts, resulting in significant losses of information in the tangential shear
data vector. We construct a simple linear transformation of the observable that
removes this non-locality, enabling more aggressive small-scale cuts for a

possible to include observations on significantly smaller scales than those

in agile software communities and how effective are those patterns? We address
these research questions using mixed-methods research in industry, that is,
interview surveys, focus-groups, and delphi studies of agile teams. In our

structure patterns that recur across our dataset, a single organisational
pattern occurs over 37% of the time. This pattern: (a) reflects young
communities (1-12 months old); (b) disappears in established ones (13+ months);
(c) reflects the highest number of architecture issues reported. Finally, we
observe a negative correlation between a proposed organisational measure and
architecture issues. These insights may serve to aid architects in designing

to extract a collection of mid-level features for semantic phrases in a text
query, which corresponds to important semantic entities described in the query
(e.g., actors, objects, and actions), and reflect bi-modal interactions between
the linguistic features of the query and the visual features of the video in
multiple levels. The proposed method effectively predicts the target time
interval by exploiting contextual information from local to global during
bi-modal interactions. Through in-depth ablation studies, we find out that
incorporating both local and global context in video and text interactions is
crucial to the accurate grounding. Our experiment shows that the proposed
method outperforms the state of the arts on Charades-STA and ActivityNet
Captions datasets by large margins, 7.44\% and 4.61\% points at Recall@tIoU=0.5

bursts depends on eccentricity. Methods: We investigate the binary trigger
hypothesis in longer-period (>20yr) binaries by carrying out three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the formation of low-mass binary
stars down to final separations of $\sim$10$\au$, including the effects of gas
turbulence and magnetic fields. We ran two simulations with an initial
turbulent gas core of one solar mass each and two different initial turbulent
Mach numbers, M = 0.1 and M=0.2, for 6500yr after protostar formation. Results:
We observe bursts of accretion at periastron during the early stages when the
eccentricity of the binary system is still high. We find that this correlation
between bursts of accretion and passing periastron breaks down at later stages
because of the gradual circularisation of the orbits. For eccentricities
greater than e=0.2, we observe episodic accretion triggered near periastron.
However, we do not find any strong correlation between the strength of episodic
accretion and eccentricity. The strength of accretion is defined as the ratio
of the burst accretion rate to the quiescent accretion rate.We determine that
accretion events are likely triggered by torques between the rotation of the
circumstellar disc and the approaching binary stars. We compare our results
with observational data of episodic accretion in short-period binaries and find
good agreement between our simulations and the observations. Conclusions: We
conclude that episodic accretion is a universal mechanism operating in
eccentric young binary-star systems, independent of separation, and it should
be observable in long-period binaries as well as in short-period binaries.
Nevertheless, the strength depends on the torques and hence the separation at
periastron.

development. Despite it is claimed to improve both quality of software and
developers' productivity, the research on the claimed effects of TDD has so far
shown inconclusive results. Some researchers have ascribed these inconclusive
results to the negative affective states that TDD would provoke. A previous
(baseline) experiment has, therefore, studied the affective reactions of
(novice) developers---i.e., 29 third-year undergraduates in Computer Science
(CS)---when practicing TDD to implement software. To validate the results of
the baseline experiment, we conducted a replicated experiment that studies the
affective reactions of novice developers when applying TDD to develop software.
Developers in the treatment group carried out a development task using TDD,
while those in the control group used a non-TDD approach. To measure the
affective reactions of developers, we used the Self-Assessment Manikin
instrument complemented with a liking dimension. The most important differences
between the baseline and replicated experiments are: (i) the kind of novice
developers involved in the experiments---third-year vs. second-year
undergraduates in CS from two different universities; and (ii) their
number---29 vs. 59. The results of the replicated experiment do not show any
difference in the affective reactions of novice developers. Instead, the
results of the baseline experiment suggest that developers seem to like TDD
less as compared to a non-TDD approach and that developers following TDD seem
to like implementing code less than the other developers, while testing code
seems to make them less happy.

axial anomaly the electric current in a system consisting of interacting
fermions and gauge field with chirality imbalance that is put into a strong
external magnetic field. Experimental search of the magnetically induced
current in QCD in heavy ion collisions above a pseudocritical temperature
hints, though not yet conclusive, that the induced current is either small or
vanishing. This would imply that the chirality imbalance in QCD above $T_c$
that could be generated via topological fluctuations is at most very small.
Here we present the most general reason for absence (smallness) of the
chirality imbalance in QCD above Tc. It was recently found on the lattice that
QCD above Tc is approximately chiral spin (CS) symmetric with the symmetry
breaking at the level of a few percent. The CS transformations mix the right-
and left-handed components of quarks. Then an exact CS symmetry would require
absence of any chirality imbalance. Consequently an approximate CS symmetry
admits at most a very small chirality imbalance in QCD above Tc. Hence the
absence or smallness of an magnetically induced current observed in heavy ion
collisions could be considered as experimental evidence for emergence of the CS
symmetry above Tc.

the selection of the matching method to predict the result as well as to decide

whether to update the target template according to the quality of the predicted

promise for advances in lasers, sensing, and non-reciprocal devices. And yet,
how such effective $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian models emerge out of
Hermitian quantum mechanics is not well understood. Here, starting from a fully
Hermitian microscopic Hamiltonian description, we show that a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian emerges naturally in a double-quantum-dot-circuit-QED (DQD-circuit
QED) set-up, which can be controllably tuned to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
point. This effective Hamiltonian governs the dynamics of two coupled
circuit-QED cavities with a voltage-biased DQD in one of them. Our analysis
also reveals the effect of quantum fluctuations on the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric
system. The $\mathcal{PT}$-transition is, then, observed both in the dynamics
of cavity observables as well as via an input-output experiment. As a simple
application of the $\mathcal{PT}$-transition in this set-up, we show that
loss-induced enhancement of amplification and lasing can be observed in the
coupled cavities. By comparing our results with two conventional local Lindblad
equations, we demonstrate the utility and limitations of the latter. Our
results pave the way for an on-chip realization of a potentially scalable
non-Hermitian system with a gain medium in quantum regime, as well as its
potential applications for quantum technology.

this is often challenging because patient cohorts are typically small and can
be heterogeneous. In classical subgroup analysis, a separate prediction model
is fitted using only the data of one specific cohort. However, this can lead to
a loss of power when the sample size is small. Simple pooling of all cohorts,
on the other hand, can lead to biased results, especially when the cohorts are
heterogeneous. For this situation, we propose a new Bayesian approach suitable
for continuous molecular measurements and survival outcome that identifies the
important predictors and provides a separate risk prediction model for each
cohort. It allows sharing information between cohorts to increase power by
assuming a graph linking predictors within and across different cohorts. The
graph helps to identify pathways of functionally related genes and genes that
are simultaneously prognostic in different cohorts. Results demonstrate that
our proposed approach is superior to the standard approaches in terms of
prediction performance and increased power in variable selection when the

propose a discriminative modeling framework that employs manipulated supervised

reconstructions and controlled generations using an appropriate decoder without
enforcing any prior distribution. Theoretically, given a class, we show that
these representations when smartly manipulated using convex combinations retain
the same class label. Furthermore, they also lead to the novel generation of
visually realistic images. Extensive experiments on datasets of varying
resolutions demonstrate that ReGene has higher classification accuracy than
existing conditional generative models while being competitive in terms of FID.

two different critical current densities for the two different domain wall

motivated by the possibility that inflation and the present phase of
accelerated expansion be due to the same dark energy. Then, in a phase space
showing the variation of matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ with respect to
this of the radiation $\Omega_r$, the curve $\Omega_m(\Omega_r)$ looks like a
closed trajectory that Universe could run through forever. In this case, the
end of the expansion acceleration of the $\Lambda CDM$ phase is the beginning
of a new inflation phase. We show that such a scenario implies the coupling of
matter and/or radiation to dark energy. We consider the simplest of these
$\Lambda CDM$ periodic models i.e. a vacuum energy coupled to radiation. From
matter domination phase to today, it behaves like a $\Lambda CDM$ model, then
followed by an inflation phase. But a sudden and fast decay of the dark energy
into radiation periodically ends the expansion acceleration. This leads to a
radiation dominated Universe preceding a new $\Lambda CDM$ type expansion. The
model is constrained with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations using
supernovae, Hubble expansion, BAO and CMB data and fits the data as well as the

computing (MEC) system, where active mobile devices with computation tasks
randomly appear in a cell. Every task can be computed at either the mobile
device or the MEC server. We jointly optimize the task offloading decision,
uplink transmission device selection and power allocation by formulating the
problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP). Compared with
most of the existing literature, this is the first attempt to address the
transmission and computation optimization with the random device arrivals in an
infinite time horizon to our best knowledge. Due to the uncertainty in the
device number and location, the conventional approximate MDP approaches
addressing the curse of dimensionality cannot be applied. An alternative and
suitable low-complexity solution framework is proposed in this work. We first
introduce a baseline scheduling policy, whose value function can be derived
analytically with the statistics of random mobile device arrivals. Then,
one-step policy iteration is adopted to obtain a sub-optimal scheduling policy
whose performance can be bounded analytically. The complexity of deriving the
sub-optimal policy is reduced dramatically compared with conventional solutions
of MDP by eliminating the complicated value iteration. To address a more
general scenario where the statistics of random mobile device arrivals are
unknown, a novel and efficient algorithm integrating reinforcement learning and
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is proposed to improve the system performance
in an online manner. Simulation results show that the gain of the sub-optimal
policy over various benchmarks is significant.

the force balance starts breaking in the stochastic region. To keep the force
balance, the pressure gradient in the stochastic region decreases and the fixed

improvement but also spatially interpretable outputs. Moreover, the proposed
SAOL also permits to fully exploit location-specific self-supervision as well

directed migratory movement. Investigations identified genes and proteins that
play important roles in defining the migration efficiency. Nevertheless, the
sensing and transduction mechanisms underlying directed cell migration are
still under discussion. We use Dictyostelium discoideum cells as model system
for studying eukaryotic cell migration in DC electric fields. We have defined
the temporal electric persistence to characterize the memory that cells have in
a varying electric field. In addition to imposing a directional bias, we
observed that the electric field influences the cellular kinematics by
accelerating the movement of cells along their paths. Moreover, the study of
vegetative and briefly starved cells provided insight into the electrical
sensing of cells. We found evidence that conditioned medium of starved cells
was able to trigger the electrical sensing of vegetative cells that would
otherwise not orient themselves in the electric field. This observation may be
explained by the presence of the conditioned medium factor (CMF), a protein
secreted by the cells, when they begin to starve. The results of this study
give new insights into understanding the mechanism that triggers the electrical
sensing and transduces the external stimulus into directed cell migration.
Finally, the observed increased mobility of cells over time in an electric
field could offer a novel perspective towards wound healing assays.

  Systems",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for frequency division
duplex (FDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Most conventional
algorithms are based on compressive sensing (CS) and are highly dependent on
the level of channel sparsity. To address the issue, a recent approach adopts
deep learning (DL) to compress CSI into a codeword with low dimensionality,
which has shown much better performance than the CS algorithms when feedback
link is perfect. In practical scenario, however, there exists various
interference and non-linear effect. In this article, we design a DL-based
denoise network, called DNNet, to improve the performance of channel feedback.
Numerical results show that the DL-based feedback algorithm with the proposed
DNNet has superior performance over the existing algorithms, especially at low

Information Criterion the most commonly used technique. Typically, a number of
candidate models are defined a priori and ranked according to their expected
out-of-sample performance. Model selection, however, only assesses the relative
performance of the models and, as pointed out in a recent paper, a large
proportion of ecology papers that use model selection do not assess the
absolute fit of the `best' model. In this paper, it is argued that assessing
the absolute fit of the `best' model alone does not go far enough. This is
because a model that appears to perform well under model selection is also
likely to appear to perform well under measures of absolute fit, even when
there is no predictive value. A model selection permutation test is proposed
that assesses the probability that the model selection statistic of the `best'
model could have occurred by chance alone, whilst taking account of
dependencies between the models. It is argued that this test should always be
performed before formal model selection takes place. The test is demonstrated
on two real population modelling examples of ibex in northern Italy and wild
reindeer in Norway.

gas mass by summing the CO line intensity within each HI cloud. On the basis of
the results, we created a catalog of 5,737 identified HI clouds with local
standard of rest (LSR) velocity of $V_{\rm LSR}\le -20$ km s$^{-1}$ in Galactic
longitude and latitude ranges of $20^\circ \le l \le 50^\circ$ and $-1^\circ

distributed within a Galactocentric distance of 16 kpc, most of which are in
the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) phase. In addition, we determined that the
high-mass end of the mass HI function is well fitted with the power-law
function with an index of 2.3. Although two sequences of self-gravitating and
diffuse clouds are expected to appear in the M$_{\rm tot}$-M$_{{\rm H}_2}$

observational data show only a single sequence with large scattering within
these two sequences. This implies that most of the clouds are mixtures of these
two types of clouds. Moreover, we suggest the following scenario of molecular
gas formation: An HI-dominant cloud evolved with increasing H$_2$ mass along a
path of $M_{{\rm H}_2} \propto M_{\rm tot}^2$ by collecting diffuse gas before
reaching and moving along the curves of the two sequences.

meeting the requirements for the heating of the upper layers of the solar
atmosphere and this conclusion does not change even if we use the least

kick stand model is based on a momentum kick by leading jets to partons in the
medium close to the leading jets. The medium where partons move freely is
assumed in the model regardless of collision systems. This helps us apply the
method to small systems like pp collisions in a simple way. Also, the momentum
transfer is purely kinematic and this provides us a strong way to approach the
ridge behaviour analytically. There are already several results with this
approach in high-energy heavy-ion collisions from the STAR and PHENIX at RHIC

ridge results in high-multiplicity pp collisions with the ATLAS and CMS at LHC.
The medium property in high-multiplicity pp collisions is diagnosed with the

Specifically, the patterns of water surface waves for each protein structure is
used to build training sets for neural networks, aimed to classify and further
process the patterns. Once trained, the neural network model is capable of
discerning different proteins solely by analyzing the macroscopic surface wave
patterns in the water film. Not only can the method distinguish different types

it is also capable of determining different folding states of the same protein,

instances of key features of the deep neural network can be made visible in a
range of images, allowing us to explore the inner workings of protein surface
wave patter neural networks, as well as the creation of new images by finding
and highlighting features of protein molecular spectra in a range of

Recently, supply chain systems that use public blockchain (PBC) have been
proposed. In these systems, PBC is used as a common database shared between
supply chain parties to secure the integrity and reliability of distribution
information such as ownership transfer records. Thus, these systems secure a
high level of traceability in the supply chain. However, the distribution
information, which can be private information, is made public since the
information recorded in PBC can be read by anyone. In this paper, we propose a
method for preserving privacy while securing traceability in a supply chain
system using PBC. The proposed method preserves privacy by concealing the
distribution information via encryption. In addition, the proposed method
ensures distribution among legitimate supply chain parties while concealing
their blockchain address by using a zero-knowledge proof to prove their
authenticity. We implement the proposed method on Ethereum smart contracts and
evaluate cost performance based on transaction fees. The results show that the
fee per party is at most 2.6 USD.

period from 2000 to 2017. The information flow from one sector to another is
measured by the transfer entropy of the daily returns of the two sector
indices. We find that the most active sector in information exchange (i.e., the
largest total information inflow and outflow) is the {\textit{non-bank
financial}} sector in the Chinese market and the {\textit{technology}} sector
in the USA market. This is consistent with the role of the non-bank sector in
corporate financing in China and the impact of technological innovation in the
USA. In each market, the most active sector is also the largest information
sink that has the largest information inflow (i.e., inflow minus outflow). In
contrast, we identify that the main information source is the {\textit{bank}}
sector in the Chinese market and the {\textit{energy}} sector in the USA
market. In the case of China, this is due to the importance of net bank lending
as a signal of corporate activity and the role of energy pricing in affecting
corporate profitability. There are sectors such as the {\textit{real estate}}
sector that could be an information sink in one market but an information
source in the other, showing the complex behavior of different markets.
Overall, these findings show that stock markets are more synchronized, or

advantage of holomorphic embedding methods (HEM) is that, even when they do not
converge, roots plots of the Pad\'e approximants (PAs) to the functions in the
inverse-$\alpha$ plane can be used to determine whether a solution exist. The
convergence factor (CF) of the near-diagonal PAs applied to functions expanded
about the origin is determined by the logarithmic capacity of the associated
branch cut (BC) and the distance of the evaluation point from the origin.
However the underlying mechanism governing this rate has been obscure. We prove
that the ultimate distribution of the PA roots on the BC in the complex plane
converges weakly to the equilibrium distribution of electrostatic charges on a

medical image registration applications. In recent years, deep learning
technique has become a promising approach for simplifying registration
problems, and has been gradually applied to medical image registration.
However, most existing deep learning registrations do not consider the problem
that when the receptive field cannot cover the corresponding features in the
moving image and the fixed image, it cannot output accurate displacement
values. In fact, due to the limitation of the receptive field, the 3 x 3 kernel
has difficulty in covering the corresponding features at high/original
resolution. Multi-resolution and multi-convolution techniques can improve but
fail to avoid this problem. In this study, we constructed pyramidal feature
sets on moving and fixed images and used the warped moving and fixed features
to estimate their ""residual"" deformation field at each scale, called the
Pyramidal Residual Deformation Field Estimation module (PRDFE-Module). The
""total"" deformation field at each scale was computed by upsampling and weighted
summing all the ""residual"" deformation fields at all its previous scales, which
can effectively and accurately transfer the deformation fields from low
resolution to high resolution and is used for warping the moving features at
each scale. Simulation and real brain data results show that our method
improves the accuracy of the registration and the rationality of the

We evaluate OBOE in socially complex gridworld environments and consider novel

the contrary, CNNs employ a fine-to-coarse processing, moving from local,
edge-detecting filters to more global ones extracting abstract representations
of the input. In this paper we reverse the feature extraction part of standard
bottom-up architectures and turn them upside-down: We propose top-down
networks. Our proposed coarse-to-fine pathway, by blurring higher frequency
information and restoring it only at later stages, offers a line of defence
against adversarial attacks that introduce high frequency noise. Moreover,
since we increase image resolution with depth, the high resolution of the
feature map in the final convolutional layer contributes to the explainability
of the network's decision making process. This favors object-driven decisions
over context driven ones, and thus provides better localized class activation
maps. This paper offers empirical evidence for the applicability of the
top-down resolution processing to various existing architectures on multiple

characteristic frequency, beyond which viscous liquids appear as
non-dissipative, elastic solids; as a consequence, its origin is non-local in
time. Concomitantly, the molecules experience Brownian forces that display
persistent correlations and long-lasting memory. A critical test of the
generalised Stokes-Einstein relation, mapping the friction of single molecules
to the viscoelastic response of the macroscopic sample, disproves the relation
for Newtonian fluids, but substantiates it exemplarily for water and a
moderately supercooled liquid. The employed approach is suitable to yield novel

systems has been a longstanding challenge in many-body physics. Notable among
them are quantum impurity models, which appear in various nanoelectronic and
quantum computing applications. Despite their seeming simplicity, they feature
correlated phenomena, including emergent energy scales and non-Fermi-liquid
physics, requiring renormalization group treatment. This has typically been at
odds with the description of their nonequilibrium steady-state under finite
bias, which exposes their nature as open quantum systems. We present a novel
numerically-exact method for obtaining the nonequilibrium state of a general
quantum impurity coupled to metallic leads at arbitrary voltage or temperature
bias, which we call ""RL-NESS"" (Renormalized Lindblad-driven NonEquilibrium
Steady-State). It is based on coherently coupling the impurity to discretized
leads which are treated exactly. These leads are furthermore weakly coupled to
reservoirs described by Lindblad dynamics which impose voltage or temperature
bias. Going beyond previous attempts, we exploit a hybrid discretization scheme
for the leads together with Wilson's numerical renormalization group, in order
to probe exponentially small energy scales. The steady-state is then found by
evolving a matrix-product density operator via real-time Lindblad dynamics,
employing a dissipative generalization of the time-dependent density matrix
renormalization group. In the long-time limit, this procedure converges to the
steady-state at finite bond dimension due to the introduced dissipation, which
bounds the growth of entanglement. We test the method against the exact
solution of the noninteracting resonant level model. We demonstrate its power
using an interacting two-level model, for which it correctly reproduces the
known limits, and gives the full $I$-$V$ curve between them.

  Robust Automated Driving","8 pages, preprint, accepted at IEEE ITSC 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lane detection is an essential part of the perception sub-architecture of any
automated driving (AD) or advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). When
focusing on low-cost, large scale products for automated driving, model-driven
approaches for the detection of lane markings have proven good performance.
More recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed that target the
drivable area / freespace mainly in inner-city applications. Focus of these
approaches is less on lane-based driving due to the fact that the lane concept
does not fully apply in unstructured, residential inner-city environments.
So-far the concept of drivable area is seldom used for highway and inter-urban
applications due to the specific requirements of these scenarios that require
clear lane associations of all traffic participants. We believe that
lane-based, mapless driving in inter-urban and highway scenarios is still not
fully handled with sufficient robustness and availability. Especially for
challenging weather situations such as heavy rain, fog, low-standing sun,
darkness or reflections in puddles, the mapless detection of lane markings
decreases significantly or completely fails. We see potential in applying
specifically designed data-driven freespace approaches in more lane-based
driving applications for highways and inter-urban use. Therefore, we propose to
classify specifically a drivable corridor of the ego lane on pixel level with a
deep learning approach. Our approach is kept computationally efficient with
only 0.66 million parameters allowing its application in large scale products.
Thus, we were able to easily integrate into an online AD system of a test
vehicle. We demonstrate the performance of our approach under challenging
conditions qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison to a state-of-the-art
model-driven approach.

an efficient sampling algorithm, we demonstrate how to estimate the

their households using Bayesian optimization and longitudinal case data.

paradigm: instance-level parser selection (ILPS), and present a
proof-of-concept study focused on instance-level selection in the framework of
delexicalized parser transfer. We start from an empirical observation that
different source parsers are the best choice for different Universal POS
sequences in the target language. We then propose to predict the best parser at
the instance level. To this end, we train a supervised regression model, based
on the Transformer architecture, to predict parser accuracies for individual
POS-sequences. We compare ILPS against two strong single-best parser selection
baselines (SBPS): (1) a model that compares POS n-gram distributions between
the source and target languages (KL) and (2) a model that selects the source
based on the similarity between manually created language vectors encoding
syntactic properties of languages (L2V). The results from our extensive
evaluation, coupling 42 source parsers and 20 diverse low-resource test
languages, show that ILPS outperforms KL and L2V on 13/20 and 14/20 test

""at the treebank level"" (SBPS), using the aggregation of predictions from our
instance-level model, we outperform the same baselines on 17/20 and 16/20 test

training process of the deep neural network becomes the process of modal
separation. A self-coding deep neural network is designed to identify the
structural modal parameters from the vibration data of structures. The mixture
signals, that is, the structural response data, are used as the input of the
neural network. Then we use a complex loss function to restrict the training
process of the neural network, making the output of the third layer the modal
responses we want, and the weights of the last two layers are mode shapes. The
deep neural network is essentially a nonlinear objective function optimization
problem. A novel loss function is proposed to constrain the independent feature
with consideration of uncorrelation and non-Gaussianity to restrict the
designed neural network to obtain the structural modal parameters. A numerical
example of a simple structure and an example of actual SHM data from a
cable-stayed bridge are presented to illustrate the modal parameter
identification ability of the proposed approach. The results show the
approach's good capability in blindly extracting modal information from system
responses.

it is possible to estimate masses and radii for solar-type pulsators. However,
these stars are not the only kind of stellar objects that follow these rules:
$\delta$ Scuti stars seem to be characterized with seismic indexes such as the
large separation ($\Delta\nu$). Thanks to long-duration high-cadence TESS light
curves, we analysed more than two thousand of this kind of classical pulsators.
In that way, we propose the frequency at maximum power ($\nu_{\rm max}$) as a
proper seismic index since it is directly related with the intrinsic
temperature, mass and radius of the star. This parameter seems not to be
affected by rotation, inclination, extinction or resonances, with the exception
of the evolution of the stellar parameters. Furthermore, we can constrain
rotation and inclination using the departure of temperature produced by the
gravity-darkening effect. This is especially feasible for fast rotators as most
of $\delta$ Scuti stars seem to be.

has proven to be very efficient and accurate for interpolating and

method converges, and its rapid convergence properties have remained
mysterious. In this letter we present the first study of the convergence of
eigenvector continuation. In order to perform the mathematical analysis, we
introduce a new variant of eigenvector continuation that we call vector
continuation. We first prove that eigenvector continuation and vector
continuation have identical convergence properties and then analyze the
convergence of vector continuation. Our analysis shows that, in general,
eigenvector continuation converges more rapidly than perturbation theory. The
faster convergence is achieved by eliminating a phenomenon that we call
differential folding, the interference between non-orthogonal vectors appearing
at different orders in perturbation theory. From our analysis we can predict
how eigenvector continuation converges both inside and outside the radius of
convergence of perturbation theory. While eigenvector continuation is a
non-perturbative method, we show that its rate of convergence can be deduced

response, which may lead to a severe degradation in the communication, and more
specifically in the bit error rate (BER). This is aggravated by the extensive
usage of multicarrier multiplexing, based on optical orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (O-OFDM), characterized by a high peak-to-average power
ratio. Here, we present a chaos-based coded modulation (CCM) setup specifically

imposing shearing motions onto the inner boundary. The initial magnetic
configuration consists of a triple arcade structure embedded into a bimodal
solar wind, and the sheared polarity inversion line is found in the southern
loop system. The mesh was continuously adapted through a refinement method that
applies to current carrying structures. We then compared the obtained eruptions

their total speed. Radial Poynting flux computation was employed as well to
follow the evolution of electromagnetic energy introduced into the system.

speed, we thus obtain a failed eruption, a stealth, or a CME driven by the
imposed shear, as the second ejection. The dynamics of all eruptions are
compared with the observed directions of propagation of an MCME event and a
good correlation is achieved. The Poynting flux analysis reveals the temporal
variation of the important steps of eruptions. For the first time, a stealth
CME is simulated in the aftermath of a first eruption, through changes in the
applied shearing speed.

vector perturbations. Considering perfect fluids or scalar fields, vector
perturbations evolve kinematically as $a^{-2}$, where $a$ is the scale factor.
Consequently, a definite answer concerning the bounce stability depends on an
arbitrary constant, therefore, there is no definitive answer. In this paper, we
consider a more general situation where the primeval material medium is a
non-ideal fluid, and its shear viscosity is capable of producing torque
oscillations, which can create and dynamically sustain vector perturbations
along cosmic evolution. In this framework, one can set that vector
perturbations have a quantum mechanical origin, coming from quantum vacuum
fluctuations in the far past of the bouncing model, as it is done with scalar
and tensor perturbations. Under this prescription, one can calculate their
evolution during the whole history of the bouncing model, and precisely infer
the conditions under which they remain linear before the expanding phase. It is
shown that such linearity conditions impose constraints on the free parameters
of bouncing models, which are mild, although not trivial, allowing a large
class of possibilities. Such conditions impose that vector perturbations are
also not observationally relevant in the expanding phase. The conclusion is
that bouncing models are generally stable under vector perturbations. As they
are also stable under scalar and tensor perturbations, we conclude that
bouncing models are generally stable under perturbations originated from
quantum vacuum perturbations in the far past of their contracting phase.

adversarial network to formulate anomaly scores over reconstruction loss of
input. Due to the rare occurrence of anomalies, optimizing such networks can be
a cumbersome task. Another possible approach is to use both generator and
discriminator for anomaly detection. However, attributed to the involvement of
adversarial training, this model is often unstable in a way that the
performance fluctuates drastically with each training step. In this study, we
propose a framework that effectively generates stable results across a wide
range of training steps and allows us to use both the generator and the
discriminator of an adversarial model for efficient and robust anomaly
detection. Our approach transforms the fundamental role of a discriminator from
identifying real and fake data to distinguishing between good and bad quality
reconstructions. To this end, we prepare training examples for the good quality
reconstruction by employing the current generator, whereas poor quality
examples are obtained by utilizing an old state of the same generator. This
way, the discriminator learns to detect subtle distortions that often appear in
reconstructions of the anomaly inputs. Extensive experiments performed on
Caltech-256 and MNIST image datasets for novelty detection show superior
results. Furthermore, on UCSD Ped2 video dataset for anomaly detection, our
model achieves a frame-level AUC of 98.1%, surpassing recent state-of-the-art
methods.

introducing novel exchange couplings even for an inversion symmetric setup.
Considering the example of a silicon nanowire double dot, we present the
relative strength of these anisotropic exchange interaction terms and calculate

numerous engineering applications. Thin films of liquid result in increased
heat transfer due to a reduction of conduction resistance, in addition the
pressure jump at the liquid-vapor interface also affects the rate and direction
of rate of phase change. Because of these effects the morphology of the
substrate surface is expected to affect the film shape, hence heat transfer,
especially in thin films. In this study, the influence of surface
characteristics on the rate of phase change from micron and sub-micron sized
2-D droplets-i.e. films extending to infinity-forming on a substrate are
modeled. Surface film profiles are generated on both flat and non-flat
surfaces, triangular or wavy in nature, and a kinetic model for
quasi-equilibrium phase change is applied. Due to the presence of
intermolecular forces at the contact line, which render the solution of the
augmented Young-Laplace equation stiff, an implicit scheme is employed for the
numerical integration. To verify the method, the predictions of a molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation of a nano sized droplet present on a V-grooved surface
is compared to the continuum model. The augmented Young-Laplace equation is
solved numerically along with a phase change model originating from kinetic
theory to calculate the shape of the two-phase interface forming the droplet
and study the effect of various parameters on the rate of phase change. Results
are obtained for droplets with liquid pressures higher and lower than that of
vapor, resulting in opposite contribution to phase change due to the pressure
jump at the interface. The results show that the heat transfer rate can be
substantially altered due primarily to the combined effects of surface
morphology and disjoining pressure.

energies up to $\sim$1 TeV. Its phase-averaged and phase-resolved $\gamma$-ray

properties of the Crab pulsar with 10-year \emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope
(LAT) data in the range of 60 MeV--500 GeV. With the phase-resolved spectra, we
investigate the origins and mechanisms responsible for the emissions. Methods:
The phaseograms are reconstructed for different energy bands and further
analysed using a wavelet decomposition. The phase-resolved energy spectra are
combined with the observations of ground-based instruments like MAGIC and
VERITAS to achieve a larger energy converage. We fit power-law models to the
overlapping energy spectra from 10 GeV to $\sim$1 TeV. We include in the fit a
relative cross-calibration of energy scales between air-shower based gamma-ray
telescopes with the orbital pair-production telescope of the Fermi mission.
Results: We confirm the energy-dependence of the $\gamma$-ray pulse shape, and
equivalently, the phase-dependence of the spectral shape for the Crab pulsar. A
relatively sharp cutoff at a relatively high energy of $\sim$8 GeV is observed
for the bridge-phase emission. The $E>$10 GeV spectrum observed for the second
pulse peak is harder than those for other phases. Conclusions: In view of the
diversity of phase-resolved spectral shapes of the Crab pulsar, we tentatively
propose a multi-origin scenario where the polar-cap, outer-gap and
relativistic-wind regions are involved.

find that DDE can affect the clustering of matter and haloes at the ~10% level
(suppressing it for so-called `freezing' models, while enhancing it for
`thawing' models), which should be distinguishable with upcoming large-scale
structure surveys. DDE cosmologies can also enhance or suppress the halo mass
function (with respect to LCDM) over a wide range of halo masses. The internal
properties of haloes are minimally affected by changes in DDE, however.

fundamental importance in quantum information. The question whether every
proper (tight) Bell inequality is violated in Quantum theory is an intriguing
one in this regard. Here, we make significant progress in answering this
question, by showing that every tight Bell inequality is violated by 'Almost
Quantum' correlations, a semi-definite programming relaxation of the set of
quantum correlations. As a consequence, we show that many (classes of) Bell
inequalities including two-party correlation Bell inequalities and
multi-outcome non-local computation games, that do not admit quantum
violations, are not facets of the classical Bell polytope. To do this, we make
use of the intriguing connections between Bell correlations and the
graph-theoretic Lov\'{a}sz-theta set, discovered by Cabello-Severini-Winter
(CSW). We also exploit connections between the cut polytope of graph theory and
the classical correlation Bell polytope, to show that correlation Bell
inequalities that define facets of the lower dimensional correlation polytope
are violated in quantum theory. The methods also enable us to derive novel
(almost) quantum Bell inequalities, which may be of independent interest for
self-testing applications.

have been successfully developed and made available to the masses (i.e.,
FaceSwap, deepfake, etc.). These methods enable anyone to easily edit faces in
video sequences with incredibly realistic results and a very little effort.
Despite the usefulness of these tools in many fields, if used maliciously, they
can have a significantly bad impact on society (e.g., fake news spreading,
cyber bullying through fake revenge porn). The ability of objectively detecting
whether a face has been manipulated in a video sequence is then a task of
utmost importance. In this paper, we tackle the problem of face manipulation
detection in video sequences targeting modern facial manipulation techniques.
In particular, we study the ensembling of different trained Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) models. In the proposed solution, different models are
obtained starting from a base network (i.e., EfficientNetB4) making use of two
different concepts: (i) attention layers; (ii) siamese training. We show that
combining these networks leads to promising face manipulation detection results

inserting edges between the edges of an underlying tree. Orchard networks are a
recently introduced generalization of the class of tree-child networks.
Structural characterizations have already been discovered for tree-based
networks; this is not the case for orchard networks. In this paper, we
introduce cherry covers---a unifying characterization of both network
classes---in which we decompose the edges of the networks into so-called cherry
shapes and reticulated cherry shapes. We show that cherry covers can be used to
characterize the class of tree-based networks as well as the class of orchard

top of previous results on multipartite entanglement verification where the
security was studied in the usual game-based model. Here, we improve the

study its security in the Abstract Cryptography framework to highlight
composability issues and avoid hidden assumptions. This framework is a
top-to-bottom theory that makes explicit any piece of information that each

any security proof, which amounts to showing indistinguishability between an
ideal resource having the desired security properties (up to local simulation)

this setting. This allows us to readily compose our basic protocol in order to
create a composably secure multi-round protocol enabling honest parties to
obtain a state close to a GHZ state or an abort signal, even in the presence of
a noisy or malicious source. Our protocol can typically be used as a subroutine

However, these models are usually trained without explicit conditioning labels

most from the latent information by decomposing the reconstruction loss per

memorizing the first words and the sentence length, producing local features of
limited usefulness. To alleviate this, we investigate alternative architectures
based on bag-of-words assumptions and language model pretraining. These
variants learn latent variables that are more global, i.e., more predictive of

they decrease memorization: the first word and the sentence length are not

the helicity parameter linked to the polarization of the excitation light. For
excitation via a single Gaussian beam or two counterpropagating beams in a hot
vapor cell, the transition rate scales as the squared degree of linear
polarization. The rate reaches zero when the light is circularly polarized. In
contrast, when the excitation is realized via an evanescent field near an
optical nanofiber, the two-photon transition cannot be completely extinguished
(theoretically, not lower than 13\% of the maximum rate, under our experimental
conditions) by only varying the polarization of the fiber-guided light. Our
findings lead to a deeper understanding of the physics of multiphoton processes

neural network architecture that given sequential data predicts the parameters
of the underlying data's dynamics. This network is trained with two objective
functions. The first one constitutes a more naive approach that assumes that
the true parameters are known. The second objective incorporates the knowledge
of the underlying dynamics and is therefore considered as hybrid approach. We
show that in terms of robustness, the latter outperforms the first objective on
noisy input data.

detecting a keV-sterile neutrino signature by measuring the entire tritium
beta-decay spectrum with an upgraded KATRIN system. One of the greatest
challenges is to handle the high signal rates generated by the strong activity
of the KATRIN tritium source while maintaining a good energy resolution.
Therefore, a novel multi-pixel silicon drift detector and read-out system are
being designed to handle rates of about 100 Mcps with an energy resolution
better than 300 eV (FWHM). This report presents succinctly the KATRIN

  orthogonality and passiveness","31 pages, 15 figures, submitted to Ocean Sciences Discussions",,"10.5194/os-17-203-2021",,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper clarifies the theoretical basis for constructing spiciness
variables optimal for characterising ocean water masses. Three essential
ingredients are identified: 1) a material density variable $\gamma$ that is as
neutral as feasible; 2) a material state function $\xi$ independent of
$\gamma$, but otherwise arbitrary; 3) an empirically determined reference
function $\xi_r(\gamma)$ of $\gamma$ representing the imagined behaviour of
$\xi$ in a notional spiceless ocean. Ingredient 1) is required because contrary
to what is often assumed, it is not the properties imposed on $\xi$ (such as
orthogonality) that determine its dynamical inertness but the degree of
neutrality of $\gamma$. The first key result is that it is the anomaly $\xi' =
\xi - \xi_r(\gamma)$, rather than $\xi$, that is the variable the most suited
for characterising ocean water masses, as originally proposed by McDougall and
Giles (1987). The second key result is that oceanic sections of normalised
$\xi'$ appear to be relatively insensitive to the choice of $\xi$, as first
suggested by Jackett and McDougall (1985). It is also argued that orthogonality
of $\nabla \xi'$ to $\nabla \gamma$ in physical space is more germane to
spiciness theory than orthogonality in thermohaline space, although how to use
it to constrain the choices of $\xi$ and $\xi_r(\gamma)$ remains to be fully
elucidated. The results are important for they unify the various ways in which
spiciness has been defined and used in the literature. They also provide a
rigorous theoretical basis justifying the pursuit of a globally defined
material density variable maximising neutrality. To illustrate the latter
point, this paper proposes a new implementation of the author's recently
developed thermodynamic neutral density and explains how to adapt existing
definitions of spiciness/spicity to work with it.

  cycles behind new daily COVID-19 cases and what happens after lockdown",,,,,"q-bio.PE stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral analysis characterises oscillatory time series behaviours such as
cycles, but accurate estimation requires reasonable numbers of observations.
Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and
post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially
interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem
of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian
spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases
for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of
around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are
suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that
the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the
two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases
grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in
cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or
more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series
contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate
interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general
technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates,
which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.

decades of research into the subject, it is still challenging to tackle the
robot locomotion problem from an algorithmic point of view. For example, these
machines cannot achieve a constant forward body movement without exploiting
contacts with the environment. The reactive forces resulting from the contacts
are subject to strong limitations, complicating the design of control laws. As
a consequence, the generation of humanoid motions requires to exploit fully the
mathematical model of the robot in contact with the environment or to resort to
approximations of it.
  This thesis investigates predictive and optimal control techniques for
tackling humanoid robot motion tasks. They generate control input values from
the system model and objectives, often transposed as cost function to minimize.
In particular, this thesis tackles several aspects of the humanoid robot
locomotion problem in a crescendo of complexity. First, we consider the single
step push recovery problem. Namely, we aim at maintaining the upright posture
with a single step after a strong external disturbance. Second, we generate and
stabilize walking motions. In addition, we adopt predictive techniques to
perform more dynamic motions, like large step-ups.
  The above-mentioned applications make use of different simplifications or
assumptions to facilitate the tractability of the corresponding motion tasks.
Moreover, they consider first the foot placements and only afterward how to
maintain balance. We attempt to remove all these simplifications. [continued]

trained on one dataset to other datasets. Training a universal model that works
anywhere, anytime, for anybody is unrealistic. In this work, we demonstrate the
generalizability problem, then explore potential solutions based on transfer
learning (TL) by using the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to computed
tomography (CT) image conversion task as the testbed. Previous works have
converted CBCT to CT-like images. However, all of those works studied only one
or two anatomical sites and used images from the same vendor's scanners. Here,
we investigated how a model trained for one machine and one anatomical site
works on other machines and other sites. We trained a model on CBCT images
acquired from one vendor's scanners for head and neck cancer patients and
applied it to images from another vendor's scanners and for other disease
sites. We found that generalizability could be a significant problem for this
particular application when applying a trained DL model to datasets from
another vendor's scanners. We then explored three practical solutions based on
TL to solve this generalization problem: the target model, which is trained on
a target domain from scratch; the combined model, which is trained on both
source and target domain datasets from scratch; and the adapted model, which
fine-tunes the trained source model to a target domain. We found that when
there are sufficient data in the target domain, all three models can achieve
good performance. When the target dataset is limited, the adapted model works
the best, which indicates that using the fine-tuning strategy to adapt the
trained model to an unseen target domain dataset is a viable and easy way to
implement DL models in the clinic.

empirical force fields, combining dispersion interactions - described by a
truncated Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential - and electrostatic interactions -
described by a Coulomb potential computed with a long-range solver. Recently,
force fields using rescaled ionic charges (electronic continuum correction,
ECC), possibly complemented with rescaling of LJ parameters (electronic
continuum correction rescaled, ECCR), have shown promising results in bulk, but
their performance at interfaces has been less explored. Here we started by
exploring the impact of the LJ potential truncation on the surface tension of a
sodium chloride aqueous solution. We show a discrepancy between the numerical
predictions for truncated LJ interactions with a large cutoff and for
untruncated LJ interactions computed with a long-range solver, which can bias
comparison of force field predictions with experiments. Using a long-range
solver for LJ interactions, we then show that an ionic charge rescaling factor
chosen to correct long-range electrostatic interactions in bulk also describes
accurately image charge repulsion at the liquid-vapor interface, and that the
rescaling of LJ parameters in ECCR models - aimed at capturing local ion-ion

progress in semantic segmentation. However, these approaches heavily rely on
annotated data which are labor intensive. To cope with this limitation,
automatically annotated data generated from graphic engines are used to train
segmentation models. However, the models trained from synthetic data are
difficult to transfer to real images. To tackle this issue, previous works have
considered directly adapting models from the source data to the unlabeled
target data (to reduce the inter-domain gap). Nonetheless, these techniques do
not consider the large distribution gap among the target data itself
(intra-domain gap). In this work, we propose a two-step self-supervised domain
adaptation approach to minimize the inter-domain and intra-domain gap together.
First, we conduct the inter-domain adaptation of the model; from this
adaptation, we separate the target domain into an easy and hard split using an
entropy-based ranking function. Finally, to decrease the intra-domain gap, we
propose to employ a self-supervised adaptation technique from the easy to the
hard split. Experimental results on numerous benchmark datasets highlight the
effectiveness of our method against existing state-of-the-art approaches. The

matter (DM) particles annihilate to an anti-DM, and an unstable state that can
mix with or decay to standard model states, can lead to particle anti-particle
asymmetry in the DM sector. The present DM abundance, including the
CP-violation in the DM sector and the resulting present asymmetry are
determined entirely by a single semi-annihilation process at next-to-leading
order. For large CP-violation in this process, we find that a nearly complete
asymmetry can be obtained in the DM sector, with the observed DM density being
dominated by the (anti-)DM particle. The presence of additional
pair-annihilation processes can modify the ratio of DM and anti-DM number
densities further, if the pair-annihilation is active subsequent to the
decoupling of the semi-annihilation. For such a scenario, the required
CP-violation for generating the same present asymmetry is generically much
smaller, as compared to the scenario with only semi-annihilation present. We
show that a minimal model with a complex scalar DM with cubic self-interactions
can give rise to both semi- and pair-annihilations, with the required
CP-violation generated at one-loop level. We also find that the upper bound on
the DM mass from S-matrix unitarity in the purely asymmetric semi-annihilation
scenario, with maximal CP-violation, is around 15 GeV, which is much stronger
than in the WIMP and previously considered asymmetric DM cases, due to the
required large non-zero chemical potential for such asymmetric DM.

back-propagation) of the object wave from the hologram recording plane to the

information from a 3D volume to a 2D detector plane, the replay of the hologram
involves creating information in a set of 3D voxels from a much smaller number
of 2D detector pixels, which at first look appears to be surprising. We point
out that the hologram replay process is a Hermitian transpose (and not inverse)
of the hologram formation process and therefore only provides an approximation
to the original 3D object function. With the knowledge of this Hermitian
transpose property, we show how one may realize true 3D image reconstruction
via a regularized optimization algorithm. The numerical illustrations of this
optimization approach as presented here show excellent slice-by-slice
tomographic 3D reconstruction of the original object under the weak scattering
approximation. In particular, the reconstructed 3D image field has near-zero
numerical values at voxels where the original object did not exist. We note
that 3D image reconstruction of this kind cannot be achieved by the traditional
physical replay process. In this sense the proposed methodology for digital
holographic image reconstruction goes beyond numerically mimicking the
traditional film based holographic replay. The reconstruction approach may find
potential applications in a number of digital holographic imaging systems.

analysis to improve efficiency in terms of running time, space and

small coreset for k-Median in (the shortest-path metric of) an excluded-minor
graph. Specifically, we give the first coreset of size that depends only on
$k$, $\epsilon$ and the excluded-minor size, and our running time is
quasi-linear (in the size of the input graph).
  The main innovation in our new algorithm is that is iterative; it first
reduces the $n$ input points to roughly $O(\log n)$ reweighted points, then to
$O(\log\log n)$, and so forth until the size is independent of $n$. Each step
in this iterative size reduction is based on the importance sampling framework
of Feldman and Langberg (STOC 2011), with a crucial adaptation that reduces the
number of \emph{distinct points}, by employing a terminal embedding (where low
distortion is guaranteed only for the distance from every terminal to all other
points). Our terminal embedding is technically involved and relies on
shortest-path separators, a standard tool in planar and excluded-minor graphs.
  Furthermore, our new algorithm is applicable also in Euclidean metrics, by
simply using a recent terminal embedding result of Narayanan and Nelson, (STOC
2019), which extends the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. We thus obtain an
efficient coreset construction in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, thereby
matching and simplifying state-of-the-art results (Sohler and Woodruff, FOCS

  In addition, we also employ terminal embedding with additive distortion to
obtain small coresets in graphs with bounded highway dimension, and use
applications of our coresets to obtain improved approximation schemes, e.g., an
improved PTAS for planar k-Median via a new centroid set.

of molecules on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices require careful
consideration of resources describing the complex electron correlation effects.
In modeling second-quantized problems, the biggest challenge confronted is that
the number of qubits scales linearly with the size of molecular basis. This
poses a significant limitation on the size of the basis sets and the number of
correlated electrons included in quantum simulations of chemical processes. To
address this issue and to enable more realistic simulations on NISQ computers,
we employ the double unitary coupled-cluster (DUCC) method to effectively
downfold correlation effects into the reduced-size orbital space, commonly
referred to as the active space. Using downfolding techniques, we demonstrate
that properly constructed effective Hamiltonians can capture the effect of the
whole orbital space in small-size active spaces. Combining the downfolding
pre-processing technique with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, we solve for
the ground-state energy of $\text{H}_2$ and $\text{Li}_2$ in the cc-pVTZ basis
using the DUCC-reduced active spaces. We compare these results to full
configuration-interaction and high-level coupled-cluster reference
calculations.

RPL security mechanisms under common routing attacks. First, a comparison of
RPL performance, with and without its security mechanisms, under four routing
attacks (Blackhole, Selective-Forward, Neighbor, and Wormhole attacks) is
conducted using several metrics (e.g., average data packet delivery rate,
average data packet delay, average power consumption, etc.). This comparison is
performed using two commonly used Radio Duty-Cycle protocols. Secondly, and
based on the observations from this comparison, we propose two techniques that
could reduce the effects of such attacks, without having added security
mechanisms for RPL. An evaluation of these techniques shows improved
performance of RPL under the investigated attacks, except for the Wormhole
attack.

quantum particles really are. According to the specialized literature, it is
not even clear if each of these microscopic entities possess their own

terms of a dilemma which forces a choice between their characterization either
as individuals or as non-individuals. In this work we attempt to address the
(metaphysical) presuppositions involved within Arenhart's dilemma which ground
the question of individuality in QM on a strong presupposition regarding the
existence of quantum objects. After providing a reconsideration of the role
played by metaphysics within physics we attempt to propose, not only a complete
redefinition of the dilemma beyond particle metaphysics, but also a possible
realist solution grounded on the provision of a new (non-classical) conceptual
framework which seeks to develop an invariant-objective representation of the

focusing is important to revealing the mechanism underlying the most singular
micro-jetting produced from drop-impact craters. Herein we study dimple
dynamics from the collapse of these craters when the drop is of a different
immiscible liquid than the pool. The parameter space is considerably more
complex than for identical liquids, revealing intricate compound-dimple shapes.
In contrast to the universal capillary-inertial drop pinch-off regime, where
the neck radius scales as $R\sim t^{2/3}$, a purely inertial collapse of the
air-dimple portrays $R \sim t^{1/2}$ and is sensitive to initial and boundary
conditions. Capillary waves can therefore mold the dimple into different
collapse shapes. We observe a clear cross-over in the nature of the dynamics
from capillary-inertial to purely inertial immediately before the pinch-off.
Notably, for singular jetting the cross-over time occurs much earlier,
irrespective of the Weber number.

context has focused on providing the rationale behind an AI agent's decision
making. While these methods provide the right explanations from the explainer's
perspective, they fail to heed the cognitive requirement of understanding an
explanation from the explainee's (the human's) perspective. In this work, we
set out to address this issue by first considering the influence of information
order in an explanation, or the progressiveness of explanations. Intuitively,
progression builds later concepts on previous ones and is known to contribute
to better learning. In this work, we aim to investigate similar effects during
explanation generation when an explanation is broken into multiple parts that
are communicated sequentially. The challenge here lies in modeling the humans'
preferences for information order in receiving such explanations to assist
understanding. Given this sequential process, a formulation based on goal-based
MDP for generating progressive explanations is presented. The reward function
of this MDP is learned via inverse reinforcement learning based on explanations
that are retrieved via human subject studies. We first evaluated our approach
on a scavenger-hunt domain to demonstrate its effectively in capturing the
humans' preferences. Upon analyzing the results, it revealed something more
fundamental: the preferences arise strongly from both domain dependent and
independence features. The correlation with domain independent features pushed
us to verify this result further in an escape room domain. Results confirmed
our hypothesis that the process of understanding an explanation was a dynamic
process. The human preference that reflected this aspect corresponded exactly
to the progression for knowledge assimilation hidden deeper in our cognitive
process.

with emphasis on tau flavour. As described in our previous paper
[arXiv:1903.06564v1], the detector can be installed in the decommissioned TI18
tunnel, about 480 m downstream the ATLAS cavern, after the first bending
dipoles of the LHC arc. In that location, the prolongation of the beam
Line-of-Sight from Interaction Point IP1 to TI18 traverses about 100 m of rock.
The detector intercepts the intense neutrino flux, generated by the LHC beams
colliding in IP1, at large pseudorapidity eta, where neutrino energies can
exceed a TeV. This paper focuses on optimizing global features of the
experiment, like detector mass and acceptance. Since the neutrino-nucleon
interaction cross section grows almost linearly with energy, the detector can
be light and still collect a considerable sample of neutrino events; in the
present study it weighs less than 3 tons. The detector is positioned off the
beam axis, slightly above the ideal prolongation of the LHC beam from the
straight section, covering 7.4 < eta < 9.2. In this configuration, the flux at
high energies (0.5-1.5 TeV and beyond) is found to be dominated by neutrinos
originating directly from IP1, mostly from charm decays, of which about 50% are
electron neutrinos and about 5% are tau neutrinos. The contribution of pion and
kaon decays to the muon neutrino flux is studied by means of simulations that
embed the LHC optics and found small at high energies. The above studies
indicate that with 150 /fb of delivered LHC luminosity in Run 3 the experiment
can record a few thousand very high energy neutrino charged current

Revision of introduction and examples. New references added",,,,"math.AP math.DS math.PR physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a new framework for parametrization schemes (PS)
in GFD. Using the theory of controlled rough paths, we derive a class of rough
geophysical fluid dynamics (RGFD) models as critical points of rough action
functionals. These RGFD models characterize Lagrangian trajectories in fluid
dynamics as geometric rough paths (GRP) on the manifold of diffeomorphic maps.
Three constrained variational approaches are formulated for the derivation of
these models. The first is the Clebsch formulation, in which the constraints
are imposed as rough advection laws. The second is the Hamilton-Pontryagin
formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as right-invariant rough
vector fields. The third is the Euler--Poincar\'e formulation in which the
variations are constrained. These variational principles lead directly to the
Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of fluid dynamics on geometric rough
paths. The GRP framework preserves the geometric structure of fluid dynamics
obtained by using Lie group reduction to pass from Lagrangian to Eulerian
variational principles, thereby yielding a rough formulation of the Kelvin
circulation theorem. The rough-path variational approach includes non-Markovian
perturbations of the Lagrangian fluid trajectories. In particular, memory
effects can be introduced through this formulation through a judicious choice
of the rough path (e.g. a realization of a fractional Brownian motion). In the
special case when the rough path is a realization of a semimartingale, we
recover the SGFD models in Holm (2015). However, by eliminating the need for
stochastic variational tools, we retain a pathwise interpretation of the
Lagrangian trajectories. In contrast, the Lagrangian trajectories in the
stochastic framework are described by stochastic integrals which do not have a
pathwise interpretation. Thus, the rough path formulation restores this
property.

suitable conditions on the hyperedge weights we prove the existence of matrix
eigenvalues of computable values and multiplicities, where the matrices
considered are Laplacian, adjacency and transition matrices. By considering
separately the case of generic hypergraphs and uniform hypergraphs, we prove
that two kinds of vertex set reductions on hypergraphs with $(m,k)$-hyperstar

some useful eigenvectors properties are derived up to a product with a suitable

predictor (ASP) predicts log amplitude spectra (LAS) from input acoustic
features. This paper proposes a novel knowledge-and-data-driven ASP (KDD-ASP)
to improve the conventional one. First, acoustic features (i.e., F0 and
mel-cepstra) pass through a knowledge-driven LAS recovery module to obtain
approximate LAS (ALAS). This module is designed based on the combination of
STFT and source-filter theory, in which the source part and the filter part are
designed based on input F0 and mel-cepstra, respectively. Then, the recovered
ALAS are processed by a data-driven LAS refinement module which consists of
multiple trainable convolutional layers to get the final LAS. Experimental
results show that the HiNet vocoder using KDD-ASP can achieve higher quality of
synthetic speech than that using conventional ASP and the WaveRNN vocoder on a

undetected toward the proto-Sun IRAS16293-2422 B (upper limit to its abundance

response of matter to intense laser fields and has, as the basis for coherent
XUV sources a variety of applications. Recently, HHG from atoms in a phase and
polarization structured laser was demonstrated and interpreted based on the
transverse electric field component of the driving pulse. Here we point out
that as dictated by Maxwell equations, such fields have a longitudinal
component which in general has a fundamental influence on the charge dynamics.
For instance, its interplay with the transversal field component enables
endowing the emitted radiation locally with circular polarization and a defined
polarity. It is shown that the time-dependent Stokes parameters defining the
polarization state of HHG can be tuned by varying the waist of the driving
field which in turn, changes the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse
electric-field components of the driving laser. In addition, employing a
multipole expansion of the produced harmonics exposes the specific multipolar
character and the relation to the spatial structure of the driving field
polarization states. The scheme proposed here allows a full polarization
control of the emitted harmonics by only one driving laser. A tighter focusing
of the driving pulse renders possible the emission of harmonics with both even
and odd spatial symmetry. The underlying mechanism is due to the fundamental
interplay between the transverse and longitudinal components of the laser's
electromagnetic vector potential. The ratio between those components is
controllable by just focusing the laser spot, pointing to an accessible tool
for polarization and polarity control of the high harmonics.

working or failed) components (arcs and/or nodes) are called binary-state
networks. The binary-state network is the fundamental type of network; thus,
there is always a need for a more efficient algorithm to calculate the network
reliability. Thus, a novel binary-addition tree (BAT) algorithm that employs
binary addition for finding all the possible state vectors and the path-based
layered-search algorithm for filtering out all the connected vectors is
proposed for calculating the binary-state network reliability. According to the
time complexity and numerical examples, the efficiency of the proposed BAT is
higher than those of traditional algorithms for solving the binary-state
network reliability problem.

ptychographic reconstruction is achieved by means of solving a complex inverse
problem that imposes constraints both on the acquisition and on the analysis of
the data, which typically precludes real-time imaging due to computational cost
involved in solving this inverse problem. In this work we propose PtychoNN, a
novel approach to solve the ptychography reconstruction problem based on deep
convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be
used to predict real-space structure and phase at each scan point solely from
the corresponding far-field diffraction data. The presented results demonstrate
how PtychoNN can effectively be used on experimental data, being able to
generate high quality reconstructions of a sample up to hundreds of times
faster than state-of-the-art ptychography reconstruction solutions once
trained. By surpassing the typical constraints of iterative model-based
methods, we can significantly relax the data acquisition sampling conditions
and produce equally satisfactory reconstructions. Besides drastically
accelerating acquisition and analysis, this capability can enable new imaging
scenarios that were not possible before, in cases of dose sensitive, dynamic

Next, the emotional content from the 5 recitations were standardized with the

as well as the speech were analyzed with the help of a latest non linear
technique called Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) that gives a scaling
exponent {\alpha}, which is essentially the measure of long range correlations
present in the signal. Similar pieces (the parts which have the exact lyrical

scaling exponent for all parts of recitation were much higher in general as
compared to their counterparts in speech. We have also established a critical
value from our analysis, above which a mere speech may become a recitation. The
case may be similar to the conventional phase transition, wherein the
measurement of external condition at which the transformation occurs (generally

potential of increasing the spectral efficiency, relative to those with
half-duplex. However, the residual self-interference (SI) from FD and high
pathloss inherent to mmWave signals may degrade the system performance.
Meanwhile, hybrid beamforming (HBF) is an efficient technology to enhance the
channel gain and mitigate interference with reasonable complexity. However,
conventional HBF approaches for FD mmWave systems are based on optimization
processes, which are either too complex or strongly rely on the quality of
channel state information (CSI). We propose two learning schemes to design HBF
for FD mmWave systems, i.e., extreme learning machine based HBF (ELM-HBF) and
convolutional neural networks based HBF (CNN-HBF). Specifically, we first
propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm
to achieve SI cancellation beamforming, and then use a
majorization-minimization (MM) based algorithm for joint transmitting and
receiving HBF optimization. To train the learning networks, we simulate noisy
channels as input, and select the hybrid beamformers calculated by proposed
algorithms as targets. Results show that both learning based schemes can
provide more robust HBF performance and achieve at least 22.1% higher spectral
efficiency compared to orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithms. Besides,
the online prediction time of proposed learning based schemes is almost 20
times faster than the OMP scheme. Furthermore, the training time of ELM-HBF is
about 600 times faster than that of CNN-HBF with 64 transmitting and receiving

situations of a social nature. For this, the case of the use of kinetic impact
projectiles and the actual data provided by official sources is considered.
This information is used in an object motion model describing the kinematic
characteristics of a spherical projectile (a rubber bullet). For these
purposes, a number Reynolds Re >> 1 was used, which allows applying a nonlinear
motion equation to find the velocity and impact energy per unit area of
projectile. Results and analysis of this model can generate an interesting
discussion in the classroom about the need to build protocols for the use of
kinetic impact projectiles, and the importance of using scientific knowledge in
social conflicts.

reduce the cost for the distributed training of deep neural networks (DNNs).
Recently, several methods have been proposed to find efficient parallelization
strategies but they all optimize a single objective (e.g., execution time,
memory consumption) and produce only one strategy. We propose FT, an efficient
algorithm that searches for an optimal set of parallelization strategies to
allow the trade-off among different objectives. FT can adapt to different
scenarios by minimizing the memory consumption when the number of devices is
limited and fully utilize additional resources to reduce the execution time.
For popular DNN models (e.g., vision, language), an in-depth analysis is
conducted to understand the trade-offs among different objectives and their
influence on the parallelization strategies. We also develop a user-friendly
system, called TensorOpt, which allows users to run their distributed DNN
training jobs without caring the details of parallelization strategies.
Experimental results show that FT runs efficiently and provides accurate
estimation of runtime costs, and TensorOpt is more flexible in adapting to

particular, a multi-response Gaussian process (MRGP) meta-modeling approach is
formulated that can accurately construct the error response surface, i.e., the
discrepancies between the frequency response predictions and actual
measurement. In order to reduce the computational cost of repeated finite
element simulations, an adaptive sampling strategy is established, where the
search of unknown parameters is guided by the response surface features.
Meanwhile, the information of previously sampled model parameters and the
corresponding errors is utilized as additional training data to refine the MRGP
meta-model. Two stochastic optimization techniques, i.e., particle swarm and
simulated annealing, are employed to train the MRGP meta-model for comparison.
Systematic case studies are conducted to examine the accuracy and robustness of

decade. We argue that to make the most of this exciting field we should resist
the temptation of assuming that forecasting can be reduced to brute-force data
analytics. This owes to the fact that modelling, as we illustrate below,
requires mastering the art of selecting relevant variables. More specifically,
we investigate the subtle relation between ""data and models"" by focussing on
the role played by algorithmic complexity, which contributed to making
mathematically rigorous the long-standing idea that to understand empirical
phenomena is to describe the rules which generate the data in terms which are
""simpler"" than the data itself.
  A key issue for the appraisal of the relation between algorithmic complexity
and algorithmic learning is to do with a much needed clarification on the
related but distinct concepts of compressibility, determinism and
predictability. To this end we will illustrate that the evolution law of a
chaotic system is compressibile, but a generic initial condition for it is not,
making the time series generated by chaotic systems incompressible in general.
Hence knowledge of the rules which govern an empirical phenomenon are not
sufficient for predicting its outcomes. In turn this implies that there is more
to understanding phenomena than learning -- even from data alone -- such rules.
This can be achieved only in those cases when we are capable of ""good
modelling"".
  Clearly, the very idea of algorithmic complexity rests on Turing's seminal
analysis of computation. This motivates our remarks on this extremely telling
example of analogy-based abstract modelling which is nonetheless heavily
informed by empirical facts.
