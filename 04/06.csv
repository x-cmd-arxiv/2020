The radiation shield is made of asteroid rock, augmented by a water layer with
2 % of the mass for neutron moderation, and a thin boron-10 layer for capturing
the thermalized neutrons. We analyze the propulsion options for moving the
material from asteroids to L5. The FFC Cambridge process can be used to extract
oxygen from asteroid regolith. The oxygen is then used as Electric Propulsion
propellant. One can also find a water-bearing asteroid and use water for the
same purpose. If one wants to avoid propellant extraction, one can use a fleet
of electric sails. The settlers fund their project by producing and selling new
settlements by zero-delay teleoperation in the nearby robotic factory which
they own. The economic case looks promising if LEO launch costs drop below

$\Delta_\Theta$ on a Riemannian manifold and a corresponding perturbed local
index density for the de~Rham complex. Invariance theory is used to show that
this local index density in fact does not depend on $\Theta$; it vanishes if
the dimension $m$ is odd, and it is the Euler form if $m$ is even. (The first
author, Kordyukov, and Leichtnam (2020) established this result previously
using other methods). The higher order heat trace asymptotics of the twisted
de~Rham complex are shown to exhibit non-trivial dependence on $\Theta$ so this
rigidity result is specific to the local index density. This result is extended
to the case of manifolds with boundary where suitable boundary conditions are
imposed. An equivariant version giving a Lefschetz trace formula for
$d_{\Theta}$ is also established; in neither instance does the twisting 1-form
$\Theta$ enter. Let $\Phi$ be a $\bar\partial$ closed $1$-form of type $(0,1)$

Dolbeault complex. By contrast with the de~Rham setting, the local index

to convert the problem into a sparsity constrained optimization. The function

the resonant conditions within the laser field the intermediate virtual
electron transforms into the real particle. As a result, the accomplished
analysis defines that the polar emission angle characterizes the frequency of a
spontaneous photon. The study derives the expressions for the resonant
differential cross-sections of the represented processes that realize
simultaneous registration of the frequency and radiation angle in correlation
to the momentum of the initial electron (for the channel A) and of the final
electron (for the channel B) of the spontaneous photon with absorption of $r$

the distribution of the resonant differential cross-section as a function of
the angle of the spontaneous photon emission for the higher numbers of
resonance ($r = 2, 3,... $) delineates a dependency with a sharp peak maximum
that coordinates to the particle radiation at the most probable frequency. To
summarize, the accomplished work represents that the resonant differential
cross-section acquires considerable magnitude. Thus, for the first resonance of
the channel A the resonant differential cross-section attains the $\sim
10^{12}$ order of a magnitude, and for the third resonance of the channel B
$\sim 10^5$ order of a magnitude (in the units of $\alpha Z^2 r_e^2$). Finally,
numerous scientific facilities with specialization in pulsed laser radiation

been a paradigm shift in medical technology, thanks to its capability of
imaging different structures within the heart without ionizing radiation.
However, it is very challenging to conduct pre-operative planning of minimally
invasive cardiac procedures without accurate segmentation and identification of
the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) blood-pool, and LV-myocardium.
Manual segmentation of those structures, nevertheless, is time-consuming and
often prone to error and biased outcomes. Hence, automatic and computationally
efficient segmentation techniques are paramount. In this work, we propose a
novel memory-efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture as a
modification of both CondenseNet, as well as DenseNet for ventricular
blood-pool segmentation by introducing a bottleneck block and an upsampling
path. Our experiments show that the proposed architecture runs on the Automated
Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset using half (50%) the memory
requirement of DenseNet and one-twelfth (~ 8%) of the memory requirements of
U-Net, while still maintaining excellent accuracy of cardiac segmentation. We
validated the framework on the ACDC dataset featuring one healthy and four
pathology groups whose heart images were acquired throughout the cardiac cycle
and achieved the mean dice scores of 96.78% (LV blood-pool), 93.46% (RV
blood-pool) and 90.1% (LV-Myocardium). These results are promising and promote
the proposed methods as a competitive tool for cardiac image segmentation and
clinical parameter estimation that has the potential to provide fast and

highly influenced by network properties such as latency, bandwidth, packet
loss, and jitter. For instance, an engineer might need to answer questions such
as: What is the impact of an increase in network latency in application
response time? How does moving a cluster between geographical regions affect
application throughput? How network dynamics affects application stability?
Answering these questions in a systematic and reproducible way is very hard,
given the variability and lack of control over the underlying network.
Unfortunately, state-of-the-art network emulation or testbeds scale poorly
(i.e., MiniNet), focus exclusively on the control-plane (i.e., CrystalNet) or
ignore network dynamics (i.e., EmuLab). Kollaps is a fully distributed network
emulator that address these limitations. Kollaps hinges on two key
observations. First, from an application's perspective, what matters are the
emergent end-to-end properties (e.g., latency, bandwidth, packet loss, and
jitter) rather than the internal state of the routers and switches leading to
those properties. This premise allows us to build a simpler, dynamically
adaptable, emulation model that circumvent maintaining the full network state.
Second, this simplified model is maintainable in a fully decentralized way,
allowing the emulation to scale with the number of machines for the
application. Kollaps is fully decentralized, agnostic of the application
language and transport protocol, scales to thousands of processes and is
accurate when compared against a bare-metal deployment or state-of-the-art
approaches that emulate the full state of the network. We showcase how Kollaps
can accurately reproduce results from the literature and predict the behaviour
of a complex unmodified distributed key-value store (i.e., Cassandra) under
different deployments.

back useful material from the vast fields of raw material. With large amount of
potentially useful information in hand, an Information Extraction (IE) system
can then transform the raw material by refining and reducing it to a germ of
original text. A Document Retrieval system collects the relevant documents
carrying the required information, from the repository of texts. An IE system
then transforms them into information that is more readily digested and
analyzed. It isolates relevant text fragments, extracts relevant information
from the fragments, and then arranges together the targeted information in a
coherent framework. The thesis presents a new approach for Word Sense
Disambiguation using thesaurus. The illustrative examples supports the
effectiveness of this approach for speedy and effective disambiguation. A
Document Retrieval method, based on Fuzzy Logic has been described and its
application is illustrated. A question-answering system describes the operation
of information extraction from the retrieved text documents. The process of
information extraction for answering a query is considerably simplified by
using a Structured Description Language (SDL) which is based on cardinals of
queries in the form of who, what, when, where and why. The thesis concludes
with the presentation of a novel strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory of
evidential reasoning, for document retrieval and information extraction. This
strategy permits relaxation of many limitations, which are inherent in Bayesian

exists a packet-dropout feature in transmitting the data as another
contribution of the paper. Formulations and numerical simulations prove the
effectiveness of the newly proposed attack detection procedure by having a
quick response to occurred attacks. Although, in previous approaches, the
trade-off between attack detection delay or LQG performance was significant, in
this approach it is proved that the difference in this trade-off is not
considered in early moments when the attack happens since the attack detection
rate is rapid and thus, these attacks can be stopped with defense strategies in
the first moments with the proposed attack detection criterion.

three exomoon indicators that emerge if well-established planet-only models are
fitted to a planet-moon transit light curve: transit timing variations (TTVs),
transit duration variations (TDVs), and apparent planetary transit radius
variations (TRVs). We re-evaluate under realistic conditions the previously
proposed exomoon signatures in the TTV and TDV series. We simulate light curves
of a transiting exoplanet with a single moon. These model light curves are then
fitted with a planet-only transit model, pretending there were no moon, and we
explore the resulting TTV, TDV, and TRV series for evidence of the moon. The
previously described ellipse in the TTV-TDV diagram of an exoplanet with a moon
emerges only for high-density moons. Low-density moons distort the sinusoidal
shapes of the TTV and the TDV series due to their photometric contribution to
the combined planet-moon transit. Sufficiently large moons can produce periodic

Kepler and PLATO have similar performances in detecting the exomoon-induced TRV
effect around simulated bright ($m_V=8$) stars. These stars, however, are rare
in the Kepler sample but will be abundant in the PLATO sample. Moreover,
PLATO's higher cadence yields a stronger TTV signal. The periodogram of the
sequence of transit radius measurements can indicate the presence of a moon.
The TTV and TDV series of exoplanets with moons can be more complex than
previously assumed. We propose that TRVs could be a more promising means to
identify exomoons in large exoplanet surveys.

the federated setting, while guaranteeing data and model privacy as well as
ensuring robustness to users dropping out in the network. We design two
privacy-preserving protocols for training linear and logistic regression models

protocol. Exploiting the training algorithm of federated learning, at the core
of our training protocols is a secure multiparty global gradient computation on
alive users' data. We analyze the security of our training protocols against
semi-honest adversaries. As long as the aggregation protocol is secure under
the aggregation privacy game and the additive HE scheme is semantically secure,
PrivFL guarantees the users' data privacy against the server, and the server's
regression model privacy against the users. We demonstrate the performance of
PrivFL on real-world datasets and show its applicability in the federated

face-centred cubic, hexagonal close-packed, body-centered cubic and simple
cubic - coexisting in the sample, which show translational but no orientational
order. These observations confirm that the 3D atomic structure in some parts of

fingerprints for MR fingerprinting (MRF) problems based on the unsupervised
deep learning model generative adversarial networks (GAN). Methods: The GAN
model is adopted and modified for better convergence and performance, resulting
in an MRF specific model named GAN-MRF. The GAN-MRF model is trained,
validated, and tested using different MRF fingerprints simulated from the Bloch
equations with certain MRF sequence. The performance and robustness of the
model are further tested by using in vivo data collected on a 3 Tesla scanner
from a healthy volunteer together with MRF dictionaries with different sizes.
T1, T2 maps are generated and compared quantitatively. Results: The validation
and testing curves for the GAN-MRF model show no evidence of high bias or high
variance problems. The sample MRF fingerprints generated from the trained
GAN-MRF model agree well with the benchmark fingerprints simulated from the
Bloch equations. The in vivo T1, T2 maps generated from the GAN-MRF
fingerprints are in good agreement with those generated from the Bloch
simulated fingerprints, showing good performance and robustness of the proposed
GAN-MRF model. Moreover, the MRF dictionary generation time is reduced from
hours to sub-second for the testing dictionary. Conclusion: The GAN-MRF model
enables a fast and accurate generation of the MRF fingerprints. It
significantly reduces the MRF dictionary generation process and opens the door

These architectures are improved models of a well known architecture in RL
called actor-critic (AC). In AC, an actor optimizes the used policy, while a
critic estimates a value function and evaluate the optimized policy by the
actor. SAC is an architecture equipped with an actor, a critic, and a selector.
The selector determines the most promising action at the current state based on
the last estimate from the critic. TAC consists of a tuner, a model-learner, an
actor, and a critic. After receiving the approximated value of the current
state-action pair from the critic and the learned model from the model-learner,
the tuner uses the Bellman equation to tune the value of the current
state-action pair. ESAC is proposed to implement intelligent agents based on
two ideas, which are lookahead and intuition. Lookahead appears in estimating
the values of the available actions at the next state, while the intuition
appears in maximizing the probability of selecting the most promising action.
The newly added elements are an underlying model learner, an estimator, and a
selector. The model learner is used to approximate the underlying model. The
estimator uses the approximated value function, the learned underlying model,
and the Bellman equation to estimate the values of all actions at the next
state. The selector is used to determine the most promising action at the next
state, which will be used by the actor to optimize the used policy. Finally,
the results show the superiority of ESAC compared with the other architectures.

propagation in nerves, are essential for clinical diagnosis and basic
understanding of physiology. Sensing can be performed electrically by placing
sensor probes near or inside a living specimen or dissected tissue using well
established electrophysiology techniques. However, these electrical probe
techniques have poor spatial resolution and cannot easily access tissue deep
within a living subject, in particular within the brain. An alternative
approach is to detect the magnetic field induced by the passage of the
electrical signal, giving the equivalent readout without direct electrical
contact. Such measurements are performed today using bulky and expensive
superconducting sensors with poor spatial resolution. An alternative is to use
nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond that promise biocompatibilty and high
sensitivity without cryogenic cooling. In this work we present advances in
biomagnetometry using NV centres, demonstrating magnetic field sensitivity of
approximately 100 pT/$\sqrt{Hz}$ in the DC/low frequency range using a setup
designed for biological measurements. Biocompatibility of the setup with a
living sample (mouse brain slice) is studied and optimized, and we show work
toward sensitivity improvements using a pulsed magnetometry scheme. In addition
to the bulk magnetometry study, systematic artifacts in NV-ensemble widefield
fluorescence imaging are investigated.

sexual minority young adults also benefitted from the dependent coverage
mandate, despite previous studies showing lower health insurance coverage among
sexual minorities and the fact that their higher likelihood of strained
relationships with their parents might predict a lower ability to use parental
coverage. Our estimates from the American Community Surveys using
difference-in-differences and event study models show that men in same-sex
couples age 21-25 were significantly more likely to have any health insurance
after 2010 compared to the associated change for slightly older 27 to
31-year-old men in same-sex couples. This increase is concentrated among
employer-sponsored insurance, and it is robust to permutations of time periods
and age groups. Effects for women in same-sex couples and men in different-sex
couples are smaller than the associated effects for men in same-sex couples.
These findings confirm the broad effects of expanded dependent coverage and
suggest that eliminating the federal dependent mandate could reduce health
insurance coverage among young adult sexual minorities in same-sex couples.

first-order phase transition that terminates at a critical point
$(T_\mathrm{c},U_\mathrm{c})$ in the temperature-interaction plane $T-U$. A
number of crossovers occur along lines that extend for some range above
$(T_\mathrm{c},U_\mathrm{c})$. Asymptotically close to
$(T_\mathrm{c},U_\mathrm{c})$, these lines coalesce into the so-called Widom
line. The existence of $(T_\mathrm{c},U_\mathrm{c})$ and of the associated
crossovers becomes unclear when long-wavelength fluctuations or long-range
order occur above $(T_\mathrm{c},U_\mathrm{c})$. We study this problem using
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo methods as impurity solvers for both
Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) and Cellular Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
(CDMFT). We contrast the cases of the square lattice, where antiferromagnetic
fluctuations dominate in the vicinity of the Mott transition, and the
triangular lattice where they do not. The inflexion points and maxima found
near the Widom line for the square lattice can serve as proxy for the
triangular lattice case. But the only crossover observable in all cases at
sufficiently high temperature is that associated with the opening of the Mott
gap. The same physics also controls an analog crossover in the resistivity
called the ""Quantum Widom line"".

that in comparison to constrained grasping, unconstrained grasp forces are more

measuring grasp forces in an unconstrained manner in order to study how humans

computation offloading mechanism with resource allocation in IoT edge computing

learning agent observing its local environment to learn optimal decisions on
either local computing or edge computing with the goal of minimizing long term
system cost by choosing its transmit power level, RAT and sub-channel without
knowing any information of the other end users. Therefore, a multi-agent

a proposed independent learners based multi-agent Q-learning (IL-based MA-Q)
algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed IL-based MA-Q algorithm is
feasible to solve the formulated problem and is more energy efficient without
extra cost on channel estimation at the centralized gateway compared to the
other two benchmark algorithms.

directed with energy input via vibration or shear. However, here we show that
in particular containers, mono-sized spheres and cubes can self-assemble into
perfect crystals when randomly dropped in. This is because the favourable
microstates for new particles are jammed in the ordered structure by the
existing particles and the boundary synergistically. Such a self-assembly
method has not been reported in the literature. It indicates that disordered
packing structure may result from the conflict between the internal structure
and the structure shaped by the boundary. Therefore, to bridge such

energy by elastic scatterings or by medium-induced gluon radiation. The gluon
radiation spectrum is suppressed at high frequency due to the LPM effect and
encompasses two regimes that are known analytically: at high frequencies
$\omega >\omega_c = \hat q L^2$, where $\hat q $ is the jet quenching transport
coefficient and $L$ the length of the medium, the spectrum is dominated by a
single hard scattering, whereas the regime $\omega <\omega_c$ is dominated by
multiple low momentum transfers. In this paper, we extend a recent approach
(dubbed the Improved Opacity Expansion (IOE)), which allows an analytic (and
systematic) treatment beyond the multiple soft scattering approximation,
matching this result with the single hard emission spectrum. We calculate in
particular the NNLO correction analytically and numerically and show that it is
strongly suppressed compared to the NLO indicating a fast convergence of the
IOE scheme and thus, we conclude that it is sufficient to truncate the series

methods used in machine learning (ML). An ensemble method is a ML method that
combines multiple hypotheses to form a single hypothesis used for prediction. A
bagging algorithm combines multiple classifiers modeled on different
sub-samples of the same data set to build one large classifier. Banks, and
their retail banking activities, are nowadays using the power of ML algorithms,
including decision trees and random forests, to optimize their processes.
However, banks have to comply with regulators and governance and, hence,
delivering effective ML solutions is a challenging task. It starts with the
bank's validation and governance department, followed by the deployment of the
solution in a production environment up to the external validation of the
national financial regulator. Each proposed ML model has to be validated and
clear rules for every algorithm-based decision must be justified. In this
context, we propose XtracTree, an algorithm capable of efficiently converting
an ML bagging classifier, such as a random forest, into simple ""if-then"" rules
satisfying the requirements of model validation. We use a public loan data set
from Kaggle to illustrate the usefulness of our approach. Our experiments
demonstrate that using XtracTree, one can convert an ML model into a rule-based
algorithm, leading to easier model validation by national financial regulators
and the bank's validation department. The proposed approach allowed our banking
institution to reduce up to 50% the time of delivery of our AI solutions to the
end-user.

zero at optimal rates under much weaker assumptions than those required by

step towards answering these questions and show that for a wide class of

the risk converge to the minimizers of the true risk at the same rate, and
often have the same asymptotic variance, as the estimators obtained by
minimizing the usual empirical risk.

the discrimination of specific transformations of an image. We argue that the
generalization capability of learned features depends on what image
neighborhood size is sufficient to discriminate different image
transformations: The larger the required neighborhood size and the more global
the image statistics that the feature can describe. An accurate description of
global image statistics allows to better represent the shape and configuration
of objects and their context, which ultimately generalizes better to new tasks
such as object classification and detection. This suggests a criterion to
choose and design image transformations. Based on this criterion, we introduce
a novel image transformation that we call limited context inpainting (LCI).
This transformation inpaints an image patch conditioned only on a small
rectangular pixel boundary (the limited context). Because of the limited
boundary information, the inpainter can learn to match local pixel statistics,
but is unlikely to match the global statistics of the image. We claim that the
same principle can be used to justify the performance of transformations such
as image rotations and warping. Indeed, we demonstrate experimentally that
learning to discriminate transformations such as LCI, image warping and
rotations, yields features with state of the art generalization capabilities on
several datasets such as Pascal VOC, STL-10, CelebA, and ImageNet. Remarkably,
our trained features achieve a performance on Places on par with features
trained through supervised learning with ImageNet labels.

methodologies. This paper studies distributed estimation for a fundamental
statistical machine learning problem, principal component analysis (PCA).
Despite the massive literature on top eigenvector estimation, much less is
presented for the top-$L$-dim ($L>1$) eigenspace estimation, especially in a
distributed manner. We propose a novel multi-round algorithm for constructing
top-$L$-dim eigenspace for distributed data. Our algorithm takes advantage of
shift-and-invert preconditioning and convex optimization. Our estimator is
communication-efficient and achieves a fast convergence rate. In contrast to
the existing divide-and-conquer algorithm, our approach has no restriction on
the number of machines. Theoretically, the traditional Davis-Kahan theorem
requires the explicit eigengap assumption to estimate the top-$L$-dim
eigenspace. To abandon this eigengap assumption, we consider a new route in our
analysis: instead of exactly identifying the top-$L$-dim eigenspace, we show
that our estimator is able to cover the targeted top-$L$-dim population
eigenspace. Our distributed algorithm can be applied to a wide range of
statistical problems based on PCA, such as principal component regression and
single index model. Finally, We provide simulation studies to demonstrate the

failure is attributed to: (1) A majority of users only have a very limited
number of neighbors in social networks and can hardly benefit from social
relations; (2) Social relations are noisy but they are indiscriminately used;
(3) Social relations are assumed to be universally applicable to multiple
scenarios while they are actually multi-faceted and show heterogeneous
strengths in different scenarios. Most existing social recommendation models
only consider the homophily in social networks and neglect these drawbacks. In
this paper we propose a deep adversarial framework based on graph convolutional
networks (GCN) to address these problems. Concretely, for (1) and (2), a
GCN-based autoencoder is developed to augment the relation data by encoding
high-order and complex connectivity patterns, and meanwhile is optimized
subject to the constraint of reconstructing the social profile to guarantee the
validity of the identified neighborhood. After obtaining enough purified social
relations for each user, a GCN-based attentive social recommendation module is
designed to address (3) by capturing the heterogeneous strengths of social
relations. Finally, we adopt adversarial training to unify all the components
by playing a Minimax game and ensure a coordinated effort to enhance
recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on multiple open datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our framework and the ablation study confirms
the importance and effectiveness of each component.

not clear whether it would result in a turbulent eddy diffusivity, or
anti-diffusivity, or something else entirely. In this paper, we present the
first direct numerical simulations of turbulence in horizontal shear flows at

spectroscopic surveys, there is an unmet need for a reliable library of
fundamentally calibrated stellar effective temperatures based on accurate
stellar diameters. Here we present a set of precision diameters and
temperatures for a sample of 6 dwarf, 5 sub-giant, and 5 giant stars observed
with the PIONIER beam combiner at the VLTI. Science targets were observed in at
least two sequences with five unique calibration stars each for accurate
visibility calibration and to reduce the impact of bad calibrators. We use the
standard PIONIER data reduction pipeline, but bootstrap over interferograms, in
addition to employing a Monte-Carlo approach to account for correlated errors
by sampling stellar parameters, limb darkening coefficients, and fluxes, as
well as predicted calibrator angular diameters. The resulting diameters were
then combined with bolometric fluxes derived from broadband Hipparcos-Tycho
photometry and MARCS model bolometric corrections, plus parallaxes from Gaia to
produce effective temperatures, physical radii, and luminosities for each star
observed. Our stars have mean angular diameter and temperatures uncertainties
of 0.8% and 0.9% respectively, with our sample including diameters for 10 stars
with no pre-existing interferometric measurements. The remaining stars are
consistent with previous measurements, with the exception of a single star
which we observe here with PIONIER at both higher resolution and greater
sensitivity than was achieved in earlier work.

second-order algorithms of the Newton type: one involving coderivatives of

minimization of extended-real-valued prox-regular functions, while covering in
this way problems of constrained optimization, by using Moreau envelops.
Employing advanced techniques of second-order variational analysis and
characterizations of tilt stability allows us to establish the solvability of
subproblems in both algorithms and to prove the Q-superlinear convergence of
their iterations.

  the nuclear incompressibility","PhD thesis submitted to the graduate school at the University of
  Notre Dame",,,,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Giant resonances are collective nuclear vibrations which provide a unique
laboratory setting to probe the bulk properties of the nuclear force. One of
the isoscalar compressional modes -- the isoscalar giant monopole resonance
(ISGMR) -- is useful in constraining the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear
matter. For example, the nuclear incompressibility, $K_\infty$, is a
fundamental quantity in the EoS and is directly correlated with the energies of
the ISGMR in finite nuclei.
  Previous work has shown that interactions with $K_\infty$ which reproduce the
energies of the ISGMR in $^{208}$Pb and $^{90}$Zr well, overestimate those of
the tin and cadmium nuclei. To further investigate where this ""softness""
appears in moving away from the doubly-closed nucleus $^{90}$Zr, and how this
effect develops, the first portion of this thesis consists of measurements of
the ISGMR in the molybdenum isotopes. Comparison of the ISGMR strengths with
Random Phase Approximation calculations shows that these nuclei have ISGMR
energies which are overestimated to a similar degree as seen in the tin and
cadmium nuclei, while the strength of $^{208}$Pb is precisely reproduced. This
suggests clearly that the molybdenum nuclei exhibit the same open-shell
softness which has been documented previously.
  The ISGMR in isotopes encompassing a broad range of proton-neutron
asymmetries constrains the dependence of the nuclear incompressibility on the
isospin asymmetry, as quantified by the asymmetry term, $K_\tau$. To reconcile
previously-published and highly concerning conclusions that $K_\tau = + 582$
MeV, the second portion of this thesis is focused upon independently studying

formation and the subsequent long-term mass accretion phase of over one million
years using two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We show that
the critical physical process that sets the final mass is formation and
expansion of a bipolar HII region. The process is similar to the formation of
massive primordial stars, but radiation pressure exerted on dust grains also
contributes to halting the accretion flow in the low-metallicity case. We find
that the net feedback effect in the case with metallicity $Z =
10^{-2}~Z_{\odot}$ is stronger than in the case with $Z \sim 1~Z_{\odot}$. With
decreasing metallicity, the radiation pressure effect becomes weaker, but
photoionization heating of the circumstellar gas is more efficient owing to the
reduced dust attenuation. In the case with $Z = 10^{-2}~Z_{\odot}$, the central
star grows as massive as 200 solar-masses, similarly to the case of primordial
star formation. We conclude that metal-poor stars with a few hundred solar
masses can be formed by gas accretion despite the strong radiative feedback.

avoid evaluating the exponentially many candidate topologies, this two-step
approach is uniquely formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using
the McCormick relaxation. If the recovered topology is not radial, a second,

importance. A major aim of this paper is to expand our theoretical knowledge of
the class of pair correlation functions or structure factors that are
realizable by classical disordered ensembles of particle configurations. We
first introduce a theoretical formalism that provides a means to draw classical
particle configurations from canonical ensembles with certain pairwise-additive
potentials that could correspond to targeted analytical functional forms for
the structure factor. This formulation enables us to devise an improved
algorithm to construct systematically canonical-ensemble particle
configurations with such targeted pair statistics. We test the algorithm by
targeting several different structure factors across dimensions that are known
to be realizable and one hyperuniform target that is known to be nontrivially
unrealizable. Subsequently, we also target several families of structure-factor
functions that meet the known necessary realizability conditions but were
heretofore not known to be realizable. Moreover, we also explore unusual
nonhyperuniform targets, including ""hyposurficial"" and ""anti-hyperuniform""
examples. In all of these instances, the targeted structure factors were
achieved with high accuracy, suggesting that they are indeed realizable by
equilibrium configurations with pairwise interactions at positive temperatures.
Our findings lead us to the conjecture that any realizable structure factor

nonequilibrium system can be attained by an equilibrium ensemble involving only

The key challenge is the dynamicity: each vehicle needs to recognize the
frequent changes of the surroundings and apply them to its networking behavior.
This is the point where the need for machine learning is highlighted. However,
the learning itself is extremely complicated due to the dynamicity as well,
which necessitates that the learning framework itself must be resilient and
flexible according to the environment. As such, this paper proposes a V2X
networking framework integrating reinforcement learning (RL) into scheduling of
multiple access. Specifically, the learning mechanism is formulated as a
multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, which enables a vehicle, without any
assistance from external infrastructure, to (i) learn the environment, (ii)
quantify the accident risk, and (iii) adapt its backoff counter according to

able to (i) evaluate an accident risk close to optimal and (ii) as a result,
yields a higher chance of transmission for a dangerous vehicle.

when rewards are very sparse, where traditional exploration heuristics such as
Boltzmann or e-greedy would typically fail. However, intrinsic exploration is
generally handled in an ad-hoc manner, where exploration is not treated as a
core objective of the learning process; this weak formulation leads to
sub-optimal exploration performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a
framework based on multi-objective RL where both exploration and exploitation
are being optimized as separate objectives. This formulation brings the balance
between exploration and exploitation at a policy level, resulting in advantages
over traditional methods. This also allows for controlling exploration while
learning, at no extra cost. Such strategies achieve a degree of control over
agent exploration that was previously unattainable with classic or intrinsic
rewards. We demonstrate scalability to continuous state-action spaces by
presenting a method (EMU-Q) based on our framework, guiding exploration towards
regions of higher value-function uncertainty. EMU-Q is experimentally shown to
outperform classic exploration techniques and other intrinsic RL methods on a

Design:
With a priori information obtained from the daily number of deaths due to

Exposure: COVID-19. Outcome: Number of deaths. Results: Assuming an
intervention level similar to the one implemented in China, the total number of
deaths in Peru is expected to be 612 (95%CI: 604.3 - 833.7) persons. Sixty four

be quadratic. Second, the Lindblad operators describing the coupling to the

In cases where we can solve the $2N$-degree polynomials that arise in our
calculations, we provide an analytical solution for initial states that are
arbitrary (i.e. they are not required to have Gaussian Wigner functions). The
solution takes the form of an evolution operator, with the measurement-result

we solve some single-mode example systems, with the POVMs being of practical
relevance to the inference of an initial state, via quantum state tomography.
Our key tool is the representation of mixed states of quantum mechanical
oscillators as state vectors rather than state matrices (albeit in a larger

bond indices taking care of two-qubit gate simulation). Consequently, in case
of weak system noise, the resource cost of MPDO will be significantly less than
that of the MPO due to a relatively small inner dimension needed for the
simulation. In case of strong system noise, a relatively small bond dimension
may be sufficient to simulate the noisy circuits, indicating a regime that the
noise is large enough for an `easy' classical simulation. Moreover, we propose
a more effective tensor updates scheme with optimal truncations for both the

propel progress in hydrological sciences, but, at the same time, it has
strained the ability of modern automatic calibration methods to produce
realistic model parameter combinations for these models. This paper presents a
new reliable and fast automatic calibration framework to address this issue. In
essence, the proposed framework, adopting a divide and conquer strategy, first
partitions the parameters into groups of different resolutions based on their
sensitivity or importance, in which the most sensitive parameters are
prioritized with highest resolution in parameter search space, while the least
sensitive ones are explored with the coarsest resolution at beginning. This is
followed by an optimization based iterative calibration procedure consisting of
a series of sub-tasks or runs. Between consecutive runs, the setup
configuration is heterogeneous with parameter search ranges and resolutions
varying among groups. At the completion of each sub-task, the parameter ranges
within each group are systematically refined from their previously estimated
ranges which are initially based on a priori information. Parameters attain
stable convergence progressively with each run. A comparison of this new
calibration framework with a traditional optimization-based approach was
performed using a quasi-synthetic double-model setup experiment to calibrate
134 parameters and two well-known distributed hydrological models: the Variable
Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation
Model (DHSVM). The results demonstrate statistically that the proposed
framework can better mitigate equifinality problem, yields more realistic model
parameter estimates, and is computationally more efficient.

also deploys a novel seq2sesq architecture which couples a convolutional

studies use optimistic resource reservation for all the applications to improve

insufficient at runtime. Many of them however share an impractical assumption
that all the critical applications will simultaneously demand additional
resources. As a consequence, they under-utilize resources by penalizing all the
low-criticality applications. In this paper we overcome this shortcoming using
a novel mechanism that comprises a parameter to model the expected number of
critical applications simultaneously demanding more resources, and an execution
strategy based on the parameter to improve resource utilization. Since most
mixed-criticality systems in practice are component-based, we design our
mechanism such that the component boundaries provide the isolation necessary to
support the execution of low-criticality applications, and at the same time
protect the critical ones. We also develop schedulability tests for the
proposed mechanism under both a flat as well as a hierarchical scheduling

and other smooth sigmoidal approximations recently reported in the literature.
We show that a key benefit of SigVaR over such approximations is that one can
establish an explicit connection with the conditional value at risk (CVaR)
approximation and exploit this connection to obtain initial guesses for the
approximation parameters. We present small- and large-scale numerical studies
to illustrate the developments.

develop a comprehensive science of resilient robotic autonomy. Resilience and
its key characteristics relating to robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness
are discussed, followed by a selected - but not exhaustive - list of research
themes and domains that are crucial to facilitate resilient autonomy. Last but
not least, an outline of possible directions of a new and enhanced design
paradigm in robotics is presented. This manuscript is intentionally short and
abstract. It serves to open the discussion and raise questions. The answers
will necessarily be found in the actual process of conducting research by the
community and in the framework of introducing robotics in an ever increasing
set of real-life use cases. Its current form is based on thoughts identified
within the ongoing experience of conducting research for robotic systems to
gain autonomy in certain types of extreme environments such as subterranean
settings, nuclear facilities, agriculture areas, and long-term off-road
deployments. The very context of this document will be subject to change and it
will be iteratively revisited.

Spectral analysis with the physical two-component advective flow (TCAF) model
allows us to understand the accretion flow properties of the source. We found
that this outburst of XTE J1118+480 is an unconventional outburst as the source
was only in the hard state (HS). Our spectral analysis suggests that during the
entire outburst, the source was highly dominated by the low angular momentum
sub-Keplerian halo rate. Since the source was active in radio throughout the
outburst, we make an effort to estimate X-ray contribution of jets in total
observed X-ray emissions from the spectral analysis with the TCAF model. The
total X-ray intensity shows a similar nature of evolution as of radio and jet
X-ray fluxes. This allowed us to define this `outburst' also as a jet dominated
`outburst'. Total X-ray flux also found to subside when jet activity
disappears. Our detailed spectral analysis also showed that although the source
was only in the HS during the outburst, in the late declining phase spectrum
became slightly softer due to the slow rise in the Keplerian disk rate.

single-molecule device can be selected between two molecular orbitals by
varying a magnetic field, giving rise to a tunable anisotropic
magnetoresistance up to 93%. The unique tunability of the electron pathways is
due to the magnetic reorientation of the transition metal center, resulting in
a re-hybridization of molecular orbitals. We obtain the tunneling electron
pathways by Kondo effect, which manifests either as a peak or a dip line shape.
The energy changes of these spin-reorientations are remarkably low and less
than one millielectronvolt. The large tunable anisotropic magnetoresistance
could be used to control electronic transport in molecular spintronics.

ideal Weyl semimetal (IWSM) which is the optimal platform to explore broad Weyl

Bipeds are dynamically unstable and need to maintain their trunk upright

when running. Gait studies report that the GRF vectors focus around a virtual
point above the center of mass (VPA), while the trunk moves forward in pitch
axis during the stance phase of human running. However, a recent simulation
study suggests that a virtual point below the center of mass (VPB) might be
present in human running, since a VPA yields backward trunk rotation during the
stance phase. In this work, we perform a gait analysis to investigate the
existence and location of the VP in human running at 5 ms-1, and support our
findings numerically using the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model with a
trunk (TSLIP). We extend our analysis to include perturbations in terrain
height (visible and camouflaged), and investigate the response of the VP
mechanism to step-down perturbations both experimentally and numerically. Our
experimental results show that the human running gait displays a VPB of ~-30cm

perturbations affect the location of the VPB. Our simulation results suggest
that the VPB is able to encounter the step-down perturbations and bring the

cues can be used. When the additive noises exist, this task becomes more
challenging. In this paper, we propose a joint training method for simultaneous
speech denoising and dereverberation using deep embedding features, which is
based on the deep clustering (DC). DC is a state-of-the-art method for speech
separation that includes embedding learning and K-means clustering. As for our
proposed method, it contains two stages: denoising and dereverberation. At the
denoising stage, the DC network is leveraged to extract noise-free deep
embedding features. These embedding features are generated from the anechoic
speech and residual reverberation signals. They can represent the inferred
spectral masking patterns of the desired signals, which are discriminative
features. At the dereverberation stage, instead of using the unsupervised
K-means clustering algorithm, another supervised neural network is utilized to
estimate the anechoic speech from these deep embedding features. Finally, the
denoising stage and dereverberation stage are optimized by the joint training
method. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the WPE
and BLSTM baselines, especially in the low SNR condition.

conversation systems. Despite that response selection is naturally a
learning-to-rank problem, most prior works take a point-wise view and train
binary classifiers for this task: each response candidate is labeled either
relevant (one) or irrelevant (zero). On the one hand, this formalization can be
sub-optimal due to its ignorance of the diversity of response quality. On the
other hand, annotating grayscale data for learning-to-rank can be prohibitively
expensive and challenging. In this work, we show that grayscale data can be
automatically constructed without human effort. Our method employs
off-the-shelf response retrieval models and response generation models as
automatic grayscale data generators. With the constructed grayscale data, we
propose multi-level ranking objectives for training, which can (1) teach a
matching model to capture more fine-grained context-response relevance
difference and (2) reduce the train-test discrepancy in terms of distractor
strength. Our method is simple, effective, and universal. Experiments on three
benchmark datasets and four state-of-the-art matching models show that the
proposed approach brings significant and consistent performance improvements.

need for accurate and efficient characterization of the noise in quantum gate
implementations. A key measure of the performance of a quantum gate is the
minimum gate fidelity, i.e., the fidelity of the gate, minimized over all input
states. Conventionally, the minimum fidelity is estimated by first accurately
reconstructing the full gate process matrix using the experimental procedure of
quantum process tomography (QPT). Then, a numerical minimization is carried out
to find the minimum fidelity. QPT is, however, well known to be costly, and it
might appear that we can do better, if the goal is only to estimate one single
number. In this work, we propose a hybrid numerical-experimental scheme that
employs a numerical gradient-free minimization (GFM) and an experimental
target-fidelity estimation procedure to directly estimate the minimum fidelity
without reconstructing the process matrix. We compare this to an alternative
scheme, referred to as QPT fidelity estimation, that does use QPT, but directly
employs the minimum gate fidelity as the termination criterion. Both approaches
can thus be considered as direct estimation schemes. General theoretical bounds
suggest a significant resource savings for the GFM scheme over QPT fidelity
estimation; numerical simulations for specific classes of noise, however, show
that both schemes have similar performance, reminding us of the need for
caution when using general bounds for specific examples. The GFM scheme,
however, presents potential for future improvements in resource cost, with the
development of even more efficient GFM algorithms.

For each problem we provide polynomial time algorithms that given $n$ i.i.d.\

$\exp\left(-O(\sqrt{n} \log n) \right)$, improving upon the previous best-known
bound achievable in polynomial time of $\exp(-O(n^{2/3} \log n))$ (Charikar,

We show that each of these are $\exp(O(k \log(N/k)))$ approximations to the

considered with boundary conditions with a shift (similar to helical ones), and
with cyclic closure of the set of all points in natural ordering. The
elementary transfer matrix with nonnegative matrix elements are constructed. On
the set of disorder solutions the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix is
constant for every size of considering planar lattice, and, in particular, in
the thermodynamic limit. Free energy per lattice site in the thermodynamic
limit is expressed through the natural logarithm of the largest eigenvalue of

eigenvector with positive components. The numerical example show the existence
of nontrivial solutions of the resulting systems of equations. The system of

intermediate width with full width at half maximum about 1900 \kmps\ and are
shown in two systems: a major system is unshifted and a minor system has a
blue-shifts of about 2600 \kmps. The line intensity ratios, combining
photo-ionization simulations, indicates an ultradense line-emitting region with

assumptions that have less discriminative power. In this work, we proposed a
self-supervised framework named SelfORE, which exploits weak, self-supervised
signals by leveraging large pretrained language model for adaptive clustering
on contextualized relational features, and bootstraps the self-supervised
signals by improving contextualized features in relation classification.
Experimental results on three datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of
SelfORE on open-domain Relation Extraction when comparing with competitive
baselines.

platforms is an area which has received much attention in the recent past. It
is widely believed that finding an optimal scheduler is hard, and therefore
most studies have focused on developing algorithms with good processor
utilization bounds. These algorithms can be broadly classified into two
categories: partitioned scheduling in which tasks are statically assigned to
individual processors, and global scheduling in which each task is allowed to
execute on any processor in the platform. In this paper we consider a third,
more general, approach called cluster-based scheduling. In this approach each
task is statically assigned to a processor cluster, tasks in each cluster are
globally scheduled among themselves, and clusters in turn are scheduled on the
multiprocessor platform. We develop techniques to support such cluster-based
scheduling algorithms, and also consider properties that minimize total
processor utilization of individual clusters. In the last part of this paper,
we develop new virtual cluster-based scheduling algorithms. For implicit
deadline sporadic task systems, we develop an optimal scheduling algorithm that
is neither Pfair nor ERfair. We also show that the processor utilization bound
of US-EDF{m/(2m-1)} can be improved by using virtual clustering. Since neither
partitioned nor global strategies dominate over the other, cluster-based
scheduling is a natural direction for research towards achieving improved
processor utilization bounds.

The controller manipulates converter power injections to limit the frequency

June 2019, which even raised the possibility that it was linked to the impact
of the small asteroid 2019 MO near Puerto Rico. Early reports also point out
the similarity of the shower to the orbit of the comet 300P/Catalina. We aim to
analyze the orbits, emission spectra, and material strengths of JEO meteoroids
to provide a characterization of this stream, identify its parent object, and
evaluate its link to the impacting asteroid 2019 MO. Our analysis is based on a
sample of 22 JEO meteor orbits and four emission spectra observed by the AMOS
network at the Canary Islands and in Chile. The link to potential parent
objects was evaluated using a combination of orbital-similarity D-criteria and
backwards integration of the orbit of comet 300P and the JEO stream. We confirm
the reports of an unexpected swarm of meteoroids originating in the JEO stream.
JEO meteoroids have low material strengths characteristic for fragile cometary
bodies, and they exhibit signs of a porous structure. The emission spectra
reveal slightly increased iron content compared to all other measured cometary
streams, but they are generally consistent with a primitive chondritic
composition. Further dynamical analysis suggests that the JEO stream is likely
to originate from comet 300P/Catalina and that it was formed within the last
1000 years. Over longer timescales, the meteoroids in the stream move to
chaotic orbits due to the turbulent orbital evolution of the comet. Our results
also suggest that the impact of the small asteroid 2019 MO on June 22 was not
connected to the JEO activity.

to compute factor score predictors that are -- under some conditions -- more
highly correlated with the common factors resulting from factor analysis than
the factor score predictors computed from the common factor model. In the
present study, we investigate SPFA as a model in its own rights. In order to
provide a basis for this, the properties and the utility of SPFA factor score
predictors and the possibility to identify single-item indicators in SPFA
loading matrices were investigated. Regarding the factor score predictors, the
main result is that the best linear predictor of the score predictor factor
analysis has not only perfect determinacy but is also correlation preserving.
Regarding the SPFA loadings it was found in a simulation study that five or
more population factors that are represented by only one variable with a rather
substantial loading can more accurately be identified by means of SPFA than
with conventional factor analysis. Moreover, the percentage of correctly
identified single-item indicators was substantially larger for SPFA than for
the common factor model. It is therefore argued that SPFA is a tool that can be
especially helpful when very short scales or single-item indicators are to be
identified.

studies suggest that the models trained in this way are not capable of robustly
handling complex syntactic constructions, such as long-distance agreement. In
this paper, using English data, we first demonstrate that appropriately using
negative examples about particular constructions (e.g., subject-verb agreement)
will boost the model's robustness on them, with a negligible loss of
perplexity. The key to our success is an additional margin loss between the
log-likelihoods of a correct word and an incorrect word. We then provide a
detailed analysis of the trained models. One of our findings is the difficulty
of object-relative clauses for RNNs. We find that even with our direct learning
signals the models still suffer from resolving agreement across an
object-relative clause. Augmentation of training sentences involving the
constructions somewhat helps, but the accuracy still does not reach the level
of subject-relative clauses. Although not directly cognitively appealing, our
method can be a tool to analyze the true architectural limitation of neural
models on challenging linguistic constructions.

between the received signal and a time-shifted waveform, as a function of this
time shift. We characterize the optimal correlator waveform that minimizes the
mean square error (MSE) in the regime of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The
optimal correlator waveforms for detection and for estimation turn out to be
different, but their limiting behavior is the same: when the thermal Gaussian
noise is dominant, the optimal correlator waveform becomes proportional to the
clean signal, but when the thermal noise is negligible compared to the other
noises, then it becomes logarithmic function of the clean signal, as expected.

species is studied. The latter first undergoes resonant photoexcitation,
leading to an autoionizing state of the diatomic system. Afterwards, the
excitation energy is transferred radiationlessly via a two-center Auger process
to the other atom, causing its ionization. Assuming a fixed internuclear
distance, it has been predicted theoretically that this indirect ionization
pathway can strongly dominate over the direct photoionization. Here, we extend
the theory of resonant two-center photoionization by including the nuclear
motion in van-der-Waals molecules. An analytical formula is derived reflecting
the influence of molecular vibrational dynamics on the relative strength of the
two-center channel. For the specific example of Li-He dimers we show that the
two-center autoionizing resonances are split by the nuclear motion into
multiplets, with the resonance lines reaching a comparable level of enhancement
over direct photoionization as is obtained in a model based on spatially fixed
nuclei.

predictive control (NMPC) of systems governed by partial differential equations

system in space and time by using the finite difference method. The proposed
method is called the double-layer Jacobi method, which exploits both the
spatial and temporal sparsities of the PDE-constrained NMPC problem. In the
upper layer, the NMPC problem is solved by ignoring the temporal couplings of
either the state or costate (Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the state
equation) equations so that the spatial sparsity is preserved. The lower-layer
Jacobi method is a linear solver dedicated to PDE-constrained NMPC problems by
exploiting the spatial sparsity. Convergence analysis indicates that the
convergence of the proposed method is related to the prediction horizon and
regularization. Results of a numerical experiment of controlling a heat
transfer process show that the proposed method is two orders of magnitude
faster than the conventional structure-exploiting Newton's method.

critical feature of adaptation. In social learning, several distributed agents
update continually their belief about a phenomenon of interest through: i)
direct observation of streaming data that they gather locally; and ii)
diffusion of their beliefs through local cooperation with their neighbors.
Traditional social learning implementations are known to learn well the
underlying hypothesis (which means that the belief of every individual agent
peaks at the true hypothesis), achieving steady improvement in the learning
accuracy under stationary conditions. However, these algorithms do not perform
well under nonstationary conditions commonly encountered in online learning,
exhibiting a significant inertia to track drifts in the streaming data. In
order to address this gap, we propose an Adaptive Social Learning (ASL)
strategy, which relies on a small step-size parameter to tune the adaptation
degree. First, we provide a detailed characterization of the learning
performance by means of a steady-state analysis. Focusing on the small
step-size regime, we establish that the ASL strategy achieves consistent
learning under standard global identifiability assumptions. We derive reliable
Gaussian approximations for the probability of error (i.e., of choosing a wrong
hypothesis) at each individual agent. We carry out a large deviations analysis
revealing the universal behavior of adaptive social learning: the error
probabilities decrease exponentially fast with the inverse of the step-size,
and we characterize the resulting exponential learning rate. Second, we
characterize the adaptation performance by means of a detailed transient
analysis, which allows us to obtain useful analytical formulas relating the
adaptation time to the step-size.

beyond the usual protoplanetary disk lifetimes (i.e., > 10 Myrs), when planets
have already formed. These gas disks, mainly composed of CO, carbon, and oxygen
seem to be ubiquitous in systems with planetesimal belts (similar to our Kuiper
belt), and can last for hundreds of millions of years. Planets orbiting in
these gas disks will accrete a large quantity of gas that will transform their
primordial atmospheres into new secondary atmospheres with compositions similar
to that of the parent gas disk. Here, we quantify how large a secondary
atmosphere can be created for a variety of observed gas disks and for a wide
range of planet types. We find that gas accretion in this late phase is very
significant and an Earth's atmospheric mass of gas is readily accreted on
terrestrial planets in very tenuous gas disks. In slightly more massive disks,
we show that massive CO atmospheres can be accreted, forming planets with up to
sub-Neptune-like pressures. Our new results demonstrate that new secondary
atmospheres with high metallicities and high C/O ratios will be created in
these late gas disks, resetting their primordial compositions inherited from
the protoplanetary disk phase, and providing a new birth to planets that lost
their atmosphere to photoevaporation or giant impacts. We therefore propose a
new paradigm for the formation of atmospheres on low-mass planets, which can be
tested with future observations (JWST, ELT, ARIEL). We also show that this late
accretion would show a very clear signature in Sub-Neptunes or cold
exo-Jupiters. Finally, we find that accretion creates cavities in late gas

GNU Emacs can currently execute Elisp code either interpreted or
byte-interpreted after it has been compiled to byte-code. In this work we
discuss the implementation of an optimizing compiler approach for Elisp
targeting native code. The native compiler employs the byte-compiler's internal
representation as input and exploits libgccjit to achieve code generation using
the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) infrastructure. Generated executables are
stored as binary files and can be loaded and unloaded dynamically. Most of the
functionality of the compiler is written in Elisp itself, including several
optimization passes, paired with a C back-end to interface with the GNU Emacs
core and libgccjit. Though still a work in progress, our implementation is able
to bootstrap a functional Emacs and compile all lexically scoped Elisp files,
including the whole GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive (ELPA). Native-compiled
Elisp shows an increase of performance ranging from 2.3x up to 42x with respect
to the equivalent byte-code, measured over a set of small benchmarks.

widely distributed across space. It is thought to have partial origin from
interstellar molecular clouds, which are near the beginning of the star
formation cycle. Observational surveys of CH$_4$ ice towards low- and high-mass
young stellar objects showed that much of the CH$_4$ is expected to be formed
by the hydrogenation of C on dust grains, and that CH$_4$ ice is strongly
correlated with solid H$_2$O. Yet, this has not been investigated under
controlled laboratory conditions, as carbon-atom chemistry of interstellar ice
analogues has not been experimentally realized. In this study, we successfully
demonstrate with a C-atom beam implemented in an ultrahigh vacuum apparatus the
formation of CH$_4$ ice in two separate co-deposition experiments: C + H on a
10 K surface to mimic CH$_4$ formation right before H$_2$O ice is formed on the
dust grain, and C + H + H$_2$O on a 10 K surface to mimic CH$_4$ formed
simultaneously with H$_2$O ice. We confirm that CH$_4$ can be formed by the
reaction of atomic C and H, and that the CH$_4$ formation rate is 2 times
greater when CH$_4$ is formed within a H$_2$O-rich ice. This is in agreement
with the observational finding that interstellar CH$_4$ and H$_2$O form
together in the polar ice phase, i.e., when C- and H-atoms simultaneously
accrete with O-atoms on dust grains. For the first time, the conditions that
lead to interstellar CH$_4$ (and CD$_4$) ice formation are reported, and can be
incorporated into astrochemical models to further constrain CH$_4$ chemistry in
the interstellar medium and in other regions where CH$_4$ is inherited.

($\sim2700$ km) moon on a close-in, circular, yet retrograde orbit, flanked by
Nereid, the largest irregular satellite ($\sim$300 km) on a highly eccentric
orbit. Capture origins have been previously suggested for both moons. Here we
explore an alternative in-situ formation model where the two satellites
accreted in the circum-Neptunian disk and are imparted irregular and eccentric
orbits by a deep planetary encounter with an ice giant (IG), like that
predicted in the Nice scenario of early solar system development. We use
$N$-body simulations of an IG approaching Neptune to 20 Neptunian radi
($R_\mathrm{Nep}$), through a belt of circular prograde regular satellites at
10-30 $R_\mathrm{Nep}$. We find that half of these primordial satellites remain
bound to Neptune and that 0.4-3\% are scattered directly onto wide and
eccentric orbits resembling that of Nereid. With better matches to the observed
orbit, our model has a success rate comparable to or higher than capture of
large Nereid-sized irregular satellites from heliocentric orbit. At the same
time, the IG encounter injects a large primordial moon onto a retrograde orbit
with specific angular momentum similar to Triton's in 0.3-3\% of our runs.
While less efficient than capture scenarios (Agnor & Hamilton 2006), our model
does indicate that an in-situ origin for Triton is dynamically possible. We
also simulate the post-encounter collisional and tidal orbital evolution of
Triton analogue satellites and find they are decoupled from Nereid on
timescales of $\sim$$10^4$ years, in agreement with Cuk & Gladman (2005).

how the common study weights arise in effect and shrinkage estimation, and how
these may be generalized to the case of Bayesian meta-analysis. Next we develop
simple ways to compute bounds on the weights, so that the contribution of the
external evidence may be assessed a priori. These considerations are
illustrated and discussed using numerical examples, including applications in
the treatment of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and in fetal monitoring to prevent
the occurrence of metabolic acidosis. The target study's contribution to the
resulting estimate is shown to be bounded below. Therefore, concerns of
evidence being easily overwhelmed by external data are largely unwarranted.

the ground states of neutral excitons ($\textrm{X}_{\textrm{1s}}^\textrm{A}$

Rydberg series of excited states of $\textrm{X}^\textrm{A}$ and
$\textrm{X}^\textrm{B}$. The relative intensities of the different spectral

trions and Rydberg excited states becoming more prominent at large gate

CERN: NP06/ENUBET. A key element of the project is the instrumentation of the
decay tunnel to monitor large angle positrons produced together with $\nu_e$ in
the three body decays of kaons ($K_{e3}$) and to discriminate them from neutral
and charged pions. The need for an efficient and high purity e/$\pi$ separation
over a length of several meters, and the requirements for fast response and
radiation hardness imposed by the harsh beam environment, suggested the
implementation of a longitudinally segmented Fe/scintillator calorimeter with a
readout based on WLS fibers and SiPM detectors. An extensive experimental
program through several test beam campaigns at the CERN-PS T9 beam line has
been pursued on calorimeter prototypes, both with a shashlik and a lateral
readout configuration. The latter, in which fibers collect the light from the
side of the scintillator tiles, allows to place the light sensors away from the
core of the calorimeter, thus reducing possible irradiation damages with
respect to the shashlik design. This contribution will present the achievements
of the prototyping activities carried out, together with irradiation tests made
on the Silicon Photo-Multipliers. The results achieved so far pin down the

Reservoir computing is a growing paradigm for simplified
training of recurrent neural networks, with a high potential for hardware
implementations. Numerous experiments in optics and electronics yield
comparable performance to digital state-of-the-art algorithms. Many of the most
recent works in the field focus on large-scale photonic systems, with tens of
thousands of physical nodes and arbitrary interconnections. While this trend
significantly expands the potential applications of photonic reservoir
computing, it also complicates the optimisation of the high number of
hyper-parameters of the system. Methods. In this work, we propose the use of
Bayesian optimisation for efficient exploration of the hyper-parameter space in
a minimum number of iteration. Results. We test this approach on a previously
reported large-scale experimental system, compare it to the commonly used grid
search, and report notable improvements in performance and the number of
experimental iterations required to optimise the hyper-parameters. Conclusion.
Bayesian optimisation thus has the potential to become the standard method for
tuning the hyper-parameters in photonic reservoir computing.

economic than architecture search. To mitigate the difficulty in effectively
dealing with huge input spaces of LSM, and to find that whether input reduction
can enhance LSM performance, we explore several input patterns, namely
fullscale, scanline, chessboard, and patch. Several datasets have been used to
evaluate the performance of the proposed input patterns, including two spatio

particles, whereas the upper solar atmosphere is mostly ionised particles and
electrons. A shock that propagates upwards in the solar atmosphere therefore
undergoes a transition where the dominant fluid is either neutral or ionised.
An upwards propagating shock also passes a point where the sound and Alfv\'en
speed are equal. At this point the energy of the acoustic shock can separated
into fast and slow components. How the energy is distributed between the two
modes depends on the angle of magnetic field. The separation of neutral and
ionised species in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere is investigated. The
role of two-fluid effects on the structure of the shocks post-mode-conversion
and the frictional heating is quantified for different levels of collisional
coupling. Two-fluid numerical simulations are performed using the
(P\underline{I}P) code of a wave steepening into a shock in an isothermal,
partially-ionised atmosphere. The collisional coefficient is varied to
investigate the regimes where the plasma and neutral species are weakly,
strongly and finitely coupled. The propagation speeds of the compressional
waves hosted by neutral and ionised species vary, therefore velocity drift
between the two species is produced as the plasma attempts to propagate faster
than the neutrals. This is most extreme for a fast-mode shock. We find that the
collisional coefficient drastically changes the features present in the system,
specifically the mode conversion height, type of shocks present, and the finite
shock widths created by the two-fluid effects. In the finitely-coupled regime
fast-mode shock widths can exceed the pressure scale height leading to a new
potential observable of two-fluid effects in the lower solar atmosphere.

contact, and uses this confinement to analyse diffusion processes without
interference of exchange with and diffusion in the bulk solution. With this
method, which we call plane-sphere confinement microscopy (PSCM), information
regarding the partitioning of molecules between the polymer coating and the
bulk liquid is also obtained. Thanks to the shape of the confined geometry,
diffusion and partitioning can be mapped as a function of compression and
concentration of the coating in a single experiment. The method is versatile
and can be integrated with conventional optical microscopes, and thus should
find widespread use in the many application areas exploiting functional polymer
coatings. We demonstrate the use of PSCM using brushes of natively unfolded
nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). A
meshwork of FG domains is known to be responsible for the selective transport
of nuclear transport receptors (NTR) and their macromolecular cargos across the
nuclear envelope that separates the cytosol and the nucleus of living cells. We
find that the selectivity of NTR uptake by FG domain films depends sensitively
on FG domain concentration, and that the interaction of NTRs with FG domains
obstructs NTR movement only moderately. These observations contribute important
information to better understand the mechanisms of selective NTR transport.

  media of various dimensions",,,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spontaneous emission, stimulated emission and absorption are the three
fundamental radiative processes describing light-matter interactions. Here, we
theoretically study the behaviour of these fundamental processes inside an
unbounded medium exhibiting a vanishingly small refractive index, i.e., a
near-zero-index (NZI) host medium. We present a generalized framework to study
these processes and find that the spatial dimension of the NZI medium has
profound effects on the nature of the fundamental radiative processes. Our
formalism highlights the role of the number of available optical modes as well
as the ability of an emitter to couple to these modes as a function of the
dimension and the class of NZI media. We demonstrate that the fundamental
radiative processes are inhibited in 3D homogeneous lossless zero index
materials but may be strongly enhanced in a zero index medium of reduced
dimensionality. Our findings have implications in thermal, nonlinear and
quantum optics as well as in designing quantum metamaterials at optical or

the rapidly evolving situation, alternative news media on the Internet have
given the events their own ideological spin. Such voices have been criticized
for furthering societal confusion and spreading potentially dangerous ""fake

to the second half of March 2020. Using computational content analysis,
methods, reach, interactions, actors, and topics of the messages were examined,
as well as the use of fabricated news and conspiracy theories. The analysis
revealed that the alternative news media stay true to message patterns and
ideological foundations identified in prior research. While they do not spread
obvious lies, they are predominantly sharing overly critical, even
anti-systemic messages, opposing the view of the mainstream news media and the
political establishment. With this pandemic populism, they contribute to a
contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview, as portrayed in detail in
this analysis.

the served rate and minimizing the total additional distance, subject to a
series of spatio-temporal constraints. Our problem can be distinguished from
existing work in three aspects: (1) Previous work did not fully explore the
impact of peak travel periods where the number of rider requests is much
greater than the number of available drivers. (2) Existing solutions usually
rely on single objective optimization techniques, such as minimizing the total
travel cost. (3) When evaluating the overall system performance, the runtime
spent on updating drivers' trip schedules as per incoming rider requests should
be incorporated, while it is excluded by most existing solutions. We propose an

(MAS) where norms are implicit, and participating agents use simplistic
decision-making mechanisms. These implicit norms are usually unconsciously
shared and adopted through agent interaction. A norm is deemed to have emerged
when a threshold or predetermined percentage of agents follow the ""norm"".
Conversely, in normative MAS, norms are typically explicit and agents
deliberately share norms through communication or are informed about norms by
an authority, following which an agent decides whether to adopt the norm or
not. The decision to adopt a norm by the agent can happen immediately after
recognition or when an applicable situation arises. In this paper, we make the
case that, similarly, a norm has emerged in a normative MAS when a percentage
of agents adopt the norm. Furthermore, we posit that agents themselves can and
should be involved in norm synthesis, and hence influence the norms governing
the MAS, in line with Ostrom's eight principles. Consequently, we put forward a
framework for the emergence of norms within a normative MAS, that allows
participating agents to propose/request changes to the normative system, while
special-purpose synthesizer agents formulate new norms or revisions in response
to these requests. Synthesizers must collectively agree that the new norm or
norm revision should proceed, and then finally be approved by an ""Oracle"". The
normative system is then modified to incorporate the norm.

road network is essential to many location-based services. Road networks are
dynamic in the sense that the weights of the edges in the corresponding graph
constantly change over time, representing evolving traffic conditions. Very
often such services have to process numerous KSP queries over large road
networks at the same time, thus there is a pressing need to identify
distributed solutions for this problem. However, most existing approaches are
designed to identify KSPs on a static graph in a sequential manner (i.e., the
(i+1)-th shortest path is generated based on the i-th shortest path),
restricting their scalability and applicability in a distributed setting. We
therefore propose KSP-DG, a distributed algorithm for identifying k-shortest
paths in a dynamic graph. It is based on partitioning the entire graph into
smaller subgraphs, and reduces the problem of determining KSPs into the
computation of partial KSPs in relevant subgraphs, which can execute in
parallel on a cluster of servers. A distributed two-level index called DTLP is
developed to facilitate the efficient identification of relevant subgraphs. A
salient feature of DTLP is that it indexes a set of virtual paths that are
insensitive to varying traffic conditions, leading to very low maintenance cost
in dynamic road networks. This is the first treatment of the problem of
processing KSP queries over dynamic road networks. Extensive experiments
conducted on real road networks confirm the superiority of our proposal over
baseline methods.

decomposition, has been extensively utilized in many applications that involve
higher-order tensors. Popular methods for low multilinear rank approximation
usually rely directly on matrix SVD, therefore often suffer from the notorious
intermediate data explosion issue and are not easy to parallelize, especially
when the input tensor is large. In this paper, we propose a new class of
truncated HOSVD algorithms based on alternating least squares (ALS) for
efficiently computing the low multilinear rank approximation of tensors. The
proposed ALS-based approaches are able to eliminate the redundant computations
of the singular vectors of intermediate matrices and are therefore free of data
explosion. Also, the new methods are more flexible with adjustable convergence
tolerance and are intrinsically parallelizable on high-performance computers.
Theoretical analysis reveals that the ALS iteration in the proposed algorithms
is q-linear convergent with a relatively wide convergence region. Numerical
experiments with large-scale tensors from both synthetic and real-world
applications demonstrate that ALS-based methods can substantially reduce the
total cost of the original ones and are highly scalable for parallel computing.

imputation methods that address this problem exist, there is still much room
for improvement. In this study, we examined single imputation based on deep
autoencoders, motivated by the apparent success of deep learning to efficiently
extract useful dataset features. We have developed a consistent framework for
both training and imputation. Moreover, we benchmarked the results against
state-of-the-art imputation methods on different data sizes and
characteristics. The work was not limited to the one-type variable dataset; we
also imputed missing data with multi-type variables, e.g., a combination of
binary, categorical, and continuous attributes. To evaluate the imputation
methods, we randomly corrupted the complete data, with varying degrees of
corruption, and then compared the imputed and original values. In all
experiments, the developed autoencoder obtained the smallest error for all
ranges of initial data corruption.

the Hall viscosity tensor contains a contribution that is singular at low
momentum, which encodes corrections to pressure induced by an external shear
strain. Due to this contribution, the Hall viscosity cannot be extracted from
the Hall conductivity in spite of Galilean symmetry. For mixed-dimensional

conversations following the data-driven paradigm. As such, a reliable training
corpus is the crux of building a robust and well-behaved dialogue model.
However, due to the open-ended nature of human conversations, the quality of
user-generated training data varies greatly, and effective training samples are
typically insufficient while noisy samples frequently appear. This impedes the
learning of those data-driven neural dialogue models. Therefore, effective
dialogue learning requires not only more reliable learning samples, but also
fewer noisy samples. In this paper, we propose a data manipulation framework to
proactively reshape the data distribution towards reliable samples by
augmenting and highlighting effective learning samples as well as reducing the
effect of inefficient samples simultaneously. In particular, the data
manipulation model selectively augments the training samples and assigns an
importance weight to each instance to reform the training data. Note that, the
proposed data manipulation framework is fully data-driven and learnable. It not
only manipulates training samples to optimize the dialogue generation model,
but also learns to increase its manipulation skills through gradient descent
with validation samples. Extensive experiments show that our framework can
improve the dialogue generation performance with respect to various automatic
evaluation metrics and human judgments.

determined by solutions of the Dirichlet problem on compact convex polygons for
a class of Monge-Amp\`ere equations. We settle a number or outstanding open
questions for this infinite class functionals. In particular we prove a
complete classification of the regularity of minimizers, also known as height
functions, for all dimer models for a natural class of polygonal (simply or
multiply connected) domains much studied in numerical simulations and
elsewhere. Our classification in particular implies that the Pokrovsky-Talapov
law holds for all dimer models at a generic point on the frozen boundary and in
addition shows a very strong local rigidity of dimer models which can be
interpreted as a geometric universality result. Furthermore, we give a complete
classification of the regularity of the associated free boundary, also known in
the literature as frozen boundary or arctic curves and prove that they are all
algebraic curves. The lack of differentiability of the functionals is
intimately connected to the boundary behaviour of the solutions to the
Monge-Amp\`ere equations and we prove a complete classification for these, of
independent interest.

they can spread the disease much longer, and this increases the COVID-19 $R_0$

observe a tendency that folk music exhibits lower fractal dimensions than

as single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), transition metal dichalcogenides, and
2D perovskite quantum wells. They possess extremely large binding energies
(>100~meV), dominating absorption and emission spectra even at high
temperatures. The large binding energies imply that they are stable, that is,
hard to ionize, rendering them seemingly unsuited for optoelectronic devices
that require mobile charge carriers, especially terahertz emitters and solar
cells. Here, we have conducted terahertz emission and photocurrent studies on
films of aligned single-chirality semiconducting SWCNTs and find that excitons
autoionize, i.e., spontaneously dissociate into electrons and holes. This
process naturally occurs ultrafast (<1~ps) while conserving energy and
momentum. The created carriers can then be accelerated to emit a burst of
terahertz radiation when a dc bias is applied, with promising efficiency in
comparison to standard GaAs-based emitters. Furthermore, at high bias, the
accelerated carriers acquire high enough kinetic energy to create secondary
excitons through impact exciton generation, again in a fully energy and
momentum conserving fashion. This exciton multiplication process leads to a
nonlinear photocurrent increase as a function of bias. Our theoretical
simulations based on nonequilibrium Boltzmann transport equations, taking into
account all possible scattering pathways and a realistic band structure,
reproduce all our experimental data semi-quantitatively. These results not only
elucidate the momentum-dependent ultrafast dynamics of excitons and carriers in
SWCNTs but also suggest promising routes toward terahertz excitonics despite
the orders-of-magnitude mismatch between the exciton binding energies and the
terahertz photon energies.

idea to identify all electron-beam subsets with low-polarization and to filter
them out by an X-shaped slit placed right behind the plasma accelerator. To
find these subsets we investigate the dependence between the initial azimuthal
angle and the spin of single electrons during the trapping process. This
dependence shows that transverse electron spins preserve their orientation
during injection if they are initially aligned parallel or anti-parallel to the
local magnetic field. We derive a precise correlation of the local beam
polarization as a function of the coordinate and the electron phase angle.
Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, incorporating classical spin
dynamics, show that the beam polarization can be increased from 35% to about
80% after spin filtering. The injected flux is strongly restricted to preserve
the beam polarization, e.g. <1kA in Ref.[27]. This limitation is removed by
employing the proposed filter mechanism. The robust of the method is discussed
that contains drive beam fluctuations, jitters, the thickness of the filter and
initial temperature. This idea marks an efficient and simple strategy to

One current
focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic
efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially
unknown. It is therefore challenging to discover a successful treatment to be
approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological
processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS)
that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These
include why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of
H2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why
the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant
doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced
in the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in
phagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification
mechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions
enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological
functions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling
molecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands
of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold
in phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the
stratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling
molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can
cause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and
cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of
invading pathogens such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), cancer and other

halos with masses above a certain threshold tend to be preferentially aligned
perpendicular to the hosting large-scale filaments, while low-mass halos tend
to have their spin axes aligned parallel to such structures. Extensive work has
so far been conducted to understand this phenomenon under the assumption of
cold dark matter and suggested that its origin should be closely related to the
nonlinear evolution of the halo angular momentum in the anisotropic cosmic web.
We present, for the first time, a numerical examination of this phenomenon

dependence of the threshold mass for the spin flip on the total neutrino mass.
Our physical explanation is that the presence of more massive neutrinos retard
the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic web, which in turn allows the halo spin
vectors to better retain their memories of the initial tidal interactions in
the nonlinear regime. Our finding implies that the statistical alignment of
halo spins with the large-scale structures can be in principle used as a probe
of the total neutrino mass.

explained in a comprehensive model, based on two magnetic sublattices and
taking into account magnetic field-induced modifications of the domain

$\times$ 10$^5$ $\frac{\hbar}{2e}$ $\Omega^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$) is found to be
superior to values reported for other TMDs. The origin of this large
damping-like SOT can be found in the interfacial properties of the TaS$_2$/Py
heterostructure, and the experimental findings are complemented by the results
from density functional theory calculations. The dominance of damping-like
torque demonstrated in our study provides a promising path for designing next
generation conducting TMD based low-powered quantum memory devices.

accelerators up to the PeV range, and therefore, to potentially play an
important role in the overall Galactic cosmic-ray population. The TeV gamma-ray
domain can be used to study particle acceleration in the multi-TeV and PeV
range. This motivates the study of the detectability of such supernovae by
current and future gamma-ray facilities. The gamma-ray emission of
core-collapse supernovae strongly depends on the level of the two-photon
annihilation process: high-energy gamma-ray photons emitted at the expanding
shock wave following the supernova explosion can interact with soft photons
from the supernova photosphere through the pair production channel, thereby
strongly suppressing the flux of gamma rays leaving the system. In the case of
SN 1993J, whose photospheric and shock-related parameters are well measured, we
calculate the temporal evolution of the expected gamma-ray attenuation by
accounting for the temporal and geometrical effects. We find the attenuation to
be of about $10$ orders of magnitude in the first few days after the SN
explosion. The probability of detection of a supernova similar to SN 1993J with
the Cherenkov Telescope Array is highest if observations are performed either
earlier than 1 day, or later than 10 days after the explosion, when the
gamma-ray attenuation decreases to about $2$ orders of magnitude.

minimum velocity of water vapor in the jets is determined from the narrowest
observed individual jet profile: it ranges from 800 m/s to 1.8 km/s for the
UVIS occultation observations. 41 individual jets were required to fit the
highest resolution UVIS dataset taken during the Solar occultation however, an
alternative larger set of linearly-dependent jets can not be excluded without
invoking additional preferably unrelated data from other instruments. A smaller
number of jets is required to fit the stellar occultation data because of their
spatial resolution and geometry. We identify a set of 37 jets that were

details of shape. Here we address the question of particle shape sensitivity
for the self-assembly of hard pear-shaped particles, by studying two models for
this system: a) the pear hard Gaussian overlap (PHGO) and b) hard pears of
revolution (HPR) model. Hard pear-shaped particles, given by the PHGO model,
are known to form a bicontinuous gyroid phase spontaneously. However, this
model does not replicate an additive object perfectly and, hence, varies
slightly in shape from a ""true"" pear-shape. Therefore, we investigate in the
first part of this series the stability of the gyroid phase in pear-shaped
particle systems. We show based on the HPR phase diagram that the gyroid phase
does not form in pears with such ""true"" hard pear-shaped potential. Moreover,
we acquire first indications from the HPR and PHGO pair-correlation functions
that the formation of the gyroid is probably attributed to the small
non-additive properties of the PHGO potential.

are induced by the interplay between coherent quantum and incoherent classical
fluctuations. Here, we investigate the crossover from a quantum to a classical
absorbing phase transition arising in the quantum contact process (QCP). The
Lindblad equation contains two parameters, $\omega$ and $\kappa$, which adjust
the contributions of the quantum and classical effects, respectively. We find
that in one dimension when the QCP starts from a homogeneous state with all
active sites, there exists a critical line in the region $0 \le \kappa <
\kappa_*$ along which the exponent $\alpha$ (which is associated with the
density of active sites) decreases continuously from a quantum to the classical
directed percolation (DP) value. This behavior suggests that the quantum
coherent effect remains to some extent near $\kappa=0$. However, when the QCP
in one dimension starts from a heterogeneous state with all inactive sites
except for one active site, all the critical exponents have the classical DP
values for $\kappa \ge 0$. In two dimensions, anomalous crossover behavior does
not occur, and classical DP behavior appears in the entire region of $\kappa
\ge 0$ regardless of the initial configuration. Neural network machine learning
is used to identify the critical line and determine the correlation length
exponent. Numerical simulations using the quantum jump Monte Carlo technique
and tensor network method are performed to determine all the other critical
exponents of the QCP.

Identifying the composition of scenes serves as a critical step towards

scenes in movies usually contain much richer temporal structures and more
complex semantic information. Towards this goal, we scale up the scene
segmentation task by building a large-scale video dataset MovieScenes, which

local-to-global scene segmentation framework, which integrates multi-modal

is able to distill complex semantics from hierarchical temporal structures over
a long movie, providing top-down guidance for scene segmentation. Our
experiments show that the proposed network is able to segment a movie into
scenes with high accuracy, consistently outperforming previous methods. We also
found that pretraining on our MovieScenes can bring significant improvements to

and is prohibitive to scale up. In this paper, we propose Attribute Mix, a data
augmentation strategy at attribute level to expand the fine-grained samples.
The principle lies in that attribute features are shared among fine-grained
sub-categories, and can be seamlessly transferred among images. Toward this
goal, we propose an automatic attribute mining approach to discover attributes
that belong to the same super-category, and Attribute Mix is operated by mixing
semantically meaningful attribute features from two images. Attribute Mix is a
simple but effective data augmentation strategy that can significantly improve
the recognition performance without increasing the inference budgets.
Furthermore, since attributes can be shared among images from the same

theoretical and practical roles. The article discusses experiences of training
neural networks to classify univariate empirical distributions and to represent
them on the two-dimensional latent space forcing disentanglement based on the
inputs of cumulative distribution functions (CDF). The latent space
representation has been performed using an unsupervised beta variational
autoencoder (beta-VAE). It separates distributions of different shapes while
overlapping similar ones and empirically realises relationships between
distributions that are known theoretically. The synthetic experiment of
generated univariate continuous and discrete (Bernoulli) distributions with
varying sample sizes and parameters has been performed to support the study.
The representation on the latent two-dimensional coordinate system can be seen
as an additional metadata of the real-world data that disentangles important
distribution characteristics, such as shape of the CDF, classification
probabilities of underlying theoretical distributions and their parameters,
information entropy, and skewness. Entropy changes, providing an ""arrow of
time"", determine dynamic trajectories along representations of distributions on
the latent space. In addition, post beta-VAE unsupervised segmentation of the
latent space based on weight-of-evidence (WOE) of posterior versus standard
isotopic two-dimensional normal densities has been applied detecting the
presence of assignable causes that distinguish exceptional CDF inputs.

approach, it is computationally independent of the number of people in the
scene. Furthermore, even though the computational burden of the 2D part scales
linearly with the number of input views, the overall architecture is able to
exploit a very lightweight 2D backbone which is orders of magnitude faster than

maps an entire 3D scene to a set of 3D object centers. As we assume the scene

world as we know it at the end of the 2nd decade of the 21st century. COVID-19
is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early
diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health
care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition
and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test,
however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity.
Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal
specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung
infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging.
Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural
Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs,
however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and
require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework
based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of
handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and

with a pure power-law distribution ($M_* \rightarrow \infty$). M51 is the only
galaxy that shows some evidence for an upper cutoff ($M_*$) in both

well-defined and stable. The vacuum expectation value of the square of the
field is not constant unless either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions

values approach the same well-known limit on the space-time boundary

Some minor discrepancies are encountered, mainly in the high luminosity regime,
where the EAGLE-SKIRT luminosity functions mildly but systematically
underestimate the observed ones. The agreement between the EAGLE-SKIRT infrared
luminosity functions and the observed ones gradually worsens with increasing
lookback time. Fitting modified Schechter functions to the EAGLE-SKIRT
luminosity and dust mass functions at different redshifts up to $z=1$, we find
that the evolution is compatible with pure luminosity/mass evolution. The
evolution is relatively mild: within this redshift range, we find an evolution
of $L_{\star,250}\propto(1+z)^{1.68}$,
$L_{\star,\text{TIR}}\propto(1+z)^{2.51}$ and
$M_{\star,\text{dust}}\propto(1+z)^{0.83}$ for the characteristic
luminosity/mass. For the luminosity/mass density we find
$\varepsilon_{250}\propto(1+z)^{1.62}$,
$\varepsilon_{\text{TIR}}\propto(1+z)^{2.35}$ and
$\rho_{\text{dust}}\propto(1+z)^{0.80}$, respectively. The mild evolution of
the dust mass density is in relatively good agreement with observations, but
the slow evolution of the infrared luminosity underestimates the observed
luminosity evolution significantly. We argue that these differences can be
attributed to increasing limitations in the radiative transfer treatment due to
increasingly poorer resolution, combined with a slower than observed evolution
of the SFR density in the EAGLE simulation and the lack of AGN emission in our
EAGLE-SKIRT post-processing recipe.

combines the CNN likelihood to be a lens and the human score resulting from
visual inspection (P-value) and we present here the highest 82 ranked
candidates with P-values $\ge 0.5$. All these high-quality candidates have
obvious arc or point-like features around the central red defector. Moreover,
we define the best 26 objects, all with scores P-values $\ge 0.7$ as a ""golden

positives and thus it is suitable for follow-up observations. The new lens
candidates come partially from the the more extended footprint adopted here
with respect to the previous analyses, partially from a larger predictive
sample (also including the BG sample). These results show that machine learning
tools are very promising to find strong lenses in large surveys and more
candidates that can be found by enlarging the predictive samples beyond the
standard assumption of LRGs. In the future, we plan to apply our CNN to the

rise to a 3D-1D coupled problem. Such problem poses several challenges from the
standpoint of existence of solutions and numerical approximation. For the
coupling conditions across dimensions, we consider the combination of essential
and natural conditions, basically the combination of Dirichlet and Neumann

Lagrange multiplier method, suitably adapted to the mixed dimensional case. The
well posedness of the resulting saddle point problem is analyzed. Then, we

the purpose to determine a good balance between the mathematical properties of
the discrete problem and flexibility of implementation of the numerical scheme.

wind resources at higher altitudes which are not accessible to conventional

of time without manual intervention while being exposed to varying wind
conditions. In the present work a methodology is presented, which augments an
existing baseline controller with a prediction and prevention methodology to
improve the resilience of the controller against these external disturbances.
In the first part of the framework, upset conditions are systematically
generated in which the given controller is no longer able to achieve its
objectives. In the second part, the generated knowledge is used to synthesize a
model that predicts upsets beforehand. Eventually, this allows to trigger an
avoidance maneuver which keeps the AWE system operational, however, leads to a
lower power production. The methodology is applied to the specific case of
tether rupture prediction and prevention. Simulation results are used to
demonstrate that the presented methodology leads indeed to a predictable
economic benefit over systems without the proposed baseline controller

radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking,

the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the

show a spatial correlation between the surface topography and basement fault

top of the gravity highs (horsts) and lows (grabens). The geodynamic model
suggests that conjugate thrust faults may exist beneath the horsts that push
the horst block upward. Our observations suggest the regional compression and

with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), these learning models empower numerous
useful applications, e.g., image processing, speech recognition, healthcare,
vehicular network and many more. Traditionally, Machine Learning (ML)
approaches require data to be centralised in cloud-based data-centres. However,
this data is often large in quantity and privacy-sensitive which prevents
logging into these data-centres for training the learning models. In turn, this
results in critical issues of high latency and communication inefficiency.
Recently, in light of new privacy legislations in many countries, the concept
of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, mobile users are
empowered to learn a global model by aggregating their local models, without
sharing the privacy-sensitive data. Usually, these mobile users have slow
network connections to the data-centre where the global model is maintained.
Moreover, in a complex and large scale network, heterogeneous devices that have
various energy constraints are involved. This raises the challenge of
communication cost when implementing FL at large scale. To this end, in this
research, we begin with the fundamentals of FL, and then, we highlight the

vulnerability of its inhabitants. As an application, we discuss the case of
COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. We characterize each of the twenty Italian regions
by using available historical data on air pollution, human mobility, winter
temperature, housing concentration, health care density, population size and
age. We find that the epidemic risk is higher in some of the Northern regions
with respect to Central and Southern Italy. The corresponding risk index shows
correlations with the available official data on the number of infected
individuals, patients in intensive care and deceased patients, and can help
explaining why regions such as Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto
have suffered much more than the rest of the country. Although the COVID-19
outbreak started in both North (Lombardia) and Central Italy (Lazio) almost at

coordination protocols that protect agents' sensitive information while
allowing them to collaborate. To help address this need, this paper presents a
differentially private formation control framework. Agents' state trajectories
are protected using differential privacy, which is a statistical notion of
privacy that protects data by adding noise to it. We provide a private
formation control implementation and analyze the impact of privacy upon the
system. Specifically, we quantify tradeoffs between privacy level, system
performance, and connectedness of the network's communication topology. These
tradeoffs are used to develop guidelines for calibrating privacy in terms of
control theoretic quantities, such as steady-state error, without requiring
in-depth knowledge of differential privacy. Additional guidelines are also
developed for treating privacy levels and network topologies as design
parameters to tune the network's performance. Simulation results illustrate
these tradeoffs and show that strict privacy is inherently compatible with
strong system performance.

important impact on multi-source information fusion in an environment of

presents a new framework named network adjustment, which considers network
accuracy as a function of FLOPs, so that under each network configuration, one
can estimate the FLOPs utilization ratio (FUR) for each layer and use it to
determine whether to increase or decrease the number of channels on the layer.
Note that FUR, like the gradient of a non-linear function, is accurate only in
a small neighborhood of the current network. Hence, we design an iterative
mechanism so that the initial network undergoes a number of steps, each of
which has a small `adjusting rate' to control the changes to the network. The
computational overhead of the entire search process is reasonable, i.e.,
comparable to that of re-training the final model from scratch. Experiments on

different scenarios for the number of UAVs: (i) single UAV scenario (SUS), and
(ii) multiple UAV scenario (MUS). For each scenario, we model UAV wobbling by
two random processes, i.e., the Wiener and sinusoidal processes, and
characterize the channel autocorrelation function (ACF) which is then used to
derive the coherence time of the channel. For the MUS, we further show that the
UAV-UE channels for different UAVs are uncorrelated from each other. A key
observation in this paper is that even for small UAV wobbling, the coherence
time of the channel may degrade quickly, which may make it difficult to track
the channel and establish a reliable communication link.

framework for precision medicine. The goal is to assign proper treatments to
patients based on their individual characteristics. From the machine learning
perspective, the solution to an ITR problem can be formulated as a weighted
classification problem to maximize the average benefit that patients receive
from the recommended treatments. Several methods have been proposed for ITR in
both binary and multicategory treatment setups. In practice, one may prefer a
more flexible recommendation with multiple treatment options. This motivates us
to develop methods to obtain a set of near-optimal individualized treatment
recommendations alternative to each other, called alternative individualized
treatment recommendations (A-ITR). We propose two methods to estimate the
optimal A-ITR within the outcome weighted learning (OWL) framework. We show the
consistency of these methods and obtain an upper bound for the risk between the
theoretically optimal recommendation and the estimated one. We also conduct
simulation studies, and apply our methods to a real data set for Type 2
diabetic patients with injectable antidiabetic treatments. These numerical

increase image resolution, for example by encoding differences in FUIF and JPEG

ratio - both for lossless compression and e.g. DC coefficients of lossy.
However, the currently used solutions rather do not exploit context dependence
for encoding of such upscaling information. This article discusses simple
inexpensive general techniques for this purpose, which allowed to save on
average $0.645$ bits/difference (between $0.138$ and $1.489$) for the last
upscaling for 48 standard $512\times 512$ grayscale 8 bit images - compared to
assumption of fixed Laplace distribution. Using least squares linear regression
of context to predict center of Laplace distribution gave on average $0.393$
bits/difference savings. The remaining savings were obtained by additionally
predicting width of this Laplace distribution, also using just the least
squares linear regression.
  For RGB images, optimization of color transform alone gave mean $\approx
4.6\%$ size reduction comparing to standard YCrCb if using fixed transform,
$\approx 6.3\%$ if optimizing transform individually for each image. Then
further mean $\approx 10\%$ reduction was obtained if predicting Laplace
parameters based on context. The presented simple inexpensive general
methodology can be also used for different types of data like DCT coefficients
in lossy image compression.

we reconsider possible Lorentz style transformations between tachyon observers

following from a straightforward argument based on relative motion as a Lie
group. The result is novel in that it requires the time direction to be
reversed for tachyon observers. We use this result to find the transformation
between supra luminal observers.
  An extended discussion {\it speculates} concerning physical evidence for, and
consequences of, a supra luminal regime dual to the sub space luminal regime.
It appears that supra luminal particles are likely to be of very low energy and
hence be difficult to detect. However, their momentum may be significant
depending on their asymptotic mass. Tachyons are candidates for astronomical
'dark matter' and perhaps vacuum energy as manifested in the cosmological
constant. Quantum tachyons might be detected as periodic variations in Casimir
type measurements corresponding to their De Broglie wavelength. We suggest that
supra luminal and sub luminal particles can be entangled at both Cauchy and
event horizons, so that transitions may be possible for quantum particles.

in parallel with the x-vector, also a diagonal precision matrix, thus providing
a path for the propagation of information about the quality of the speech
segment into a PLDA scoring backend. These precisions quantify the uncertainty
about what the values of the embeddings might have been if they had been

We compute the full PLDA likelihood 'by the book' for each clustering

performance of the E2E model, the locality and temporal sequential properties
of speech should be efficiently taken into account when modelling. However, in
most current E2E models for SE, these properties are either not fully
considered or are too complex to be realized. In this paper, we propose an
efficient E2E SE model, termed WaveCRN. In WaveCRN, the speech locality feature
is captured by a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the temporal
sequential property of the locality feature is modeled by stacked simple
recurrent units (SRU). Unlike a conventional temporal sequential model that
uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is difficult to
parallelize, SRU can be efficiently parallelized in calculation with even fewer
model parameters. In addition, in order to more effectively suppress the noise
components in the input noisy speech, we derive a novel restricted feature
masking (RFM) approach that performs enhancement on the feature maps in the
hidden layers; this is different from the approach that applies the estimated
ratio mask on the noisy spectral features, which is commonly used in speech
separation methods. Experimental results on speech denoising and compressed
speech restoration tasks confirm that with the lightweight architecture of SRU
and the feature-mapping-based RFM, WaveCRN performs comparably with other
state-of-the-art approaches with notably reduced model complexity and inference

because of the numerous services they provide. On the other hand, they require
considerable computing power. To satisfy these requirements, it is possible to
use graphic processing units (GPUs). However, high power consumption and
limited external IOs constrain their usability and suitability in industrial
and mission-critical scenarios. Recently, the number of researches that utilize
FPGAs to implement CNNs are increasing rapidly. This is due to the lower power
consumption and easy reconfigurability offered by these platforms. Because of
the research efforts put into topics such as architecture, synthesis and
optimization, some new challenges are arising to integrate such hardware
solutions to high-level machine learning software libraries. This paper
introduces an integrated framework (CNN2Gate) that supports compilation of a
CNN model for an FPGA target. CNN2Gate exploits the OpenCL synthesis workflow
for FPGAs offered by commercial vendors. CNN2Gate is capable of parsing CNN
models from several popular high-level machine learning libraries such as
Keras, Pytorch, Caffe2 etc. CNN2Gate extracts computation flow of layers, in
addition to weights and biases and applies a ""given"" fixed-point quantization.
Furthermore, it writes this information in the proper format for OpenCL
synthesis tools that are then used to build and run the project on FPGA.
CNN2Gate performs design-space exploration using a reinforcement learning agent
and fits the design on different FPGAs with limited logic resources
automatically. This paper reports results of automatic synthesis and
design-space exploration of AlexNet and VGG-16 on various Intel FPGA platforms.
CNN2Gate achieves a latency of 205 ms for VGG-16 and 18 ms for AlexNet on the

Initiation of chemical reactions occurs at hot spots due to energy localization
at sites of porosities and other defects. Emerging multi-scale predictive
models of HE response to loads account for the physics at the meso-scale, i.e.
at the scale of statistically representative clusters of particles and other
features in the microstructure. Meso-scale physics is infused in
machine-learned closure models informed by resolved meso-scale simulations.
Since microstructures are stochastic, ensembles of meso-scale simulations are
required to quantify hot spot ignition and growth and to develop models for
microstructure-dependent energy deposition rates. We propose utilizing
generative adversarial networks (GAN) to spawn ensembles of synthetic
heterogeneous energetic material microstructures. The method generates
qualitatively and quantitatively realistic microstructures by learning from
images of HE microstructures. We show that the proposed GAN method also permits
the generation of new morphologies, where the porosity distribution can be
controlled and spatially manipulated. Such control paves the way for the design
of novel microstructures to engineer HE materials for targeted performance in a

strength $\lambda$ can be extracted directly from the thermal attenuation
(Debye-Waller factor) of Helium atom scattering reflectivity. This theory is
here extended to multivalley semimetal systems and applied to the case of
graphene on different metal substrates and graphite. It is shown that $\lambda$
rapidly increases for decreasing graphene-substrate binding strength. Two
different calculational models are considered which produce qualitatively
similar results for the dependence of $\lambda$ on binding strength. These
models predict, respectively, values of $\lambda_{HAS} = 0.89$ and 0.32 for a
hypothetical flat free-standing single-layer graphene with cyclic boundary
conditions. The method is suitable for analysis and characterization of not
only the graphene overlayers considered here, but also other layered systems

State of the art methods use deep neural networks to predict semantic classes

measurements is to use two-dimensional, image-like projections. In this work,
we perform a comprehensive experimental study of image-based semantic
segmentation architectures for LiDAR point clouds. We demonstrate various
techniques to boost the performance and to improve runtime as well as memory
constraints.
  First, we examine the effect of network size and suggest that much faster
inference times can be achieved at a very low cost to accuracy. Next, we
introduce an improved point cloud projection technique that does not suffer
from systematic occlusions. We use a cyclic padding mechanism that provides
context at the horizontal field-of-view boundaries. In a third part, we perform
experiments with a soft Dice loss function that directly optimizes for the
intersection-over-union metric. Finally, we propose a new kind of convolution
layer with a reduced amount of weight-sharing along one of the two spatial
dimensions, addressing the large difference in appearance along the vertical
axis of a LiDAR scan. We propose a final set of the above methods with which
the model achieves an increase of 3.2% in mIoU segmentation performance over
