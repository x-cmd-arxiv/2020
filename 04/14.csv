disk obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). The disk is detected in
total and polarized intensity down to a projected angular separation of 0.15"",
or 20au. On the other hand, the large scale swept-back halo remains undetected,
likely a consequence of its markedly blue color relative to the parent body
belt. We analyze the curvature of the disk spine and estimate a radius of
$\approx$100au for the parent body belt, smaller than past scattered light
studies but consistent with thermal emission maps of the system. We employ
three different flux-preserving post-processing methods to suppress the
residual starlight and evaluate the surface brightness and polarization profile
along the disk spine. Unlike past studies of the system, our high fidelity
images reveal the disk to be highly symmetric and devoid of morphological and
surface brightness perturbations. We find the dust scattering properties of the
system to be consistent with those observed in other debris disks, with the
exception of HR 4796. Finally, we find no direct evidence for the presence of a
planetary-mass object in the system.

worldwide. We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out
jointly in test-settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative
case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only demands
collecting information about potential risk factors for COVID-19 from the
tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with
population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population
controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that
test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population
controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic
persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory
infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal
magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be
identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to
compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional
case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups:
one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn
from existing country-wide health care databases. We also describe other
possibilities for population controls. Combining the TND with population
controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes between exposures
that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, and
exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19. This combined design can be
applied to future epidemics, but also to study causes of non-epidemic disease.

aggregates in the sub-kelvin He environment, providing the following insight
into their structure: The molecules in the dopant cluster are loosely bound van

work reveals a Penning process stemming from the n = 4 band where
charge-transfer from autoionized He in the droplets is known to be the dominant
relaxation channel. This allows for excited states of the remnant dopant
oligomer Penning-ions to be studied. Hence, we demonstrate Penning ionization
electron spectroscopy of doped droplets as an effective technique for
investigating dopant oligomers which are easily formed by attachment to the

in 1946, using a non-constructive parity argument, that such a second
Hamiltonian cycle always exists. Our main result is an algorithm which computes
the second Hamiltonian cycle in time $O(n \cdot 2^{(0.3-\varepsilon)n})$ time,
for some positive constant $\varepsilon>0$, and in polynomial space, thus
improving the state of the art running time for solving this problem. Our
algorithm is based on a fundamental structural property of Thomason's lollipop
algorithm, which we prove here for the first time. In the direction of
approximating the length of a second cycle in a Hamiltonian graph $G$ with a
given Hamiltonian cycle $C_0$ (where we may not have guarantees on the
existence of a second Hamiltonian cycle), we provide a linear-time algorithm
computing a second cycle with length at least $n - 4\alpha

$\delta,\Delta$ are the minimum and the maximum degree of the graph,
respectively. This approximation result also improves the state of the art.

prone to failure due to the scarce of unlabeled target data. To this end, we
propose a novel Adversarial Style Mining approach, which combines the style
transfer module and task-specific module into an adversarial manner.
Specifically, the style transfer module iteratively searches for harder
stylized images around the one-shot target sample according to the current
learning state, leading the task model to explore the potential styles that are
difficult to solve in the almost unseen target domain, thus boosting the
adaptation performance in a data-scarce scenario. The adversarial learning
framework makes the style transfer module and task-specific module benefit each

this methodology with the classic Kuramoto phase oscillator model, and
demonstrate how our manifold learning technique can successfully identify a
coarse variable that is one-to-one with the established Kuramoto order
parameter. We then introduce an extension of our coarse-graining methodology
which enables us to learn evolution equations for the discovered coarse
variables via an artificial neural network architecture templated on numerical
time integrators (initial value solvers). This approach allows us to learn
accurate approximations of time derivatives of state variables from sparse flow
data, and hence discover useful approximate differential equation descriptions
of their dynamic behavior. We demonstrate this capability by learning ODEs that
agree with the known analytical expression for the Kuramoto order parameter
dynamics at the continuum limit. We then show how this approach can also be
used to learn the dynamics of coarse variables discovered through our manifold
learning methodology. In both of these examples, we compare the results of our
neural network based method to typical finite differences complemented with
geometric harmonics. Finally, we present a series of computational examples
illustrating how a variation of our manifold learning methodology can be used
to discover sets of ""effective"" parameters, reduced parameter combinations, for
multi-parameter models with complex coupling. We conclude with a discussion of
possible extensions of this approach, including the possibility of obtaining
data-driven effective partial differential equations for coarse-grained
neuronal network behavior.

  Interaction Effect","72 pages in total, 12 figures",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mediation analysis serves as a crucial tool to obtain causal inference based
on directed acyclic graphs, which has been widely employed in the areas of
biomedical science, social science, epidemiology and psychology. Decomposition
of total effect provides a deep insight to fully understand the casual
contribution from each path and interaction term. Since the four-way
decomposition method was proposed to identify the mediated interaction effect
in counterfactual framework, the idea had been extended to a more sophisticated
scenario with non-sequential multiple mediators. However, the method exhibits
limitations as the causal structure contains direct causal edges between
mediators, such as inappropriate modeling of dependence and
non-identifiability. We develop the notion of natural counterfactual
interaction effect and find that the decomposition of total effect can be
consistently realized with our proposed notion. Furthermore, natural
counterfactual interaction effect overcomes the drawbacks and possesses a clear
and significant interpretation, which may largely improve the capacity of
researchers to analyze highly complex causal structures.

In this contribution, the relative strange hadron production is enhanced with
increasing $R_{\rm {T}}$. This enhancement is significant for the strange

the embeddings of papers and repositories into the same space, where proximity

was implemented into a CFD code ANSYS-CFX. The model treats transport of heat
and electric current in the plasma and the electrodes in a coupled manner and
accounts for gas convection in the chamber. Multiple surface processes at the
electrodes are modeled, including the formation of space-charge limited
sheaths, ablation and deposition of carbon, emission and absorption of
radiation and electrons. The simulations show that the arc is constricted near
the cathode and the anode front surfaces leading to the formation of electrode
spots. The cathode spot is a well-known phenomenon and mechanisms of its
formation were reported elsewhere. However, the anode spot formation mechanism
discovered in this work was not reported before. We conclude that the spot
formation is not related to plasma instability, as commonly believed in case of
constricted discharge columns, but rather occurs due to the highly nonlinear
nature of heat balance in the anode. We additionally demonstrate this property
with a reduced anode heat transfer model. We also show that the spot size
increases with the arc current. This anode spot behavior was also confirmed in
our experiments. Due to the anode spot formation, a large gradient of carbon
gas density occurs near the anode, which drives a portion of the ablated carbon
back to the anode at its periphery. This can consequently reduce the total
ablation rate. Simulation results also show that the arc can reach local
chemical equilibrium (LCE) state in the column region while the local thermal
equilibrium (LTE) state is not typically achieved for experimental conditions.
It shows that it is important to account for different electron and gas
temperatures in the modeling of short carbon arcs.

analyses of social and environmental data. It allows spatial heterogeneities in
processes and relationships to be investigated through a series of local
regression models rather than a global one. Standard GWR assumes that the
relationships between the response and predictor variables operate at the same
spatial scale, which is frequently not the case. To address this, several GWR
variants have been proposed. This paper describes a route map to inform the
choice of whether to use a GWR model or not, and if so which of three core
variants to apply: a standard GWR, a mixed GWR or a multiscale GWR (MS-GWR).
The route map comprises primary steps: a basic linear regression, a MS-GWR, and
investigations of the results of these. The paper provides guidance for
deciding whether to use a GWR approach, and if so for determining the
appropriate GWR variant. It describes the importance of investigating a number
of secondary issues at global and local scales including collinearity, the
influence of outliers, and dependent error terms. Code and data for the case
study used to illustrate the route map are provided, and further considerations
are described in an extensive Appendix.

finite Gamma interaction remained unresolved. Here we focus on this parameter
region and find that there are two new phases, namely, a rank-1 ordered phase
with an $O_h\rightarrow D_3$ symmetry breaking, and a peculiar Kitaev phase.
Remarkably, the $O_h\rightarrow D_3$ symmetry breaking corresponds to the
classical magnetic order, but appears in a region very close to the
antiferromagnetic Kitaev point where the quantum fluctuations are presumably
very strong. In addition, a two-step symmetry breaking $O_h\rightarrow

increased: At short and intermediate length scales, the system behaves as
having a rank-2 spin nematic order with $O_h\rightarrow D_{3d}$ symmetry
breaking; and at long distances, time reversal symmetry is further broken
leading to the $O_h\rightarrow D_3$ symmetry breaking. Finally, there is no

of making reading comprehension models more robust to adversarial evaluation,
but also improving generalization to the source domain as well as new domains
and languages. We first propose three new methods for generating QA
adversaries, that introduce multiple points of confusion within the context,
show dependence on insertion location of the distractor, and reveal the
compounding effect of mixing adversarial strategies with syntactic and semantic
paraphrasing methods. Next, we find that augmenting the training datasets with
uniformly sampled adversaries improves robustness to the adversarial attacks
but leads to decline in performance on the original unaugmented dataset. We
address this issue via RL and more efficient Bayesian policy search methods for
automatically learning the best augmentation policy combinations of the
transformation probability for each adversary in a large search space. Using
these learned policies, we show that adversarial training can lead to
significant improvements in in-domain, out-of-domain, and cross-lingual
(German, Russian, Turkish) generalization.

promising future architecture in terms of minimizing energy consumption and
allocating resources efficiently by providing real-time cloud infrastructures,
cooperative radio, and centralized data processing. Recently, given their
vulnerability to malicious attacks, the security of C-RAN networks has
attracted significant attention. Among various anomaly-based intrusion
detection techniques, the most promising one is the machine learning-based
intrusion detection as it learns without human assistance and adjusts actions
accordingly. In this direction, many solutions have been proposed, but they
show either low accuracy in terms of attack classification or they offer just a
single layer of attack detection. This research focuses on deploying a
multi-stage machine learning-based intrusion detection (ML-IDS) in 5G C-RAN
that can detect and classify four types of jamming attacks: constant jamming,
random jamming, deceptive jamming, and reactive jamming. This deployment
enhances security by minimizing the false negatives in C-RAN architectures. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed solution is carried out using WSN-DS
(Wireless Sensor Networks DataSet), which is a dedicated wireless dataset for
intrusion detection. The final classification accuracy of attacks is 94.51\%
with a 7.84\% false negative rate.

presents an unprecedented opportunity to follow its early evolution. The
suspected detection stems from an excess of infrared emission from a dust blob
near the compact object's predicted position. The infrared excess could be due
to the decay of isotopes like 44Ti, accretion luminosity from a neutron star or
black hole, magnetospheric emission or a wind originating from the spindown of
a pulsar, or thermal emission from an embedded, cooling neutron star (NS
1987A). It is shown that the last possibility is the most plausible as the
other explanations are disfavored by other observations and/or require
fine-tuning of parameters. Not only are there indications the dust blob
overlaps the predicted location of a kicked compact remnant, but its excess
luminosity also matches the expected thermal power of a 30 year old neutron
star. Furthermore, models of cooling neutron stars within the Minimal Cooling
paradigm readily fit both NS 1987A and Cas A, the next-youngest known neutron
star. If correct, a long heat transport timescale in the crust and a large
effective stellar temperature are favored, implying relatively limited crustal
n-1S0 superfluidity and an envelope with a thick layer of light elements,
respectively. If the locations don't overlap, then pulsar spindown or accretion
might be more likely, but the pulsar's period and magnetic field or the
accretion rate must be rather finely tuned. In this case, NS 1987A may have
enhanced cooling and/or a heavy-element envelope.

candidates for a wide range of applications, from anti-fouling and anti-icing
coatings to self-healing surfaces and controlled wetting. However, when exposed
to realistic environmental conditions, LIS tend to age and progressively lose
their desirable properties, potentially compromising their application. The
associated ageing mechanisms are still poorly understood, and results
reflecting real-life applications are scarce. Here we track the ageing of model
LIS composed of glass surfaces functionalized with hydrophobic nanoparticles
and infused with silicone oil. The LIS are fully submerged in aqueous solutions
and exposed to acoustic pressure waves for set time intervals. The ageing is
monitored by periodic measurements of the LIS' wetting properties. We also
track changes to the LIS' nanoscale structure. We find that the LIS rapidly
lose their slippery properties due to a combination of oil loss, smoothing of
the nanoporous functional layer and substrate degradation when directly exposed
to the solution. The oil loss is consistent with water microdroplets entering
the oil layer and displacing oil away from the surface. These mechanisms are
general and could play a role in the ageing of most LIS.

observed that the mean value and the relative width of the initial distribution
of the diffusion coefficients characterizing the individuals together with the
temporal fluctuations determine the final distribution of the diffusivities
(diffusion coefficients leading to the competition success) as well as the
final diversity of the system at finite time (the number of different diffusion

of niches forming in the system due to the competitive interactions. The
cluster formation is also associated to the competition success of the slower

sense the correlations between multiple uses of a channel at different moments

when the particle is sent at a definite time can exhibit correlations that
enable a perfect transmission of classical bits when the particle is sent at a
superposition of two times. In contrast, we show that, in the lack of
correlations, a single particle sent at a superposition of two times undergoes
an effective channel with classical capacity of at most 0.16 bits. When
multiple transmission lines are available, time correlations can be used to
simulate the application of quantum channels in a coherent superposition of

implements a selective $k$ encoding policy such that rather than encoding all

realizations. We consider three different policies regarding the remaining
$n-k$ less probable realizations: $highest$ $k$ $selective$ $encoding$ which
disregards whenever a realization from the remaining $n-k$ values occurs;
$randomized$ $selective$ $encoding$ which encodes and sends the remaining $n-k$

the expense of longer codewords for the selected $k$ realizations; and
$highest$ $k$ $selective$ $encoding$ $with$ $an$ $empty$ $symbol$ which sends a

mysteries in deep neural networks: (i) a nonsmooth activation function like
ReLU outperforms a smooth one like hyperbolic tangent; (ii) successful neural
network architectures rely on having many layers, even though a shallow network
can approximate any function arbitrary well. We performed extensive experiments
on the persistent homology of a wide range of point cloud data sets, both real
and simulated. The results consistently demonstrate the following: (1) Neural
networks operate by changing topology, transforming a topologically complicated
data set into a topologically simple one as it passes through the layers. No
matter how complicated the topology of $M$ we begin with, when passed through a
well-trained neural network $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^p$, there is a
vast reduction in the Betti numbers of both components $M_a$ and $M_b$; in fact
they nearly always reduce to their lowest possible values:
$\beta_k\bigl(f(M_i)\bigr) = 0$ for $k \ge 1$ and $\beta_0\bigl(f(M_i)\bigr) =
1$, $i =a, b$. Furthermore, (2) the reduction in Betti numbers is significantly
faster for ReLU activation than hyperbolic tangent activation as the former
defines nonhomeomorphic maps that change topology, whereas the latter defines
homeomorphic maps that preserve topology. Lastly, (3) shallow and deep networks
transform data sets differently -- a shallow network operates mainly through
changing geometry and changes topology only in its final layers, a deep one
spreads topological changes more evenly across all layers.

underlying physical processes are poorly understood. This is mainly because we
have little information about the outflow structure, especially on large
scales. In this paper, we probe the structure of galactic outflows in low-$z$
starburst by using a combination of ultra-violet spectroscopy and imaging of
the fluorescence emission lines (associated with transitions to excited
fine-structure levels) and spectroscopy of the corresponding strongly
blue-shifted resonance absorption lines. We find that in the majority of cases
the observed fluorescence emission lines are much weaker and narrower than the
absorption lines, originating in the star-forming interstellar medium and/or
the slowest-moving part of the inner outflow. In a minority of cases, the
outflowing absorbing material does make a significant contribution to the
fluorescence emission. These latter systems are characterized by both strong
Ly$\alpha$ emission lines and weak low-ionization absorption lines (both known
to be empirical signs of Lyman-continuum leakage). We argue that the observed
weakness of emission from the outflow seen in the majority of cases is due to
the missing emission arising on scales larger than those encompassed by the
aperture of the {\it{Hubble Space Telescope}}. This implies shallow radial
density profiles in these outflows, and suggests that most of the observed
absorbing material must be created/injected at radii much larger than that of
the starburst. This has important implications for our understanding of both
the physics of galactic outflows and for our estimation of their principal
properties.

enhancement of the power spectrum $\Delta_\zeta$ of the curvature fluctuation
$\zeta$ at wavelengths much shorter than those of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies. This is typically achieved in models where $\zeta$
evolves without interacting significantly with additional (isocurvature) scalar
degrees of freedom. However, quantum gravity inspired models are characterized
by moduli spaces with highly curved geometries and a large number of scalar
fields that could vigorously interact with $\zeta$ (as in the cosmological
collider picture). Here we show that isocurvature fluctuations can mix with
$\zeta$ inducing large enhancements of its amplitude. This occurs whenever the
inflationary trajectory experiences rapid turns in the field space of the model
leading to amplifications that are exponentially sensitive to the total angle
swept by the turn, which induce characteristic observable signatures on
$\Delta_\zeta$. We derive accurate analytical predictions and show that the
large enhancements required for PBHs demand non-canonical kinetic terms in the

blocks of galaxies. The physical characteristics of GMCs and their evolution
are tightly connected to galaxy evolution. The macroscopic properties of the
interstellar medium propagate into the properties of GMCs condensing out of it,
with correlations between e.g. the galactic and GMC scale gas pressures,
surface densities and volume densities. That way, the galactic environment sets
the initial conditions for star formation within GMCs. After the onset of
massive star formation, stellar feedback from e.g. photoionisation, stellar
winds, and supernovae eventually contributes to dispersing the parent cloud,
depositing energy, momentum and metals into the surrounding medium, thereby
changing the properties of galaxies. This cycling of matter between gas and
stars, governed by star formation and feedback, is therefore a major driver of
galaxy evolution. Much of the recent debate has focused on the durations of the
various evolutionary phases that constitute this cycle in galaxies, and what
these can teach us about the physical mechanisms driving the cycle. We review
results from observational, theoretical, and numerical work to build a

compare different approaches to estimate FIR line emission from
state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, either with CLOUDY or with
on-the-fly non-equilibrium chemistry. We find that [CII]$_{158\mu}$ predictions
are robust to the model variations we explored. [OI] emission lines, that
typically trace colder and denser gas relative to [CII]$_{158\mu}$, are instead
model-dependent, as these lines are strongly affected by the thermodynamic
state of the gas and non-equilibrium photoionisation effects. For the same
reasons, [OI] lines represent an excellent tool to constrain emission models,
hence future observations targeting these lines will be crucial.

Topologically protected critical lines exist on a plane of magnetic field
angles, and their shapes are determined by microscopic spin interactions. A
chirality operator plays a key role in demonstrating microscopic dependences of
the critical lines. We also show that the chirality operator can be used to
evaluate topological properties of the non-abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid
without relying on Majorana fermion descriptions. Experimental criteria for the
non-abelian spin liquid state are provided for future experiments.

follow a relation often dubbed the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). This
relation links the stellar mass of a galaxy with its star formation rate (SFR)
and its gas-phase metallicity. Specifically, the FMR predicts that galaxies, at
a given stellar mass, exhibit lower metallicities for higher SFRs. This trend
is qualitatively consistent with observations of galaxy pairs, which have been
robustly shown to experience increasing gas-phase metallicity dilution and
enhanced star formation activity with decreasing projected separation. In this
work, we show that, despite the qualitative consistency with FMR expectations,
the observed O/H dilution in galaxy pairs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is
stronger than what is predicted by the FMR. We conclude that the evolutionary
phase of galaxies interacting with companions is not encoded in the FMR, and
thus, mergers constitute a clearly defined population of outliers. We find that
galaxies in pairs are consistent with the FMR only when their separation is
larger than 110 kpc. Finally, we also quantify the local environment of the
pairs using the number of galaxy neighbours within $2\, \mathrm{Mpc}$, $N_2$,
and the projected separation to the second closest galaxy, $r_2$. We find that
pairs are more sensitive to a second companion than to the local galaxy
density, displaying less elevated SFRs with smaller values of $r_2$.

are fundamental processes linked to the morphological transformation of
galaxies and the evolution of star formation across the history of the
Universe. Both nuclear and disk-wide starbursts are assumed to occur during the
merger process. However, quantifying both nuclear and disk-wide star formation
activity is non-trivial because the nuclear starburst is dusty in the most
active merging starburst galaxies. This paper presents a new approach to this
problem: combining hydrogen recombination lines in optical, millimeter, and
free-free emission. Using NGC~3256 as a case study, H$\beta$, H40$\alpha$, and
free-free emissions are investigated using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory
(MUSE/VLT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The
H$\beta$ image obtained by MUSE identifies star-forming regions outside the
nuclear regions, suggesting a disk-wide starburst. In contrast, the H40$\alpha$
image obtained by ALMA identifies a nuclear starburst where optical lines are
undetected due to dust extinction ($A_{\rm V}\sim25$). Combining both MUSE and
ALMA observations, we conclude that the total SFR is
$49\pm2~M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ and the contributions from nuclear and disk-wide
starbursts are $\sim34~\%$ and $\sim66~\%$, respectively. This suggests the
dominance of disk-wide star formation in NGC~3256. In addition, pixel-by-pixel
analyses for disk-wide star-forming regions suggest that shock gas tracers
(e.g., CH$_3$OH) are enhanced where gas depletion time ($\tau_{\rm
gas}$=$M_{\rm gas}/SFR$) is long. This possibly means that merger-induced
shocks regulate disk-wide star formation activities.

the reionization of hydrogen in the early universe. In this model, galaxy
formation can only take place in dark matter haloes whose mass exceeds a
redshift-dependent critical value, which, before reionization, is equal (in the
simplest case) to the mass at which atomic hydrogen cooling becomes effective
and, after reionization, is equal to the mass above which gas cannot remain in
hydrostatic equilibrium. We define the Halo Occupation Fraction (HOF) as the
fraction of haloes that host a luminous galaxy as a function of halo mass. The
HOF is established by the interplay between the evolution of the critical mass
and the assembly history of haloes and depends on three factors: the minimum
halo mass for galaxy formation before reionization, the redshift of
reionization, and the intensity of the (evolving) external photoheating rate.
Our fiducial model predicts a cutoff in the galaxy mass function at a
present-day halo mass, $M_{200} \sim 3\times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$; 100\%
occupation at $M_{200} > 5\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$; and a population of starless

M_{\odot}\lesssim 5\times 10^{9}$, in which the gas is in thermal equilibrium
with the ultraviolet background radiation and in hydrostatic equilibrium in the
gravitational potential of the halo. The transition between HOF = 0 and HOF=1
reflects the stochastic nature of halo mass growth. We explore how these
characteristic masses vary with model assumptions and parameter values. The
results of our model are in excellent agreement with cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations of galaxy formation.

isotropy both at electron-positron colliders, where events are compared to a
perfectly spherical radiation pattern, as well as at proton-proton colliders,

Compared to traditional event shape observables like sphericity and thrust,
event isotropy exhibits a larger dynamic range for high-multiplicity events.
This enables event isotropy to not only distinguish between dijet and multijet

different values of N. As a key application of this new observable, we study
its performance to characterize strongly-coupled new physics scenarios with

images and estimate the physical properties of galaxies through spectral energy
distribution fitting. We find that the photometric redshifts are primarily
limited by the availability of blue-band and near-infrared medium-band imaging.
The stellar masses and star-formation rates are recovered within $0.25$ and
$0.3$ dex respectively, for galaxies with accurate photometric redshifts. Brown
dwarfs contaminating the $z>5$ galaxy samples can be reduced to $<0.01$
arcmin$^{-2}$ with a limited impact on galaxy completeness. We investigate
multiple high-redshift galaxy selection techniques and find the best compromise
between completeness and purity at $5<z<10$ using the full redshift posterior
probability distributions. In the EGS field, the galaxy completeness remains
higher than $50\%$ for $m_\text{UV}<27.5$ sources at all redshifts, and the

its integrals of motion are fully compatible with a cluster purely belonging to

to star-formation quenching at stellar masses
$\gtrsim10^{10.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$ but also to a change in thermodynamic
properties of the (\emph{non}-star-forming) gas, both within the galaxy and
beyond. The IllustrisTNG kinetic feedback from SMBHs increases the average gas
entropy, within the galaxy and in the CGM, lengthening typical gas cooling
times from $10\textrm{--}100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ to $1\textrm{--}10\,\mathrm{Gyr}$,
effectively ceasing ongoing star-formation and inhibiting radiative cooling and
future gas accretion. In practice, the same AGN feedback channel is
simultaneously `ejective' and `preventative' and leaves an imprint on the
temperature, density, entropy, and cooling times also in the outer reaches of
the gas halo, up to distances of several hundred kiloparsecs. In the

demonstrate that EntanCl can successfully separate ground states from excited

NOF-MP2 method that simultaneously calculates static and dynamic electron
correlations taking as a reference the Slater determinant formed with the NOs

The basic idea for the entire cadre is to choose some non-local model family,
to train many of them on small sections of neighboring data, and then to
`stitch' the resulting models together in some way. Due to the limits of
constraining a training dataset to a small neighborhood, research on
locally-learned models has largely been restricted to simple model families.
Also, since simple model families have no complex structure by design, this has
limited use of the individual local models to predictive tasks. We hypothesize
that, using a sufficiently complex local model family, various properties of
the individual local models, such as their learned parameters, can be used as
features for further learning. This dissertation improves upon the current
state of research and works toward establishing this hypothesis by
investigating algorithms for localization of more complex model families and by
studying their applications beyond predictions as a feature extraction
mechanism. We summarize this generic technique of using local models as a
feature extraction step with the term ``local model feature transformations.''
In this document, we extend the local modeling paradigm to Gaussian processes,
orthogonal quadric models and word embedding models, and extend the existing
theory for localized linear classifiers. We then demonstrate applications of
local model feature transformations to epileptic event classification from EEG
readings, activity monitoring via chest accelerometry, 3D surface

However, exact computation of these estimators remains a major challenge.
Indeed, modern exact methods, based on mixed integer programming (MIP), face

solving the node relaxations using a specialized first-order method, based on

a thorough empirical evaluation on eight Bert-based classification models by
focusing on two key factors: 1) Bert model variants, and 2) classification
strategies. Experiments on three corpora show that domain-specific pre-training

intelligence (AI) technologies are opening to a wide plethora of novel and
interesting applications. While this field received a strong impact from the
recent AI breakthroughs, most of the provided solutions either entirely rely on
commercial software or provide a weak integration interface which denies the
development of additional techniques. This leads us to propose a novel and
efficient framework for the UAV-AI joint technology. Intelligent UAV systems
encounter complex challenges to be tackled without human control. One of these
complex challenges is to be able to carry out computer vision tasks in
real-time use cases. In this paper we focus on this challenge and introduce a
multi-layer AI (MLAI) framework to allow easy integration of ad-hoc
visual-based AI applications. To show its features and its advantages, we
implemented and evaluated different modern visual-based deep learning models
for object detection, target tracking and target handover.

spacetimes in the framework of Einstein-aether theory, and pay particular
attention to the existence of black holes (BHs). In the present studies we
first clarify several subtle issues. In particular, we find that, out of the
five non-trivial field equations, only three are independent, so the problem is
well-posed, as now generically there are only three unknown functions, {$F(r),
B(r), A(r)$, where $F$ and $B$ are metric coefficients, and $A$ describes the
aether field.} In addition, the two second-order differential equations for $A$
and $F$ are independent of $B$, and once they are found, $B$ is given simply by
an algebraic expression of $F,\; A$ and their derivatives. To simplify the
problem further, we explore the symmetry of field redefinitions, and work first
with the redefined metric and aether field, and then obtain the physical ones
by the inverse transformations. These clarifications significantly simplify the
computational labor, which is important, as the problem is highly involved
mathematically. In fact, it is exactly because of these, we find various
numerical BH solutions with an accuracy that is at least two orders higher than
previous ones. More important, these BH solutions are the only ones that
satisfy the self-consistent conditions and meantime are consistent with all the
observational constraints obtained so far. The locations of universal horizons
are also identified, together with several other observationally interesting
quantities, such as the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), the ISCO
frequency, and the maximum redshift $z_{max}$ of a photon emitted by a source
orbiting the ISCO. All of these quantities are found to be quite close to their
relativistic limits.

in an additive way, in contrast to the popular Cox model, in which it is

ordinary least squares. In this paper we consider the case where covariates are
bounded, and derive the maximum likelihood estimator under the constraint that
the hazard is non-negative for all covariate values in their domain. We
describe an efficient algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimator. The
method is contrasted with the ordinary least squares approach in a simulation
study, and the method is illustrated on a realistic data set.

reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from input images with lower spatial
resolutions. However, effectively evaluating the perceptual quality of SR
images remains a challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose a
no-reference/blind deep neural network-based SR image quality assessor
(DeepSRQ). To learn more discriminative feature representations of various
distorted SR images, the proposed DeepSRQ is a two-stream convolutional network
including two subcomponents for distorted structure and texture SR images.
Different from traditional image distortions, the artifacts of SR images cause
both image structure and texture quality degradation. Therefore, we choose the
two-stream scheme that captures different properties of SR inputs instead of
directly learning features from one image stream. Considering the human visual
system (HVS) characteristics, the structure stream focuses on extracting
features in structural degradations, while the texture stream focuses on the
change in textural distributions. In addition, to augment the training data and
ensure the category balance, we propose a stride-based adaptive cropping
approach for further improvement. Experimental results on three publicly
available SR image quality databases demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of our proposed DeepSRQ method compared with
state-of-the-art image quality assessment algorithms.

often exhibit non-Maxwellian electron and ion velocity distributions that lead
to the growth of microinstabilities, that is, enhanced electric and magnetic
fields at relatively short wavelengths. These instabilities play an active role
in the evolution of space plasmas, as does ubiquitous broadband turbulence
induced by turbulent structures. This study compares certain properties of a
2.5 dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation for the forward cascade of
Alfvenic turbulence in a collisionless plasma against the same properties of
turbulence observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft in the
terrestrial magnetosheath. The PIC
  simulation is of decaying turbulence which develops both coherent structures
and anisotropic ion velocity distributions with the potential to drive kinetic
scale instabilities. The uniform background magnetic field points perpendicular
to the plane of the simulation. Growth rates are computed from linear theory
using the ion temperature anisotropies and ion beta values for both the
simulation and the observations. Both the simulation and the observations show
that strong anisotropies and growth rates occur highly intermittently in the
plasma, and the simulation further shows that such anisotropies preferentially
occur near current sheets. This suggests that, though microinstabilities may
affect the plasma globally , they act locally and develop in response to
extreme temperature anisotropies generated by turbulent structures. Further
studies will be necessary to understand why there is an apparent correlation
between linear instability theory and strongly intermittent turbulence.

when considering the more complex software engineering workflows in

relatively long running workflows; ii) infrastructure (such as logging) is not
fully aware of work items; iv) engineering processes (e.g., for incident

diffractive optical elements is their capability to efficiently deflect light

approaches that are optimal for small deflection angles and their performance
for designing high numerical aperture devices is not well quantified. Here we
introduce and apply a technique for the estimation of the efficiency of high
numerical aperture metasurfaces. The technique is based on a particular
coherent averaging of diffraction coefficients of periodic blazed gratings and
can be used to compare the performance of different metasurface designs in
implementing high numerical aperture devices. Unlike optimization-based methods
that rely on full-wave simulations and are only practicable in designing small
metasurfaces, the gradient averaging technique allows for the design of
arbitrarily large metasurfaces. Using this technique, we identify an
unconventional metasurface design and experimentally demonstrate a metalens
with a numerical aperture of 0.78 and a measured focusing efficiency of 77%.
The grating averaging is a versatile technique applicable to many types of
gradient metasurfaces, thus enabling highly efficient metasurface components
and systems.

SLRs in SE. [Objective] The goal of this paper is to provide recommendations on
when to update SLRs in SE. [Method] We evaluated, using a three-step approach,
a third-party decision framework (3PDF) employed in other fields, to decide
whether SLRs need updating. First, we conducted a literature review of SLR
updates in SE and contacted the authors to obtain their feedback relating to
the usefulness of the 3PDF within the context of SLR updates in SE. Second, we
used these authors feedback to see whether the framework needed any adaptation;
none was suggested. Third, we applied the 3PDF to the SLR updates identified in
our literature review. [Results] The 3PDF showed that 14 of the 20 SLRs did not
need updating. This supports the use of a decision support mechanism (such as
the 3PDF) to help the SE community decide when to update SLRs. [Conclusions] We
put forward that the 3PDF should be adopted by the SE community to keep

confinement and wave guiding result in multiwavelength light localization
provided conditions of adiabatic mode transformation are satisfied. The field
is enhanced further through fine tuning of the groove-width (w), groove-depth

width-graded and non-graded gratings and defining the adiabaticity condition,
we demonstrate the criticality of w and d in achieving adiabatic mode
transformation among the grooves. We observe that the resonant wavelength of a
graded grating corresponds to the properties of a single groove when the
grooves are adiabatically coupled. We show that L plays an important function
in defining the span of localized wavelengths. We show that multiwavelength
resonant modes with intensity enhancement exceeding 3 orders of magnitude are

turbulence whose collective outcome on an arbitrary scale in the inertial range
may lead to a global stochastic reconnection event with a rate independent of
small scale physics. We show that this picture is intimately related to the
nanoflare theory of the solar corona. First, we argue that due to stochastic
flux freezing, a generalized version of flux freezing in turbulence, the
magnetic field follows the turbulent flow in a statistical sense. Bending and
stretching an initially smooth field, therefore, the turbulence generally
increases the magnetic spatial complexity. Strong magnetic shears associated
with such a highly tangled field can trigger local reversals and field
annihilations that convert magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energy
respectively. The former maintains the turbulence, which incidentally continues
to entangle the field completing the cycle, while the latter enhances the heat
generation in the dissipative range. We support this theoretical picture
invoking recent analytical and numerical studies which suggest a correlation
between magnetic complexity and magnetic energy dissipation. The amplification
of multiple local, in-phase reversals by super-linear Richardson diffusion may
initiate a global reconnection at larger scales, however, even in the absence
of such a global stochastic reconnection, the small scale reversals will
continue to interact with the turbulence. We employ conventional scaling laws
of MHD turbulence to illustrate that these local events are indeed efficient in
both enhancing the turbulence and generating heat. Finally, using an MHD
numerical simulation, we show that the time evolution of the magnetic
complexity is statistically correlated with the kinetic energy injection rate
and/or magnetic-to-thermal energy conversion rate.

a three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the intensity
of ejection events that occur in Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a
periodic channel flow. The trained network is able to predict burst intensities
accurately for flow snaphshots that are sufficiently removed from the training
data so as to be temporally decorrelated. More importantly, we probe the
trained network to reveal regions of the flow where the network focuses its
attention in order to make a prediction. We find that these salient regions
correlate very well with fluid parcels being ejected away from the wall.
Moreover, the CNN is able to keep track of the salient fluid parcels as the
flow evolves in time. This demonstrates that CNNs are capable of discovering
dynamically critical phenomena in turbulent flows without requiring any
a-priori knowledge of the underlying dynamics. Remarkably, the trained CNN is
able to predict ejection intensities accurately for data at different Reynolds
numbers, which highlights its ability to identify physical processes that
persist across varying flow conditions. The results presented here highlight
the immense potential of CNNs for discovering and analyzing nonlinear spatial
correlations in turbulent flows.

exploration of the mutual interaction among the visual objects. In this work,
we propose a novel transformer formulation for scene graph generation and
relation prediction. We leverage the encoder-decoder architecture of the
transformer for rich feature embedding of nodes and edges. Specifically, we
model the node-to-node interaction with the self-attention of the transformer
encoder and the edge-to-node interaction with the cross-attention of the
transformer decoder. Further, we introduce a novel positional embedding
suitable to handle edges in the decoder. Finally, our relation prediction
module classifies the directed relation from the learned node and edge
embedding. We name this architecture as Relation Transformer Network (RTN). On
the Visual Genome and GQA dataset, we have achieved an overall mean of 4.85%
and 3.1% point improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Our
experiments show that Relation Transformer can efficiently model context across
various datasets with small, medium, and large-scale relation classification.

that enable attackers to exfiltrate data from isolated, network-less computers.
Various types of air-gap covert channels have been demonstrated over the years,
including electromagnetic, magnetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal.
  In this paper, we introduce a new type of vibrational (seismic) covert
channel. We observe that computers vibrate at a frequency correlated to the
rotation speed of their internal fans. These inaudible vibrations affect the
entire structure on which the computer is placed. Our method is based on
malware's capability of controlling the vibrations generated by a computer, by
regulating its internal fan speeds. We show that the malware-generated covert
vibrations can be sensed by nearby smartphones via the integrated, sensitive
\textit{accelerometers}. Notably, the accelerometer sensors in smartphones can
be accessed by any app without requiring the user permissions, which make this
attack highly evasive. We implemented AiR-ViBeR, malware that encodes binary
information, and modulate it over a low frequency vibrational carrier. The data
is then decoded by malicious application on a smartphone placed on the same
surface (e.g., on a desk). We discuss the attack model, provide technical
background, and present the implementation details and evaluation results. Our
results show that using AiR-ViBeR, data can be exfiltrated from air-gapped
computer to a nearby smartphone on the same table, or even an adjacent table,

observe the images of sources but rather measure their Fourier components at
discrete spatial frequencies up to a maximum value set by the longest baseline
in the array. Construction of images from the Fourier components or analysis of
them with high-resolution models requires careful treatment of fine source
structure nominally beyond the array resolution. The primary EHT targets, Sgr
A* and M87, are expected to have black-hole shadows with sharp edges and
strongly filamentary emission from the surrounding plasma on scales much
smaller than those probed by the currently largest baselines. We show that for
aliasing not to affect images reconstructed with regularized maximum likelihood
methods and model images that are directly compared to the data, the sampling
of these images (i.e., their pixel spacing) needs to be significantly finer
than the scale probed by the largest baseline in the array. Using GRMHD
simulations of black-hole images, we estimate the maximum allowable pixel
spacing to be approximately equal to (1/8)GM/c^2; for both of the primary EHT
targets, this corresponds to an angular pixel size of <0.5 microarcseconds.
With aliasing under control, we then advocate use of the second-order
Butterworth filter with a cut-off scale equal to the maximum array baseline as
optimal for visualizing the reconstructed images. In contrast to the
traditional Gaussian filters, this Butterworth filter retains most of the power
at the scales probed by the array while suppressing the fine image details for

Raft, is a variation on the Raft consensus algorithm that reduces the number of

distributed systems where membership changes over time and where sites must
reach consensus quickly. The second, C-Raft, is targeted for distributed
systems where sites are grouped into clusters, with fast communication within
clusters and slower communication between clusters. C-Raft uses Fast Raft as a

expressions is a key challenge in meaningfully analyzing clinical text for use
in advanced AI applications. While previous studies exist, the state-of-the-art
performance has significant room for improvement.
  Methods: We studied several variants of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations using Transformers) some involving clinical domain
customization and the others involving improved architecture and/or training
strategies. We evaluated these methods using a direct temporal relations
dataset which is a semantically focused subset of the 2012 i2b2 temporal
relations challenge dataset.
  Results: Our results show that RoBERTa, which employs better pre-training
strategies including using 10x larger corpus, has improved overall F measure by
0.0864 absolute score (on the 1.00 scale) and thus reducing the error rate by
24% relative to the previous state-of-the-art performance achieved with an SVM
(support vector machine) model.
  Conclusion: Modern contextual language modeling neural networks, pre-trained
on a large corpus, achieve impressive performance even on highly-nuanced
clinical temporal relation tasks.

finite time. Near the singularity, the surface resembles a self-shrinker, a
surface that shrinks by dilations under mean curvature flow. If the singularity
is modeled on a self-shrinker other than a round sphere or cylinder, then the
singularity is unstable under perturbations of the flow. One can quantify this
instability using the index of the self-shrinker when viewed as a critical
point of the entropy functional.
  In this work, we prove an upper bound on the index of rotationally symmetric
self-shrinking tori in terms of their entropy and their maximum and minimum
radii. While there have been a few lower bound results in the literature, we
believe that this result is the first upper bound on the index of a
self-shrinker. Our methods also give lower bounds on the index and the entropy,

to these variations is exactly $-1$. Finally, we present some preliminary

detected in the photometric time series of Sectors 14, 20, and 21 of the TESS
space mission. We confirm the planetary nature of the transit signal, which has
a period of 3.44 d, by using precise radial velocity measurements with CARMENES
and HARPS-N spectrographs. A comparison of the properties derived for TOI-1235
b's with theoretical models reveals that the planet has a rocky composition,
with a bulk density slightly higher than Earth's. In particular, we measure a
mass of M_p = 5.9+/-0.6 M_Earth and a radius of R_p = 1.69+/-0.08 R_Earth,
which together result in a density of rho_p = 6.7+1.3-1.1 g/cm3. When compared
with other well-characterized exoplanetary systems, the particular combination
of planetary radius and mass puts our discovery in the radius gap, a transition
region between rocky planets and planets with significant atmospheric
envelopes, with few known members. While the exact location of the radius gap
for M dwarfs is still a matter of debate, our results constrain it to be
located at around 1.7 R_Earth or larger at the insolation levels received by

are often highly simplified representations of incredibly complex systems.
Because of these simplifications, the model output, of say new cases of a
disease over time, or when an epidemic will occur, may be inconsistent with
available data. In this case, we must improve the model, especially if we plan
to make decisions based on it that could affect human health and safety, but
direct improvements are often beyond our reach. In this work, we explore this
problem through a case study of the Zika outbreak in Brazil in 2016. We propose
an embedded discrepancy operator---a modification to the model equations that
requires modest information about the system and is calibrated by all relevant
data. We show that the new enriched model demonstrates greatly increased
consistency with real data. Moreover, the method is general enough to easily
apply to many other mathematical models in epidemiology.

meta-analysis is efficiently finding scientifically sound relevant articles.
Typically, less than 1% of articles match this requirement which leads to a
highly imbalanced task. Although feature-engineered and early neural networks
models were studied for this task, there is an opportunity to improve the
results.
  Methods: We framed the problem of filtering articles as a classification
task, and trained and tested several ensemble architectures of SciBERT, a
variant of BERT pre-trained on scientific articles, on a manually annotated
dataset of about 50K articles from MEDLINE. Since scientifically sound articles
are identified through a multi-step process we proposed a novel cascade
ensemble analogous to the selection process. We compared the performance of the
cascade ensemble with a single integrated model and other types of ensembles as
well as with results from previous studies.
  Results: The cascade ensemble architecture achieved 0.7505 F measure, an
impressive 49.1% error rate reduction, compared to a CNN model that was
previously proposed and evaluated on a selected subset of the 50K articles. On
the full dataset, the cascade ensemble achieved 0.7639 F measure, resulting in
an error rate reduction of 19.7% compared to the best performance reported in a
previous study that used the full dataset.
  Conclusion: Pre-trained contextual encoder neural networks (e.g. SciBERT)
perform better than the models studied previously and manually created search
filters in filtering for scientifically sound relevant articles. The superior
performance achieved by the cascade ensemble is a significant result that
generalizes beyond this task and the dataset, and is analogous to query
optimization in IR and databases.

state-of-the-art solutions rank the items with an average of the ratings

and the exposure to attacks and spamming/spurious users. Using these ratings to
group users with similar preferences might be useful to present users with
items that reflect their preferences and overcome those vulnerabilities. In
this paper, we propose a new reputation-based ranking system, utilizing
multipartite rating subnetworks, which clusters users by their similarities
using three measures, two of them based on Kolmogorov complexity. We also study
its resistance to bribery and how to design optimal bribing strategies. Our
system is novel in that it reflects the diversity of preferences by (possibly)
assigning distinct rankings to the same item, for different groups of users. We
prove the convergence and efficiency of the system. By testing it on synthetic

more robust to attacks than state-of-the-art approaches. Also, by clustering
users, the effect of bribery in the proposed multipartite ranking system is
dimmed, comparing to the bipartite case.

approachable than, similar sums studied by Ramanujan. It is also reminiscent of
Euler's formula $\zeta(2,1) = \zeta(3)$, which is the simplest instance of
duality of multiple polylogarithms. We review this duality and apply it to
derive a companion identity. We also discuss approaches based on computer
algebra. All of our approaches ultimately require the introduction of
polylogarithms and nontrivial relations between them. It remains an open
challenge to relate the triple integral or the double sum to $\zeta(3)$

results when the debris stream returns to pericenter and punches through the
disk. Shocks excited in the disk dissipate the kinetic energy of the disk
interior to the impact point and expedite inflow toward the black hole.
Radiatively efficient disks with luminosity $\gtrsim10^{-3}$ Eddington have a
high enough surface density that the initial stream-disk interaction leads to
energy dissipation at a super-Eddington rate. Because of the rapid inflow, only
part of this dissipated energy emerges as radiation, while the rest is advected
into the black hole. Dissipation, inflow, and cooling balance to keep the
bolometric luminosity at an Eddington-level plateau whose duration is tens of
days, with an almost linear dependence on stellar mass. After the plateau, the
luminosity decreases in proportion to the disk surface density, with a
power-law index between $-3$ and $-2$ at earlier times, and possibly a steeper

poses a challenge in designing a secure, reliable, and particularly
high-performance communication for this family of devices. Although
side-channel resistant ciphers (either block cipher or stream cipher) are the
well-suited solution to establish a guaranteed secure communication, the
energy-intensive nature of these ciphers makes them undesirable for
particularly lightweight IoT solutions. In this paper, we introduce ExTru, a
novel encrypted communication protocol based on stream ciphers that adds a
configurable switching & toggling network (CSTN) to not only boost the
performance of the communication in lightweight IoT devices, it also consumes
far less energy compared with the conventional side-channel resistant ciphers.
Although the overall structure of the proposed scheme is leaky against physical
attacks, such as side-channel or new scan-based Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
attack or algebraic attack, we introduce a dynamic encryption mechanism that
removes this vulnerability. We demonstrate how each communicated message in the
proposed scheme reduces the level of trust. Accordingly, since a specific
number of messages, N, could break the communication and extract the key, by
using the dynamic encryption mechanism, ExTru can re-initiate the level of
trust periodically after T messages where T<N, to protect the communication
against side-channel and scan-based attacks (e.g. SAT attack). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that by properly configuring the value of T, ExTru not only
increases the strength of security from per ""device"" to per ""message"", it also
significantly improves energy consumption as well as throughput in comparison
with an architecture that only uses a conventional side-channel resistant
block/stream cipher.

of unknown parameters, the aim is to estimate the Bayes' rule of allocation for
the allocation of subsequent unclassified observations. Estimation on the basis
of both the classified and unclassified data can be undertaken in a
straightforward manner by fitting a g-component mixture model by maximum
likelihood (ML) via the EM algorithm in the situation where the observed data
can be assumed to be an observed random sample from the adopted mixture
distribution. This assumption applies if the missing-data mechanism is
ignorable in the terminology pioneered by Rubin (1976). An initial likelihood
approach was to use the so-called classification ML approach whereby the
missing labels are taken to be parameters to be estimated along with the
parameters of the class-conditional distributions. However, as it can lead to
inconsistent estimates, the focus of attention switched to the mixture ML
approach after the appearance of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).
Particular attention is given here to the asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE)
of the Bayes' rule estimated from a partially classified sample. Lastly, we
consider briefly some recent results in situations where the missing label

fundamental challenge in contemporary photonics and materials research. While
photonic strategies have enabled angular selectivity of thermal emission over
narrow sets of bandwidths, thermal radiation is inherently a broadband
phenomenon. We currently lack the ability to constrain emitted thermal
radiation to arbitrary angular ranges over broad bandwidths. Here, we introduce
and experimentally realize gradient epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material structures
that enable broad spectrum directional control of thermal emission by
supporting leaky electromagnetic modes that couple to free space at fixed
angles over a broad bandwidth. We demonstrate two emitter structures consisting
of multiple semiconductor oxides in a photonic configuration that enable
gradient ENZ behavior over long-wave infrared wavelengths. The structures
exhibit high average emissivity (greater than 0.6 and 0.7) in the p
polarization between 7.7 and 11.5 micron over an angular range of 70 deg - 85
deg, and between 10.0 to 14.3 micron over an angular range of 60 deg-75 deg,
respectively. Outside these angular ranges, the emissivity dramatically drops
to 0.4 at 50 deg and 40 deg. The structures broadband thermal beaming
capability enables strong radiative heat transfer only at particular angles and
is experimentally verified through direct measurements of thermal emission. By
decoupling conventional limitations on angular and spectral response, our
approach opens new possibilities for radiative heat transfer in applications
such as thermal camouflaging, solar heating, radiative cooling and waste heat
recovery.

Dirac spinor field in the global de Sitter space of any dimension $d$ using the
in-/out-state formalism. We show that there is particle production in even
dimensions for both scalar field and spinor field. The in-out vacuum amplitude
$Z_{in/out}$ is divergent at late times. By using dimensional regularization,
we extract the finite part of $\log Z_{in/out}$ for $d$ even and the
logarithmically divergent part of $\log Z_{in/out}$ for $d$ odd. We also find
that the regularized in-out vacuum amplitude equals the ratio of determinants
associated with different quantizations in $AdS_d$ upon the identification of
certain parameters in the two theories.

This
application may be facilitated by variational quantum-classical algorithms

needed for convergence, especially for chemical accuracy. Here we introduce a
strategy for reducing the number of measurements (i.e., shots) by randomly
sampling operators $h_i$ from the overall Hamiltonian $H = \sum_i c_i h_i$. In
particular, we employ weighted sampling, which is important when the $c_i$'s
are highly non-uniform, as is typical in chemistry. We integrate this strategy
with an adaptive optimizer developed recently by our group to construct an
improved optimizer called Rosalin (Random Operator Sampling for Adaptive
Learning with Individual Number of shots). Rosalin implements stochastic
gradient descent while adapting the shot noise for each partial derivative and
randomly assigning the shots amongst the $h_i$ according to a weighted
distribution. We implement this and other optimizers to find the ground states
of molecules H$_2$, LiH, and BeH$_2$, without and with quantum hardware noise,
and Rosalin outperforms other optimizers in most cases.

images in different conditions (i.e. profiles, fluxes, backgrounds and full

difference in precision between the two algorithms is related to the profiles

Gaussian-profile star image cannot be extended to other more specific

challenging ill-posed field-to-source inversion problem. Inaccurate
field-to-source inversion often causes large susceptibility estimation errors
that appear as streaking artifacts in the QSM, especially in massive
hemorrhagic regions. Recently, several deep learning (DL) QSM techniques have
been proposed and demonstrated impressive performance. Due to the inherent
non-existent ground-truth QSM references, these DL techniques used either
calculation of susceptibility through multiple orientation sampling (COSMOS)
maps or synthetic data for network training. Therefore, they were constrained
by the availability and accuracy of COSMOS maps, or suffered from performance
drop when the training and testing domains were different. To address these
limitations, we present a model-based DL method, denoted as uQSM. Without
accessing to QSM labels, uQSM is trained using the well-established physical
model. When evaluating on multi-orientation QSM datasets, uQSM achieves higher
levels of quantitative accuracy compared to TKD, TV-FANSI, MEDI, and DIP
approaches. When qualitatively evaluated on single-orientation datasets, uQSM
outperforms other methods and reconstructed high quality QSM.

industrial computed tomography (ICT) has found many applications in smart

pace with smart manufacturing. In this paper, with the support from Internet of
things (IoT) and convolutional neural network (CNN), we proposed a lightweight
solution of ICT devices for smart manufacturing. It consists of efforts from
two aspects: distributed hardware allocation and data reduction. At the first
aspect, ICT devices are separated into four functional units: data acquisition,
cloud storage, computing center and control terminals. They are distributed and
interconnected by IoT. Only the data acquisition unit still remains in the
production lines. This distribution not only slims the ICT device, but also
permits the share of the same functional units. At the second aspect, in the
data acquisition unit, sparse sampling strategy is adopted to reduce the raw
data and singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to compress these data.
They are then transmitted to the cloud storage. At the computing center, an ICT
image reconstruction algorithm and a CNN are applied to these compressed sparse
sampling data to obtain high quality CT images. The experiments with practical
ICT data have been executed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed
solution. The results indicate that this solution can achieve a drastic data
reduction, a storage space save and an efficiency improvement without
significant image degradation. The presented work has been helpful to push the
applications of ICT in smart manufacturing.

reduction technique that connects two well-known shape fitting problems:
subspace approximation and clustering, and may be of independent interest. We

elongations of $\sim 9.22- 18.69~R_{\odot}$) to the Sun (Howard et al. 2019).
Such a F-corona decrease cannot be explained by the dust sublimation scenario
of the popular silicate composition that implies a dust-free-zone of boundary
at heliocentric radius $R\lesssim 4-5R_{\odot}$, but may be explained by
appealing to various dust compositions with different sublimation fronts. In
this paper, we present an additional explanation for the F-corona decrease
using our newly introduced mechanism of dust destruction so-called Radiative
Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism. We demonstrate that RATD rapidly breaks
large grains into nanoparticles so that they can be efficiently destroyed by
nonthermal sputtering induced by bombardment of energetic protons from slow
solar winds, which extends the dust-free-zone established by thermal
sublimation to $R_{dfz}\sim 8R_{\odot}$. Beyond this extended dust-free-zone,
we find that the dust mass decreases gradually from $R\sim 42R_{\odot}$ toward
the Sun due to partial removal of nanodust by nonthermal sputtering. The joint
effect of RATD and nonthermal sputtering can successfully reproduce the gradual
decrease of the F-corona between $19-9R_{\odot}$ observed by the PSP. Finally,
the RATD mechanism can efficiently produce nanoparticles usually observed in
the inner solar system.

network to combine the tasks of instance segmentation and semantic
segmentation. However, prior models only unified the two related tasks at the
architectural level via a multi-branch scheme or revealed the underlying
correlation between them by unidirectional feature fusion, which disregards the
explicit semantic and co-occurrence relations among objects and background.
Inspired by the fact that context information is critical to recognize and
localize the objects, and inclusive object details are significant to parse the
background scene, we thus investigate on explicitly modeling the correlations
between object and background to achieve a holistic understanding of an image
in the panoptic segmentation task. We introduce a Bidirectional Graph Reasoning
Network (BGRNet), which incorporates graph structure into the conventional
panoptic segmentation network to mine the intra-modular and intermodular
relations within and between foreground things and background stuff classes. In
particular, BGRNet first constructs image-specific graphs in both instance and
semantic segmentation branches that enable flexible reasoning at the proposal
level and class level, respectively. To establish the correlations between
separate branches and fully leverage the complementary relations between things
and stuff, we propose a Bidirectional Graph Connection Module to diffuse
information across branches in a learnable fashion. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our BGRNet that achieves the new
state-of-the-art performance on challenging COCO and ADE20K panoptic

star mergers and failed supernovae. For BH remnants from neutron star mergers,
we evaluate the consistency of these models with the recent claim on the
existence of echoes following the neutron star merger event GW170817. We find
that the claimed echoes in GW170817, if real, suggest that overtones contribute
a significant amount of energy in the ringdown of the remnant BH. We finally
discuss the detectability of echoes from failed supernovae by second and

constrain the maximum mass and equation of state of neutron stars.

these regimes is particularly desired for systems with spatially varying band
structures where band gaps of various sizes are simultaneously present, e.g. in
moir\'{e} patterns. For a single wavepacket, alternative to the previous
derivation by Lagrangian variational approach, we show that the same
semiclassical equations of motion can be obtained by introducing a
spatial-texture-induced force operator similar to the Ehrenfest theorem. For
semiclassically computing the current, the ensemble of wavepackets based on
adiabatic dynamics is shown to well correspond to a phase-space fluid for which
the fluid's mass and velocity are two distinguishable properties. This
distinction is not inherited to the ensemble of wavepackets with the
non-adiabatic dynamics. We extend the adiabatic kinetic theory to the
non-adiabatic regime by taking into account decoherence, whose joint action
with electric field favours certain form of inter-band coherence. The
steady-state density matrix as a function of the phase-space variables is then
phenomenologically obtained for calculating the transport current. The result,
applicable with a finite electric field, expectedly reproduces the known
adiabatic limit by taking the electric field to be infinitesimal, and therefore
attains a unified description from the adiabatic to the non-adiabatic
situations.

conjectured form of entanglement area law for 2D gapped systems. In this work,
we instead start with the principle of exchange symmetry, and determine the
minimal prescription of additional postulates needed to make contact with
unitary ribbon fusion categories as the appropriate algebraic framework for
modelling anyons. Assuming that 2D quasiparticles are spatially localised, we
build a functor from the coloured braid groupoid to the category of

notion of exchange symmetry, allowing us to recover the core fusion properties
of anyons. In particular, given a system of $n$ quasiparticles, we show that
the action of a certain $n$-braid $\beta_{n}$ uniquely specifies its
superselection sectors. We then provide an overview of the braiding and fusion
structure of anyons in the usual setting of braided $6j$ fusion systems. By
positing the duality axiom of [A. Kitaev, Ann. Phys., 321(1) (2006)] and

finite volume method that ensures the rigorous numerical conservation. To
represent the spherical geometry free of polar problems, the cubed-sphere grid
is adopted. A fourth-order multi-moment discretization formulation is applied
to the nonhydrostatic governing equations cast in local curvilinear coordinates
on each patch of cubed sphere through a gnomonic projection. In vertical
direction, the height-based terrain-following grid is used to represent the
topography. To get around the CFL stability restriction imposed by relatively
small grid spacing in the vertical direction, the dimensional-splitting time
integration using the HEVI (Horizontal Explicit and Vertical Implicit) strategy
is implemented by applying the IMEX Runge-Kutta scheme. The proposed dynamical
core preserves the fourth-order accuracy in spherical geometry and has been
verified by the widely-used benchmark tests. The results of our numerical
experiments show that the present numerical core has superior solution quality
and great practical potential as a platform for atmospheric models. A new
unified model for numerical weather prediction and global atmospheric

  for Indoor Visible Light Positioning",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a high coverage algorithm termed enhanced camera assisted
received signal strength ratio (eCA-RSSR) positioning algorithm is proposed for
visible light positioning (VLP) systems. The basic idea of eCA-RSSR is to
utilize visual information captured by the camera to estimate the incidence
angles of visible lights first. Based on the incidence angles, eCA-RSSR
utilizes the received signal strength ratio (RSSR) calculated by the photodiode
(PD) to estimate the ratios of the distances between the LEDs and the receiver.
Based on an Euclidean plane geometry theorem, eCA-RSSR transforms the ratios of
the distances into the absolute values. In this way, eCA-RSSR only requires 3
LEDs for both orientation-free 2D and 3D positioning, implying that eCA-RSSR
can achieve high coverage. Based on the absolute values of the distances, the
linear least square method is employed to estimate the position of the
receiver. Therefore, for the receiver having a small distance between the PD
and the camera, the accuracy of eCA-RSSR does not depend on the starting values
of the non-linear least square method and the complexity of eCA-RSSR is low.
Furthermore, since the distance between the PD and camera can significantly
affect the performance of eCA-RSSR, we further propose a compensation algorithm
for eCA-RSSR based on the single-view geometry. Simulation results show that
eCA-RSSR can achieve centimeter-level accuracy over 80% indoor area for both
the receivers having a small and a large distance between the PD and the
camera.

SpO$_2$ measurement from transmittance pulse oximeters is limited to peripheral
regions. This becomes a disadvantage at very low temperatures as blood
perfusion to the peripherals decreases. On the other hand, reflectance pulse
oximeters can be used at various sites like finger, wrist, chest and forehead.
Additionally, reflectance pulse oximeters can be scaled down to affordable
patches that do not interfere with the user's diurnal activities. However,
accurate SpO$_2$ estimation from reflectance pulse oximeters is challenging due
to its patient dependent, subjective nature of measurement. Recently, a Machine
Learning (ML) method was used to model reflectance waveforms onto SpO$_2$
obtained from transmittance waveforms. However, the generalizability of the
model to new patients was not tested. In light of this, the current work
implemented multiple ML based approaches which were subsequently found to be
incapable of generalizing to new patients. Furthermore, a minimally calibrated

increased event energy. For events with S1 = 120 detected photons, i.e.
equivalent to a nuclear recoil energy of $\sim$100 keV, we observe an
electronic recoil background acceptance of $<10^{-5}$ at a nuclear recoil
signal acceptance of 50%. We also observe modest electric field dependence of
the discrimination power, which peaks at a field of around 300 V/cm over the
range of fields explored in this study (50-500 V/cm). In the WIMP search region
of S1 = 1-80 phd, the minimum electronic recoil leakage we observe is
${(7.3\pm0.6)\times10^{-4}}$, which is obtained for a drift field of 240-290
V/cm. Pulse shape discrimination is utilized to improve our results, and we
find that, at low energies and low fields, there is an additional reduction in
background leakage by a factor of up to 3. We develop an empirical model for
recombination fluctuations which, when used alongside the Noble Element
Scintillation Technique (NEST) simulation package, correctly reproduces the
skewness of the electronic recoil data. We use this updated simulation to study
the width of the electronic recoil band, finding that its dominant contribution
comes from electron-ion recombination fluctuations, followed in magnitude of
contribution by fluctuations in the S1 signal, fluctuations in the S2 signal,
and fluctuations in the total number of quanta produced for a given energy

an exponential rate of infection. COVID-19 is particularly notorious as the
onset of symptoms in infected patients are usually delayed and there exists a
large number of asymptomatic carriers. In order to prevent overwhelming of
medical facilities and large fatality rate, early stage testing and diagnosis
are key requirements. In this article, we discuss the methodologies from the
group testing literature and its relevance to COVID-19 diagnosis. Specifically,
we investigate the efficiency of group testing using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) for COVID-19. Group testing is a method in which multiple samples are
pooled together in groups and fewer tests are performed on these groups to
discern all the infected samples. We study the effect of dilution due to
pooling in group testing and show that group tests can perform well even in the
presence of dilution effects. We present multiple group testing algorithms that
could reduce the number of tests performed for COVID-19 diagnosis. We analyze
the efficiency of these tests and provide insights on their practical
relevance. With the use of algorithms described here, test plans can be
developed that can enable testing centers to increase the number of diagnosis
performed without increasing the number of PCR tests. The codes for generating
test plans are available online at [1].

online media coverage about COVID-19-related racial attacks increases steadily,
most of which are anti-Chinese or anti-Asian. As this pandemic becomes
increasingly severe, more people start to talk about it on social media
platforms such as Twitter. When they refer to COVID-19, there are mainly two
ways: using controversial terms like ""Chinese Virus"" or ""Wuhan Virus"", or using
non-controversial terms like ""Coronavirus"". In this study, we attempt to
characterize the Twitter users who use controversial terms and those who use
non-controversial terms. We use the Tweepy API to retrieve 17 million related
tweets and the information of their authors. We find significant differences
between these two groups of Twitter users across their demographics, user-level
features like the number of followers, political following status, as well as
their geo-locations. Moreover, we apply classification models to predict
Twitter users who are more likely to use controversial terms. To our best

the former are suitable for FWI application on 3D dense OBC acquisitions

Helmholtz operator, hence requiring efficient preconditioners. In this study,
we use the Krylov subspace GMRES iterative solver combined with a multi-level

general elliptic system, when the coefficients are piecewise H\""{o}lder
continuous and uniformly bounded, an $\varepsilon$-independent bound of the
gradient was obtained by Li and Nirenberg \cite{ln}, where $\varepsilon$
represents the distance between the interfacial surfaces. However, in
high-contrast composites, when $\varepsilon$ tends to zero, the stress always
concentrates in the narrow regions. As a contrast to the uniform boundedness
result of Li and Nirenberg, in order to investigate the role of $\varepsilon$
played in such kind of concentration phenomenon, in this paper we establish the
blow-up asymptotic expressions of the gradients of solutions to the Lam\'{e}

discover the relationship between the blow-up rate of the stress and the
relative convexity of adjacent surfaces, and find a family of blow-up factor
matrices with respect to the boundary data. Therefore, this work completely
solves the Babu\u{s}ka problem on blow-up analysis of stress concentration in
high-contrast composite media. Moreover, as a byproduct of these local
analysis, we establish an extended Flaherty-Keller formula on the global
effective elastic property of a periodic composite with densely packed fibers,

ultra-wideband (UWB) radios. Conventional schemes assume that the necessary
packet exchanges occur in isolation, to avoid collisions. Concurrent ranging
relies on the overlapping of replies from nearby responders to the same ranging
request issued by an initiator node. As UWB transmissions rely on short pulses,
the individual times of arrival can be discriminated by examining the channel
impulse response (CIR) of the initiator transceiver. By ranging against N
responders with a single, concurrent exchange, our technique drastically abates
network overhead, enabling higher ranging frequency with lower latency and
energy consumption w.r.t. conventional schemes.
  Concurrent ranging can be implemented with a strawman approach requiring
minimal changes to standard schemes. Nevertheless, we empirically show that
this limits the attainable accuracy, reliability, and therefore applicability.
We identify the main challenges in realizing concurrent ranging without
dedicated hardware and tackle them by contributing several techniques, used in
synergy in our prototype based on the popular DW1000 transceiver. Our
evaluation, with static targets and a mobile robot, confirms that concurrent
ranging reliably achieves decimeter-level distance and position accuracy,

prototypical fermionic model of topological properties. To set the stage, we
firstly compute the single-particle spectral function, the local density, and
the boundary charge in the absence of interactions. The boundary charge is
fully determined by bulk properties indicating a bulk-boundary correspondence.
In a large parameter regime it agrees with the one obtained from an effective
low-energy theory (arXiv:2004.00463). Secondly, we investigate the robustness
of our results towards two-particle interactions. To resum the series of
leading logarithms for small gaps, which dismantle plain perturbation theory in
the interaction, we use an essentially analytical renormalization group
approach. It is controlled for small interactions and can directly be applied
to the microscopic lattice model. We benchmark the results against numerical
density matrix renormalization group data. The main interaction effect in the
bulk is a power-law renormalization of the gap with an interaction dependent
exponent. The important characteristics of the boundary charge are unaltered
and can be understood from the renormalized bulk properties, elevating the
bulk-boundary correspondence to the interacting regime. This requires a
consistent treatment not only of the low-energy gap renormalization but also of
the high-energy band width one. In contrast to low-energy field theories our
renormalization group approach also provides the latter. We show that the
interaction spoils the relation between the bulk properties and the number of
edge states, consistent with the observation that the Rice-Mele model with
finite potential modulation does not reveal any zero-energy edge states.

Inference protocols such as maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori

limitation has for many disciplines with increasingly high-dimensional data
become a serious bottleneck. We recently showed that in Cox regression for
time-to-event data the overfitting errors are not just noise but take mostly
the form of a bias, and how with the replica method from statistical physics
once can model and predict this bias and the noise statistics. Here we extend
our approach to arbitrary generalized linear regression models (GLM), with
possibly correlated covariates. We analyse overfitting in ML/MAP inference
without having to specify data types or regression models, relying only on the
GLM form, and derive generic order parameter equations for the case of $L2$
priors. Second, we derive the probabilistic relationship between true and
inferred regression coefficients in GLMs, and show that, for the relevant
hyperparameter scaling and correlated covariates, the $L2$ regularization
causes a predictable direction change of the coefficient vector. Our results,
illustrated by application to linear, logistic, and Cox regression, enable one
to correct ML and MAP inferences in GLMs systematically for overfitting bias,

data from aggregated global models. To this end, a differentially private
AirComp-based FL is designed in this study, where the key idea is to harness
receiver noise perturbation injected to aggregated global models inherently,
thereby preventing the inference of clients' private data. However, the
variance of the inherent receiver noise is often uncontrollable, which renders
the process of injecting an appropriate noise perturbation to achieve a desired
privacy level quite challenging. Hence, this study designs transmit power
control across clients, wherein the received signal level is adjusted
intentionally to control the noise perturbation levels effectively, thereby
achieving the desired privacy level. It is observed that a higher privacy level
requires lower transmit power, which indicates the tradeoff between the privacy
level and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To understand this tradeoff more fully,
the closed-form expressions of SNR (with respect to the privacy level) are
derived, and the tradeoff is analytically demonstrated. The analytical results
also demonstrate that among the configurable parameters, the number of
participating clients is a key parameter that enhances the received SNR under
the aforementioned tradeoff. The analytical results are validated through

subsequent temperature changes restore the as-grown domain structure as

uncompensated bound charges occuring at the newly written domain walls due to
the lack of mobile screening charges at low temperature. Thus, the polarization
of improper ferroelectrics is in many ways subject to the same electrostatics

the one-dimensionality, the momentum space separates into infinite sets of
disjoint irreducible subspaces dynamically independent of one another. Hence,
momentum relaxation occurs only within each subspace toward the Maxwell
distribution. We obtain a hydrodynamic mode with transport coefficients, a
sound velocity and a diffusion coefficient, defined in each subspace. Moreover,
because the sound velocity has momentum dependence, phase mixing affects the
broadening of the spatial distribution of the exciton in addition to the
diffusion process. Due to the phase mixing the increase rate of the mean-square
displacement of the exciton increases linearly with time and diverges in the

problems, often leading to superior performance over traditional iterative
approaches. However, two important questions remain largely unanswered: first,
how well can the trained neural network generalize to objects very different
from the ones in training? This is particularly important in practice, since
large-scale annotated examples similar to those of interest are often not
available during training. Second, has the trained neural network learnt the
underlying (inverse) physics model, or has it merely done something trivial,
such as memorizing the examples or point-wise pattern matching? This pertains
to the interpretability of machine-learning based algorithms. In this work, we
use the Phase Extraction Neural Network (PhENN), a deep neural network (DNN)
for quantitative phase retrieval in a lensless phase imaging system as the
standard platform and show that the two questions are related and share a
common crux: the choice of the training examples. Moreover, we connect the
strength of the regularization effect imposed by a training set to the training
process with the Shannon entropy of images in the dataset. That is, the higher
the entropy of the training images, the weaker the regularization effect can be
imposed. We also discover that weaker regularization effect leads to better
learning of the underlying propagation model, i.e. the weak object transfer
function, applicable for weakly scattering objects under the weak object
approximation. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that better
cross-domain generalization performance can be achieved if DNN is trained on a
higher-entropy database, e.g. the ImageNet, than if the same DNN is trained on
a lower-entropy database, e.g. MNIST, as the former allows the underlying

The goal was to derive reliable halo dwarf abundances and uncertainties for six

trans-Fe elements and two well-understood heavier elements. Our two independent

enhance virus acquisition and pathogenesis. Thus, understanding the SARS-CoV-2

increased susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis. Both Azithromycin and

is appealing to combine the CSMC and MCMC in the framework of the particle
Gibbs (PG) sampler to jointly estimate the phylogenetic trees and evolutionary

the underlying SMC suffers from the path degeneracy issue. Some remedies,
including the particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling and the interacting

a novel CSMC method by proposing a more efficient proposal distribution. It

Dielectric permittivity and loss measurements were carried at both high and low

scanning and transmission electron microscopies, Raman spectroscopy and
piezoresponse force microscopy. The concentration of polar nano clusters, whose

image - is one of the most important tasks in computer vision and has a wide
range of applications including movement diagnostics, surveillance, or
self-driving vehicle. The accuracy of human keypoint prediction is increasingly
improved thanks to the burgeoning development of deep learning. Most existing
methods solved human pose estimation by generating heatmaps in which the ith
heatmap indicates the location confidence of the ith keypoint. In this paper,
we introduce novel network structures referred to as multi-resolution
representation learning for human keypoint prediction. At different resolutions
in the learning process, our networks branch off and use extra layers to learn
heatmap generation. We firstly consider the architectures for generating the
multi-resolution heatmaps after obtaining the lowest-resolution feature maps.
Our second approach allows learning during the process of feature extraction in
which the heatmaps are generated at each resolution of the feature extractor.
The first and second approaches are referred to as multi-resolution heatmap
learning and multi-resolution feature map learning respectively. Our
architectures are simple yet effective, achieving good performance. We
conducted experiments on two common benchmarks for human pose estimation:

present a light-weight mechanism to estimate end-to-end delay in the network in
which the clocks of the switches are not synchronized. The mechanism aims at
providing high level of accuracy with lower communication overhead. We then
propose a contract-based framework using software-defined networking where the
components are associated with delay contracts and a resilience manager. The
proposed resilience management framework contains: (1) contracts which state
guarantees about components behaviors, (2) observers which are responsible to
detect contract failure (fault), (3) monitors to detect events such as run-time
changes in the delay requirements and link failure, (4) control logic to take
suitable decisions based on the type of the fault, (5) resilience manager to
decide response strategies containing the best course of action as per the
control logic decision. Finally, we present a delay-aware path finding
algorithm which is used to route/reroute the real-time flows to provide
resiliency in the case of faults and, to adapt to the changes in the network

produces trigonal and tetragonal distortions of the rigid cage and results in
the symmetry lowering of the fcc lattice in the dodecaborides. The
ferrodistortive dynamics in the boron sub-lattice generates both the collective
modes and quasilocal vibrations (rattling modes) of the heavy RE ions, causing
a modulation in the charge-carrier density and the emergence of dynamic charge
stripes. We consider their manifestations both in the properties of the
nonmagnetic reference compound LuB$_{12}$ and in the phase diagrams of the
$R\mathrm{B}_{12}$ antiferromagnets that exhibit multiple magnetic phases with
anisotropic field-angular phase diagrams in the form of the Maltese cross. We
also discuss the metal-insulator transitions in YbB$_{12}$ and Yb-based
dodecaborides in terms of the instability of the Yb 4$f$-electron

boron cage, providing one more mechanism of the charge and spin fluctuations.
The experimental results challenge the established Kondo-insulator scenario in

paradigm provides the adversary with greater control over the target model,
thereby exposing, in a wide range of scenarios, threats against deep learning
models that cannot be conducted by the conventional paradigms. We introduce
four different strategies to efficiently generate such attacks, and illustrate
our approach by extending multiple adversarial attack algorithms. We also
experimentally validate our approach for the spoken command classification task
and the Tweet emotion classification task, two exemplary machine learning
problems in the audio and text domain, respectively. Our results demonstrate
that we can closely approximate any probability distribution for the classes
while maintaining a high fooling rate and even prevent the attacks from being
detected by label-shift detection methods.

propagation is a challenge for Chinese NER while processing colloquial data

specializes in identifying entities from Chinese social media text, especially
by leveraging ambiguous information of word segmentation. Such uncertain
information contains all the potential segmentation states of a sentence that
provides a channel for the model to infer deep word-level characteristics. We
propose a trilogy (i.e., candidate position embedding -> position selective
attention -> adaptive word convolution) to encode uncertain word segmentation
information and acquire appropriate word-level representation. Experiments
results on the social media corpus show that our model alleviates the
segmentation error cascading trouble effectively, and achieves a significant
performance improvement of more than 2% over previous state-of-the-art methods.

enforces that peers periodically create a small proof of work to refresh their

Therefore, we propose a personalized re-ranking model for improving diversity

model can be easily deployed as a follow-up component after any existing

personalized Determinental Point Process (DPP). DPP has been applied in some
recommender systems to improve the diversity and increase the user

individual propensities to the diversity. To overcome such limitation, our
re-ranking model proposes a personalized DPP to model the trade-off between
accuracy and diversity for each individual user. We implement and deploy the
personalized DPP model on alarge scale industrial recommender system.
Experimental results on both offline and online demonstrate the efficiency of

framework unifying the frameworks of K\""ahler-Ricci solitons and cscK metrics.
This article consists of two ingredients.
  On one hand, we develop a foundational framework concerning `derivative of
relative equivariant intersection', which we call equivariant calculus. A core
claim in equivariant calculus is a convergence result for some infinite series
in equivariant cohomology, which is obtained by relative equivariant
intersections. Our proof is based on some observations on deRham-Cartan model
of equivariant locally finite homology. This framework furnishes a language to
describe $\mu$K-stability. We in particular conclude the $\mu$K-semistability
of $\mu$-cscK manifolds with respect to general test configurations.
  On the other hand, we introduce an equivariant character
$\mathbf{\check{\mu}}^\lambda$ called $\mu$-character for equivariant family of
polarized schemes, motivated by the $\mu$-volume functional introduced in the
paper arXiv1902.00664 as a generalization of Tian-Zhu's functional in the
theory of K\""ahler-Ricci soliton. The equivariant derivative of the
$\mu$-character derive $\mu$-Futaki invariant for general test configuration,
and furthermore, it also produces an analogue of the equivariant first Chern
class of CM line bundle for family of polarized schemes, which is irrational
and hence cannot be realized as a $\mathbb{Q}$-line bundle in our general
$\mu$K-stability setup.

Prabhakaran et al. (2019) [arXiv:1906.06129] suggested otherwise. In this work,
we are aiming to quantify the ice-nucleating potential using high-fidelity flow
simulation techniques around a single hydrometeor and use favorable
considerations to upscale the effects to a collective of ice particles in
clouds. While we find that ice nucleation may be enhanced in the vicinity of a
warm hydrometeor by several orders of magnitude and that the affected volume of
air is much larger than previously estimated, it is very unlikely that this
effect alone causes the rapid enhancement of ice nucleation observed in some
types of clouds, mainly due to the low initial volumetric ice concentration.
Nonetheless, it is suggested to implement this effect into existing cloud
models in order to investigate second-order effects such as ice nucleus
preactivation or enhancement after the onset of glaciation.

  Very High Resolution Satellite Images by Data Standardization","Accepted at CVPR EarthVision Workshop 2020",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation has recently been actively
studied to increase the generalization capabilities of deep learning models.
The vast majority of the domain adaptation methods tackle single-source case,
where the model trained on a single source domain is adapted to a target
domain. However, these methods have limited practical real world applications,
since usually one has multiple source domains with different data
distributions. In this work, we deal with the multi-source domain adaptation
problem. Our method, namely StandardGAN, standardizes each source and target
domains so that all the data have similar data distributions. We then use the
standardized source domains to train a classifier and segment the standardized
target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on two remote sensing data
sets, in which the first one consists of multiple cities from a single country,
and the other one contains multiple cities from different countries. Our
experimental results show that the standardized data generated by StandardGAN
allow the classifiers to generate significantly better segmentation.

decentralised platform enabling trustworthy assignments of items and prices

schemes to provide strong privacy guarantees while making bidders accountable.
It leverages the Ethereum blockchain for auditability, combining efficient
off-chain computations with novel, on-chain proofs of misbehaviour. Our

unit but leaving the mass partitions unaffected, have been for the first time
investigated by peripheral collisions of $^{112}$Sn ions accelerated up to
1\textit{A} GeV at the GSI facilities. The high-resolving power of the FRS
spectrometer allows us to obtain $(p, n)$-type isobaric charge-exchange cross
sections with an uncertainty of $3.5\%$ and to separate quasi-elastic and
inelastic components in the missing-energy spectra of the ejectiles. The
inelastic component is associated to the excitation of the $\Delta$(1232)
isobar resonance and the emission of pions in s-wave both in the target and
projectile nucleus, while the quasi-elastic contribution is associated to the
nuclear spin-isospin response of nucleon-hole excitations. An apparent shift of
the $\Delta$-resonance peak of $\sim$63 MeV is observed when comparing the
missing-energy spectra obtained from the measurements with proton and carbon
targets. A detailed analysis, performed with a theoretical model for the
reactions, indicates that this observation can be simply interpreted as a
change in the relative magnitude between the contribution of the excitation of
the resonance in the target and in the projectile.

global convergence is guaranteed even for non-convex problems. Finally, our

only generate quantum states as solutions instead of their final classical

vectors normally will destroy the quantum advantage in most scenarios because
all existing tomographic methods require runtime that is polynomial with
respect to the state dimension. In this work, we present an efficient read-out
protocol that yields the classical vector form of the generated state, so it
will achieve the end-to-end advantage for those quantum algorithms. Our
protocol suits the case that the output state lies in the row space of the
input matrix, of rank $r$, that is stored in the quantum random access memory.
The quantum resources for decoding the state in $\ell^2$ norm with $\epsilon$
error require $\poly(r,1/\epsilon)$ copies of the output state and $\poly(r,
\kappa^r,1/\epsilon)$ queries to the input oracles, where $\kappa$ is the
condition number of the input matrix. With our read-out protocol, we completely
characterise the end-to-end resources for quantum linear equation solvers and
quantum singular value decomposition. One of our technical tools is an
efficient quantum algorithm for performing the Gram-Schmidt orthonormal

edition of the ASVspoof challenge series. This paper reports our attempts to
help explain these observations. The explanation is shown to lie in the level
of attention paid by each front-end to different sub-band components of the
spectrum. Thus far, surprisingly little has been learned about what artefacts
are being detected by spoofing countermeasures. Our work hence aims to shed
light upon signal or spectrum level artefacts that serve to distinguish
different forms of spoofing attack from genuine, bone fide speech. With a
better understanding of these artefacts we will be better positioned to design
more reliable countermeasures.

Poiseuille flow under Stokes regime. A neutrally buoyant, initially concentric
compound drop is released into a fully developed flow, where it migrates to its
equilibrium position. Based on the results, we find that the core-shell
interaction affects the dynamics of both the core and the compound drop. During
the initial transient period, the core revolves about the center of the
compound drop due to the internal circulation inside the shell. At equilibrium,
depending upon the nature of the flow field inside the shell, we identify two
distinct core behaviors: stable state and limit-cycle state. In the stable
state, the core stops revolving and moves outward very slowly. The core in the
limit-cycle state continues to revolve in a nearly fixed orbit with no further
inward motion. We also find that the migration of the compound drop affects the
eccentricity of the core significantly. A comparison with the simple drop
reveals that the core enhances the deformation of the compound drop. The
outward moving core in stable state pushes the compound drop towards the walls,
and the revolving core in limit-cycle state makes the compound drop to
oscillate at its equilibrium position. From the parametric study, we find that
the core affects the compound drop dynamics only at intermediate sizes, and
increase in any parameter sufficiently causes a transition from limit-cycle
state to stable state.

against malicious attacks. Most sensitive systems employ instances of them
(e.g. Firewalls) to secure the network perimeter and filter out attacks or
unwanted traffic. A firewall, similar to classifiers, has a boundary to decide
which traffic sample is normal and which one is not. This boundary is defined
by configuration and is managed by a set of rules which occasionally might also
filter normal traffic by mistake. However, for some applications, any
interruption of the normal operation is not tolerable e.g. in power plants,
water distribution systems, gas or oil pipelines, etc. In this paper, we design
a learning firewall that receives labelled samples and configures itself
automatically by writing preventive rules in a conservative way that avoids
false alarms. We design a new family of classifiers, called
$\mathfrak{z}$-classifiers, that unlike the traditional ones which merely
target accuracy, rely on zero false-positive as the metric for decision making.
First, we analytically show why naive modification of current classifiers like
SVM does not yield acceptable results and then, propose a generic iterative
algorithm to accomplish this goal. We use the proposed classifier with CART at
its heart to build a firewall for a Power Grid Monitoring System. To further
evaluate the algorithm, we additionally test it on KDD CUP'99 dataset. The
results confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

  1. For $t=1$, there is a deterministic algorithm that solves the problem
within $\widetilde{O}(D^2)$ rounds, provided that the graph is 3
edge-connected. This round complexity beats the natural barrier of $O(D^3)$

$\widetilde{O}(D^{O(t)})$-round algorithm against $t$ adversarial edges in
$(2t+1)$ edge-connected graphs.
  2. For expander graphs with minimum degree of $\Omega(t^2\log n)$, there is
an improved broadcast algorithm with $O(t \log ^2 n)$ rounds against $t$

properties of G-subgraphs obtained by employing the Karger's edge sampling

ecology. Quite often it acts to improve efficiency of biological reactions. One
example is the immune system signalling, where infected tissues release
chemokines attracting monocytes to fight invading bacteria. Another example is
reproduction, where eggs release pheromones that attract sperm. A macro scale
example is flower scent appealing to pollinators. In this paper we consider a
system of PDE designed to model such processes. Our interest is to quantify the
effect of chemotaxis on reaction rates compared to pure reaction-diffusion. We
limit consideration to surface chemotaxis, which is well motivated from the
point of view of many applications. Our results provide the first insight into
situations where chemotaxis can be crucial for reaction success, and where its
effect is likely to be limited. The proofs are based on new analytical tools; a
significant part of the paper is dedicated to building up the linear machinery
that can be useful in more general settings. In particular we establish precise
estimates on the rates of convergence to ground state for a class of
Fokker-Planck operators with potentials that grow at a logarithmic rate at
infinity.
  These estimates are made possible by a new sharp weak weighted Poincar\'e
inequality improving in particular a result of Bobkov and Ledoux.

general, nodes of ZH diagrams take parameters over C which determine the tensor

athletes have to complete a relatively long distance at a high speed in the
presence of direct opponents. To win such a race, athletes are motivated to
hide behind others to suppress energy consumption before a final moment of the
race. This situation seems to produce a social dilemma: players want to hide
behind others, whereas if a group of players attempts to do so, they may all
lose to other players that overtake them. To support that speed skaters are
involved in such a social dilemma, we analyzed video footage data for 14 mass
start skating races to find that skaters that hid behind others to avoid air
resistance for a long time before the final lap tended to win. Furthermore, the
finish rank of the skaters in mass start races was independent of the record of
the same skaters in time-trial races measured in the absence of direct
opponents. The results suggest that how to strategically cope with a skater's
dilemma may be a key determinant for winning long-distance and high-speed races

(IM) problem asks for a seed set $S$ of $k$ nodes from $G$ to maximize the
expected number of nodes influenced via a propagation model. The majority of
the existing algorithms for the IM problem are developed only under the
non-adaptive setting, i.e., where all $k$ seed nodes are selected in one batch
without observing how they influence other users in real world. In this paper,
we study the adaptive IM problem where the $k$ seed nodes are selected in
batches of equal size $b$, such that the $i$-th batch is identified after the
actual influence results of the former $i-1$ batches are observed. In this
paper, we propose the first practical algorithm for the adaptive IM problem
that could provide the worst-case approximation guarantee of
$1-\mathrm{e}^{\rho_b(\varepsilon-1)}$, where $\rho_b=1-(1-1/b)^b$ and
$\varepsilon \in (0, 1)$ is a user-specified parameter. In particular, we
propose a general framework AdaptGreedy that could be instantiated by any
existing non-adaptive IM algorithms with expected approximation guarantee. Our
approach is based on a novel randomized policy that is applicable to the
general adaptive stochastic maximization problem, which may be of independent
interest. In addition, we propose a novel non-adaptive IM algorithm called EPIC
which not only provides strong expected approximation guarantee, but also
presents superior performance compared with the existing IM algorithms.
Meanwhile, we clarify some existing misunderstandings in recent work and shed
light on further study of the adaptive IM problem. We conduct experiments on

the experimental results strongly corroborate the superiorities and

environment is fundamentally a binary property; that is to say, an environment
can either support the metabolic processes of a given organism or not. The
habitability of different environments, they argue, may have different degrees
that could be determined at least in theory by answering the question: 'is this
environment habitable to a given organism?' 'More' or 'less' habitable
environments could then be related by the number of yes or no answers given to
what is fundamentally a series of binary questions and decisions. In my
opinion, there are at least three implicit assumptions made for this line of
reasoning that are implausible and that sabotage the conclusions. The first is
in the genetic diversity of the organisms, which I argue is fundamentally
continuous in nature and a binary construction of the sample is not meaningful.
The second misconception is in the assumption that an ecosystem can be
decomposed into subsets of independent samples. The third problem is in the
definition of an environment. The question of the environment is a continuous
one in both space and time and thus any concept constructed to be applicable to
a sample of environments must be continuous as well. In summary, the question
of whether habitability is a binary quantity or not brings us back to the
question of whether our concepts of life and of the environments that life
thrives in (or not) are binary or non-binary. I argue that the latter is the
case, and hence any modern concept of habitability must be continuous too.

the renormalized trajectory lies outside the diffeomorphism invariant subspace,
entering this subspace only in the infrared, below a dynamically generated

functions of the conformal factor, their form being determined by the RG. In
the ultraviolet, the coefficient functions are parametrised by an infinite

curvature is proportional to the thermodynamic volume. This allows us to
critically examine the applicability of geometric methods in black hole
thermodynamics in extended phase space. We show how several standard features
that are expected to hold in normal fluid systems impose severe restrictions on
the black hole parameters, leading to the fact that several results in the
current literature on the geometry of thermodynamics in extended phase space
may be physically invalid. These are true for both charged and rotating AdS
black holes. As a by-product of our analysis, we examine a conjecture regarding
the equality of the correlation lengths of co-existing phases near criticality,
in charged AdS black hole backgrounds, and find reasonable validity.

exist, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Yet, most of the
current literature and open datasets only deal with electro-optical (optical)
data for different detection and segmentation tasks at high spatial
resolutions. optical data is often the preferred choice for geospatial
applications, but requires clear skies and little cloud cover to work well.
Conversely, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors have the unique capability
to penetrate clouds and collect during all weather, day and night conditions.
Consequently, SAR data are particularly valuable in the quest to aid disaster
response, when weather and cloud cover can obstruct traditional optical
sensors. Despite all of these advantages, there is little open data available
to researchers to explore the effectiveness of SAR for such applications,
particularly at very-high spatial resolutions, i.e. <1m Ground Sample Distance

  To address this problem, we present an open Multi-Sensor All Weather Mapping

SAR and optical). The dataset and challenge focus on mapping and building
footprint extraction using a combination of these data sources. MSAW covers 120
km^2 over multiple overlapping collects and is annotated with over 48,000
unique building footprints labels, enabling the creation and evaluation of

observations of the two atomic lines HI and [CI] as well as molecular lines
observations in 13CO in the 1--0 and 3--2 transitions. The analysis comprises
investigations of the kinematic properties of the different tracers, estimates
of the mass flow rates, velocity structure functions, a Histogram of Oriented
Gradients (HOG) study as well as comparisons to simulations. Results: The
central IRDC is embedded in a more diffuse envelope of cold neutral medium
(CNM) traced by HI self-absorption (HISA) and molecular gas. The spectral line
data as well as the HOG and structure function analysis indicate a possible
kinematic decoupling of the HI from the other gas compounds. Spectral analysis
and position-velocity diagrams reveal two velocity components that converge at
the position of the IRDC. Estimated mass flow rates appear rather constant from
the cloud edge toward the center. The velocity structure function analysis is
consistent with gas flows being dominated by the formation of hierarchical
structures. Conclusions: The observations and analysis are consistent with a
picture where the IRDC G28 is formed at the center of two converging gas flows.
While the approximately constant mass flow rates are consistent with a
self-similar, gravitationally driven collapse of the cloud, external
compression by, e.g., spiral arm shocks or supernovae explosions cannot be
excluded yet. Future investigations should aim at differentiating the origin of
such converging gas flows.

sets of vertices of a graph as for instance: dominating sets, induced
matchings, perfect codes, independent sets or irredundant sets. Bounds on the
number of sets of any such family of sets are interesting from a combinatorial
point of view and have algorithmic applications. Many such bounds on different
families of sets over different classes of graphs are already provided in the
literature. In particular, Rote recently showed that the number of minimal
dominating sets in trees of order $n$ is at most $95^{\frac{n}{13}}$ and that
this bound is asymptotically sharp up to a multiplicative constant. We build on
his work to show that what he did for minimal dominating sets can be done for
any family of sets definable by a monadic second order formula.
  We first show that, for any monadic second order formula over graphs that
characterizes a given kind of subset of its vertices, the maximal number of
such sets in a tree can be expressed as the \textit{growth rate of a bilinear
system}. This mostly relies on well known links between monadic second order
logic over trees and tree automata and basic tree automata manipulations. Then
we show that this ""growth rate"" of a bilinear system can be approximated from
above.We then use our implementation of this result to provide bounds on the
number of independent dominating sets, total perfect dominating sets, induced
matchings, maximal induced matchings, minimal perfect dominating sets, perfect
codes and maximal irredundant sets on trees. We also solve a question from D.
Y. Kang et al. regarding $r$-matchings and improve a bound from G\'orska and
Skupie\'n on the number of maximal matchings on trees. Remark that this
approach is easily generalizable to graphs of bounded tree width or clique
width (or any similar class of graphs where tree automata are meaningful).

independently left-truncated and right-censored survival data to estimating the
transition probability matrix of a time-inhomogeneous Markov model with finite
state space. Such multi-state models have a wide range of applications for
modelling complex courses of a disease over the course of time, but the Markov
assumption may often be in doubt. If censoring is entirely unrelated to the
multi-state data, it has been noted that the Aalen-Johansen estimator,
standardized by the initial empirical distribution of the multi-state model,
still consistently estimates the state occupation probabilities. Recently, this
result has been extended to transition probabilities using landmarking, which
is, inter alia, useful for dynamic prediction. We complement these results in
three ways. Firstly, delayed study entry is a common phenomenon in
observational studies, and we extend the earlier results to multi-state data
also subject to left-truncation. Secondly, we present a rigorous proof of
consistency of the Aalen-Johansen estimator for state occupation probabilities,
on which also correctness of the landmarking approach hinges, correcting,
simplifying and extending the earlier result. Thirdly, our rigorous proof
motivates wild bootstrap resampling. Our developments for left-truncation are
motivated by a prospective observational study on the occurrence and the impact
of a multi-resistant infectious organism in patients undergoing surgery. Both
the real data example and simulation studies are presented. Studying wild
bootstrap is motivated by the fact that, unlike drawing with replacement from
the data, it is desirable to have a technique that works both with non-Markov
models subject to random left-truncation and right-censoring and with Markov
models where left-truncation and right-censoring need not be entirely random.

approximations we find three main phases that differ in the absolute
magnetization and the size of the largest component: a consensus phase, a
coexistence phase, and a dynamical fragmentation phase. More detailed analysis
reveals inner differences in these phases, allowing us to divide two of them
further. In the consensus phase we can distinguish between a weak or
alternating consensus (switching between two opposite consensus states), and a
strong consensus, in which the system remains in the same state for the whole
realization of the stochastic dynamics. Additionally, weak and strong consensus
phases scale differently with the system size. The strong consensus phase
exists for superlinear interactions and it is the only consensus phase that
survives in the thermodynamic limit. In the coexistence phase we distinguish a
fully-mixing phase (both states well mixed in the network) and a structured
coexistence phase, where the number of links connecting nodes in different
states (active links) drops significantly due to the formation of two
homogeneous communities of opposite states connected by a few links. The
structured coexistence phase is an example of emergence of community structure
from not exclusively topological dynamics, but coevolution. Our numerical
observations are supported by an analytical description using a pair
approximation approach and an ad-hoc calculation for the transition between the
coexistence and dynamical fragmentation phases. Our work shows how simple
interaction rules including the joint effect of non-linearity, noise, and
coevolution lead to complex structures relevant in the description of social

blocked, decreasing the observed flux from the star. The same is expected to
occur when observing the stellar radio flux. However, at radio wavelengths, the
planet also radiates, depending on its temperature, and thus modifies the
transit depths. We explore this scenario simulating the radio lightcurves of
transits of hot-Jupiters, Kepler-17b and WASP-12b, around solar-like stars. We
calculated the bremsstrahlung radio emission at 17, 100, and 400 GHz originated
from the star, considering a solar atmospheric model. The planetary radio
emission was calculated modelling the planets in two scenarios: as a blackbody
or with a dense and hot extended atmosphere. In both cases the planet radiates
and contributes to the total radio flux. For a blackbody planet, the transit
depth is in the order of 2-4% and it is independent of the radio frequency.
Hot-Jupiters planets with atmospheres appear bigger and brighter in radio, thus
having a larger contribution to the total flux of the system. Therefore, the
transit depths are larger than in the case of blackbody planets, reaching up to
8% at 17 GHz. Also the transit depth is frequency-dependent. Moreover, the
transit caused by the planet passing behind the star is deeper than when the
planet transits in front of the star, being as large as 18% at 400GHz. In all
cases, the contribution of the planetary radio emission to the observed flux is
evident when the planet transits behind the star.

paper, we propose an adaptive evaluation framework to efficiently evaluate
autonomous vehicles in adversarial environments generated by deep reinforcement

ensemble models to represent different local optimums for diversity. We then
utilize a nonparametric Bayesian method to cluster the adversarial policies.
The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that
involves frequent interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding
vehicles. Results show that the adversarial scenarios generated by our method
significantly degrade the performance of the tested vehicles. We also
illustrate different patterns of generated adversarial environments, which can
be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles.

be heterogeneous in size and direction across regions. However, while many

a nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem. Therefore any EIT image
reconstruction method needs to be regularized, typically resulting in blurred
images. One promising application is stroke-EIT, or classification of stroke
into either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke involves a blood clot,
preventing blood flow to a part of the brain causing a low-conductivity region.
Hemorrhagic stroke means bleeding in the brain causing a high-conductivity
region. In both cases the symptoms are identical, so a cost-effective and
portable classification device is needed. Typical EIT are not optimal for
stroke-EIT because of blurriness. This paper explores the possibilities of
machine learning in improving the classification results. Two paradigms are
compared: (a) learning from the EIT data, that is Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN)
maps and (b) extracting robust features from data and learning from them. The
features of choice are Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection (VHED) functions
[Greenleaf {\it et al.}, Analysis \& PDE 11, 2018] that have a geometric
interpretation and whose computation from EIT data does not involve calculating
a full image of the conductivity. We report the measures of accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity of the networks trained with EIT data and VHED

better classification results than the black-box paradigm (a).

the presence of carbon rings with more than six atoms. Some examples of

we investigated the stability of germanium (Ge) schwarzites using density
functional theory with GGA exchange-correlation functional. We chose one

In contrast, we propose a fully unsupervised methodology based on robust

estimation of the rigid transformation between two point sets and we describe
two algorithms, one based on a mixture between a Gaussian and a uniform
distribution, and another one based on the generalized Student's
t-distribution. We show that these methods are robust to up to 50% outliers,
which makes them suitable for mapping a face, from an unknown pose to a frontal
pose, in the presence of facial expressions and occlusions. Using these methods
in conjunction with large datasets of face images, we build a statistical
frontal facial model and an associated parametric confidence metric, eventually
used for performance analysis. We empirically show that the proposed pipeline
is neither method-biased nor data-biased, and that it can be used to assess

topology of the order parameter, topology of the Fermi surface, the spectrum of
bulk and edge Fermionic excitations, and the structure of the impurity
potential. In the case of electronic heat transport, impurities induce an
anomalous (zero-field) thermal Hall conductivity that is easily orders of
magnitude larger than the quantized edge contribution. The effect originates
from branch-conversion scattering of Bogoliubov quasiparticles by the chiral
order parameter, induced by potential scattering. The former transfers angular
momentum between the condensate and the excitations that transport heat. The
anomalous thermal Hall conductivity is shown to depend to the structure of the
electron-impurity potential, as well as the winding number, $\nu$, of the
chiral order parameter, $\Delta(p)=|\Delta(p)|\,e^{i\nu\phi_{p}}$. The results
provide quantitative formulae for interpreting heat transport experiments
seeking to identify broken T and P symmetries, as well as the topology of the
order parameter for chiral superconductors.

(NLP) analyses in clinical applications is that a concept can be referenced in
various forms across different texts. This paper introduces Multi-Ontology
Refined Embeddings (MORE), a novel hybrid framework for incorporating domain
knowledge from multiple ontologies into a distributional semantic model,
learned from a corpus of clinical text.
  Materials and Methods: We use the RadCore and MIMIC-III free-text datasets
for the corpus-based component of MORE. For the ontology-based part, we use the
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) ontology and three state-of-the-art
ontology-based similarity measures. In our approach, we propose a new learning
objective, modified from the Sigmoid cross-entropy objective function.
  Results and Discussion: We evaluate the quality of the generated word
embeddings using two established datasets of semantic similarities among
biomedical concept pairs. On the first dataset with 29 concept pairs, with the
similarity scores established by physicians and medical coders, MORE's
similarity scores have the highest combined correlation (0.633), which is 5.0%
higher than that of the baseline model and 12.4% higher than that of the best
ontology-based similarity measure.On the second dataset with 449 concept pairs,
MORE's similarity scores have a correlation of 0.481, with the average of four
medical residents' similarity ratings, and that outperforms the skip-gram model
by 8.1% and the best ontology measure by 6.9%.

velocity dispersions of stars in the Milky Way, from combined studies of
complementary surveys including GALAH, LAMOST, APOGEE, the NASA $Kepler$ and K2
missions, and $Gaia$ DR2. We find that different stellar samples, even though
they target different tracer populations and employ a variety of age estimation
techniques, follow the same set of fundamental relations. We provide the
clearest evidence to date that, in addition to the well-known dependence on
stellar age, the velocity dispersions of stars depend on orbital angular
momentum $L_z$, metallicity and height above the plane $|z|$, and are well
described by a multiplicatively separable functional form. The dispersions have
a power-law dependence on age with exponents of 0.441$\pm 0.007$ and 0.251$\pm
0.006$ for $\sigma_z$ and $\sigma_R$ respectively, and the power law is valid
even for the oldest stars. For the solar neighborhood stars, the apparent break
in the power law for older stars, as seen in previous studies, is due to the
anti-correlation of $L_z$ with age. The dispersions decrease with increasing
$L_z$ until we reach the Sun's orbital angular momentum, after which $\sigma_z$
increases (implying flaring in the outer disc) while $\sigma_R$ flattens. The
dispersions increase with decreasing metallicity, suggesting that the
dispersions increase with birth radius. The dispersions also increase linearly
with $|z|$. The same set of relations that work in the solar neighborhood also
work for stars between $3<R/{\rm kpc}<20$. Finally, the high-[$\alpha$/Fe]
stars follow the same relations as the low-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars.

  In this paper we prove that for a comeager set of initial data in the weak

given by a free flow where trajectories are disjoint straight lines.
  Indeed, such an existence and uniqueness result holds for a broader class of
solutions decreasing their kinetic energy, which we call dissipative solutions,

solve multiple optimization tasks concurrently by means of a single search

genetic material, thereby forging the Transfer Optimization field. In this
context, Evolutionary Multitasking addresses this paradigm by resorting to
concepts from Evolutionary Computation. Within this specific branch, approaches
such as the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has lately gained a
notable momentum when tackling multiple optimization tasks. This work
contributes to this trend by proposing the first adaptation of the recently
introduced Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm II (MFEA-II) to
permutation-based discrete optimization environments. For modeling this
adaptation, some concepts cannot be directly applied to discrete search spaces,
such as parent-centric interactions. In this paper we entirely reformulate such
concepts, making them suited to deal with permutation-based search spaces
without loosing the inherent benefits of MFEA-II. The performance of the
proposed solver has been assessed over 5 different multitasking setups,
composed by 8 datasets of the well-known Traveling Salesman (TSP) and
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP). The obtained results and their
comparison to those by the discrete version of the MFEA confirm the good
performance of the developed dMFEA-II, and concur with the insights drawn in
previous studies for continuous optimization.

evaluating a kernel on pairs of signals, e.g. to assess the similarity of an
incoming query to a database of known signals. This nonlinear evaluation can be
simplified to a linear inner product of the random Fourier features of those
signals: random projections followed by a periodic map, the complex
exponential. It is known that a simple quantization of those features
(corresponding to replacing the complex exponential by a different periodic map
that takes binary values, which is appealing for their transmission and
storage), distorts the approximated kernel, which may be undesirable in
practice. Our take-home message is that when the features of only one of the
two signals are quantized, the original kernel is recovered without distortion;
its practical interest appears in several cases where the kernel evaluations
are asymmetric by nature, such as a client-server scheme. Concretely, we
introduce the general framework of asymmetric random periodic features, where
the two signals of interest are observed through random periodic features:
random projections followed by a general periodic map, which is allowed to be
different for both signals. We derive the influence of those periodic maps on
the approximated kernel, and prove uniform probabilistic error bounds holding
for all signal pairs from an infinite low-complexity set. Interestingly, our
results allow the periodic maps to be discontinuous, thanks to a new
mathematical tool, i.e. the mean Lipschitz smoothness. We then apply this
generic framework to semi-quantized kernel machines (where only one signal has
quantized features and the other has classical random Fourier features), for
which we show theoretically that the approximated kernel remains unchanged
(with the associated error bound), and confirm the power of the approach with
numerical simulations.

carried out that leads to dewetting, that is, owing to surface diffusion the Ni
and Cu sputtered layers simultaneously mix with each other and split into NiCu
nanoparticles at the nanotube surface. The approach allows for a full control
over key features of the alloyed nanoparticles such as their composition, work
function and cocatalytic ability towards $H_2$ generation. Dewetted-alloyed
cocatalytic nanoparticles composed of equal Ni and Cu amounts not only are
significantly more reactive than pure Ni or Cu nanoparticles, but also lead to
$H_2$ generation rates that can be comparable to those obtained by conventional
noble metal (Pt) decoration of TiO$_2$ nanotube arrays.

this principle for a wide range of higher-categorical structures, adapting
FOLDS-signatures to specify a general class of structures, and using two-level
type theory to treat all categorical dimensions uniformly. As in the previously
known case of 1-categories (which is an instance of our theory), the structures
themselves must satisfy a local univalence principle, stating that

call ""indiscernibilities"", using only the dependency structure rather than any

oxide-semiconductor-based photocatalytic hydrogen generation. In the present
work, we show that optimized high-temperature hydrogenation of commercially
available strontium titanate (SrTiO3) powder can be used to engineer an
intrinsic cocatalytic shell around nanoparticles that can create a
photocatalyst that is highly effective without the use of any additional
cocatalyst for hydrogen generation from neutral aqueous methanol solutions.
This intrinsic activation effect can also be observed for SrTiO3[100] single
crystal as well as Nb-doped SrTiO3 (100) single crystal. For all types of
SrTiO3 samples (nanopowders and either of the single crystals), hydrogenation
under optimum conditions leads to a surface-hydroxylated layer together with
lattice defects visible by transmission electron microscopy, electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and photoluminescence (PL). Active samples
provide states in a defective matrix -- this is in contrast to the inactive
defects formed in other reductive atmospheres. In aqueous media, active SrTiO3
samples show a significant negative shift of the flatband potential (in
photoelectrochemical as well as in capacitance data) and a lower
charge-transfer resistance for photoexcited electrons. We therefore ascribe the
remarkable cocatalyst-free activation of the material to a synergy between
thermodynamics (altered interface energetics induced by hydroxylation) and
kinetics (charge transfer mediation by suitable Ti3+ states).

statistics are derived. For this, a uniform reduction principle for the
sequential empirical process in a two-parameter Skorohod space equipped with a
weighted supremum norm is proved. Moreover, we compare the efficiency of rank
tests resulting from the consideration of different score functions. Under
Gaussianity, the asymptotic relative efficiency of rank-based tests with
respect to the CuSum test is 1, irrespective of the score function. Regarding
the practical implementation of rank-based change-point tests, we suggest to
combine self-normalized rank statistics with subsampling. The theoretical
results are accompanied by simulation studies that, in particular, allow for a
comparison of rank tests resulting from different score functions. With respect
to the finite sample performance of rank-based change-point tests, the Van der

pixel wide and detailed object contour, since this type of contour could be
analyzed using methods such as Fourier descriptors. Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are rarely used for contour tracing. However, we find CNNs are
tailor-made for this task and that's why we present the Walk the Lines (WtL)
algorithm, a standard regression CNN trained to follow object contours. To make
the first step, we train the CNN only on ship contours, but the principle is
also applicable to other objects. Input data are the image and the associated
object contour prediction of the recently published RefineContourNet. The WtL
gets a center pixel, which defines an input section and an angle for rotating
this section. Ideally, the center pixel moves on the contour, while the angle
describes upcoming directional contour changes. The WtL predicts its steps
pixelwise in a selfrouting way. To obtain a complete object contour the WtL
runs in parallel at different image locations and the traces of its individual
paths are summed. In contrast to the comparable Non-Maximum Suppression method,
our approach produces connected contours with finer details. Finally, the
object contour is binarized under the condition of being closed. In case all
procedures work as desired, excellent ship segmentations with high IoUs are
produced, showing details such as antennas and ship superstructures that are
easily omitted by other segmentation methods.

design for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems through
deep learning. Given the deep neural network (DNN) based noncoherent receiver,
the novelty of this work mainly lies in the multiuser waveform design at the
transmitter side. According to the signal format, the proposed deep learning
solutions can be divided into two groups. One group is called pilot-aided
waveform, where the information-bearing symbols are time-multiplexed with the
pilot symbols. The other is called learning-based waveform, where the multiuser
waveform is partially or even completely designed by deep learning algorithms.
Specifically, if the information-bearing symbols are directly embedded in the
waveform, it is called systematic waveform. Otherwise, it is called
non-systematic waveform, where no artificial design is involved. Simulation
results show that the pilot-aided waveform design outperforms the conventional
zero forcing receiver with least squares (LS) channel estimation on small-size
MU-MIMO systems. By exploiting the time-domain degrees of freedom (DoF), the
learning-based waveform design further improves the detection performance by at
least 5 dB at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. Moreover, it is found
that the traditional weight initialization method might cause a training
imbalance among different users in the learning-based waveform design. To
tackle this issue, a novel weight initialization method is proposed which
provides a balanced convergence performance with no complexity penalty.

it is dependent on the age: the younger stellar populations exhibit stronger
warp features than the old ones, accompanied with the warp amplitude $\gamma
({\rm age})$ decreasing with age and its first derivative $\dot{\gamma} ({\rm

at $-$5 degree without clear time evolution, which perfectly confirms some of

graphene in a perpendicular magnetic field. In doing so, we address the extent
to which these states survive in moir\'e systems and analyze the nature of the
transition. Through the use of a Peierls substitution, we determine the
Landau-level splitting for the moir\'e Hamiltonian, and study the structure of
the Chern bands for a range of magnetic flux per plaquette. We identify
topological flat bands in the spectrum at low energies, with numerically
tractable lattice geometries that can support the fractional quantum Hall
effect. As we tune the model, we find that the orbital-polarized $\nu=1/3$ and
$2/5$ states corresponding to the honeycomb Hofstadter model survive up to
$\approx 30\%$ of typical moir\'e superlattice parameters, beyond which they
transition into an insulating phase. We present evidence for this through
density matrix renormalization group calculations on an infinite cylinder, by
verifying the charge pumping, spectral flow, entanglement scaling, and
conformal field theory edge counting. We conclude that fractional quantum Hall
states from the Hofstadter model can persist up to hopping amplitudes of the

that the isotropy is favored through local ionic distortions of Cu and Zn - due

sold-liquid interfaces is difficult to control in artificial systems. The high
mobility of dissolved small molecules limits their residence at the interface,
typically restricting the self-assembly to systems under confinement or with
mobile tethers between the molecules and the surface. Small hydrogen-bonding
molecules can overcome these issues by exploiting group-effect stabilization to
achieve non-tethered self-assembly at hydrophobic interfaces. Significantly,
the weak molecular interactions with the solid makes it possible to influence
the interfacial hydrogen bond network, potentially creating a wide variety of
supramolecular structures. Here we investigate the nanoscale details of water
and alcohols mixtures self-assembling at the interface with graphite through
group effect. We explore the interplay between inter-molecular and surface
interactions by adding small amounts of foreign molecules able to interfere
with the hydrogen bond network and systematically varying the length of the
alcohol hydrocarbon chain. The resulting supramolecular structures forming at
room temperature are then examined using atomic force microscopy with insights
from computer simulations. We show that the group-based self-assembly approach
investigated here is general and can be reproduced on other substrates such as
molybdenum disulphide and graphene oxide, potentially making it relevant for a
wide variety of systems.

spinless particles, apart from interference terms, the symmetry of the wave

bosons display this effect, even for the dissipative regime but, for fermions,
backflow is not exhibited in any regime, dissipative and nodissipative. The
anti-symmetric character of the corresponding wave function seems to be strong
enough to prevent it. For bosons, backflow is also analyzed in terms of
fidelity of one-particle states which is a well-known property of two quantum
states. At very small values of fidelity, this effect is not seen even for

problem, since the information of the line art is highly sparse and abstracted
and there exists a strict requirement for the color and style consistency
between frames. Recently, a lot of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based
image-to-image translation methods for single line art colorization have
emerged. They can generate perceptually appealing results conditioned on line
art images. However, these methods can not be adopted for the purpose of
animation colorization because there is a lack of consideration of the
in-between frame consistency. Existing methods simply input the previous
colored frame as a reference to color the next line art, which will mislead the
colorization due to the spatial misalignment of the previous colored frame and
the next line art especially at positions where apparent changes happen. To
address these challenges, we design a kind of correlation matching feature
transfer model (called CMFT) to align the colored reference feature in a
learnable way and integrate the model into an U-Net based generator in a
coarse-to-fine manner. This enables the generator to transfer the layer-wise
synchronized features from the deep semantic code to the content progressively.
Extension evaluation shows that CMFT model can effectively improve the
in-between consistency and the quality of colored frames especially when the
motion is intense and diverse.

useful to support authorities in designing healthcare policies and lockdown
measures to contain its impact on public health and economy. In Italy, the
devised forecasts have been mostly based on a pure data-driven approach, by
fitting and extrapolating open data on the epidemic evolution collected by the
Italian Civil Protection Center. In this respect, SIR epidemiological models,
which start from the description of the nonlinear interactions between
population compartments, would be a much more desirable approach to understand
and predict the collective emergent response. The present contribution
addresses the fundamental question whether a SIR epidemiological model,
suitably enriched with asymptomatic and dead individual compartments, could be
able to provide reliable predictions on the epidemic evolution. To this aim, a
machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is
proposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set
of data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case
study. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model
predictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training,
and that further data are still required to achieve convergent -- and therefore
reliable -- predictions.

sites, which might affect energy conversion. We present in situ evidence of the
firehose instability in multiple reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail. The
observed proton beams accelerated in the direction parallel to magnetic field
and ion-scale fluctuations of whistler type imply the development of firehose
instability between two active reconnection sites. The linear wave dispersion
relation, estimated for the measured plasma parameters, indicates a positive
growth rate of firehose-related electromagnetic fluctuations. Simulations of
temporal evolution of the observed multiple reconnection by using a 2.5D
implicit particle-in-cell code show that, as the plasmoid formed between two
reconnection sites evolves, the plasma at its edge becomes anisotropic and
overcomes the firehose marginal stability threshold, leading to the generation
of magnetic field fluctuations. The combined results of observations and
simulations suggest that the firehose instability, operating between
reconnection sites, converts plasma kinetic energy into energy of magnetic
field fluctuations, counteracting the conversion of magnetic energy into plasma
energy occurring at reconnection sites. This suggests that magnetic energy
conversion in multiple reconnection can be less efficient than in the case of

liquids. In reduced dimensions, particular phases, such as the two-dimensional

exciting example of 2D ordered systems are skyrmion lattices, where in contrast
to previously studied 2D colloid systems, the skyrmion size and density can be
tuned by temperature and magnetic field. This allows us to drive the system
from a liquid phase to a hexatic phase as deduced from the analysis of the
hexagonal order. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of soft
disks, we determine the skyrmion interaction potentials and we find that the
simulations are able to reproduce the full two-dimensional phase behavior. This
shows that not only the static behavior of skyrmions is qualitatively well
described in terms of a simple two-dimensional model system but skyrmion
lattices are versatile and tunable two-dimensional model systems that allow for
studying phases and phase transitions in reduced dimensions.

efforts to develop paradigms and standard procedures to validate models,
difficulties may arise due to the sequential, manual and often biased nature of
the commonly adopted calibration and validation processes, thus slowing down
data collections, hampering the progress towards discovering new physics,
increasing expenses and possibly leading to misinterpretations of the
credibility and application ranges of proposed models. This work attempts to
introduce concepts from game theory and machine learning techniques to overcome
many of these existing difficulties. We introduce an automated meta-modeling
game where two competing AI agents systematically generate experimental data to
calibrate a given constitutive model and to explore its weakness, in order to
improve experiment design and model robustness through competition. The two
agents automatically search for the Nash equilibrium of the meta-modeling game
in an adversarial reinforcement learning framework without human intervention.
By capturing all possible design options of the laboratory experiments into a
single decision tree, we recast the design of experiments as a game of
combinatorial moves that can be resolved through deep reinforcement learning by
the two competing players. Our adversarial framework emulates idealized
scientific collaborations and competitions among researchers to achieve a
better understanding of the application range of the learned material laws and
prevent misinterpretations caused by conventional AI-based third-party

programming languages like Python and easy-to-use deep learning libraries like
Keras. These software libraries come pre-loaded with a variety of network
architectures, provide autodifferentiation, and support GPUs for fast and
efficient computation. As a result, a deep learning practitioner will favor
training a neural network model in Python, where these tools are readily
available. However, many large-scale scientific computation projects are
written in Fortran, making it difficult to integrate with modern deep learning
methods. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a software library, the
Fortran-Keras Bridge (FKB). This two-way bridge connects environments where
deep learning resources are plentiful, with those where they are scarce. The
paper describes several unique features offered by FKB, such as customizable
layers, loss functions, and network ensembles.
  The paper concludes with a case study that applies FKB to address open
questions about the robustness of an experimental approach to global climate
simulation, in which subgrid physics are outsourced to deep neural network
emulators. In this context, FKB enables a hyperparameter search of one hundred
plus candidate models of subgrid cloud and radiation physics, initially
implemented in Keras, to be transferred and used in Fortran. Such a process
allows the model's emergent behavior to be assessed, i.e. when fit
imperfections are coupled to explicit planetary-scale fluid dynamics. The
results reveal a previously unrecognized strong relationship between offline
validation error and online performance, in which the choice of optimizer
proves unexpectedly critical. This reveals many neural network architectures

containing titania particles have been reported to provide favorable charge
separation resulting in enhanced reaction efficiency. In the current work we
describe a one-step synthesis of Magneli-containing mixed phase nanoparticles
that carry directly integrated minute amounts of Pt. Phase optimized
nanoparticles that contain only a few hundred ppm Pt are very effective
photocatalysts for H$_2$ evolution (they provide a 50-100 times higher H$_2$
evolution than plain anatase loaded with a similar amount of Pt). These
photocatalysts are synthesized in a setup combining a hot-wall reactor that is
used for TiOx synthesis with a spark generator producing Pt nanoparticles.
Different reactor temperatures result in various phase ratios between anatase
and Magneli phases. The titania nanoparticles (ca. 24 - 53 nm) were
characterized using XRD, HRTEM, XPS and EPR spectra as well as ICP-OES
analysis. The best photocatalyst prepared at 900$^\circ$C (which consists of
mixed phase particles of 32% anatase, 11% rutile and 57% Magneli phases loaded
with 290 ppm of Pt) can provide a photocatalytic H$_2$ evolution rate of ca.
5432 micromol h$^{-1} g$^{-1}$ for UV and ca. 1670 micromol h$^{-1} g$^{-1}$
for AM1.5 illumination. For powders converted to higher amounts of Magneli
phases (1000$^\circ$C and 1100$^\circ$C), a drastic loss of the photocatalytic

under best conditions is ascribed to an effective synergy between
multi-junctions of Magneli titania and Pt that enable a much more effective
charge separation and reaction than conventional Pt/anatase junctions.
