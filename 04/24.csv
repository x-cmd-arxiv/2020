  Adversarial Attacks","8 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effective defense of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks remains
a challenging problem, especially under powerful white-box attacks. In this
paper, we develop a new method called ensemble generative cleaning with
feedback loops (EGC-FL) for effective defense of deep neural networks. The
proposed EGC-FL method is based on two central ideas. First, we introduce a
transformed deadzone layer into the defense network, which consists of an
orthonormal transform and a deadzone-based activation function, to destroy the
sophisticated noise pattern of adversarial attacks. Second, by constructing a
generative cleaning network with a feedback loop, we are able to generate an
ensemble of diverse estimations of the original clean image. We then learn a
network to fuse this set of diverse estimations together to restore the
original image. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach improves the state-of-art by large margins in both white-box and
black-box attacks. It significantly improves the classification accuracy for
white-box PGD attacks upon the second best method by more than 29% on the SVHN
dataset and more than 39% on the challenging CIFAR-10 dataset.

particles at colliders or at deviations from known observables at low energies.
In order to discover New Physics in precision measurements, both experimental
and theoretical uncertainties must be under full control. Laser spectroscopy
nowadays offers a tool to measure transition frequencies very precisely. For
certain molecular and atomic transitions the experimental technique permits a
clean study of possible deviations. Theoretical progress in recent years allows
us to compare ab initio calculations with experimental data. We study the
impact of a variety of New Physics scenarios on these observables and derive
novel constraints on many popular generic Standard Model extensions. As a
result, we find that molecular spectroscopy is not competitive with atomic
spectroscopy and neutron scattering to probe new electron-nucleus and
nucleus-nucleus interactions, respectively. Molecular and atomic spectroscopy
give similar bounds on new electron-electron couplings, for which, however,
stronger bounds can be derived from the magnetic moment of the electron. In
most of the parameter space H_2 molecules give stronger constraints than T_2 or
other isotopologues.

  Fast Radio Bursts","version accepted for publication in JCAP",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the evolution of the ionization fraction $x_e(z)$
during the epoch of reionization by using the dispersion measurements (DMs) of
fast radio bursts (FRBs). Different from the previous studies, here we turn to
consider the large-scale clustering information of observed DMs of FRB catalog,
which only needs the rough redshift distribution, instead of the exact redshift
information of each FRB. Firstly, we consider the instantaneous
``\texttt{tanh}'' model for $x_e(z)$ and find that including the
auto-correlation information of the mock catalog, about $10^4$ FRBs with the
intrinsic DM scatter of 100 $\rm pc/cm^3$ spanning 20\% of all sky, could
significantly improve the constraint on the width $\Delta_z$ of the model, when
comparing with that from the CMB data alone. The evolution shape of the
ionization fraction will be tightly narrowed, namely the duration of the epoch
of reionization has been shrunk, $z_{\rm dur}<2.24$ (95\% C.L.). Furthermore,
we also use another redshift-asymmetric reionization model and obtain that the
FRB mock catalog could measure the ionization fraction at $z=6$ precisely with
the $1\sigma$ error $\Delta x_e(z=6)=0.012$, which means that the large-scale
clustering information of observed DMs of FRB catalog is very sensitive to the
ionization fraction of the end of reionization epoch. We conclude that the
observation of high-redshift FRBs could be a complementary probe to study the
reionization history in the future.

decision-making across a number of logistic problems. With sufficient data,
single road-segment travel time can be well approximated. The challenge lies in
understanding how to aggregate such information over a route to arrive at the
route-distribution of travel time. We develop a novel statistical approach to
this problem. We show that, under general conditions, without assuming a
distribution of speed, travel time {divided by route distance follows a
Gaussian distribution with route-invariant population mean and variance. We
develop efficient inference methods for such parameters and propose
asymptotically tight population prediction intervals for travel time. Using
traffic flow information, we further develop a trip-specific Gaussian-based
predictive distribution, resulting in tight prediction intervals for short and
long trips. Our methods, implemented in an R-package, are illustrated in a
real-world case study using mobile GPS data, showing that our trip-specific and
population intervals both achieve the 95\% theoretical coverage levels.
Compared to alternative approaches, our trip-specific predictive distribution
achieves (a) the theoretical coverage at every level of significance, (b)
tighter prediction intervals, (c) less predictive bias, and (d) more efficient
estimation and prediction procedures. This makes our approach promising for
low-latency, large-scale transportation applications.

of inner body organs and blood vasculature, which is crucial for diagnosis and
treatment of diverse diseases. However, 3D systems require massive hardware due
to the huge number of transducer elements and consequent data size. This
increases cost significantly and limits both frame rate and image quality, thus
preventing 3D ultrasound from being common practice in clinics worldwide. A
recent study proposed a technique, called convolutional beamforming algorithm
(COBA), which obtains improved image quality while allowing notable element
reduction. COBA was developed and tested for 2D focused imaging using full and
sparse arrays. The later was referred to as sparse COBA (SCOBA). In this paper,
we build upon previous work and introduce a nonlinear beamformer for 3D
imaging, called COBA-3D, consisting of 2D spatial convolution of the in-phase
and quadrature received signals. The proposed technique considers
diverging-wave transmission, thus, achieves improved image resolution and
contrast compared with standard delay-and-sum beamforming, while enabling high
frame rate. Incorporating 2D sparse arrays into our method creates SCOBA-3D: a
sparse beamformer which offers significant element reduction and thus allows to
perform 3D imaging with the resources typically available for 2D setups. To
create 2D thinned arrays, we present a scalable and systematic way to design 2D
fractal sparse arrays. The proposed framework paves the way for affordable
ultrafast ultrasound devices that perform high-quality 3D imaging, as
demonstrated using phantom and ex-vivo data.

we investigate the possibility that the early/blue kilonova originated from the

post-merger evolution, we can follow for the first time the full mass ejection
process up to its final decline. We find that the baryon wind carries
$\simeq\!0.010\!-\!0.028\,M_\odot$ of unbound material, proving that the high
mass estimated for the blue kilonova can be achieved. We also find expansion
velocities of up to $\sim\!0.2\,c$, consistent with the lower end of the
observational estimates, and we discuss possible effects neglected here that
could further increase the final ejecta velocity. Overall, our results show
that the magnetically driven baryon wind represents a viable channel to explain

1000 complete images from the MNIST dataset. The results show that GP can learn
the distribution of the pixels with respect to a simple baseline predictor,
with no significant differences observed between the two neighborhoods. In the

employing a heterostructure, the inversion symmetry can be broken intrinsically
in bulk SRO by introducing defects. In this study THE is observed in 60 nm
thick SRO films, in which defects and lattice distortions are introduced by
helium ion irradiation. The irradiated SRO films exhibit a pronounced THE in a
wide temperature range from 5 K to 80 K. These observations can be attributed
to the emergence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as a result of artificial
inversion symmetry breaking associated to the lattice defect engineering. The
creation and control of the THE in oxide single layers can be realized by ex

  Accounting for Tactic Volatility",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When self-adaptive systems encounter changes within their surrounding
environments, they enact tactics to perform necessary adaptations. For example,
a self-adaptive cloud-based system may have a tactic that initiates additional
computing resources when response time thresholds are surpassed, or there may
be a tactic to activate a specific security measure when an intrusion is
detected. In real-world environments, these tactics frequently experience
tactic volatility which is variable behavior during the execution of the
tactic.
  Unfortunately, current self-adaptive approaches do not account for tactic
volatility in their decision-making processes, and merely assume that tactics
do not experience volatility. This limitation creates uncertainty in the
decision-making process and may adversely impact the system's ability to
effectively and efficiently adapt. Additionally, many processes do not properly
account for volatility that may effect the system's Service Level Agreement
(SLA). This can limit the system's ability to act proactively, especially when
utilizing tactics that contain latency.
  To address the challenge of sufficiently accounting for tactic volatility, we
propose a Tactic Volatility Aware (TVA) solution. Using Multiple Regression
Analysis (MRA), TVA enables self-adaptive systems to accurately estimate the
cost and time required to execute tactics. TVA also utilizes Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for time series forecasting, allowing the
system to proactively maintain specifications.

accuracy may vary across the experimental domain. To optimize experimental
design, and so to ensure that the substantial resources necessary for modern
experiments are focused on acquiring the most valuable data, both the theory
uncertainty and the expected pattern of experimental errors must be considered.
We develop a Bayesian approach to this problem, and apply it to the example of
proton Compton scattering. Chiral Effective Field Theory ($\chi$EFT) predicts
the functional form of the scattering amplitude for this reaction, so that the
electromagnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon can be inferred from data. With
increasing photon energy, both experimental rates and sensitivities to
polarizabilities increase, but the accuracy of $\chi$EFT decreases. Our
physics-based model of $\chi$EFT truncation errors is combined with present
knowledge of the polarizabilities and reasonable assumptions about experimental
capabilities at HI$\gamma$S and MAMI to assess the information gain from
measuring specific observables at specific kinematics, \emph{i.e.}, to
determine the relative amount by which new data are apt to shrink
uncertainties. The strongest gains would likely come from new data on the spin
observables $\Sigma_{2x}$ and $\Sigma_{2x^\prime}$ at $\omega\simeq140$ to
$200$ MeV and $40^\circ$ to $120^\circ$. These would tightly constrain
$\gamma_{E1E1}-\gamma_{E1M2}$. New data on the differential cross section
between $100$ and $200$\,MeV and over a wide angle range will substantially
improve constraints on $\alpha_{E1}-\beta_{M1}$, $\gamma_\pi$ and
$\gamma_{M1M1}-\gamma_{M1E2}$. Good signals also exist around $160$ MeV for
$\Sigma_3$ and $\Sigma_{2z^\prime}$. Such data will be pivotal in the
continuing quest to pin down the scalar polarizabilities and refine
understanding of the spin polarizabilities.

longitudinally and negligible radially. Such anisotropy is ensured by cellulose
microfibrils (CMF) reinforcing the cell wall in the hoop direction. To maintain
the cell's integrity during growth, new wall material including CMF must be
continually deposited. We develop a mathematical model representing the cell as
a cylindrical pressure vessel and the cell wall as a fibre-reinforced viscous
sheet, explicitly including the mechano-sensitive angle of CMF deposition. The
model incorporates interactions between turgor, external forces, CMF
reorientation during wall extension, and matrix stiffening. Using the model, we

the nearby, bright, Sun-like (G3V) star HD~108236 using data from the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We present transit photometry,
reconnaissance and precise Doppler spectroscopy as well as high-resolution
imaging, to validate the planetary nature of the objects transiting HD~108236,
also known as the TESS Object of Interest (TOI) 1233. The innermost planet is a
possibly-rocky super-Earth with a period of $3.79523_{-0.00044}^{+0.00047}$
days and has a radius of $1.586\pm0.098$ $R_\oplus$. The outer planets are
sub-Neptunes, with potential gaseous envelopes, having radii of
$2.068_{-0.091}^{+0.10}$ $R_\oplus$, $2.72\pm0.11$ $R_\oplus$, and
$3.12_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$ $R_\oplus$ and periods of
$6.20370_{-0.00052}^{+0.00064}$ days, $14.17555_{-0.0011}^{+0.00099}$ days, and
$19.5917_{-0.0020}^{+0.0022}$ days, respectively. With V and K$_{\rm s}$
magnitudes of 9.2 and 7.6, respectively, the bright host star makes the
transiting planets favorable targets for mass measurements and, potentially,
for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy. HD~108236 is
the brightest Sun-like star in the visual (V) band known to host four or more
transiting exoplanets. The discovered planets span a broad range of planetary
radii and equilibrium temperatures, and share a common history of insolation
from a Sun-like star ($R_\star = 0.888 \pm 0.017$ R$_\odot$, $T_{\rm eff} =
5730 \pm 50$ K), making HD 108236 an exciting, opportune cosmic laboratory for
testing models of planet formation and evolution.

rules for the minimum fill-in problem, which significantly reduce the size of
the graph while producing an equivalent (or near-equivalent) instance. By
applying both new and existing data reduction rules exhaustively before nested
dissection, we obtain improved quality and at the same time large improvements

the state-of-the-art significantly: it not only yields better elimination

GeVs). The latter, the shower mode, measures coordinates and arrival time of
each particle hitting the carpet for a complete shower reconstruction at an

study of the thermodynamics condensation of dust grains in distinct stellar
environments with the Galactic chemical evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy. The
Galaxy is evolved in terms of elemental evolution resulting from stellar
nucleosynthetic contributions of several generations of stars. Based on the
elemental composition of the evolving Galaxy, the relative abundances of the
major constituents of interstellar dust are assessed. The major aim is to
redistribute the various condensable elements at any epoch during the evolution
of the Galaxy into various grain constituents and understand their abundance
evolution based on a mass-balance formalism. We also performed thermodynamical
equilibrium condensation calculations to understand the stellar origin of
various grain constituents that could carry the isotopic signatures of the
various stellar nucleosynthetic sources. This is perhaps a novel attempt to
estimate the bulk dust mass budget in the evolving Galaxy. The normalized mass
of the Galactic dust is predicted to decrease with the increase in distance
from the Galactic centre. It increases over time. The supernovae SN Ia are
predicted as the most prominent sources of Fe-dust mass, the supernovae SN

redshifted towards the detector most sensitive band. We study the redshift
dependence of information about neutron star matter and find that single-scale

measured from the distant weak sources from $z\sim 1$.

$\sim$ 4, 000 K). We combined thousands of spectrally resolved lines observed
during one night with the HARPS-N spectrograph (R $\sim$ 115, 000), mounted at
the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We introduce a novel statistical approach to
extract the planetary parameters from the binary mask cross-correlation
analysis. We also adapt the concept of contribution function to the context of
high spectral resolution observations, to identify the location in the
planetary atmosphere where the detected emission originates. The average
planetary line profile intersected by a stellar G2 binary mask was found in
emission with a contrast of 84 $\pm$ 14 ppm relative to the planetary plus
stellar continuum (40 $\pm$ 5$\%$ relative to the planetary continuum only).
This result unambiguously indicates the presence of an atmospheric thermal
inversion. Finally, assuming a modelled temperature profile previously
published (Lothringer et al. 2018), we show that an iron abundance consistent
with a few times the stellar value explains the data well. In this scenario,
the iron emission originates at the $10^{-3}$-$10^{-5}$ bar level.

the Dirac points when graphene is exposed to circularly polarized light. Using
Keldysh-Floquet Green's functions, we develop a theoretical framework to
calculate the time-averaged RKKY coupling under weak periodic drives and show
that its magnitude in undoped graphene can be decreased controllably by
increasing the driving strength, while mostly maintaining its ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic character. In doped graphene, we find RKKY oscillations with
a period that is tunable by the driving field. When a sufficiently strong drive
is turned on that brings the Fermi level completely within the dynamically
opened gap, the behavior of the RKKY coupling changes qualitatively from that
of doped to undoped irradiated graphene.

evolution of epidemics, to determine the potential and severity of an outbreak,
and to provide critical information for identifying the type of disease
interventions and intensity. One of the widely used mathematical models of
long-term spreading of epidemics are the so-called deterministic compartmental
models (SIR/SEIR type models). One of the main purposes of applying such models
is to assess how the expensive restriction measures imposed by the authorities
(home and social isolation/quarantine, travel restrictions, etc.) can
effectively reduce the control reproduction number of the disease and its
transmission risk. However the classical SIR/SEIR models have been primarily
studied in what may be called stationary case, where the main parameters, the
Transmission rate Beta (reflecting the virus spread by infected individuals)
and the Removed rate Gamma (reflecting the hospitalization/isolation measures)
remain constant during the whole period of interest. Hence, it is important to
extend the classical SIR/SEIR models by creating new ansatzes for the dynamics
of the transmission rates Beta(t) (which we will call further just Beta) and
removed rates Gamma(t) (which we will call further just Gamma). The main
purpose of the present research is to introduce a spline-based SEIR model with
Time-varying Beta and Gamma parameters, or abbreviated TVBG-SEIR model, which
is used to estimate the practical implications of the public health
interventions and measures. We have designed a Tool based on the TVBG-SEIR
model, which may be used as a Decision Support Tool to assist the health
decision- and policy-makers in creating predictive scenarios.

approximates that of twisted bilayer graphene when an applied perpendicular
electric field points from the bilayer towards the monolayer graphene, or
twisted double bilayer graphene when the field is reversed. In the former case,
we observe correlated states which undergo an orbitally driven insulating
transition above a critical perpendicular magnetic field. In the latter case,
we observe the emergence of electrically tunable ferromagnetism at one-quarter
filling of the conduction band, with a large associated anomalous Hall effect.
Uniquely, the magnetization direction can be switched purely with electrostatic

European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical
interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and
universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most
recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns.
  In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical
model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of
infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive
number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these
interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in
behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from
temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of
transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic
time lag between infection and death.
  In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al

effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more

we propose a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularized transfer learning
approach to address this problem. We employ the pretrained SeqSleepNet (i.e.
the subject independent model) as a starting point and finetune it with the
single-night personalization data to derive the personalized model. This is
done by adding the KL divergence between the output of the subject independent
model and the output of the personalized model to the loss function during
finetuning. In effect, KL-divergence regularization prevents the personalized
model from overfitting to the single-night data and straying too far away from
the subject independent model. Experimental results on the Sleep-EDF Expanded
database with 75 subjects show that sleep staging personalization with a
single-night data is possible with help of the proposed KL-divergence
regularization. On average, we achieve a personalized sleep staging accuracy of
79.6%, a Cohen's kappa of 0.706, a macro F1-score of 73.0%, a sensitivity of
71.8%, and a specificity of 94.2%. We find both that the approach is robust

in the predictive character depends on understanding the dynamics for the
temporal evolution of the rate of contagion $\beta^*$. A semi-empirical model
for this dynamics is formulated, where reaching $\beta^*\approx0$ due to
isolation is achieved after the mean duration of the disease $\tau=1/\gamma$,
in which the number of infected in the confined families has decreased. It is
considered that $\beta^*(t)$ should have an abrupt decrease on the day of
initiation of confinement and decrease until canceling at the end of the
interval $\tau$. The analysis describes appropriately the infection curve for
Germany. The model is applied to predict an infection curve for Cuba, which
estimates a maximum number of infected as less than 2000 in the middle of May,
depending on the rigor of the isolation. This is suggested by the ratio between
the daily detected cases and the total. We consider the ratio between the
observed and real infected cases (k) less than unity. The low value of k
decreases the maximum obtained when $\beta^*-\gamma>0$. The observed evolution
is independent of k in the linear region. The value of $\beta^*$ is also
studied by time intervals, adjusting to the data of Cuba, Germany and South
Korea. We compare the extrapolation of the evolution of Cuba with the contagion
rate until 16.04.20 with that obtained by a strict quarantine at the end of
April. This model with variable $\beta^*$ correctly describes the observed
infected evolution curves. We emphasize that the desired maximum of the SIR
infected curve is not the maximum standard with constant $\beta^*$, but one
achieved due to quarantine when $\tilde R_0=\beta^*/\gamma<1$. For the
countries controlling the epidemic the maxima are in the region in which SIR
equations are linear.

repulsive Coulomb interactions, which favors ground states with non-zero
electron spin. As a result, controlling spin magnetism with electric fields---a
longstanding technological goal in spintronics and multiferroics---can be
achieved only indirectly. Here, we experimentally demonstrate direct electric
field control of magnetic states in an orbital Chern insulator, a magnetic
system in which non-trivial band topology favors long range order of orbital
angular momentum but the spins are thought to remain disordered. We use van der
Waals heterostructures consisting of a graphene monolayer rotationally faulted
with respect to a Bernal-stacked bilayer to realize narrow and topologically
nontrivial valley-projected moir\'e minibands. At fillings of one and three
electrons per moir\'e unit cell within these bands, we observe quantized
anomalous Hall effects with transverse resistance approximately equal to
$h/2e^2$, which is indicative of spontaneous polarization of the system into a
single-valley-projected band with a Chern number equal to two. At a filling of
three electrons per moir\'e unit cell, we find that the sign of the quantum
anomalous Hall effect can be reversed via field-effect control of the chemical
potential; moreover, this transition is hysteretic, which we use to demonstrate
nonvolatile electric field induced reversal of the magnetic state. A
theoretical analysis indicates that the effect arises from the topological edge
states, which drive a change in sign of the magnetization and thus a reversal
in the favored magnetic state. Voltage control of magnetic states can be used
to electrically pattern nonvolatile magnetic domain structures hosting chiral
edge states, with applications ranging from reconfigurable microwave circuit
elements to ultralow power magnetic memory.

best candidates for the updated digital twin. The approach is demonstrated
through the development of a structural digital twin for a 12ft wingspan
unmanned aerial vehicle. This digital twin is built from a library of
reduced-order models of the vehicle in a range of structural states. The
data-driven digital twin dynamically updates in response to structural damage

Within this context, we study the performance of the optimal tree classifiers

antisymmetric part of the metric in non-symmetric gravity theories. The
couplings to matter are considered at length and cannot be used to render the

troupes, which provide a broad framework for generalizing several of the

some of the main techniques that have been developed for understanding $s$;

  The unexpected connection between troupes and cumulants provides a powerful
new tool for analyzing the stack-sorting map that hinges on free probability
theory. We give numerous applications of this method. For example, we show that
if $\sigma\in S_{n-1}$ is chosen uniformly at random, then the expected value

consistent with these stars being permanently bound to <3.5 kpc from the

exhibit slower rotation and a higher velocity dispersion. The higher velocity
dispersion arises almost exclusively from halo interlopers passing through the

still confined to the inner ~3.5 kpc), and is both spatially and kinematically

this population was born prior to bar formation, as its spatial location,

this sample contains three chemically distinct groups: a low metallicity
population, and low-$\alpha$ and high-$\alpha$ groups at higher metallicity.
The age and orbit distributions of these populations show that: 1) the
high-$\alpha$ group, which includes both disk stars and the in-situ halo, has a
star-formation history independent of eccentricity that abruptly truncated
$8.3\pm0.1$ Gyr ago ($z\simeq1$); 2) the low metallicity population, which we
identify as the accreted stellar halo, is on eccentric orbits and its star
formation truncated $10.2.^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ Gyr ago ($z\simeq2$); 3) the
low-$\alpha$ population is primarily on low eccentricity orbits and the bulk of
its stars formed less than 8 Gyr ago. These results suggest a scenario in which
the Milky Way accreted a satellite galaxy at $z\approx2$ that merged with the
early disk by $z\approx1$. This merger truncated star formation in the early
high-$\alpha$ disk and perturbed a fraction of that disk onto halo-like orbits.
The merger enabled the formation of a chemically distinct, low-$\alpha$ disk at
$z\lesssim1$. The lack of any stars on halo-like orbits at younger ages
indicates that this event was the last significant disturbance to the Milky Way

draids can be implemented without having to physically braid majoranas or using

We present and discuss the differences between identifying voids directly in

effort has been made to test how these results are affected by galaxy shape
noise, which is a dominant source of noise in weak lensing observations. By
studying the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for the tangential shear profile of
each void finder, we find that voids identified directly in the convergence
maps have the highest SNR but are also the ones most affected by galaxy shape
noise. Troughs are least affected by noise, but also have the lowest SNR. The
tunnel algorithm, which identifies voids in the distribution of weak lensing
peaks, represents a good compromise between finding a large tangential shear
SNR and mitigating the effect of galaxy shape noise.

optical extent is comparable to Milky Way-type galaxies. Due to their peculiar
properties, it remains ambiguous whether UDGs are the descendants of massive
galaxies or they are puffed-up dwarf galaxies. In this work, we explore a
population of 404 UDGs in the Coma cluster to study their origin and AGN
occupation fraction. To constrain the formation scenario of UDGs, we probe the
X-ray emission originating from diffuse gas and from the population of
unresolved low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) residing in globular clusters (GCs).
It is expected that both the luminosity of the hot gas and the number of
globular clusters and hence the luminosity from GC-LMXBs are proportional to
the total dark matter halo mass. We do not detect statistically significant
emission from the hot gas or from GC-LMXBs. The upper limits on the X-ray
luminosities suggest that the bulk of the UDGs reside in low-mass dark matter
halos, implying that they are genuine dwarf galaxies. This conclusion agrees
with our previous results obtained for isolated UDGs, arguing that UDGs are a
homogenous population of galaxies. To probe the AGN occupation fraction of
UDGs, we cross-correlate the position of detected X-ray sources in the Coma
cluster with the position of UDGs. We identify two UDGs that have a luminous
X-ray source at 3.0"" and 3.2"" from the center of the galaxies, which could be
off-center AGN. However, Monte Carlo simulations suggest that one of these
sources could be the result of spatial coincidence with a background AGN.
Therefore, we place an upper limit of $\lesssim0.5\%$ on the AGN occupation

electric phenomena such as fractional electric polarization and
boundary-localized fractional charge. This quantized fractional charge is the
generic observable for identification of TCIs that lack robust spectral
features, including ones having higher-order topology. It has been predicted
that fractional charges can also manifest where crystallographic defects
disrupt the lattice structure of TCIs, potentially providing a bulk probe of
crystalline topology. However, this capability has not yet been confirmed in
experiment since measurements of charge distributions in TCIs have not been
accessible until recently. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that
disclination defects can robustly trap fractional charges in TCI metamaterials,
and show that this trapped charge can indicate non-trivial higher-order
crystalline topology even in the absence of any spectral signatures.
Furthermore, we uncover a connection between the trapped charge and the
existence of topological bound states localized at these defects. We test the
robustness of these topological features when the protective crystalline
symmetry is broken, and find that a single robust bound state can be localized
at each disclination alongside the fractional charge. Our results conclusively
show that disclination defects in TCIs can robustly trap fractional charges as

fractional charge as a probe of crystalline topology.

signature of external gas accretion. It is the fourth known case of an

rings in their dust sub-mm continuum emission profile. These structures are
widely considered to originate from local maxima in the gas pressure profile.
The properties of the underlying gas structures are however unknown. In this
paper we present a method to measure the dust-gas coupling $\alpha/St$ and the
width of the gas pressure bumps affecting the dust distribution, applying
high-precision techniques to extract the gas rotation curve from emission lines
data-cubes. As a proof-of-concept, we then apply the method to two discs with
prominent sub-structure, HD163296 and AS 209. We find that in all cases the gas
structures are larger than in the dust, confirming that the rings are pressure
traps. Although the grains are sufficiently decoupled from the gas to be
radially concentrated, we find that the degree of coupling of the dust is
relatively good ($\alpha/St \sim 0.1$). We can therefore reject scenarios in
which the disc turbulence is very low and the dust has grown significantly. If
we further assume that the dust grain sizes are set by turbulent fragmentation,
we find high values of the $\alpha$ turbulent parameter ($\alpha \sim
10^{-2}$). Alternatively, solutions with smaller turbulence are still
compatible with our analysis if another process is limiting grain growth. For
HD163296, recent measurements of the disc mass suggest that this is the case if
the grain size is 1mm. Future constraints on the dust spectral indices will
help to discriminate between the two alternatives.

frequencies. On large scales, $f \lesssim 10^{-16}\, \text{Hz}$, we reconstruct
the initial tensor power spectrum in logarithmic frequency bins, finding
maximal sensitivity for scales close to the horizon size at recombination. On
small scales, $f \gtrsim10^{-15}\,\mbox{Hz}$, we use the shortwave

Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences which are an optimal basis to model

that they maximally concentrate power within a finite region of Fourier space.
We show that DAYENU enables the access of large-scale line-of-sight modes that
are inaccessible to tapered DFT estimators. Since these modes have the largest
SNRs, DAYENU significantly increases the sensitivity of 21 cm analyses over
tapered Fourier transforms. Slight modifications allow us to use DAYENU as a

However, it remains an open question whether a lattice regularization of the
dynamical Weyl-CDW is in fact a single-particle axion insulator (AXI). In this
Letter, we use analytic and numerical methods to study both
lattice-commensurate and incommensurate minimal (magnetic) Weyl-CDW phases in
the mean-field state. We observe that, as previously predicted from field
theory, the two inversion- ($\mathcal{I}$-) symmetric Weyl-CDWs with $\phi =

we crucially discover that $neither$ of the minimal Weyl-CDW phases at

(QAH) and ""obstructed"" QAH insulators that differ by a fractional translation
in the modulated cell, analogous to the two phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model of polyacetylene. Using symmetry indicators of band topology and
non-abelian Berry phase, we demonstrate that our results generalize to
multi-band systems with only two Weyl fermions, establishing that minimal
Weyl-CDWs unavoidably carry nontrivial Chern numbers that prevent the

this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance, and practical
recommendations for how to select the number of basis functions and the
boundary factor. Intuitive visualizations and recommendations, make it easier
for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We
also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and
the boundary factor are adequate given the data. The approach is simple and
exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure,
and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several
illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the
probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the
underlying Stan model code.

based on a gauge invariant ultraviolet regularisation scheme without the
introduction of a background field. This allows for a manifestly background
independent approach to quantum gravity and gauge theories in the continuum.
The regularisation is a geometric variant of Slavnov's scheme consisting of a
modified action, which suppresses high momentum modes, supplemented by
Pauli-Villars determinants in the path integral measure. An exact
renormalisation group flow equation for the Wilsonian effective action is
derived by requiring that the path integral is invariant under a change in the
cutoff scale while preserving quasi-locality. The renormalisation group flow is
defined directly on the space of gauge invariant actions without the need to
fix the gauge. We show that the one-loop beta function in Yang-Mills and the
one-loop divergencies of General Relativity can be calculated without fixing
the gauge. As a first non-perturbative application we find the form of the
Yang-Mills beta function within a simple truncation of the Wilsonian effective
action.

planning, tree search, dynamic programming, etc.) are constrained by an
implicit sequential planning assumption: The order in which a plan is
constructed is the same in which it is executed. We consider alternatives to
this assumption for the class of goal-directed Reinforcement Learning (RL)
problems. Instead of an environment transition model, we assume an imperfect,
goal-directed policy. This low-level policy can be improved by a plan,
consisting of an appropriate sequence of sub-goals that guide it from the start
to the goal state. We propose a planning algorithm, Divide-and-Conquer Monte
Carlo Tree Search (DC-MCTS), for approximating the optimal plan by means of
proposing intermediate sub-goals which hierarchically partition the initial
tasks into simpler ones that are then solved independently and recursively. The
algorithm critically makes use of a learned sub-goal proposal for finding
appropriate partitions trees of new tasks based on prior experience. Different
strategies for learning sub-goal proposals give rise to different planning
strategies that strictly generalize sequential planning. We show that this
algorithmic flexibility over planning order leads to improved results in
navigation tasks in grid-worlds as well as in challenging continuous control
environments.

identifying organized spatio-temporal patterns within specific frequency bands
and extracting dynamical modes. However, the unavoidable tradeoff between
frequency resolution and robustness of the PCs leads to high sensitivity to
noise and overfitting, which limits the interpretation of the sPCA results. We
propose herein a simple non-parametric implementation of the sPCA using the
continuous analytic Morlet wavelet as a robust estimator of the cross-spectral
matrices with good frequency resolution. To improve the interpretability of the
results when several modes of similar amplitude exist within the same frequency
band, we propose a rotation of eigenvectors that optimizes the spatial
smoothness in the phase domain. The developed method, called rotated spectral
PCA (rsPCA), is tested on synthetic data simulating propagating waves and shows
impressive performance even with high levels of noise in the data. Applied to
historical sea surface temperature (SST) time series over the Pacific Ocean,
the method accurately captures the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at
low frequency (2 to 7 years periodicity). At high frequencies (sub-annual
periodicity), at which several extratropical patterns of similar amplitude are
identified, the rsPCA successfully unmixes the underlying modes, revealing
spatially coherent patterns with robust propagation dynamics. Identification of
higher frequency space-time climate modes holds promise for seasonal to
subseasonal prediction and for diagnostic analysis of climate models.

bound into clusters, this is expected to change in the electrical double layer
(EDL), in which the resulting electric field 'prefers' to interact with
electrical monopoles-free, unclustered ions. The competition between the
propensity of ions to stay in a clustered state and the reduction of the energy
of ions in electric field in the free state determines the resulting portion of
free ions in the EDL. We present a study of this effect, based on the simplest
possible mean-field theory. 'Cracking' of ion clusters into individual ions in
electric field is accompanied by the change of the dielectric response of ionic
liquid which is different in clustered and unclustered states. The predictions
of the theory are verified and further explored by specially performed
molecular dynamics simulations. A particular finding of the theory is that the
differential capacitance vs potential curve displays a bell shape despite low
concentration of free charge carriers, because the dielectric response of bound
ions reduces the threshold concentration of the bell- to camel-shape
transition. Whereas qualitatively these findings make perfect sense, in reality
the exact numbers and criteria might be different as the presented simple
theory does not take into account overscreening and oscillating charge and
electrostatic potential distributions near the electrode. This is why testing
the theory with computer simulations is essential, but the latter basically
reproduce the qualitative conclusions of the theory.

between electromagnetic (EM) fields and particles. Because the electric field
depends on the reference frame, in which frame to calculate $\langle\delta
j\cdot \delta E\rangle$ is an important issue. We compute the scale-dependent
energy transfer rate spectrum in wavevector space, and investigate the
electric-field fluctuations in two reference frames: $\delta E$ in the mean
bulk flow frame and $\delta E'$ in the local bulk flow frame (non-inertial
reference frame). Considering Alfv\'enic waves, we find that $\langle\delta
j\cdot\delta E^\prime\rangle$, which neglects the contribution of work done by
the ion inertial force, is not consistent with the magnetic field energy
damping rate ($2\gamma \delta B^2$) according to linear Maxwell-Vlasov theory,
while $\langle\delta j\cdot \delta E\rangle$ is exactly the same as $2\gamma
\delta B^2$ in wavenumber space $(k_\parallel, k_\perp)$, where $\gamma$ is the
linear damping rate. Under typical conditions of solar wind at 1 au, we find in
our theoretical calculation that the field energy is mainly converted into
proton kinetic energy leaving the residual minor portion for electrons.
Although the electrons gain energy in the direction perpendicular to the mean
magnetic field, they return a significant fraction of their kinetic energy in
the parallel direction. Magnetic-field fluctuations can transfer particle
energy between the parallel and perpendicular degrees of freedom. Therefore,
$\langle\delta j_\parallel\cdot \delta E_\parallel\rangle$ and $\langle\delta

radio detected MCVs to more that 40. A surprising result is that about
three-quarters (24 of 33 stars) of the detections show highly circularly
polarized radio emission of short duration, which is characteristic of electron
cyclotron maser emission. We argue that this emission originates from the lower
corona of the donor star, and not from a region between the two stars. Maser
emission enables a more direct estimate of the mean coronal magnetic field of
the donor star, which we estimate to be 1--4 kG assuming a magnetic filling
factor of 50%. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test supports the conclusion
that the distribution function of radio detected MCVs with orbital periods
between 1.5-5 hours is similar to that of all MCVs. This result implies that
rapidly-rotating (Pspin < 10 days), fully convective stars can sustain strong
magnetic dynamos. These results support the model of Taam & Spruit (1989) that
the change in angular momentum loss across the fully convective boundary at

analysis of a state-by-state landscape of indicators, both subjective and
objective, in an initial search for stand-out well-being patterns, and an
econometric study of a large selection of mainly subjective indicators inspired
by theory and the findings of previous Mexican research. Descriptive analysis
confirms that subjective well-being correlates strongly with and complements
objective data, providing interesting directions for analysis. The econometrics
literature indicates that happiness increases with income and satisfying of
material needs as theory suggests, but also that Mexicans are relatively happy
considering their mediocre incomes and high levels of insecurity, the last of
which, by categorizing according to satisfaction with life, can be shown to
impact poorer people disproportionately. The article suggests that well-being

  Traffic data from 28 sensors collected over one year were used to calibrate
the two-regime GHR model. Rear-end crash rates for the segments surrounding the

rear-end crash rates exhibited a strong positive correlation with the reaction

large sparse linear systems arising in the discretization of partial

Based on Gaussian a priori distributions, Kriging interpolation minimizes the

increasingly integrated in modern distributed systems, supporting
functionalities that require assurances that certain critical requirements are
satisfied by the overall system. We focus here on spatially-distributed
Internet-of-Things systems such as smart environments, where the dynamics of
spatial distribution of entities in the system is crucial to requirements
satisfaction. Analysis techniques need to be in place while systems operate to
ensure that requirements are fulfilled. This may be achieved by keeping a model
of the system at runtime, monitoring events that lead to changes in the spatial
environment, and performing analysis. This computationally-intensive runtime
assurance method cannot be supported by resource-constrained devices that
populate the space and must be offloaded to the cloud. However, challenges
arise regarding resource allocation and cost, especially when the workload is
unknown at the system's design time. As such, it may be difficult or even
impossible to guarantee application service level agreements, e.g., on response
times. To this end, we instantiate spatial verification processes, integrating
them to the service layer of an IoT-cloud architecture based on microservices.
We propose several cloud deployments for such an architecture for assurance of
spatial requirements -- based on virtual machines, containers, and the recent
Functions-as-a-Service paradigm. Then, we assess deployments' tradeoffs in
terms of elasticity, performance and cost by using a workload scenario from a
known dataset of taxis roaming in Beijing. We argue that the approach can be
replicated in the design process of similar kinds of spatially distributed
Internet-of-Things systems.

edge of it is contained in exactly $d$ distinct triangles. It is called
$\epsilon$-expanding if its up-down two-dimensional random walk has a
normalized maximal eigenvalue which is at most $1-\epsilon$.
  In this work, we present a class of bounded degree 2-dimensional expanders,
which is the result of a small 2-complex action on a vertex set. The resulted
complexes are fully transitive, meaning the automorphism group acts
transitively on their faces.
  Such two-dimensional expanders are rare! Known constructions of such bounded
degree two-dimensional expander families are obtained from deep algebraic
reasonings (e.g. coset geometries).
  We show that given a small $d$-regular two-dimensional $\epsilon$-expander,
there exists an $\epsilon'=\epsilon'(\epsilon)$ and a family of bounded degree
two-dimensional simplicial complexes with a number of vertices goes to
infinity, such that each complex in the family satisfies the following
properties:
  * It is $4d$-regular.
  * The link of each vertex in the complex is the same regular graph (up to
isomorphism).
  * It is $\epsilon'$ expanding.
  * It is transitive.
  The family of expanders that we get is explicit if the one-skeleton of the
small complex is a complete multipartite graph, and it is random in the case of
(almost) general $d$-regular complex. For the randomized construction, we use
results on expanding generators in a product of simple Lie groups. This
construction is inspired by ideas that occur in the zig-zag product for graphs.
It can be seen as a loose two-dimensional analog of the replacement product.

token-based method for distributed optimization. This algorithm finds the
solution of a consensus optimization problem by solving a sequence of
subproblems where some components of the cost are linearized around specific
anchor points. StochaLM can be interpreted as a dual block coordinate ascent
method whose block components are selected using the state of an ergodic Markov
chain. This sampling process is neither essentially cyclic nor independent over
time, preventing us from using proofs of convergence of dual block coordinate
ascent methods done in previous works. The proof of convergence of our method
is, therefore, also novel. We show that, if the cost is strongly convex and the
network is fully connected, then, with probability one, the primal sequence
generated by StochaLM converges to the solution. Our method is
application-friendly, as it has no global hyperparameters to tune; any
hyperparameters can be tuned locally by the agents, using information regarding
their private cost and neighbourhood. Our method is, therefore, decentralized
in the truest sense. Numerical experiments evidence that our method converges
to the solution faster than other token-based methods, even when these methods'
hyperparameters are tuned for optimal performance.

the intrinsic properties of the aggregates and changes the effective

initially placed arbitrarily on the nodes of an $n$-node anonymous graph,
autonomously move to reach a final configuration where exactly each node has at
most one robot on it. This problem is of significant interest due to its
relationship to other fundamental robot coordination problems, such as
exploration, scattering, load balancing, relocation of self-driving electric
cars to recharge stations, etc. The robots have unique IDs, typically in the
range $[1,poly(n)]$ and limited memory, whereas the graph is anonymous, i.e.,
the nodes do not have identifiers. The objective is to simultaneously minimize
two performance metrics: (i) time to achieve dispersion and (ii) memory
requirement at each robot. This problem has been relatively well-studied when
robots are non-faulty.
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of Byzantine faults to this problem,
i.e., we formalize the problem of dispersion in the presence of up to $f$
Byzantine robots. We then study the problem on a ring while simultaneously
optimizing the time complexity of algorithms and the memory requirement per
robot. Specifically, we design deterministic algorithms that attempt to match
the time lower bound ($\Omega(n)$ rounds) and memory lower bound ($\Omega(\log
n)$ bits per robot).
  Our main result is a deterministic algorithm that is both time and memory
optimal, i.e., $O(n)$ rounds and $O(\log n)$ bits of memory required per robot,
subject to certain constraints. We subsequently provide results that require
less assumptions but are either only time or memory optimal but not both. We
also provide a primitive, utilized often, that takes robots initially gathered
at a node of the ring and disperses them in a time and memory optimal manner
without additional assumptions required.

sequences are outstanding number-theoretic problems whose decidability has been
open for many decades. In this paper, the inherent mathematical difficulty of a
series of optimization problems on Markov decision processes (MDPs) is shown by
a reduction from the Positivity problem to the associated decision problems
which establishes that the problems are also at least as hard as the Skolem
problem as an immediate consequence. The optimization problems under
consideration are two non-classical variants of the stochastic shortest path
problem (SSPP) in terms of expected partial or conditional accumulated weights,
the optimization of the conditional value-at-risk for accumulated weights, and
two problems addressing the long-run satisfaction of path properties, namely
the optimization of long-run probabilities of regular co-safety properties and
the model-checking problem of the logic frequency-LTL. To prove the Positivity-
and hence Skolem-hardness for the latter two problems, a new auxiliary path
measure, called weighted long-run frequency, is introduced and the
Positivity-hardness of the corresponding decision problem is shown as an
intermediate step. For the partial and conditional SSPP on MDPs with
non-negative weights and for the optimization of long-run probabilities of
constrained reachability properties (a U b), solutions are known that rely on
the identification of a bound on the accumulated weight or the number of
consecutive visits to certain sates, called a saturation point, from which on
optimal schedulers behave memorylessly. In this paper, it is shown that also
the optimization of the conditional value-at-risk for the classical SSPP and of
weighted long-run frequencies on MDPs with non-negative weights can be solved
in pseudo-polynomial time exploiting the existence of a saturation point.

moderately-large $\Delta V$ cannot be explained by the dynamics of the tail,

dense directed unweighted graphs needs $n^{3-o(1)}$ time unless one uses fast
matrix multiplication. Meanwhile, the best known approximation factor for a
combinatorial algorithm running in $O(mn^{1-\epsilon})$ time (by Chechik et
al.) is $3$. Is the true answer $2$ or $3$?
  The main result of this paper is a (conditionally) tight approximation
algorithm for directed graphs. First, we show that under a popular hardness
assumption, any algorithm, even one that exploits fast matrix multiplication,
would need to take at least $mn^{1-o(1)}$ time for some sparsity $m$ if it
achieves a $(2-\epsilon)$-approximation for any $\epsilon>0$. Second we give a
$2$-approximation algorithm for the girth of unweighted graphs running in
$\tilde{O}(mn^{3/4})$ time, and a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm (for
any $\epsilon>0$) that works in weighted graphs and runs in $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt
n)$ time. Our algorithms are combinatorial.
  We also obtain a $(4+\epsilon)$-approximation of the girth running in
$\tilde{O}(mn^{\sqrt{2}-1})$ time, improving upon the previous best
$\tilde{O}(m\sqrt n)$ running time by Chechik et al. Finally, we consider the
computation of roundtrip spanners. We obtain a $(5+\epsilon)$-approximate
roundtrip spanner on $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}/\epsilon^2)$ edges in $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt
n/\epsilon^2)$ time. This improves upon the previous approximation factor
$(8+\epsilon)$ of Chechik et al. for the same running time.

scrutinized, and we notice a steep ascend of the more recent topic and an
eventual drop in discussions over the previous issue on inflation. Balancing

method, are used to study coherent structures in turbulent pipe flow at
friction Reynolds numbers $Re_{\tau} = 180$ and $550$. The database was
analysed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) to identify
energetically dominant coherent structures, most of which turn out to be
streaks and quasi-streamwise vortices. To understand how such structures can be
modelled, the linear flow responses to harmonic forcing were computed using the
singular value decomposition of the resolvent operator, using the mean field as
a base flow. The SPOD and resolvent analysis were calculated for several
combinations of frequencies and wavenumbers, allowing to map out the
similarities between SPOD modes and optimal responses for a wide range of
relevant scales in turbulent pipe flows. In order to explore physical reasons
behind the agreement between both methods, an indicator of lift-up mechanism in
the resolvent analysis was introduced, activated when optimal forcing
represents quasi-streamwise vortices and associated response corresponds to
streaks. Good agreement between leading SPOD and resolvent modes is observed in
a large region of parameter space. In this region, a significant gain
separation is found in resolvent analysis, which may be attributed to the
strong amplification associated with the lift-up mechanism. For both Reynolds
numbers, the observed concordances were generally for structures with large
energy in the buffer layer. The results highlight resolvent analysis as a
pertinent reduced-order model for coherent structures in wall-bounded
turbulence, particularly for streamwise elongated structures corresponding to
near-wall streamwise vortices and streaks.

Two new important results follow from the simulations: 1) counter-propagating
Alfv\'enic fluctuations at a each scale decorrelate in time at the same rate in
both balanced and imbalanced turbulence; and 2) the scaling with wavenumber of
the decorrelation rate is consistent with pure hydrodynamic sweeping of
small-scale structures by the fluctuating velocity of the energy-containing
scales. An explanation of the simulation results is proposed in the context of
a recent phenomenological MHD model introduced by Bourouaine and Perez 2019

a multinomial distribution. The Poisson distribution is an alternative
distribution to describe the probability of count data. For topic modelling,
the Poisson distribution describes the number of occurrences of a word in
documents of fixed length. The Poisson distribution has been successfully
applied in text classification, but its application to topic modelling is not
well documented, specifically in the context of a generative probabilistic
model. Furthermore, the few Poisson topic models in literature are admixture
models, making the assumption that a document is generated from a mixture of
topics. In this study, we focus on short text. Many studies have shown that the
simpler assumption of a mixture model fits short text better. With mixture
models, as opposed to admixture models, the generative assumption is that a
document is generated from a single topic. One topic model, which makes this
one-topic-per-document assumption, is the Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model.
The main contributions of this work are a new Gamma-Poisson mixture model, as
well as a collapsed Gibbs sampler for the model. The benefit of the collapsed
Gibbs sampler derivation is that the model is able to automatically select the
number of topics contained in the corpus. The results show that the
Gamma-Poisson mixture model performs better than the Dirichlet-multinomial
mixture model at selecting the number of topics in labelled corpora.
Furthermore, the Gamma-Poisson mixture produces better topic coherence scores
than the Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model, thus making it a viable option
for the challenging task of topic modelling of short text.

Outlier Factor (TOF) to measure the uniqueness of events in continuous data
sets from dynamic systems. The concept of unique events differs significantly
from traditional outliers in many aspects: while repetitive outliers are no
longer unique events, a unique event is not necessarily an outlier; it does not
necessarily fall out from the distribution of normal activity. The performance
of our algorithm was examined in recognizing unique events on different types
of simulated data sets with anomalies and it was compared with the Local
Outlier Factor (LOF) and discord discovery algorithms. TOF had superior
performance compared to LOF and discord algorithms even in recognizing
traditional outliers and it also recognized unique events that those did not.
The benefits of the unicorn concept and the new detection method were
illustrated by example data sets from very different scientific fields. Our
algorithm successfully recognized unique events in those cases where they were
already known such as the gravitational waves of a binary black hole merger on
LIGO detector data and the signs of respiratory failure on ECG data series.
Furthermore, unique events were found on the LIBOR data set of the last 30

quasi-likelihood approach driven by a latent factor process. More specifically,
given the latent process, we only specify the conditional mean and variance of
the time series and enjoy a quasi-likelihood function for estimating parameters
related to the mean. This proposed methodology has three remarkable features:
(i) no parametric form is assumed for the conditional distribution of the time
series given the latent process; (ii) able for modelling non-negative, count,
bounded/binary and real-valued time series; (iii) dispersion parameter is not
assumed to be known. Further, we obtain explicit expressions for the marginal
moments and for the autocorrelation function of the time series process so that
a method of moments can be employed for estimating the dispersion parameter and
also parameters related to the latent process. Simulated results aiming to
check the proposed estimation procedure are presented. Real data analysis on
unemployment rate and precipitation time series illustrate the potencial for
practice of our methodology.

field of $\sim 10^6$ G. We explain the salient observed features of the systems
due to the magnetospheric interaction of two stars. Currently, the WD's
spin-down is determined by the mass loading of the WD's magnetosphere from the
RD's at a mild rate of $\dot{M}_{WD} \sim 10^{-11} M_\odot $/yr. Typical
loading distance is determined by the ionization of the RD's wind by the WD's
UV flux. The WD was previously spun up by a period of high accretion rate from
the RD via Roch lobe overflow with $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-9} M_\odot $/yr, acting
for as short a period as tens of thousands of years. The non-thermal X-ray and
optical synchrotron emitting particles originate in reconnection events in the
magnetosphere of the WD due to the interaction with the flow from the RD. In
the case of AR Sco, the reconnection events produce signals at the WD's
rotation and beat periods - this modulation is due to the changing relative
orientation of the companions' magnetic moments and resulting variable
reconnection conditions. Radio emission is produced in the magnetosphere of the
RD, we hypothesize, in a way that it is physically similar to the Io-induced
Jovian decametric radiation.

factors such as large field of view, presence of multiple activities, varying

activity detection is mainly focused on datasets, such as UCF-101, JHMDB,
THUMOS, and AVA, which partially address these issues. The requirement of
processing the security videos in real-time makes this even more challenging.
In this work we propose Gabriella, a real-time online system to perform
activity detection on untrimmed security videos. The proposed method consists
of three stages: tubelet extraction, activity classification, and online
tubelet merging. For tubelet extraction, we propose a localization network
which takes a video clip as input and spatio-temporally detects potential
foreground regions at multiple scales to generate action tubelets. We propose a
novel Patch-Dice loss to handle large variations in actor size. Our online
processing of videos at a clip level drastically reduces the computation time
in detecting activities. The detected tubelets are assigned activity class
scores by the classification network and merged together using our proposed
Tubelet-Merge Action-Split (TMAS) algorithm to form the final action
detections. The TMAS algorithm efficiently connects the tubelets in an online
fashion to generate action detections which are robust against varying length
activities. We perform our experiments on the VIRAT and MEVA (Multiview
Extended Video with Activities) datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed approach in terms of speed (~100 fps) and performance with
state-of-the-art results. The code and models will be made publicly available.

practice and research methodology. There have been many methods of measuring
adherence yet no recognized standard for adherence. Here we conduct a software
study of the usefulness and efficacy of a mobile phone app to measure
medication adherence using photographs taken by a phone app of medications and
self-reported health measures.
  Results: The participants were asked by the app 'would help to keep track of
your medication', their response indicated 92.9% felt the app 'would you use
this app every day' to improve their medication adherence. The subjects were
also asked by the app if they 'would photograph their pills on a daily basis'.
Subject responses indicated 63% would use the app on a daily basis. By using
the data collected, we determined that subjects who used the app on daily basis
were more likely to adhere to the prescribed regimen.
  Conclusions: Pill photographs are a useful measure of adherence, allowing
more accurate time measures and more frequent adherence assessment. Given the
ubiquity of mobile telephone use, and the relative ease of this adherence
measurement method, we believe it is a useful and cost-effective approach.
However we feel the 'manual' nature of using the phone for taking a photograph
of a pill has individual variability and an 'automatic' method is needed to
reduce data inconsistency.

how they move across language barriers. We find that Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil

cases where the same image is associated with very different text (and

learning models, especially deep neural networks, have been shown to be
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Attackers add carefully-crafted
perturbations to input, where the perturbations are almost imperceptible to
humans, but can cause models to make wrong predictions. Techniques to protect
models against adversarial input are called adversarial defense methods.
Although many approaches have been proposed to study adversarial attacks and
defenses in different scenarios, an intriguing and crucial challenge remains
that how to really understand model vulnerability? Inspired by the saying that
""if you know yourself and your enemy, you need not fear the battles"", we may
tackle the aforementioned challenge after interpreting machine learning models
to open the black-boxes. The goal of model interpretation, or interpretable
machine learning, is to extract human-understandable terms for the working
mechanism of models. Recently, some approaches start incorporating
interpretation into the exploration of adversarial attacks and defenses.
Meanwhile, we also observe that many existing methods of adversarial attacks
and defenses, although not explicitly claimed, can be understood from the
perspective of interpretation. In this paper, we review recent work on
adversarial attacks and defenses, particularly from the perspective of machine
learning interpretation. We categorize interpretation into two types,
feature-level interpretation and model-level interpretation. For each type of
interpretation, we elaborate on how it could be used for adversarial attacks
and defenses. We then briefly illustrate additional correlations between
interpretation and adversaries. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future
directions along tackling adversary issues with interpretation.

triggered by the emergence of software defined networking and network function
virtualization (NFV). Network service providers have unlocked immense
capabilities by these technologies, which have enabled them to dynamically
adapt to user needs by deploying their network services in real-time through
generating Service Function Chain (SFCs). However, NFV still faces challenges
that hinder its full potentials, including availability guarantees, network
security, and other performance requirements. For this reason, the deployment
of NFV applications remains critical as it should meet different service level
agreements while insuring the security of the virtualized functions. In this
paper, we tackle the challenge of securing these SFCs by introducing virtual
security functions (VSFs) into the latencyaware deployment of NFV applications.
This work insures the optimal placement of the SFC components including the
security functions while considering the performance constraints and the VSFs'
operational rules such as, functions' alliance, proximity, and anti-affinity.
This paper develops a mixed integer linear programming model to optimally place
all the requested SFCs while satisfying the above constraints and minimizing
the latency of every SFC and the intercommunication delay between the SFC
components. The simulations are evaluated against a greedy algorithm on the
virtualized Evolved Packet Core use case and have shown promising results in
maintaining the security rules while achieving minimum delays.

applied into lesions transfer of medical images, due to the diverse appearances
of same lesion among different datasets; 2) equal attention has been paid into
all semantic representations instead of neglecting irrelevant knowledge, which
leads to negative transfer of untransferable knowledge. To address these
challenges, we develop a new unsupervised semantic transfer model including two
complementary modules (i.e., T_D and T_F ) for endoscopic lesions segmentation,
which can alternatively determine where and how to explore transferable
domain-invariant knowledge between labeled source lesions dataset (e.g.,
gastroscope) and unlabeled target diseases dataset (e.g., enteroscopy).
Specifically, T_D focuses on where to translate transferable visual information
of medical lesions via residual transferability-aware bottleneck, while
neglecting untransferable visual characterizations. Furthermore, T_F highlights
how to augment transferable semantic features of various lesions and
automatically ignore untransferable representations, which explores
domain-invariant knowledge and in return improves the performance of T_D. To
the end, theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on medical endoscopic
dataset and several non-medical public datasets well demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed model.

science and mathematics. As in general pursuit evasion games, pursuers (cops)
seek to capture evaders (robbers); however, players move in turn and are
constrained to move on a discrete structure, usually a graph, and know the
exact location of their opponent. In 2017, Bonato and MacGillivray presented a
general characterization of Cops and Robbers games in order for them to be
globally studied. However, their model doesn't cover cases where stochastic
events may occur, such as the robbers moving in a random fashion. In this paper
we present a novel model with stochastic elements that we call a Generalized
Probabilistic Cops and Robbers game (GPCR). A typical such game is one where
the robber moves according to a probabilistic distribution, either because she
is rather lost or drunk than evading, or because she is a robot. We present
results to solve GPCR games, thus enabling one to study properties relating to
the optimal strategies in large classes of Cops and Robbers games. Some classic
Cops and Robbers games properties are also extended.

uniform bit width quantization across all the layers is usually sub-optimal and
the exploration of hybrid quantization for different layers is vital for
efficient deep compression. In this paper, we employ the meta learning method
to automatically realize low-bit hybrid quantization of neural networks. A
MetaQuantNet, together with a Quantization function, are trained to generate
the quantized weights for the target DNN. Then, we apply a genetic algorithm to
search the best hybrid quantization policy that meets compression constraints.
With the best searched quantization policy, we subsequently retrain or finetune
to further improve the performance of the quantized target network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the performance of searched hybrid quantization scheme
surpass that of uniform bitwidth counterpart. Compared to the existing
reinforcement learning (RL) based hybrid quantization search approach that
relies on tedious explorations, our meta learning approach is more efficient

convolutional neural network architecture to produce a model that captures both

outputs a per-pixel error estimate that incorporates both statistical and model

mean absolute difference of $<4\mu$K over the full sky after masking map pixels
with a predicted standard error of $>50\mu$K; the angular power spectrum is
also accurately recovered. Once validated with the simulations, this model was

similarity-preserving hashing has been widely applied to approximate nearest
neighbor search in large-scale image retrieval. However, existing methods have
poor performance in retrieval using an extremely short-length hash code due to
weak ability of classification and poor distribution of hash bit. To address
this issue, in this study, we propose a novel reinforcing short-length hashing
(RSLH). In this proposed RSLH, mutual reconstruction between the hash
representation and semantic labels is performed to preserve the semantic
information. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of hash representation, a
pairwise similarity matrix is designed to make a balance between accuracy and
training expenditure on memory. In addition, a parameter boosting strategy is
integrated to reinforce the precision with hash bits fusion. Extensive
experiments on three large-scale image benchmarks demonstrate the superior
performance of RSLH under various short-length hashing scenarios.

called Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) where the concept is to allow entities, e.g.,
individuals or local authorities, to hire workers to help from the crowd of
connected people, to execute a task or service. Some complex tasks require the
collaboration of multiple workers to ensure its successful completion. In this
context, the task requester needs to hire a group of socially connected and
collaborative workers that, at the same time, have sufficient skills to
accomplish the task. In this paper, we develop two recruitment strategies for
collaborative MCS frameworks in which, virtual teams are formed according to
four different criteria: level of expertise, social relationship strength,
recruitment cost, and recruiter's confidence level. The first proposed strategy
is a platform-based approach which exploits the platform knowledge to form the
team. The second one is a leader-based approach that uses team members'
knowledge about their social network (SN) neighbors to designate a group leader
that recruits its suitable team. Both approaches are modeled as integer linear
programs resulting in optimal team formation. Experimental results show a
performance trade-off between the two virtual team grouping strategies when
varying the members SN edge degree. Compared to the leader-based strategy, the
platform-based strategy recruits a more skilled team but with lower SN
relationships and higher cost.

vision research as a potential safety risk for machine learning (ML) systems.
Traditional data poisoning attacks manipulate training data to induce
unreliability of an ML model, whereas backdoor data poisoning attacks maintain
system performance unless the ML model is presented with an input containing an
embedded ""trigger"" that provides a predetermined response advantageous to the
adversary. Our work builds upon prior backdoor data-poisoning research for ML
image classifiers and systematically assesses different experimental conditions
including types of trigger patterns, persistence of trigger patterns during
retraining, poisoning strategies, architectures (ResNet-50, NasNet,
NasNet-Mobile), datasets (Flowers, CIFAR-10), and potential defensive
regularization techniques (Contrastive Loss, Logit Squeezing, Manifold Mixup,
Soft-Nearest-Neighbors Loss). Experiments yield four key findings. First, the
success rate of backdoor poisoning attacks varies widely, depending on several
factors, including model architecture, trigger pattern and regularization
technique. Second, we find that poisoned models are hard to detect through
performance inspection alone. Third, regularization typically reduces backdoor
success rate, although it can have no effect or even slightly increase it,
depending on the form of regularization. Finally, backdoors inserted through
data poisoning can be rendered ineffective after just a few epochs of
additional training on a small set of clean data without affecting the model's
performance.

promising techniques for Android malware detection and has achieved high
accuracy by leveraging commonly-used features. In practice, most of the ML
classifications only provide a binary label to mobile users and app security
analysts. However, stakeholders are more interested in the reason why apps are
classified as malicious in both academia and industry. This belongs to the
research area of interpretable ML but in a specific research domain (i.e.,
mobile malware detection). Although several interpretable ML methods have been
exhibited to explain the final classification results in many cutting-edge
Artificial Intelligent (AI) based research fields, till now, there is no study
interpreting why an app is classified as malware or unveiling the
domain-specific challenges.
  In this paper, to fill this gap, we propose a novel and interpretable
ML-based approach (named XMal) to classify malware with high accuracy and
explain the classification result meanwhile. (1) The first classification phase
of XMal hinges multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and attention mechanism, and also
pinpoints the key features most related to the classification result. (2) The
second interpreting phase aims at automatically producing neural language
descriptions to interpret the core malicious behaviors within apps. We evaluate
the behavior description results by comparing with the existing interpretable
ML-based methods (i.e., Drebin and LIME) to demonstrate the effectiveness of
XMal. We find that XMal is able to reveal the malicious behaviors more
accurately. Additionally, our experiments show that XMal can also interpret the
reason why some samples are misclassified by ML classifiers. Our study peeks
into the interpretable ML through the research of Android malware detection and

wind by Mira B over the past century is presented; it accounts for only a small
fraction of the overall observed emission but its accumulation over several
orbital periods may have produced an enhancement of CO emission in the orbital
plane of Mira B. We identify a South-western outflow and give arguments for the
anti-correlation observed between CO and SiO emissions being the result of a
recent mass ejection accompanied by a shock wave. We discuss the failure of
simple scenarios that have been proposed earlier to explain some of the
observed features and comment on the apparent lack of continuity between the
present observations and those obtained in the close environment of the stars.

number is sufficiently large. Azimuthal slip can cause linear instability if
the slip length is sufficiently large. The critical Reynolds number can be
reduced to a few hundred given large slip lengths. Besides numerical

the data provided by brokerage firms and exchanges. There is an emerging
intermediate layer of financial players that are placed in between a broker and
algorithmic traders. The role of these players is to aggregate market decisions
from the algorithmic traders and send a final market order to a broker. In
return, the quantitative analysts receive incentives proportional to the
correctness of their predictions. In such a setup, the intermediate player - an
aggregator - does not provide the market data in plaintext but encrypts it.
Encrypting market data prevents quantitative analysts from trading on their
own, as well as keeps valuable financial data private. This paper proposes an
implementation of a popular trend-following indicator with two different
homomorphic encryption libraries - SEAL and HEAAN - and compares it to the
trading indicator implemented for plaintext. Then an attempt to implement a

with SEAL and HEAAN is almost identical to that implemented on the plaintext,
the percentage error is of 0.14916% and 0.00020% respectively. Despite many

correlation function of thermal emission by a homogeneous, isothermal sphere of
arbitrary size and material are presented. The spectral distribution and the
power law governing the distance-dependent energy density are investigated in
the near-field and far-field regimes for silicon carbide, silicon and tungsten
spheres of various size parameters ranging from X = 0.002 to 5. The spatial
coherence of thermal field emitted by spheres is also studied in both radial
and polar directions. The energy density follows a power law of d^-2 (d is the
observation distance) in the far field for all sizes and materials. The power
law in the near field is strongly dependent on the material, size parameter,
and the ratio d/a (a is the sphere radius). In the near field, the energy
density follows a power law of d^-6 when X<<1 and d/a>>1 (similar to an
electric point dipole). With increasing X or decreasing d/a, the contribution
of multipoles to the energy density increases resulting in an increase in the
power of d until the power law converges to that for a semi-infinite medium.
The spatial correlation length in the radial direction is in the orders of
$\lambda$, 0.1$\lambda$, and 0.001$\lambda$ in the far field, intermediate near
field, and extreme near field, respectively. The correlation angle in the
extreme near field is strongly dependent on the sphere size parameter, such
that it decreases by three orders of magnitude (from 0.5$\pi$ to 0.001$\pi$)
when X increases from 0.002 to 5. In the intermediate near field and far field,
the correlation angle retains the same order of magnitude (0.15$\pi$ -
0.7$\pi$) for all considered Xs. While the excitation of dipolar localized

  Knowledge Graph",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph neural networks (GNN) have recently been applied to exploit knowledge
graph (KG) for recommendation. Existing GNN-based methods explicitly model the
dependency between an entity and its local graph context in KG (i.e., the set
of its first-order neighbors), but may not be effective in capturing its
non-local graph context (i.e., the set of most related high-order neighbors).
In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation framework, named
Contextualized Graph Attention Network (CGAT), which can explicitly exploit
both local and non-local graph context information of an entity in KG.
Specifically, CGAT captures the local context information by a user-specific
graph attention mechanism, considering a user's personalized preferences on
entities. Moreover, CGAT employs a biased random walk sampling process to
extract the non-local context of an entity, and utilizes a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) to model the dependency between the entity and its non-local
contextual entities. To capture the user's personalized preferences on items,
an item-specific attention mechanism is also developed to model the dependency
between a target item and the contextual items extracted from the user's
historical behaviors. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of CGAT, compared with state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation
methods.

co-clustering algorithms are designed to find pairwise disjoint and exhaustive
co-clusters while many real-world datasets contain not only a large overlap

Overlapping Co-Clustering where both of the row and column clusters are allowed
to overlap with each other and outliers for each dimension of the data matrix

monotonically decreases the proposed objective functions. Experimental results

treatment assignment, a general problem that arises in many applications and
has received significant attention from economists, computer scientists, and
social scientists. We group the various methods proposed in the literature into
three general classes of algorithms (or metalearners): learning models to
predict outcomes (the O-learner), learning models to predict causal effects
(the E-learner), and learning models to predict optimal treatment assignments
(the A-learner). We compare the metalearners in terms of (1) their level of
generality and (2) the objective function they use to learn models from data;
we then discuss the implications that these characteristics have for modeling
and decision making. Notably, we demonstrate analytically and empirically that
optimizing for the prediction of outcomes or causal effects is not the same as
optimizing for treatment assignments, suggesting that in general the A-learner
should lead to better treatment assignments than the other metalearners. We
demonstrate the practical implications of our findings in the context of
choosing, for each user, the best algorithm for playlist generation in order to
optimize engagement. This is the first comparison of the three different
metalearners on a real-world application at scale (based on more than half a
billion individual treatment assignments). In addition to supporting our
analytical findings, the results show how large A/B tests can provide
substantial value for learning treatment assignment policies, rather than
simply choosing the variant that performs best on average.

reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, the diffusion of EETs in small and
medium-sized enterprises is rather slow. Literature shows the interactions
between innovation adopters and potential adopters have significant impacts on
innovation diffusion. Enterprises lack the motivation to share information, and
EETs usually lack observability, which suppress the inter-firm influence.
Therefore, an information platform, together with proper policies encouraging
or forcing enterprises to disclose EET-related information, should help harness
inter-firm influence to accelerate EETs' diffusion. To explore whether and how
such an information platform affects EETs' diffusion in small and medium-sized
enterprises, this study builds an agent-based model to mimic EET diffusion
processes. Based on a series of controlled numerical experiments, some
counter-intuitive phenomena are discovered and explained. The results show that
the information platform is a double-edged sword that notably accelerates EETs'
diffusion by approximately 47% but may also boost negative information to
diffuse even faster and delay massive adoption of EETs. Increasing network
density and the intensity of inter-firm influence are effective to speed EET
diffusion, but their impacts diminish drastically after reaching some critical
values (0.05 and 0.15 respectively) and eventually harm the stability of the
system. Hence, the findings implicate that EET suppliers should carefully
launch their promising but immature products; policies that can reduce the
perceived risk by enterprises and the effort to maintain an informative rather
than judgmental information platform can prominently mitigate the negative side
effects brought by high fluidity of information.

scenario which can be readily tested in present or near-future experiments

sensitive parameter space of the mixing angles between the active neutrinos and
HNLs. Since the mixing between $ \nu_{\tau} $ and HNL is not well established

include at least two tau leptons. After the signal-background analysis, we
further set sensitivity bounds on the mixing $ |U_{\tau N}|^2 $ with $ M_N $ at

achieve complex learning tasks across various domains. However, they suffer
from the ""catastrophic forgetting"" problem when they face a sequence of
learning tasks, where they forget the old ones as they learn new tasks. This
problem is also highly related to the ""stability-plasticity dilemma"". The more
plastic the network, the easier it can learn new tasks, but the faster it also
forgets previous ones. Conversely, a stable network cannot learn new tasks as
fast as a very plastic network. However, it is more reliable to preserve the
knowledge it has learned from the previous tasks. Several solutions have been
proposed to overcome the forgetting problem by making the neural network
parameters more stable, and some of them have mentioned the significance of
dropout in continual learning. However, their relationship has not been
sufficiently studied yet. In this paper, we investigate this relationship and
show that a stable network with dropout learns a gating mechanism such that for
different tasks, different paths of the network are active. Our experiments
show that the stability achieved by this implicit gating plays a very critical
role in leading to performance comparable to or better than other involved

In experiments with multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks, G-DAUG^C

iron-based LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_{x}$ superconductor for $x\gtrsim0.4$ was
investigated by muon spin rotation measurements under hydrostatic pressure up
to 2.6 GPa. The N\'eel temperature ($T_{\rm N}$) obtained for a sample with
$x=0.51$ exhibits considerably greater sensitivity to pressure than that in the
pristine antiferromagnetic phase (AF1, $x\lesssim0.06$). Moreover, while the
AF1 phase is always accompanied by the structural transition (from tetragonal
to orthorhombic) at a temperature ($T_{\rm s}$) which is slightly higher than
$T_{\rm N}$, the AF2 phase prevails at higher pressures above $\sim$1.5 GPa
where the structural transition is suppressed ($T_{\rm s}=0$). These features
indicate that the microscopic origin of the AF2 phase is distinct from that of
AF1, suggesting that electronic correlation plays important role in the former
phase. We argue that the orbital-selective Mott transition is a plausible
scenario to account for the observed pressure dependence of $T_{\rm N}$ and
$T_{\rm s}$ in the AF2 phase.

properties of two lacunar spinel compounds GaM4S8 with light (M=V) and heavy
(M=Mo) transition-metal elements, which are responsible for different
spin-orbit interaction strength. In the model, each magnetic lattice point was
associated with the M4S4 molecule, and the model itself was formulated in the
basis of molecular Wannier functions constructed for three magnetic t2 bands.
The effects of rhombohedral distortion, spin-orbit interaction, band filling,
and the screening of Coulomb interactions in the t2 bands are discussed in
details. The electronic model is further treated in the superexchange
approximation, which allows us to derive an effective spin model for the energy
and electric polarization ($P$) depending on the relative orientation of spins
in the bonds, and study the properties of this model by means of classical
Monte Carlo simulations with the emphasis on the possible formation of the
skyrmionic phase. While isotropic exchange interactions clearly dominate in
GaV4S8, all types of interactions -- isotropic, antisymmetric, and symmetric
anisotropic -- are comparable in the case of GaMo4S8. Particularly, large
uniaxial exchange anisotropy has a profound effect on the properties of
GaMo4S8. On the one hand, it raises the Curie temperature by opening a gap in
the spectrum of magnon excitations. On the other hand, it strongly affects the
skyrmionic phase by playing the role of a molecular field, which facilitates
the formation of skyrmions, but makes them relatively insensitive to the
external magnetic field in the large part of the phase diagram. We predict
reversal of the magnetic dependence of $P$ in the case of GaMo4S8 caused by the
reversal of direction of the rhombohedral distortion.

optimizing Mixed Integer Program framework to model the effects of various bike
repositioning strategies for dockless systems. We process 30 days worth of
Singapore-based dockless bike data from September 2017 to extract trips.
Pairing our mixed integer program with a demand model built from the processed

repositioning proper to the repositioning strategy employed. We also show that
increasing repositioning potential does not always improve service performance.

the downsampled skip-connection/multi-scale model based on a convolutional
neural network to incorporate the multi-scale nature of fluid flows into its
network structure. As an initial example, the model is applied to a
two-dimensional cylinder wake at $Re_D$ = 100. The reconstructed flow fields by
the proposed method show great agreement with the reference data obtained by
direct numerical simulation. Next, we examine the capability of the proposed
model for a two-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The
machine-learned models can follow the decaying evolution from coarse input data
in space and time, according to the assessment with the turbulence statistics.
The proposed concept is further investigated for a complex turbulent channel
flow over a three-dimensional domain at $Re_{\tau}$ =180. The present model can
reconstruct high-resolved turbulent flows from very coarse input data in space,
and it can also reproduce the temporal evolution when the time interval is
appropriately chosen. The dependence on the amount of training snapshots and
duration between the first and last frames based on a temporal two-point
correlation coefficient are also assessed to reveal the capability and
robustness of spatio-temporal super resolution reconstruction. These results
suggest that the present method can meet a range of flow reconstructions for

measurement experiments in storage rings. The spin precession of the particles

bunching via RF cavities, eventually yielding a polarization lifetime of
10--100 seconds. Previous studies have shown that it can be further improved by
sextupoles, which correct the second order effects related to the chromaticity

in ring parameters. This work presents a real-time sextupole tuning method that
relies on a feedback algorithm. It adjusts the sextupole strength during
storage, targeting a zero average radial spin component. Satisfying this
condition results in a longer polarization lifetime. Simulation studies show
that roughly determined feedback coefficients in this method work effectively
for a wide range of ring parameters, with practical field imperfections and
measurement errors taken into account. Alternatively, this technique can be

many industrial domain-specific tasks. However, the current state-of-the-art DL
software still suffers from quality issues, which raises great concern
especially in the context of safety- and security-critical scenarios.
Adversarial examples (AEs) represent a typical and important type of defects
needed to be urgently addressed, on which a DL software makes incorrect
decisions. Such defects occur through either intentional attack or
physical-world noise perceived by input sensors, potentially hindering further
industry deployment. The intrinsic uncertainty nature of deep learning
decisions can be a fundamental reason for its incorrect behavior. Although some
testing, adversarial attack and defense techniques have been recently proposed,
it still lacks a systematic study to uncover the relationship between AEs and
DL uncertainty. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study towards bridging
this gap. We first investigate the capability of multiple uncertainty metrics
in differentiating benign examples (BEs) and AEs, which enables to characterize
the uncertainty patterns of input data. Then, we identify and categorize the
uncertainty patterns of BEs and AEs, and find that while BEs and AEs generated
by existing methods do follow common uncertainty patterns, some other
uncertainty patterns are largely missed. Based on this, we propose an automated
testing technique to generate multiple types of uncommon AEs and BEs that are
largely missed by existing techniques. Our further evaluation reveals that the
uncommon data generated by our method is hard to be defended by the existing
defense techniques with the average defense success rate reduced by 35\%. Our
results call for attention and necessity to generate more diverse data for
evaluating quality assurance solutions of DL software.

sum of a certain linear cost function and a regularization term. We focus on
regularization terms where a Young's function applied to the (density of the)
transport plan is integrated against a product measure. This forces the
transport plan to belong to a certain Orlicz space. The predual problem is
derived and proofs for strong duality and existence of primal solutions of the
regularized problem are presented. Existence of (pre-)dual solutions is shown
for the special case of $L^p$ regularization for $p\geq 2$. Moreover, two
results regarding $\Gamma$-convergence are stated: The first is concerned with
marginals that do not lie in the appropriate Orlicz space and guarantees
$\Gamma$-convergence to the original Kantorovich problem, when smoothing the

independent problems, without considering their interaction, or asking which
should be applied first. Several recent works have started addressing them
jointly in works that involve heavy weight CNNs, thus incompatible with low
power portable imaging devices. Hence, the question of how to combine denoising
and demosaicking to reconstruct full color images remains very relevant: Is
denoising to be applied first, or should that be demosaicking first? In this
paper, we review the main variants of these strategies and carry-out an
extensive evaluation to find the best way to reconstruct full color images from
a noisy mosaic. We conclude that demosaicking should applied first, followed by
denoising. Yet we prove that this requires an adaptation of classic denoising
algorithms to demosaicked noise, which we justify and specify.

because distributions of the training and target samples may differ as time
passes. Such distribution change in streaming data is called concept drift.
Numerous histogram-based distribution change detection methods have been
proposed to detect drift. Most histograms are developed on grid-based or
tree-based space partitioning algorithms which makes the space partitions
arbitrary, unexplainable, and may cause drift blind-spots. There is a need to
improve the drift detection accuracy for histogram-based methods with the
unsupervised setting. To address this problem, we propose a cluster-based
histogram, called equal intensity k-means space partitioning (EI-kMeans). In
addition, a heuristic method to improve the sensitivity of drift detection is
introduced. The fundamental idea of improving the sensitivity is to minimize
the risk of creating partitions in distribution offset regions. Pearson's
chi-square test is used as the statistical hypothesis test so that the test
statistics remain independent of the sample distribution. The number of bins
and their shapes, which strongly influence the ability to detect drift, are
determined dynamically from the sample based on an asymptotic constraint in the
chi-square test. Accordingly, three algorithms are developed to implement
concept drift detection, including a greedy centroids initialization algorithm,
a cluster amplify-shrink algorithm, and a drift detection algorithm. For drift
adaptation, we recommend retraining the learner if a drift is detected. The
results of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
advantages of EI-kMeans and show its efficacy in detecting concept drift.

different recommendation problems. Previous review-based recommendation methods
usually employ sophisticated compositional models, such as Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to learn semantic
representations from the review data for recommendation. However, these methods
mainly capture the local dependency between neighbouring words in a word
window, and they treat each review equally. Therefore, they may not be
effective in capturing the global dependency between words, and tend to be
easily biased by noise review information. In this paper, we propose a novel
review-based recommendation model, named Review Graph Neural Network (RGNN).
Specifically, RGNN builds a specific review graph for each individual
user/item, which provides a global view about the user/item properties to help
weaken the biases caused by noise review information. A type-aware graph
attention mechanism is developed to learn semantic embeddings of words.
Moreover, a personalized graph pooling operator is proposed to learn
hierarchical representations of the review graph to form the semantic
representation for each user/item. We compared RGNN with state-of-the-art
review-based recommendation approaches on two real-world datasets. The
experimental results indicate that RGNN consistently outperforms baseline
methods, in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE).

formation of circular polarization in the condensate persists even for a weakly

a transition from the condensate polarization being pinned along the

Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveals that this depolarization stems from a
competition between sample induced in-plane polarization splitting and the

weakening of the condensate fixed-point phase space attractors, and enhanced
random phase space walk and appearance of limit cycle trajectories, reducing

were considered unable to support optical mobile communication when nodes are
randomly moving at a high speed because existing tracking schemes fail to track
the nodes accurately and rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking

laser's power is measured to estimate the orientation of the target. Unlike
existing schemes which drive servo motors multiple times based on consecutive

the tracking system to converge much faster. Closed-form outage probability
expression is derived for the optical mobile communication system with ideal

maintain sufficient average power and reduce the outage probability, the
recommended size of a source spot is expressed in closed form as a function of
the target's statistics of random moving, providing insights to the system

separation upon deformation. To boost the conductivity at higher strains, the
production process was adapted by stretching the nitrile substrate before
spraying, after which it was released. This adaption meant that the electrical
resistance doubled at 25 % strain. The electrical resistance was found
sufficiently low to give a 1.9 dB/{\mu}m shielding in the 8-12 GHz

to a sample spanning network. The rheology of this gel primarily exhibits a
yield stress at low shear rates followed by a linear variation of shear stress
at high shear rates. The apparent yield stress extracted from the flow curves

Rescaling of the yield stress curves using suitable shift factors results in an
empirical expression for the yield stress showing squared dependence on liquid

both combined in a highly nonlinear manner. The microstructural variations with
changing secondary liquid content and particle fractions are captured using

single degree of freedom, despite their equations of motion being higher than
second order. In some cases, this is a mere consequence of a disformal field
redefinition carried out in a non-degenerate theory. More generally, this is
made possible by the existence of an additional constraint that removes the
would-be ghost. It has been noted that this constraint can be thwarted when the
coupling to matter involves time derivatives of the metric, which results in a
modification of the canonical momenta of the gravitational sector. In this note
we expand on this issue by analyzing the precise ways in which the extra degree
of freedom may reappear upon minimal coupling to matter. Specifically, we study
examples of matter sectors that lead either to a direct loss of the special
constraint or to a failure to generate a pair of secondary constraints. We also
discuss the recurrence of the extra degree of freedom using the language of
disformal transformations in particular for what concerns ""veiled"" gravity. On
the positive side, we show that the minimal coupling of spinor fields is
healthy and does not spoil the additional constraint. We argue that this virtue
of spinor fields to preserve the number of degrees of freedom in the presence
of higher derivatives is actually very general and can be seen from the level
decomposition of Grassmann-valued classical variables.

form bar later. When the bars were formed, the disc gas fractions were mostly
lower than 0.4. The much higher bar fraction in TNG100 probably have benefit
from much lower gas fraction in massive disc galaxies since $z\sim3$, which may
result from the combination of more effective stellar and AGN feedback. The
latter may be the primary factor at $z<2$. Meanwhile, in both simulations,
barred galaxies have higher star formation rate before bar formation, and
stronger AGN feedback all the time than unbarred galaxies. The properties of
dark matter halos hosting massive disc galaxies are similar between two

It allows the network to learn general boundaries between categories from the
easy training pairs at its early stages and finalize the details of the model
mainly relying on the hard training samples in the later. Compared to the
existing training sample mining approaches, the hard samples are mined with
little harm to the learned general model. This dynamic sampling strategy is
formularized as two simple terms that are compatible with various loss
functions. Consistent performance boost is observed when it is integrated with
several popular loss functions on fashion search, fine-grained classification,
and person re-identification tasks.

The Huang-Rhys parameter is evaluated by the intensity ratio of the

onset of the CdS shell absorption to well above the CdS shell band edge to get
insight into resonance effects of the CdS LO phonon with high energy excitonic
transitions. The isotropic spherical giant-shell nanocrystals show consistently
stronger exciton-phonon coupling as compared to the anisotropic rod-shaped
dot-in-rod (DiR) architecture, and the 2LO/LO intensity ratio decreases for
excitation wavelengths approaching the CdS band edge. The strong exciton-phonon
coupling in the spherical giant-shell nanocrystals can be related to the
delocalization of the electronic wave functions. Furthermore, we observe the
radial breathing modes of the GS nanocrystals and their overtones by ultralow

spontaneous emission features can be tuned over a broad spectral range via
their composition, geometry and size. However, towards embedding nanocrystals
films in elaborated device geometries, one significant drawback is the
sensitivity of their emission properties on further fabrication processes like
lithography, metal or oxide deposition, etc. In this work, we demonstrate how
bright emitting and robust thin films can be obtained by combining nanocrystal
deposition from solutions via spin2 coating with subsequent atomic layer
deposition of alumina. For the resulting composite films, the layer thickness
can be controlled on the nanoscale, and their refractive index can be finely
tuned by the amount of deposited alumina. Ellipsometry is used to measure the
real and imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity, which gives direct
access to the wavelength dependent refractive index absorbance of the film.
Detailed analysis of the photophysics of thin films of core-shell nanocrystal
with different shape and different shell thickness allow to correlate the
behavior of the photoluminescence and of the decay life time to the changes in
the non-radiative rate that are induced by the alumina deposition. We show that
the photoemission properties of such composite films are stable in wavelength
and intensity over several months, and that the photoluminescence completely
recovers from heating processes up to 240$^\circ$C. The latter is particularly
interesting, since it demonstrates robustness to the typical heat treatment
that is needed in several process steps like resist-based lithography and
deposition by thermal or electron beam evaporation of metals or oxides.

profiles for severe convective storm environments, building off of the
two-layer static energy framework developed in Agard and Emanuel (2017). The
model is phrased in terms of static energy, and it allows for independent
variation of the boundary layer and free troposphere separated by a capping
inversion. An algorithm is presented to apply the model to generate a sounding
for numerical simulations of severe convective storms, and the model is
compared and contrasted with that of Weisman and Klemp. The model is then fit
to a case-study sounding associated with the 3 May 1999 tornado outbreak, and
its potential utility is demonstrated via idealized numerical simulation
experiments. A long-lived supercell is successfully simulated with the
historical sounding but not the analogous theoretical sounding. Two types of
example experiments are then performed that do simulate a long-lived supercell:
1) a semi-theoretical experiment in which a portion of the theoretical sounding
is modified to match the real sounding (low-level moisture); 2) a
fully-theoretical experiment in which a model physical parameter is modified
(free-tropospheric relative humidity). Overall, the construction of this
minimal model is flexible and amenable to additional modifications as needed.
The model offers a novel framework that may be useful for testing how severe
convective storms depend on the vertical structure of the hydrostatic
environment, as well as for linking variability in these environments to the
physical processes that produce them within the climate system.

the performance of NCs based optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic cells,
photodetectors and light emitting diodes (LEDs). On one hand, the NC emission
depends critically on the passivation of the surface to minimize trap states
that can provide non-radiative recombination channels. On the other hand, the
electrical properties of NC films are dominated by the ligands that constitute
the barriers for charge transport from one NC to its neighbor. Therefore,
surface modifications via ligandexchange have been employed to improve the
conductance of NC films. However, in light emitting devices, such surface
modifications are more critical due to their possible detrimental effects on
the emission properties. In this work, we study the role of surface ligand
modifications on the optical and electrical properties of CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods
(DiRs) in films, and investigate their performance in all-solution processed
LEDs. The DiR films maintain high PLQY, around 40-50%, and their
electroluminescence in the LED preserves the excellent color purity of the PL.
In the LEDs, the ligand-exchange boosted the luminance, reaching a four-fold
increase from 2200 cd/m2 for native surfactants to 8500 cd/m2 for the exchanged
aminoethanethiol ligands. Moreover, the efficiency roll-off, operational
stability, and shelf life are significantly improved, and the external quantum
efficiency is modestly increased from 5.1 % to 5.4 %. We relate these
improvements to the increased conductivity of the emissive layer, and to the
better charge balance of the electrically injected carriers. In this respect,
we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to obtain deeper
insight in the band alignment of the LED structure.

tension between the parameters measured with different techniques, among which
there is one based on time delays in gravitational lenses. We discuss a new way
of using time delays for cosmology, taking advantage of the extreme precision
expected for lensed fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are short flashes of radio
emission originating at cosmological distances. With coherent methods, the
achievable precision is sufficient for measuring how time delays change over
the months and years, which can also be interpreted as differential redshifts
between the images. It turns out that uncertainties arising from the unknown
mass distribution of gravitational lenses can be eliminated by combining time
delays with their time derivatives. Other effects, most importantly relative
proper motions, can be measured accurately and disentangled from the
cosmological effects. With a mock sample of simulated lenses, we show that it
may be possible to attain strong constraints on cosmological parameters.
Finally, the lensed images can be used as galactic interferometer to resolve
structures and motions of the burst sources with incredibly high resolution and
help reveal their physical nature, which is currently unknown.

a new and ambitious project, the financial issues have been quite im-portant.
US LHC Accelerator Research Program (LARP) and other institution funding
sources have assured the de-velopment of the design for implementing the
feedback in the SPS ring at CERN. Here the intra-bunch feedback sys-tem has
been installed and tested in the frame of the LIU (LHC Injector Upgrade)

to continue the R&D activity, could be by implementing the system in a lepton
storage ring affected by e-cloud effects. For achieving this goal, a possible
ex-periment could be carried out in the positron ring of DAFNE at Frascati,
Italy. The feasibility of the proposal is evaluated in the following sections.
In case of approval of the experiment, indeed the project could be inserted in

absorption (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Cu $L_3$
edge on a polycrystalline sample. We show that the XAS profile of BCO is
characterised by two peaks associated to inequivalent Cu sites, and that its
RIXS response features a single, sharp peak associated to crystal-field
excitations. We argue that these observations are only partially compatible
with the previously proposed crystal structure of BCO. Based on our
spectroscopic results and on previously published powder diffraction
measurements, we propose a crystalline structure characterized by two
inequivalent Cu sites located at alternated planes along the $c$ axis:
nominally trivalent Cu(1) belonging to very short Cu-O chains, and divalent
Cu(2) in the oxygen deficient CuO$_ {1.5}$ planes. We also analyze the
low-energy region of the RIXS spectra to estimate the magnitude of the magnetic
interactions in BCO and find that in-plane nearest neighbor superexchange
exceeds 120~meV, similarly to that of other layered cuprates. Although these
results do not support the pure $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ ground state scenario, they hint
at a significant departure from the common quasi-2D electronic structure of
superconducting cuprates of pure $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry.

we circumvent this problem in the experimental system of growing liquid-crystal

fluctuations clearly show characteristic properties of the 1D stationary KPZ
interfaces, including the convergence to the Baik-Rains distribution. We also
identify finite-time corrections to the KPZ scaling laws, which turn out to
play a major role in the direct test of the stationary KPZ interfaces. This
paves the way to explore unsolved properties of the stationary KPZ interfaces
experimentally, making possible connections to nonlinear fluctuating
hydrodynamics and quantum spin chains as recent studies unveiled relation to
the stationary KPZ.

mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ has enabled the resolution of neutrino mass
hierarchy (MH) at medium-baseline reactor neutrino oscillation (MBRO)
experiments. On the other hand, recent calculations of the reactor neutrino
flux predict percent-level sub-structures in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to
Coulomb effects in beta decay. Such fine structure in the reactor spectrum
could be an important issue for the determination of neutrino MH for the MBRO
approach since they could affect the sub-dominant oscillation pattern used to
discriminate different hierarchies. Inconveniently, the energy resolutions of
current reactor experiments are not sufficient to measure such fine structure,
and therefore the size and location in energy of these predicted
discontinuities has not been confirmed experimentally. There has been
speculation that a near detector is required with sufficient energy resolution
to resolve the fine structure such that it can be accounted for in any analysis
which attempts to discriminate the MH. This article studies the impact of fine
structure on the resolution of MH, based on the predicted reactor neutrino
spectra, using the measured spectrum from Daya Bay as a reference. We also
investigate whether a near detector could improve the sensitivity of neutrino
MH resolution using various assumptions of near detector energy resolution.

recommendations, have been more or less overlooked. In the latest decade,
recommendation diversity has drawn more research attention, especially in the
models based on user-item bipartite networks. In this paper, we introduce a
family of approaches to extract fabricated experts from users in RSes, named as
the Expert Tracking Approaches (ExTrA for short), and explore the capability of
these fabricated experts in improving the recommendation diversity, by
highlighting them in a well-known bipartite network-based method, called the
Mass Diffusion (MD for short) model. These ExTrA-based models are compared with
two state-of-the-art MD-improved models HHP and BHC, with respect to
recommendation accuracy and diversity. Comprehensive empirical results on three
real-world datasets MovieLens, Netflix and RYM show that, our proposed
ExTrA-based models can achieve significant diversity gain while maintain
comparable level of recommendation accuracy.

different facets of next generation networks. The challenges in creating a
trustworthy 6G are multidisciplinary spanning technology, regulation,
techno-economics, politics and ethics. This white paper addresses their
fundamental research challenges in three key areas. Trust: Under the current
""open internet"" regulation, the telco cloud can be used for trust services only
equally for all users. 6G network must support embedded trust for increased
level of information security in 6G. Trust modeling, trust policies and trust
mechanisms need to be defined. 6G interlinks physical and digital worlds making
safety dependent on information security. Therefore, we need trustworthy 6G.
Security: In 6G era, the dependence of the economy and societies on IT and the
networks will deepen. The role of IT and the networks in national security
keeps rising - a continuation of what we see in 5G. The development towards
cloud and edge native infrastructures is expected to continue in 6G networks,
and we need holistic 6G network security architecture planning. Security
automation opens new questions: machine learning can be used to make safer
systems, but also more dangerous attacks. Physical layer security techniques
can also represent efficient solutions for securing less investigated network
segments as first line of defense. Privacy: There is currently no way to
unambiguously determine when linked, deidentified datasets cross the threshold
to become personally identifiable. Courts in different parts of the world are
making decisions about whether privacy is being infringed, while companies are
seeking new ways to exploit private data to create new business revenues. As
solution alternatives, we may consider blockchain, distributed ledger
technologies and differential privacy approaches.

interest. Most of the theoretical studies so far focused on instantaneous
resetting which is, however, a major impediment to practical realization or
experimental verification in the field. This is because in the real world,
taking a particle from one place to another requires finite time and thus a
generalization of the existing theory to incorporate non-instantaneous
resetting is very much in need. In this paper, we propose a method of resetting
which involves non-instantaneous returns facilitated by an external confining
trap potential $U(x)$ centered at the resetting location. We consider a
Brownian particle that starts its random motion from the origin. Upon
resetting, the trap is switched on and the particle starts experiencing a force
towards the center of the trap which drives it to return to the origin. The
return phase ends when the particle makes a first passage to this center. We
develop a general framework to study such a set up. Importantly, we observe
that the system reaches a non-equilibrium steady state which we analyze in full
details for two choices of $U(x)$, namely, (i) linear and (ii) harmonic.
Finally, we perform numerical simulations and find an excellent agreement with
the theory. The general formalism developed here can be applied to more
realistic return protocols opening up a panorama of possibilities for further
theoretical and experimental applications.

ME TMO was synthesised by three bottom up methods. The presence of distortion
in the rocksalt crystal structure, revealed by X ray diffraction and Raman
spectroscopy, and correlated with magnetic measurements from SQUID and EPR
studies could be attributed to the additive effects of exchange striction (from
the magnetic constituents) and magnetic anisotropy (from the decreased
crystallite size). For the first time, iron has been doped into ME TMO, to show
that a higher amount of magnetic constituent increases the distortion in the

a single-core layer-wise baseline implementation. Our implementation takes only
5.82 ms and consumes 0.627 mJ per inference. With 21.0GMAC/s/W, it is 256x more

address these issues, we explore a two-stage Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)

deviation bounds even when data are heavy-tailed and/or corrupted. This work

core technique is the use of VC-dimension (instead of Rademacher complexity) to
measure the statistical complexity. In particular, this allows to give the
first robust estimators for sparse estimation which achieves the so-called
subgaussian rate only assuming a finite second moment for the uncorrupted data.
By comparison, previous works using Rademacher complexities required a number
of finite moments that grows logarithmically with the dimension. With this
technique, we derive new robust sugaussian bounds for mean estimation in any

the first to achieve subgaussian bounds without $L_4-L_2$ norm equivalence.

relationship between the binding energy per nucleon, temperature, density, as
well as the isospin asymmetry, has been a hot topic in nuclear physics and
astrophysics for a long time. The knowledge of the nuclear EOS is essential for
studying the properties of nuclei, the structure of neutron stars, the dynamics
of heavy ion collision (HIC), as well as neutron star mergers. HIC offers a
unique way to create nuclear matter with high density and isospin asymmetry in
terrestrial laboratory, but the formed dense nuclear matter exists only for a
very short period, one cannot measure the nuclear EOS directly in experiments.
Practically, transport models which often incorporate phenomenological
potentials as an input are utilized to deduce the EOS from the comparison with
the observables measured in laboratory. The ultrarelativistic quantum molecular
dynamics (UrQMD) model has been widely employed for investigating HIC from the
Fermi energy (40 MeV per nucleon) up to the CERN Large Hadron Collider energies
(TeV). With further improvement in the nuclear mean-field potential term, the
collision term, and the cluster recognition term of the UrQMD model, the newly
measured collective flow and nuclear stopping data of light charged particles
by the FOPI Collaboration can be reproduced. In this article we highlight our
recent results on the studies of the nuclear EOS and the nuclear symmetry
energy with the UrQMD model. New opportunities and challenges in the extraction
of the nuclear EOS from transport models and HIC experiments are discussed.

setup, they have focussed on specific applications and thus enforced suitable
simplifications. Here we present a versatile semi-analytical framework for
studying the elastohydrodynamics of axisymmetric loading of a rigid sphere near
a soft elastic substrate coated on a rigid platform mediated by an aqueous
electrolytic solution. Three loading modes are considered - approach, recession
and oscillatory. The framework incorporates - large oscillation frequency and
amplitude, two-way coupling between pressure and substrate deformation, and
presence of DLVO forces. From computations using the framework, we gain
insights on the effects of DLVO forces, substrate thickness, substrate material
compressibility (quantified by Poisson's ratio) and high oscillation frequency
for different physical setups encountered in SPM and the likes. We list some
key observations. A substrate that is thicker and more compressible allows for
larger deformation, i.e. is effectively softer. Presence of DLVO forces lead to
magnification in force of upto two orders of magnitude and in substrate
deformation of upto an order of magnitude for oscillatory loading at low
frequencies and approach/recession loading at low speed. For oscillatory
loading at high frequencies, DLVO forces do not appreciably affect the force
and deflection behaviour of the system. Having demonstrated the versatility and
utility of our framework, we expect it to evolve into a diverse and useful tool
for solving problems of soft-lubrication.

different from tidal tails and those without any signature of extended stellar
density profiles. When exploring different kinematical and structural parameter
spaces, we found that globular clusters - irrespective from the presence of
tidal tails, or any other kind of extra-tidal features or the absence of them -
behave similarly. In general, globular clusters whose orbits are relatively
more eccentric and very inclined respect to the Milky Way plane have undergone
a larger amount of mass-loss by tidal disruption. The latter has also
accelerated the internal dynamics toward a comparatively more advanced stage of
evolution. These outcomes show that it is not straightforward to find any

challenging scenarios. Moreover, based on the formulation, we also propose a
structural loss to explicitly model the structure of lanes. Extensive
experiments on two lane detection benchmark datasets show that our method could
achieve the state-of-the-art performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. A
light-weight version could even achieve 300+ frames per second with the same
resolution, which is at least 4x faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.

are enriched by rather complex molecules. Many of these molecules are believed
to be synthesized on the icy surfaces of the interstellar submicron-sized dust
grains that permeate the Galaxy. At 10 K thermal desorption is ineffcient and,
therefore, why these molecules are found in the cold gas has tantalized
astronomers for years. The assumption of the current models, called chemical
desorption, is that the molecule formation energy released by the chemical
reaction at the grain surface is partially absorbed by the grain and the
remaining one causes the ejection of the newly formed molecule into the gas.
Here we report an accurate ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations aimed to
study the fate of the energy released by the first reaction of the H addition
chain on CO, CO + H $\rightarrow$ HCO, occurring on a crystalline ice surface
model. We show that about 90% of the HCO formation energy is injected towards
the ice in the first picosecond, leaving HCO with an energy content (10-15 kJ
mol$^{-1}$) more than a factor two lower than its adsorption energy (30 kJ
mol$^{-1}$). As a result, in agreement with laboratory experiments, we conclude
that chemical desorption is ineffcient for this specific system, namely H + CO
on crystalline ice. We suspect this behavior to be quite general when dealing
with hydrogen bonds, which are responsible of both the cohesive energy of the
ice mantle and the interaction with adsorbates, as the HCO radical, even though
ad hoc simulations are needed to draw specific conclusions on other systems.

find whether there exists at most $k$ pairs of vertices in $G$ such that
changing the adjacency of the pairs in $G$ results in a graph without any
induced copy of $H$. The existence of polynomial kernels for $H$-free Edge
Editing received significant attention in the parameterized complexity
literature. Nontrivial polynomial kernels are known to exist for some graphs
$H$ with at most 4 vertices, but starting from 5 vertices, polynomial kernels
are known only if $H$ is either complete or empty. This suggests the conjecture
that there is no other $H$ with at least 5 vertices were $H$-free Edge Editing

nine 5-vertex graphs such that if for every $H\in\mathcal{H}$, $H$-free Edge
Editing is incompressible and the complexity assumption $NP \not\subseteq
coNP/poly$ holds, then $H$-free Edge Editing is incompressible for every graph
$H$ with at least five vertices that is neither complete nor empty. That is,
proving incompressibility for these nine graphs would give a complete
classification of the kernelization complexity of $H$-free Edge Editing for

  We obtain similar result also for $H$-free Edge Deletion. Here the picture is
more complicated due to the existence of another infinite family of graphs $H$

it has been promoted for its wide applicability and has even been suggested as
a fundamental principle of understanding intelligent behavior and brain
function. We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free
energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as
applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that
appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum
entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of
minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies
from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for
action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information
processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to
formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context
of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature.
We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual
issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to
apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of

Here we report the control of freely propagating keV electrons with an isolated
optical cycle of mid-infrared light and create a modulated electron current
with a peak-cycle-specific sub-femtosecond structure in time. The evident
effects of the carrier-envelope phase, amplitude and dispersion of the optical
waveform on the temporal composition, pulse durations and chirp of the
free-space electron wavefunction demonstrate the sub-cycle nature of our
control. These results create novel opportunities in laser-driven particle
acceleration, seeded free-electron lasers, attosecond space-time imaging,
electron quantum optics and wherever else high-energy electrons are needed with
the temporal structure of single-cycle light.

well-known limitations and drawbacks of conventional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as network homogeneity with the sole linear neuron model.
ONNs are heterogenous networks with a generalized neuron model that can
encapsulate any set of non-linear operators to boost diversity and to learn
highly complex and multi-modal functions or spaces with minimal network
complexity and training data. However, Greedy Iterative Search (GIS) method,
which is the search method used to find optimal operators in ONNs takes many
training sessions to find a single operator set per layer. This is not only
computationally demanding, but the network heterogeneity is also limited since
the same set of operators will then be used for all neurons in each layer.
Moreover, the performance of ONNs directly depends on the operator set library
used, which introduces a certain risk of performance degradation especially
when the optimal operator set required for a particular task is missing from
the library. In order to address these issues and achieve an ultimate
heterogeneity level to boost the network diversity along with computational
efficiency, in this study we propose Self-organized ONNs (Self-ONNs) with
generative neurons that have the ability to adapt (optimize) the nodal operator
of each connection during the training process. Therefore, Self-ONNs can have
an utmost heterogeneity level required by the learning problem at hand.
Moreover, this ability voids the need of having a fixed operator set library
and the prior operator search within the library in order to find the best
possible set of operators. We further formulate the training method to
back-propagate the error through the operational layers of Self-ONNs.

given a window into the choices a model is making and an opportunity to guide
those choices in a more desirable direction. A novel pair-wise matrix captures
the sentence interactions, centrality, and attribute scores, and a mask with
tunable attribute thresholds allows the user to control which sentences are
likely to be included in the extraction. A sentence-deployed attention

not optimal in the presence of certain types of non-iid data. In this work we
present a modification to FL by introducing a hierarchical clustering step
(FL+HC) to separate clusters of clients by the similarity of their local
updates to the global joint model. Once separated, the clusters are trained
independently and in parallel on specialised models. We present a robust
empirical analysis of the hyperparameters for FL+HC for several iid and non-iid

separation of concerns towards a dynamic solution. Therefore, a two-layered
adaptive manager was designed to satisfy the software requirements with
parameters optimization through regression analysis and evolutionary

Max-2CSP problems in the streaming model. Specifically, for every type of
Max-2CSP problem, we give an explicit constant $\alpha$, s.t. for any
$\epsilon>0$ (i) there is an $(\alpha-\epsilon)$-streaming approximation using
space $O(\log{n})$; and (ii) any $(\alpha+\epsilon)$-streaming approximation
requires space $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. This generalizes the celebrated work of
[Kapralov, Khanna, Sudan SODA 2015; Kapralov, Krachun STOC 2019], who showed
that the optimal approximation ratio for Max-CUT was $1/2$.
  Prior to this work, the problem of determining this ratio was open for all
other Max-2CSPs. Our results are quite surprising for some specific Max-2CSPs.
For the Max-DCUT problem, there was a gap between an upper bound of $1/2$ and a
lower bound of $2/5$ [Guruswami, Velingker, Velusamy APPROX 2017]. We show that
neither of these bounds is tight, and the optimal ratio for Max-DCUT is $4/9$.
We also establish that the tight approximation for Max-2SAT is $\sqrt{2}/2$,
and for Exact Max-2SAT it is $3/4$. As a byproduct, our result gives a
separation between space-efficient approximations for Max-2SAT and Exact
Max-2SAT. This is in sharp contrast to the setting of polynomial-time
algorithms with polynomial space, where the two problems are known to be
equally hard to approximate. Finally, we prove that the tight streaming
approximation for \mksat{} is $\sqrt{2}/2$ for every $k\geq2$.

We develop CMPMOB, an estimation procedure for a semi-varying coefficient

is broader than the existing MOB framework as it allows node-invariant effects
to be included in the model. To simplify the computational burden of the
exhaustive search employed in the original MOB algorithm, a new split point
estimation procedure is proposed by borrowing tools from change point
estimation methodology. The proposed method uses only the estimated score
functions without fitting models for each split point and, therefore, is
computationally simpler. Since the tree-based methods only provide a piece-wise

CMPBoost semi-varying coefficient model which uses the gradient boosting

have been performed by using both a commercial spectrum analyzer and the
diagnostic capabilities of the longitudinal bunch-by-bunch feedback. The
damping effect has been observed in DAFNE for the first time during collisions
with the crab waist scheme. Our explanation, based both on theoretical
consideration and modeling simulation, is that beam collisions with a large
crossing angle produce longitudinal tune shift and spread, providing Landau
damping of synchrotron oscillations.

transitive action on a nilpotent Lie group $H$ via affine transformations.
Although the existence is guaranteed, not much is known about which Lie groups
$G$ can act simply transitive on which Lie groups $H$. So far the focus was
mainly on the case where $G$ is also nilpotent, leading to a characterization
depending only on the corresponding Lie algebras and related to the notion of
post-Lie algebra structures.
  This paper studies two different aspects of this problem. First, we give a
method to check whether a given action $\rho: G \to \operatorname{Aff}(H)$ is
simply transitive by looking only at the induced morphism $\varphi:
\mathfrak{g} \to \operatorname{aff}(\mathfrak{h})$ between the corresponding
Lie algebras. Secondly, we show how to check whether a given solvable Lie group
$G$ acts simply transitive on a given nilpotent Lie group $H$, again by
studying properties of the corresponding Lie algebras. The main tool for both
methods is the semisimple splitting of a solvable Lie algebra and its relation
to the algebraic hull, which we also define on the level of Lie algebras. As an
application, we give a full description of the possibilities for simply
transitive actions up to dimension $4$.

computer games. For long-distance navigation on the surface of the earth or in
outer space however, approximating the geometry as Euclidean can be
insufficient for real-world applications such as the navigation of spacecraft,
aeroplanes, drones and ships. This article describes an any-angle pathfinding
algorithm for calculating the shortest path between point pairs over the
surface of a sphere. Introducing several novel adaptations, it is shown that
Anya as described by (Harabor & Grastien, 2013) for Euclidean space can be
extended to Spherical geometry. There, where the shortest-distance line between
coordinates is defined instead by a great-circle path, the optimal solution is
typically a curved line in Euclidean space. In addition the turning points for
optimal paths in Spherical geometry are not necessarily corner points as they
are in Euclidean space, as will be shown, making further substantial
adaptations to Anya necessary. Spherical Anya returns the optimal path on the
sphere, given these different properties of world maps defined in Spherical
geometry. It preserves all primary benefits of Anya in Euclidean geometry,
namely the Spherical Anya algorithm always returns an optimal path on a sphere
and does so entirely on-line, without any preprocessing or large memory
overheads. Performance benchmarks are provided for several game maps including
Starcraft and Warcraft III as well as for sea navigation on Earth using the
NOAA bathymetric dataset. Always returning the shorter path compared with the
Euclidean approximation yielded by Anya, Spherical Anya is shown to be faster
than Anya for the majority of sea routes and slower for Game Maps and Random
Maps.

often, various types of errors - coding, logic, semantic, and others (most of

these bugs might be found in the later stage of testing, and many times it is
reported by customers on production code. Companies have to spend many
resources, both money and time in finding and fixing the bugs which would have
been avoided if coding was done right. Also, concealed flaws in software can
lead to security vulnerabilities that potentially allow attackers to compromise
systems and applications. Interestingly, same or similar issues/bugs, which
were fixed in the past (although in different modules), tend to get introduced
in production code again.
  We developed a novel AI-based system which uses the deep representation of
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) created from the source code and also the active
feedback loop to identify and alert the potential bugs that could be caused at
the time of development itself i.e. as the developer is writing new code (logic

incorporate suggestions right at the time of development, rather than waiting
for UT/QA/customer to raise a defect.
  We assessed our tool on both open-source code and also on Cisco codebase for

detachment after Descemet's Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK) in
Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) scans. Methods: 1280
AS-OCT B-scans were annotated by a DMEK expert. Using the annotations, a deep
learning pipeline was developed to localize scleral spur, center the AS-OCT
B-scans and segment the detached graft sections. Detachment segmentation model
performance was evaluated per B-scan by comparing (1) length of detachment and
(2) horizontal projection of the detached sections with the expert annotations.
Horizontal projections were used to construct graft detachment maps. All final
evaluations were done on a test set that was set apart during training of the
models. A second DMEK expert annotated the test set to determine inter-rater
performance. Results: Mean scleral spur localization error was 0.155 mm,
whereas the inter-rater difference was 0.090 mm. The estimated graft detachment
lengths were in 69% of the cases within a 10-pixel (~150{\mu}m) difference from
the ground truth (77% for the second DMEK expert). Dice scores for the
horizontal projections of all B-scans with detachments were 0.896 and 0.880 for
our model and the second DMEK expert respectively. Conclusion: Our deep
learning model can be used to automatically and instantly localize graft
detachment in AS-OCT B-scans. Horizontal detachment projections can be
determined with the same accuracy as a human DMEK expert, allowing for the
construction of accurate graft detachment maps. Translational Relevance:
Automated localization and quantification of graft detachment can support DMEK
research and standardize clinical decision making.

probably $(1-\omega)\in [0,1]$ random walkers remain in the same layer and
follow (layer-specific) intralayer Markov chains, whereas with probability
$\omega$ they move to different layers following (node-specific) interlayer
Markov chains. One main finding is the identification of multiplex convection,
whereby a stationary distribution exhibits circulating flows that involve
multiple layers. Convection cycles are well understood in fluids, but are
insufficiently explored on networks. Our experiments reveal that one mechanism
for convection is the existence of imbalances for the (intralayer) degrees of
nodes in different layers. To gain further insight, we employ spectral
perturbation theory to characterize the stationary distribution for the limits
of small and large $\omega$, and we show that MMCs inherently exhibit
optimality for intermediate $\omega$ in terms of their convergence rate and the
extent of convection. As an application, we conduct an MMC-based analysis of
brain-activity data, finding MMCs to differ between healthy persons and those

attraction between $N$ and $\bar{\Omega}$ is a little bit larger than that
between $N$ and $\Omega$, which indicates that it is more possible for the
$N\bar{\Omega}$ than the $N\Omega$ system to form bound states. The dynamic
calculations state that both the $J^{P}=1^{+}$ and $2^{+}$ $N\bar{\Omega}$
systems are bound states. The binding energy of these two states are deeper
than that of $N\Omega$ systems with $J^{P}=2^{+}$, and the $N\Omega$ system
with $J^{P}=1^{+}$ is unbound. The calculation of the low-energy scattering
phase shifts, scattering length and the effective range also supports the
existence of the $N\bar{\Omega}$ bound states with $J^{P}=1^{+}$ and $2^{+}$.
So the $N\bar{\Omega}$ states are better hexaquark states and stronger signals

a smaller milli-arcsecond telescope design with 525 $\mu$as resolution and 645
cm$^2$ effective area at 1 keV ($\lambda$=1.24 nm). We describe how to match
the optical path lengths between all shells in a compact mirror assembly, and
investigate chromatic and off-axis aberrations. Chromatic aberration results
from total external reflection off of mirror surfaces, and we greatly mitigate
its effects by slightly adjusting the path lengths in each mirror shell. The
mirror surface height error and alignment requirements for diffraction-limited
performance are challenging but arguably achieveable in the coming decades.
Since the focal ratio for a diffraction-limited X-ray telescope is extremely
large ($f/D$~10$^5$), the only important off-axis aberration is curvature of
field, so a 1 arcsecond field of view is feasible with a flat detector. The
detector must fly in formation with the mirror assembly, but relative
positioning tolerances are on the order of 1 m over a distance of some tens to
hundreds of kilometers. While there are many challenges to achieving
diffraction-limited X-ray imaging, we did not find any fundamental barriers.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been shown that the majority of existing adversarial defense methods
achieve robustness at the cost of sacrificing prediction accuracy. The
undesirable severe drop in accuracy adversely affects the reliability of
machine learning algorithms and prohibits their deployment in realistic
applications. This paper aims to address this dilemma by proposing a novel
preprocessing framework, which we term Robust and Accurate Image
classificatioN(RAIN), to improve the robustness of given CNN classifiers and,
at the same time, preserve their high prediction accuracies. RAIN introduces a
new randomization-enhancement scheme. It applies randomization over inputs to
break the ties between the model forward prediction path and the backward
gradient path, thus improving the model robustness. However, similar to
existing preprocessing-based methods, the randomized process will degrade the
prediction accuracy. To understand why this is the case, we compare the
difference between original and processed images, and find it is the loss of
high-frequency components in the input image that leads to accuracy drop of the
classifier. Based on this finding, RAIN enhances the input's high-frequency
details to retain the CNN's high prediction accuracy. Concretely, RAIN consists
of two novel randomization modules: randomized small circular shift (RdmSCS)
and randomized down-upsampling (RdmDU). The RdmDU module randomly downsamples
the input image, and then the RdmSCS module circularly shifts the input image
along a randomly chosen direction by a small but random number of pixels.
Finally, the RdmDU module performs upsampling with a detail-enhancement model,
such as deep super-resolution networks. We conduct extensive experiments on the
STL10 and ImageNet datasets to verify the effectiveness of RAIN against various
types of adversarial attacks.

interstellar travel, taking centuries to reach other stars. Due to their crewed
nature, size, and long trip times, the feasibility of world ships faces an
additional set of challenges compared to interstellar probes. Despite their
emergence in the 1980s, most of these topics remain unexplored. This article
revisits some of the key feasibility issues of world ships. First, definitions
of world ships from the literature are revisited and the notion of world ship
positioned with respect to similar concepts such as generation ships. Second,
the key question of population size is revisited in light of recent results
from the literature. Third, socio-technical and economic feasibility issues are
evaluated. Finally, world ships are compared to potential alternative modes of
crewed interstellar travel. Key roadblocks for world ships are the considerable
resources required, shifting its economic feasibility beyond the year 2300, and
the development of a maintenance system capable of detecting, replacing, and
repairing several components per second. The emergence of alternative, less
costly modes of crewed interstellar travel at an earlier point in time might
render world ships obsolete.

six experiential qualities that are regarded as antecedents of delight. The
objective of this paper is to introduce the approach and the companions and
state the two paths that have defined the future steps of this research.

  Learning",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The advent of computational material sciences has paved the way for
data-driven approaches for modeling and fabrication of materials. The
prediction of properties like the glass-forming ability (GFA) by using the
variation in alloy composition remains to be a challenging problem in the field
of material sciences. It also results in significant financial concerns for the
manufacturing industry. Despite the existence of various empirical guides for
the prediction of GFA, a comprehensive prediction model is still highly
desirable. This work focuses on studying some of the popular machine learning
algorithms for the prediction of the reduced glass transition temperature (Trg)
of material compositions. From the experimentation, we conclude that the
ensemble model performs better for predicting Trg. This result can prove
instrumental in the branch of material sciences by helping us to develop
materials having remarkable properties.

solution to fulfill the demanding requirements of many practical applications
in both classical and quantum optics. Phase shifters integrated in the photonic
circuit offer the possibility to dynamically reconfigure its properties in
order to fine tune its operation or to produce adaptive circuits, thus greatly
extending the quality and the applicability of these devices. In this paper, we
provide a thorough discussion of the main problems that one can encounter when
using thermal shifters to reconfigure photonic circuits. We then show how all
these issues can be solved by a careful design of the thermal shifters and by
choosing the most appropriate way to drive them. Such performance improvement
is demonstrated by manufacturing thermal phase shifters in femtosecond laser
written PICs (FLW-PICs), and by characterizing their operation in detail. The
unprecedented results in terms of power dissipation, miniaturization and
stability, enable the scalable implementation of reconfigurable FLW-PICs that
can be easily calibrated and exploited in the applications.
