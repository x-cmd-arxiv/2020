  Emerging Applications",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Differential privacy (DP) has arisen as the state-of-the-art metric for
quantifying individual privacy when sensitive data are analyzed, and it is
starting to see practical deployment in organizations such as the US Census
Bureau, Apple, Google, etc. There are two popular models for deploying
differential privacy - standard differential privacy (SDP), where a trusted
server aggregates all the data and runs the DP mechanisms, and local
differential privacy (LDP), where each user perturbs their own data and
perturbed data is analyzed. Due to security concerns arising from aggregating
raw data at a single server, several real world deployments in industry have
embraced the LDP model. However, systems based on the LDP model tend to have
poor utility - ""a gap"" in the utility achieved as compared to systems based on
the SDP model.
  In this work, we survey and synthesize emerging directions of research at the
intersection of differential privacy and cryptography. First, we survey
solutions that combine cryptographic primitives like secure computation and
anonymous communication with differential privacy to give alternatives to the
LDP model that avoid a trusted server as in SDP but close the gap in accuracy.
These primitives introduce performance bottlenecks and necessitate efficient
alternatives. Second, we synthesize work in an area we call ""DP-Cryptography"" -
cryptographic primitives that are allowed to leak differentially private
outputs. These primitives have orders of magnitude better performance than
standard cryptographic primitives. DP-cryptographic primitives are perfectly
suited for implementing alternatives to LDP, but are also applicable to
scenarios where standard cryptographic primitives do not have practical
implementations. Through this unique lens of research taxonomy, we survey
ongoing research in these directions while also providing novel directions for
future research.

Prediction (NWP) models, quantitative prediction of intensity of heavy rainfall
events and associated disasters has remained a challenge. Encouraged by
compelling evidence of electrical influences on cloud/rain microphysical
processes, here we propose a hypothesis that modification of raindrop size
distribution (RDSD) towards larger drop sizes through enhanced
collision-coalescence facilitated by cloud electric fields could be one of the
factors responsible for intensity errors in weather/climate models. The
robustness of the hypothesis is confirmed through a series of simulations of
strongly electrified (SE) rain events and weakly electrified (WE) events with a
convection-permitting weather prediction model incorporating the electrically
modified RDSD parameters in the model physics. Our results indicate a possible
roadmap for improving hazard prediction associated with extreme rainfall events
in weather prediction models and climatological dry bias of precipitation
simulation in many climate models.

in the Deeply virtual Compton scattering and Bethe-Heitler parts of the cross

formalism which has provided so far the underlying mathematical framework to
study Deeply virtual Compton scattering and related experiments. Using
theoretical model calculations of the twist-two generalized parton
distributions, $ H$, $E$, $\widetilde{H}$ and $\widetilde{E}$, we uncover large
discrepancies between the harmonic series and our proposed framework. Most
importantly, these numerical differences appear in the intermediate $Q^2$ range
which represents a sweet spot for extracting generalized parton distributions
from data. % We provide a framework that is ideal, on one side, to study and
compare the different conventions that can be used to describe the leading
order contribution to DVCS in QCD, while on the other, it facilitates a
quantitative extraction of physically meaningful information from experiment

devices based on Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, a layered AFM that was recently found to
exhibit AHE in bulk crystals below the N\'eel temperature T$_N$ = 29 K.
Transport measurements reveal a pronounced resistivity anisotropy, indicating
that upon lowering temperature the electronic coupling between individual
atomic layers is increasingly suppressed. The experiments also show an
extremely large anomalous Hall conductivity of approximately 400 S/cm, more
than one order of magnitude larger than in the bulk, which demonstrates the
importance of studying the AHE in small exfoliated crystals, less affected by
crystalline defects. Interestingly, the corresponding anomalous Hall
conductance, when normalized to the number of contributing atomic planes, is
$\sim \, 0.6 \; e^2/h$ per layer, approaching the value expected for the
quantized anomalous Hall effect. The observed strong anisotropy of transport
and the very large anomalous Hall conductance per layer make the properties of
Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ compatible with the presence of partially filled
topologically non-trivial 2D bands originating from the magnetic superstructure
of the antiferromagnetic state. Isolating atomically thin layers of this

presence of a full-duplex adversary that is capable of executing a jamming
attack while also being able to measure the power levels on various frequency
bands. Due to the presence of a strong adversary, first, we point out that
traditional frequency-hopping does not help since unused frequency bands may
not be available, and moreover, the victim's transition between the frequency
bands would be detected by the full-duplex adversary. Identifying these
challenges, we propose a new cooperative mitigation strategy, referred to as
the Semi-Coherent Fast-Forward Full-Duplex (SC-FFFD) relaying technique,
wherein the victim node, upon switching to a new frequency band, seeks the
assistance of its incumbent user, which is also a full-duplex radio, to
instantaneously forward its messages to the destination using a portion of
their powers. Meanwhile, the two nodes cooperatively use their residual powers
on the jammed frequency band so as to engage the adversary to continue
executing the jamming attack on the same band. Using on-off keying (OOK) and
phase-shift-keying (PSK) as the modulation schemes at the victim and the helper
node, respectively, we derive upper bounds on the probability of error of
jointly decoding the information symbols of the two nodes, and subsequently
derive analytical solutions to arrive at the power-splitting factor between the
two frequency bands to minimize the error of both the nodes. We also present
extensive simulation results for various signal-to-noise-ratio values and PSK
constellations to showcase the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Although CNN hardware accelerators are already included as part of many SoC

devices is still considered challenging, mainly due to the vast number of
design parameters that need to be balanced to achieve an efficient solution.
Quantization techniques, when applied to the network parameters, lead to a
reduction of power and area and may also change the ratio between communication
and computation. As a result, some algorithmic solutions may suffer from lack
of memory bandwidth or computational resources and fail to achieve the expected
performance due to hardware constraints. Thus, the system designer and the
micro-architect need to understand at early development stages the impact of
their high-level decisions (e.g., the architecture of the CNN and the amount of
bits used to represent its parameters) on the final product (e.g., the expected
power saving, area, and accuracy). Unfortunately, existing tools fall short of
supporting such decisions.
  This paper introduces a hardware-aware complexity metric that aims to assist
the system designer of the neural network architectures, through the entire
project lifetime (especially at its early stages) by predicting the impact of
architectural and micro-architectural decisions on the final product. We
demonstrate how the proposed metric can help evaluate different design
alternatives of neural network models on resource-restricted devices such as
real-time embedded systems, and to avoid making design mistakes at early
stages.

with $M$-ary frequency shift keying are designed using three optimization
algorithms and presented in four decoding schemes. In a concatenated code such
as PTC, the Viterbi decoder for the outer convolutional code provides maximum
likelihood decoding. Hence, the error correction performance is dependent on
the decoding scheme used for the inner code. Due to the structure of the
encoder with the modulation scheme, the channel output can be interpreted as an
assignment problem. SD decoding can then be designed accordingly, using the
presented, low-complexity optimization-based schemes. The bit error rate (BER)
performance of the schemes are simulated in an additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) and powerline communication (PLC) channel. The complexities of the
schemes are also presented. The performance of the SD schemes are compared with
the existing SD threshold detector, with BER results showing significant coding
gain for certain codebooks. From the results, a reasonable trade-off between
the complexity and coding gain is observed for a noisy channel such as the PLC

dependence of deterministic chaotic systems upon initial conditions. However,
this is only one facet of the notion of unpredictability pioneered by Lorenz,
who actually predicted that multiscale fluid flows could spontaneously lose
their deterministic nature and become intrinsically random. This effect, which
is radically different from chaos, have remained out of reach for detailed
physical observations. Here, we substantiate this scenario by showing that it
is inherent to the elementary Kelvin--Helmholtz hydrodynamical instability of
an initially singular shear layer. We moreover provide evidence that the
resulting macroscopic flow displays universal statistical properties that are
triggered by, but independent of specific physical properties at micro-scales.
This spontaneous stochasticity is interpreted as an Eulerian counterpart to
Richardson's relative dispersion of Lagrangian particles, giving substance to
the intrinsic nature of randomness in turbulence.

of one of those systems, Tau 4 (RX J0502.8+1624), which underwent a
serendipitous jump from a low-accretion state into a high state during the
final days of the observation. Apart from one brief flare, there was no
evidence of accretion during the 70 d of observations of the low state. As Tau
4 transitioned into a high state, the resumption of accretion was very gradual,
taking approximately six days (~90 binary orbits). We supplement Tau 4's K2
light curve with time-resolved spectroscopy obtained in both high and low
states of accretion. High-excitation lines, such as He II 468.6 nm, were
extraordinarily weak, even when the system was actively accreting. This
strongly suggests the absence of an accretion shock, placing Tau 4 in the
bombardment regime predicted for AM Herculis systems with low accretion rates.
In both the high-state and low-state spectra, Zeeman absorption features from
the white dwarf's photosphere are present and reveal a surface-averaged field
strength of $15\pm2$ MG. Remarkably, the high-state spectra also show
Zeeman-split emission lines produced in a region with a field strength of
$12\pm1$ MG. Zeeman emission has not been previously reported in an AM Herculis
system, and we propose that the phenomenon is caused by a temperature inversion
in the WD's atmosphere near the accretion region.

instances where agents do not know their values. On each round, a mechanism
first assigns an allocation each to a set of agents and charges them a price;
at the end of the round, the agents provide (stochastic) feedback to the
mechanism for the allocation they received. This setting is motivated by
applications in cloud markets and online advertising where an agent may know
her value for an allocation only after experiencing it. Therefore, the
mechanism needs to explore different allocations for each agent so that it can
learn their values, while simultaneously attempting to find the socially
optimal set of allocations. Our focus is on truthful and individually rational
mechanisms which imitate the classical VCG mechanism in the long run. To that
end, we first define three notions of regret for the welfare, the individual
utilities of each agent and that of the mechanism. We show that these three
terms are interdependent via an $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower bound for the
maximum of these three terms after $T$ rounds of allocations, and describe an
algorithm which essentially achieves this rate. Our framework also provides
flexibility to control the pricing scheme so as to trade-off between the agent
and seller regrets. Next, we define asymptotic variants for the truthfulness
and individual rationality requirements and provide asymptotic rates to
quantify the degree to which both properties are satisfied by the proposed

Autoencoders address this challenge by mapping trees to a vectorial latent

tree structure. However, existing autoencoding approaches for tree data fail to
take the specific grammatical structure of tree domains into account and rely
on deep learning, thus requiring large training datasets and long training

Hz). A force platform recorded torque actuated by the feet, and normalized sway
path length (SPL) was computed as a construct for postural performance during
each period. SPL values indicated improvement in postural performance over the
trial periods. Significant variation in absolute power values (ASP) was found
in assessing postural adaptation: an increase in theta band ASP in the
frontal-central region for closed-eyes trials, an increase in theta and beta
band ASP in the parietal region for open-eyes trials. In habituation, no
significant variations in ASP were observed during closed-eyes trials, whereas
an increase in theta, alpha, and beta band ASP was observed with open eyes.
Furthermore, open-eyed trials generally yielded a greater number of significant
ASP differences across all bands during both adaptation and habituation,
suggesting that following cortical activity during postural perturbation may be
up-regulated with the availability of visual feedback. Results provide deeper
insight into pathological postural control failure by exploring the dynamic
changes in both cortical activity and postural kinematics during adaptation and
habituation to proprioceptive postural perturbation.

node in the network represents a voter and can be in one of two states that
correspond to different opinions shared by the voters. A voter disagreeing with
its neighbor's opinion may either adopt it or rewire its link to another
randomly chosen voter with any opinion. The system is studied by means of the
pair approximation in which a distinction between the average degrees of nodes
in different states is made. This approach allows us to identify two
dynamically active phases, a symmetric and an asymmetric one. The asymmetric
active phase, in contrast to the symmetric, is characterized by different
numbers of nodes in the opposite states that coexist in the network. The pair
approximation predicts the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which
leads to a continuous phase transition between the symmetric and the asymmetric
active phases. In this case, the absorbing transition occurs between the
asymmetric active and the absorbing phases after the spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Discontinuous phase transitions and hysteresis loops between both
active phases are also possible. Interestingly, the asymmetric active phase is
not displayed by the model where the rewiring occurs only to voters sharing the

algorithm employs geometric algebra to determine the pose for a pair of
coplanar parallel lines (ideally a tangent pair as in a rectangle). This is
achieved by computing vanishing points on a visual unit sphere, which
correspond to pose matrix vectors. The algorithm can determine pose for an
extremely distorted view source without prior rectification, owing to a
visual-sphere perspective model mapping of view coordinates. Mapping can be
performed using either a perspective map lookup or a parametric universal
perspective distortion model, which is also presented in this paper. The
outcome is a robust pose matrix computation that can be executed on an embedded

the Thyssen claim that distant simultaneity is conventional, I show that, using
a moving clock, relativistic time-dilation allows the synchronization of
isochronized stationary clocks without knowing OWVL and also allows,
separately, the measurement of OWVL. A burst of unstable particles is a
suitable moving clock. Thus, one-way velocity and synchronization are shown to
be independent concepts. The wavelength transmitted by an airgap and the decay
of unstable particles have been neglected regarding OWVL, but all experiments

by the smoke caused by the $CO_2$ injection, and dissection tools, thus
reducing the visibility of organs and tissues. This lack of visibility
increases the surgery time and even the probability of mistakes conducted by
the surgeon, then producing negative consequences on the patient's health. In
this paper, a novel computational approach to remove the smoke effects is
introduced. The proposed method is based on an image-to-image conditional
generative adversarial network in which a dark channel is used as an embedded
guide mask. Obtained experimental results are evaluated and compared
quantitatively with other desmoking and dehazing state-of-art methods using the
metrics of the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity
(SSIM) index. Based on these metrics, it is found that the proposed method has
improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the processing
time required by our method is 92 frames per second, and thus, it can be
applied in a real-time medical system trough an embedded device.

The improvement may be in terms of preservation, revitalization, livability,

the SCC have certain constraints that may not allow the devices and nodes to
cooperate to save their resources such as memory, energy, and buffer, or simply
maximize their performance. Thus, to stimulate the nodes to avoid selfish
behavior, SSC needs a novel and well-organized solution to motivate nodes for
cooperation. This article aims to resolve the issue of selfish behaviors in SCC
and to encourage the nodes for cooperation. A novel mechanism Socially Omitting
Selfishness (SOS) has been proposed to manage/eradicate selfishness using a
socially-oriented election process. The election process elects different heads
based on weight and cooperation (using VCG model). The election of heads and
incentive mechanism encourages the nodes to show participation and behave as
highly cooperative members of the community. Furthermore, an extended version
of the Dempster-Shafer model has been used to discourage the selfish behavior
of the participating nodes in the SOS scheme. It uses different monitoring and
gateway nodes to efficiently employ the proposed scheme. A mathematical model
has been developed for the aforementioned aspects and simulated through the NS2
simulation environment to analyze the performance of SOS. The results of the
proposed scheme outperform the contemporary schemes in terms of average
delivery delay, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and average energy.

calibrationless magnetic resonance image (Cl-MRI) reconstruction that is fast,

  Theory and Methods: Cl-MRI methods can enable high acceleration rates and
flexible sampling patterns, but their clinical application is limited by
computational complexity and large memory footprint. The proposed computational
procedure, HIgh-dimensional fast ConvolU-tional framework (HICU), provides
fast, memory-efficient recovery of unsampled k-space points. For demonstration,
HICU is applied to six 2D T2-weighted brain, seven 2D cardiac cine, five 3D

  Results: The 2D imaging results show that HICU can offer one to two orders of
magnitude computation speedup compared to other Cl-MRI methods without
sacrificing imaging quality. The 2D cine and 3D imaging results show that the
computational acceleration techniques included in HICU yield computing time on
par with SENSE-based compressed sensing methods with up to 3 dB improvement in
signal-to-error ratio and better perceptual quality. The MSDWI results
demonstrate the feasibility of HICU for a challenging multi-shot echo-planar
imaging application.
  Conclusions: The presented method, HICU, offers efficient computation and
scalability as well as extendibility to a wide variety of MRI applications.

Unlike IDSs they not only detect threats but prevent them from disrupting the

a multifunctional platform material due to its desirable properties, including
its lightweight nature, high mechanical properties, and good conductivity.
However, their mass adoption and applications by industry have run into
significant bottlenecks because of large variability and uncertainty in quality
during fabrication. There is an urgent demand to produce high-quality,
high-performance buckypaper at an industrial scale. Raman spectroscopy provides
detailed nanostructure information within seconds, and the obtained spectra can
be decomposed into multiple effects associated with diverse quality
characteristics of buckypaper. However, the decomposed effects are
high-dimensional, and a systematic quantification method for buckypaper quality
assessment has been lacking. In this paper, we propose a real-time data-driven
quality assessment method, which fills in the blank of quantifying the quality
for continuous manufacturing processes of CNT buckypaper. The composite indices
derived from the proposed method are developed by analyzing in-line Raman
spectroscopy sensing data. Weighted cross-correlation and maximum margin
clustering are used to fuse the fixed effects into an inconsistency index to
monitor the long-term mean shift of the process and to fuse the normal effects
into a uniformity index to monitor the within-sample normality. Those
individual quality indices are then combined into a composite index to reflect
the overall quality of buckypaper. A case study indicates that our proposed
approach can determine the quality rank for ten samples, and can provide
quantitative quality indices for single-walled carbon nanotube buckypaper after
acid processing or functionalization. The quality assessment results are
consistent with evaluations from the experienced engineers.

inferred with the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) for 14 unique eclipse coronae
that span almost two complete solar cycles. We find that the direction of the
coronal magnetic field does not become radial until at least 3 Rs, with a high
variance between 1.5 and 3 Rs at different latitudes and phases of the solar

regions with weaker magnetic field strengths in the photosphere, while stronger
photospheric fields are associated with highly radial field lines in the
corona. In addition, we find an abundance of field lines which extend
continuously from the solar surface out to several solar radii at all
latitudes, regardless of the presence of coronal holes. These results have
implications for testing and constraining coronal magnetic field models, and
for linking in situ solar wind measurements to their sources at the Sun.

outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The
difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the

remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.

design, has gained much popularity in recent years with increasingly complex
search algorithms being proposed. Yet, solid comparisons with simple baselines
are often missing. At the same time, recent retrospective studies have found
many new algorithms to be no better than random search (RS). In this work we
consider, for the first time, a simple Local Search (LS) algorithm for NAS. We
particularly consider a multi-objective NAS formulation, with network accuracy
and network complexity as two objectives, as understanding the trade-off
between these two objectives is arguably the most interesting aspect of NAS.
The proposed LS algorithm is compared with RS and two evolutionary algorithms
(EAs), as these are often heralded as being ideal for multi-objective
optimization. To promote reproducibility, we create and release two benchmark
datasets, named MacroNAS-C10 and MacroNAS-C100, containing 200K saved network
evaluations for two established image classification tasks, CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100. Our benchmarks are designed to be complementary to existing
benchmarks, especially in that they are better suited for multi-objective
search. We additionally consider a version of the problem with a much larger
architecture space. While we find and show that the considered algorithms
explore the search space in fundamentally different ways, we also find that LS
substantially outperforms RS and even performs nearly as good as
state-of-the-art EAs. We believe that this provides strong evidence that LS is
truly a competitive baseline for NAS against which new NAS algorithms should be
benchmarked.

single-phase turbulence models, which fail to capture complex two-phase flow
dynamics across dilute and dense regimes, especially when two-way coupling
between the phases is important. In the present study, particles settle under
gravity in an unbounded viscous fluid. At sufficient mass loadings, interphase
momentum exchange between the phases results in the spontaneous generation of
particle clusters that sustain velocity fluctuations in the fluid. Data
generated from Eulerian--Lagrangian simulations are used in a sparse regression
method for model closure that ensures form invariance. Particular attention is
paid to modelling the unclosed terms unique to the multiphase RANS equations
(drag production, drag exchange, pressure strain and viscous dissipation). A
minimal set of tensors is presented that serve as the basis for modelling. It
is found that sparse regression identifies compact, algebraic models that are
accurate across flow conditions and robust to sparse training data.

may only be willing to disclose their locations when some condition is met, for
instance in proximity of a disaster area or an event of interest. Currently,
such functionality can be achieved using searchable encryption. Such
cryptographic primitives provide provable guarantees for privacy, and allow
decryption only when the location satisfies some predicate. Nevertheless, they
rely on expensive pairing-based cryptography (PBC), of which direct application
to the domain of location updates leads to impractical solutions. We propose
secure and efficient techniques for private processing of location updates that
complement the use of PBC and lead to significant gains in performance by
reducing the amount of required pairing operations. We implement two
optimizations that further improve performance: materialization of results to
expensive mathematical operations, and parallelization. We also propose an
heuristic that brings down the computational overhead through enlarging an
alert zone by a small factor (given as system parameter), therefore trading off
a small and controlled amount of privacy for significant performance gains.
Extensive experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly

  with Application to Microbial Communities Analysis",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microbial communities analysis is drawing growing attention due to the rapid
development of high-throughput sequencing techniques nowadays. The observed
data has the following typical characteristics: it is high-dimensional,
compositional (lying in a simplex) and even would be leptokurtic and highly
skewed due to the existence of overly abundant taxa, which makes the
conventional correlation analysis infeasible to study the co-occurrence and
co-exclusion relationship between microbial taxa. In this article, we address
the challenges of covariance estimation for this kind of data. Assuming the
basis covariance matrix lying in a well-recognized class of sparse covariance
matrices, we adopt a proxy matrix known as centered log-ratio covariance matrix
in the literature, which is approximately indistinguishable from the real basis
covariance matrix as the dimensionality tends to infinity. We construct a
Median-of-Means (MOM) estimator for the centered log-ratio covariance matrix
and propose a thresholding procedure that is adaptive to the variability of
individual entries. By imposing a much weaker finite fourth moment condition
compared with the sub-Gaussianity condition in the literature, we derive the
optimal rate of convergence under the spectral norm. In addition, we also
provide theoretical guarantee on support recovery. The adaptive thresholding
procedure of the MOM estimator is easy to implement and gains robustness when
outliers or heavy-tailedness exist. Thorough simulation studies are conducted
to show the advantages of the proposed procedure over some state-of-the-arts
methods. At last, we apply the proposed method to analyze a microbiome dataset
in human gut. The R script for implementing the method is available at

conducting a large campaign to spectroscopically classify all transients
occurring in galaxies in the Census of the Local Universe (CLU) catalog. The
aim of the experiment is to construct a spectroscopically complete,
volume-limited sample of transients coincident within 100"" of CLU galaxies out
to 200 Mpc, and to a depth of 20 mag. We describe the survey design and
spectroscopic completeness from the first 16 months of operations. We present
results from a systematic search for Calcium rich gap transients in the sample
of 22 low luminosity (peak absolute magnitude $M > -17$), hydrogen poor events
found in the experiment (out of 754 spectroscopically classified SNe). We
report the detection of eight Calcium rich gap transients, and constrain their
volumetric rate to be at least $\approx 15\pm5$% of the SN Ia rate. Combining
this sample with ten events from the literature, we find a likely continuum of
spectroscopic properties ranging from events with SN Ia-like features (Ca-Ia
objects) to SN Ib/c-like features (Ca-Ib/c objects) at peak light. Within the
Ca-Ib/c events, we find two populations of events distinguished by their red
($g - r \approx 1.5$ mag) or green ($g - r \approx 0.5$ mag) spectral colors at
$r$-band peak, wherein redder events show strong line blanketing signatures,
slower light curves, weaker He lines and lower [Ca II]/[O I] in the nebular
phase. Together, we find that the spectroscopic continuum, volumetric rates and
striking old environments are consistent with the explosive burning of He
shells on low mass white dwarfs. We posit that Ca-Ia and red Ca-Ib/c objects
are consistent with the double detonation of He shells with high He burning
efficiency, while green Ca-Ib/c objects could arise from less efficient He
burning scenarios such as detonations in low density He shells or He shell
deflagrations.

(SNR) Cygnus Loop using the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic
Telescope (LAMOST) DR5. LAMOST features both a large field of view and a large
aperture, which allow us to simultaneously obtain 4000 spectra at
$\sim$3700-9000 \AA with R$\approx$1800. The Cygnus Loop is a prototype of
middle-aged SNRs, which has the advantages of being bright, large in angular
size, and relatively unobscured by dust. Along the line of sight to the Cygnus
Loop, 2747 LAMOST DR5 spectra are found in total, which are spatially
distributed over the entire remnant. This spectral sample is free of the
selection bias of most previous studies, which often focus on bright filaments
or regions bright in [O III]. Visual inspection verifies that 368 spectra
(13$\%$ of the total) show clear spectral features to confirm their association
with the remnant. In addition, 176 spectra with line emission show ambiguity of
their origin but have a possible association to the SNR. In particular, the 154
spectra dominated by the SNR emission are further analyzed by identifying
emission lines and measuring their intensities. We examine distributions of
physical properties such as electron density and temperature, which vary
significantly inside the remnant, using theoretical models. By combining a
large number of the LAMOST spectra, a global spectrum representing the Cygnus
Loop is constructed, which presents characteristics of radiative shocks.
Finally, we discuss the effect of the unbiased spectral sample on the global
spectrum and its implication to understand a spatially unresolved SNR in a
distant galaxy.

explored, including factorization methods. Factorization methods approximate
the weight matrix of a DNN layer with the multiplication of two or multiple
low-rank matrices. However, it is hard to measure the ranks of DNN layers
during the training process. Previous works mainly induce low-rank through
implicit approximations or via costly singular value decomposition (SVD)
process on every training step. The former approach usually induces a high
accuracy loss while the latter has a low efficiency. In this work, we propose
SVD training, the first method to explicitly achieve low-rank DNNs during
training without applying SVD on every step. SVD training first decomposes each
layer into the form of its full-rank SVD, then performs training directly on
the decomposed weights. We add orthogonality regularization to the singular
vectors, which ensure the valid form of SVD and avoid gradient
vanishing/exploding. Low-rank is encouraged by applying sparsity-inducing
regularizers on the singular values of each layer. Singular value pruning is
applied at the end to explicitly reach a low-rank model. We empirically show
that SVD training can significantly reduce the rank of DNN layers and achieve
higher reduction on computation load under the same accuracy, comparing to not
only previous factorization methods but also state-of-the-art filter pruning
methods.

B-spline surfaces from a sequence of straight line segments indicating the

required to approximate rulings on the resulting surface as much as possible.
This manner of developable surface design is conceptually similar to the
popular way of the freeform curve and surface design in the CAD community,
observing that a developable ruled surface is a single parameter family of
straight lines. This new design mode of the developable surface also provides
more flexibility than the widely employed way of developable surface design
from two boundary curves of the surface. The problem is treated by numerical
optimization methods with which a particular level of distance error is
allowed. We thus provide an effective tool for creating surfaces with a high
degree of developability when the input control rulings do not lie in exact
developable surfaces. We consider this ability as the superiority over
analytical methods in that it can deal with arbitrary design inputs and find
practically useful results.

as an effective and efficient alternative to the list or tree based data
structures for dynamic data set. It consists of two sub-arrays, one white and
one black of half of the size of the white. Both of them are conceptually
partitioned into segments of different ranks with the sizes grow in geometric
sequence. The layout of BWA allows easy calculation of the meta-data about the
segments, which are used extensively in the algorithms for the basic operations
of the dynamic sets. The insertion of a sequence of unordered numbers into BWA
takes amortized time logarithmic to the length of the sequence. It is also
proven that when the searched or deleted value is present in the BWA, the
asymptotic amortized cost for the operations is O(log(n)); otherwise, the time
will fall somewhere between O(log(n)) and O(log^2(n)). It is shown that the
state variable total, which records the number of values in the BWA captures
the dynamics of state transition of BWA. This fact is exploited to produce
concise, easy- to-understand, and efficient coding for the operations. As it
uses arrays as the underlying structure for dynamic set, a BWA need neither the
space to store the pointers referencing other data nodes nor the time to chase
the pointers as with any linked data structures. A C++ implementation of the
BWA is completed. The performance data were gathered and plotted, which
confirmed the theoretic analysis. The testing results showed that the amortized

Feedback regulation is crucial to tightly control this system, but the specific

work, we aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms in hematopoiesis by
conducting perturbation experiments, where animal subjects are exposed to an
external agent in order to observe the system response and evolution.
Developing a proper experimental design for these studies is an extremely
challenging task. To address this issue, we have developed a novel Bayesian
framework for optimal design of perturbation experiments. We model the numbers
of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in mice that are exposed to a low
dose of radiation. We use a differential equations model that accounts for
feedback and feedforward regulation. A significant obstacle is that the
experimental data are not longitudinal, rather each data point corresponds to a
different animal. This model is embedded in a hierarchical framework with
latent variables that capture unobserved cellular population levels. We select
the optimum design based on the amount of information gain, measured by the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability distributions before and
after observing the data. We evaluate our approach using synthetic and

model parameters even with relatively few subjects. Additionally, we
demonstrate that the model parameters show a wide range of sensitivities to
design options. Our method should allow scientists to find the optimal design

OGLE-2017-BLG-0406, which was observed both from the ground and by the ${\it
Spitzer}$ satellite in a solar orbit. At high magnification, the anomaly in the
light curve was densely observed by ground-based-survey and follow-up groups,
and it was found to be explained by a planetary lens with a planet/host mass
ratio of $q=7.0 \times 10^{-4}$ from the light-curve modeling. The ground-only
and ${\it Spitzer}$-""only"" data each provide very strong one-dimensional (1-D)
constraints on the 2-D microlens parallax vector $\bf{\pi_{\rm E}}$. When
combined, these yield a precise measurement of $\bf{\pi_{\rm E}}$, and so of
the masses of the host $M_{\rm host}=0.56\pm0.07\,M_\odot$ and planet $M_{\rm
planet} = 0.41 \pm 0.05\,M_{\rm Jup}$. The system lies at a distance $D_{\rm
L}=5.2 \pm 0.5 \ {\rm kpc}$ from the Sun toward the Galactic bulge, and the
host is more likely to be a disk population star according to the kinematics of
the lens. The projected separation of the planet from the host is $a_{\perp} =
3.5 \pm 0.3 \ {\rm au}$, i.e., just over twice the snow line. The Galactic-disk
kinematics are established in part from a precise measurement of the source
proper motion based on OGLE-IV data. By contrast, the ${\it Gaia}$
proper-motion measurement of the source suffers from a catastrophic
$10\,\sigma$ error.

is proposed for visible light communication (VLC) systems. The proposed GDC
scheme achieves dimming control by simultaneously adjusting the intensity of
transmitted symbols and the number of active elements in a space-time matrix.
Both the indices of the active elements in each space-time matrix and the
modulated constellation symbols are used to carry information. Since
illumination is deemed as the prior task of VLC, an incremental algorithm for
index mapping is proposed for achieving target optical power and uniform
illumination. Next, GDC having the optimal activation pattern is investigated
to further improve the bit-error rate (BER) performance. In particular, the BER
performance of GDC is analyzed using the union bound technique. Based on the
analytical BER bound, the optimal activation pattern of GDC scheme with the
minimum BER criterion (GDC-MBER) is obtained by exhaustively searching all
conditional pairwise error probabilities. However, since GDC-MBER requires high
search complexity, two low-complexity GDC schemes having the maximum free
distance criterion (GDCMFD) are proposed. The first GDC-MFD scheme, coined as
GDC-MFD1, reduces the computational complexity by deriving a lower bound of the
free distance based on Rayleigh-Ritz theorem. Based on the time-invariance
characteristics of the VLC channel, GDC-MFD2 is proposed to further reduce the
required computation efforts. Simulation and numerical results show that
GDC-MBER, GDC-MFD1 and GDC-MFD2 have similar BER performance, and they can
achieve 2 dB performance gains over conventional hybrid dimming control scheme
and 7 dB performance gains over digital dimming control schemes.

Boundary and bulk effects are investigated systematically, putting emphasis on
the phase relation between the modulation and the atomic motion of the coherent
phonon. They are summarized as follows: Modulation by the boundary effect is in
phase with the coherent phonon amplitude, while that by the bulk effect shows
$\pi/2$ phase difference. Strong frequency dependence appears in the modulation
by the bulk effect, while no frequency dependence by the boundary effect.
First-principles calculations support the reliability of the analytical result.

elucidate the deterioration mechanism. Here, we present operando direct
observation of spin states in the cells using electron spin resonance (ESR)
spectroscopy in order to investigate the operation and deterioration mechanisms
from a microscopic viewpoint. By simultaneous measurements of solar-cell and
ESR characteristics of the same cell, the spin states in the hole-transport
material (HTM) spiro-OMeTAD are demonstrated to be changed at the molecular
level, which varies the device performance under device operation. These
variations are ascribed to the change of hole transport by charge-carrier
scatterings and filling of deep trapping levels in the HTM, and to interfacial
electric dipole layers formed at the HTM interfaces. In addition, reverse
electron transfer from TiO2 layer to the HTM layer is directly demonstrated at
the molecular level under ultraviolet light irradiation, which causes the
decrease in the HTM doping effect. Thus, conducting such operando microscopic
investigation on the internal states in the cells would be useful to obtain a

occur when insolation is low and CO2 outgassing rates are unable to balance
with the rapid drawdown of CO2 during warm weathering periods. Planets in this
regime will alternate between global glaciation and transient warm climate
phases. This mechanism is capable of explaining the geomorphological evidence
for transient warm periods in the martian record. Previous work has shown that
collision-induced absorption of CO2-H2 was capable of deglaciating early Mars,
but only with high H2 outgassing rates (greater than ~600 Tmol/yr) and at high
surface pressures (between 3 to 4 bars). We used new theoretically derived
collision-induced absorption coefficients for CO2-H2 to reevaluate the climate
limit cycling hypothesis for early Mars. Using the new and stronger absorption
coefficients in our 1-dimensional radiative convective model as well as our
energy balance model, we find that limit cycling can occur with an H2
outgassing rate as low as ~300 Tmol/yr at surface pressures below 3 bars. Our
results agree more closely with paleoparameters for early martian surface
pressure and hydrogen abundance.

on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We limit this study to exoplanets and BDs
with orbits that have semi-major axis of 1AU<a0<20AU, a high eccentricity,
e0>0.25, and having a parent star of mass M>1Mo. We find that the star HIP
75458 will engulf its planet HIP 75458 b during its RGB phase. The planet will
remove the envelope and terminate the RGB evolution, leaving a bare helium core
of mass 0.4Mo that will evolve to form a helium white dwarf. Only in one system
out of five, the planet beta Pic c will enter the envelope of its parent star
during the AGB phase. For that to occur, we have to reduce the wind mass-loss
rate by a factor of about four from its commonly used value. This strengthens
an early conclusion, which was based on exoplanets with circular orbits, that
states that to have a non-negligible fraction of AGB stars that engulf planets
we should consider lower wind mass-loss rates of isolated AGB stars (before
they are spun-up by a companion). Such an engulfed planet might lead to the
shaping of the AGB mass-loss geometry to form an elliptical planetary nebula.

regular tree lies in the uniqueness region by Li et al. (2013). Moreover, in
the tree non-uniqueness region, Sly (2010) showed that there is no

decay approach due to Weitz (2006) or the polynomial interpolation approach
developed by Barvinok (2016). However the running time is only polynomial for
constant $\Delta$. For the hardcore model, recent work of Anari et al. (2020)
establishes rapid mixing of the simple single-site Markov chain known as the
Glauber dynamics in the tree uniqueness region. Our work simplifies their
analysis of the Glauber dynamics by considering the total pairwise influence of
a fixed vertex $v$ on other vertices, as opposed to the total influence on $v$,
thereby extending their work to all 2-spin models and improving the mixing
time.
  More importantly our proof ties together the three disparate algorithmic
approaches: we show that contraction of the tree recursions with a suitable
potential function, which is the primary technique for establishing efficiency
of Weitz's correlation decay approach and Barvinok's polynomial interpolation
approach, also establishes rapid mixing of the Glauber dynamics. We emphasize
that this connection holds for all 2-spin models (both antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic), and existing proofs for correlation decay or polynomial
interpolation immediately imply rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics. Our proof
utilizes that the graph partition function divides that of Weitz's
self-avoiding walk trees, leading to new tools for analyzing influence of
vertices.

the polarimetric properties, for some purposes in both Optics and SAR
Polarimetry, the concept of coherency vector associated with a nondepolarizing
medium has proven to be an useful mathematical structure that inherits certain
symmetries underlying the nature of linear polarimetric transformations of the
states of polarization of light caused by its interaction with material media.
While the Jones and Mueller matrices of a serial combination of devices are
given by the respective conventional matrix products, the composition of
coherency vectors of such serial combinations requires a specific and
unconventional mathematical rule. In this work, a vector product of coherency
vectors is presented that satisfies, in a meaningful and consistent manner, the
indicated requirements. As a result, a new algebraic formalism is built where
the representation of polarization states of electromagnetic waves through
Stokes vectors is preserved, while nondepolarizing media are represented by
coherency vectors and general media are represented by coherency matrices
generated by partially coherent compositions of the coherency vectors of the
components.

results suggest that the SCLs and the charge transfer kinetics are intertwined.
The emergence of the SCLs and the depletion of reactants increases the charge

that the strong electric fields originating at interfaces yield significant

factorization (online NMF). The key idea is to learn dictionary patterns of
short evolution instances of the new daily cases in multiple countries at the

dictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from
the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online
NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to
the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by
the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions,
we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results
can be directly attributed to the learned dictionary patterns due to their

that are qualitatively distinct from matter at thermal equilibrium. However,
the most spectacular departures from equilibrium phase behaviour are thought to
be confined to systems with polar or nematic asymmetry. In this paper, we show
that such departures are also displayed in more symmetric phases such as
hexatics if, in addition, the constituent particles have chiral asymmetry. We
show that chiral active hexatics whose rotation rate does not depend on density
have giant number fluctuations. If the rotation rate depends on density, the
giant number fluctuations are suppressed due to a novel orientation-density
sound mode with a linear dispersion which propagates even in the overdamped
limit. However, we demonstrate that beyond a finite but large lengthscale, a
chirality and activity-induced relevant nonlinearity invalidates the
predictions of the linear theory and destroys the hexatic order. In addition,
we show that activity modifies the interactions between defects in the active
chiral hexatic phase, making them non-mutual. Finally, to demonstrate the

melting of chiral active crystals in finite systems.

orthorhombic distortion of the perovskite unit cell. These effects provide
another evidence for the strong coupling between the electronic and lattice
degrees of freedom in this class of compounds. Upon increasing pressure, a
systematic increase of the transport anisotropies is observed. The anomalous
pressure-induced changes of the resistivity cannot be accounted for by the
pressure dependence of the density of the electron charge carriers, as inferred
from Hall effect measurements. Moreover, pressure-induced rotations of the IrO6
octahedra likely occur within the distorted perovskite unit cell and affect
electron mobility of this system.

of criteria (e.g. core prominence combined with low-surface brightness of the
extended emission and steep spectrum of the central region) we selected a
subsample of candidate restarted radio galaxies representing between 13% and
15% of the 158 sources of the main sample. We compare their properties to the
rest of the sample, which consists of remnant candidates and active radio
galaxies. Optical identifications and characterisations of the host galaxies
indicate similar properties for candidate restarted, remnant, and active radio
galaxies, suggesting that they all come from the same parent population. The
fraction of restarted radio galaxies is slightly higher with respect to
remnants, suggesting that the restarted phase can often follow after a
relatively short remnant phase (the duration of the remnant phase being a few

integral parts of the life cycle of massive elliptical galaxies. A preliminary
investigation does not suggest a strong dependence of this cycle on the

emerging in deep multi-agent simulations possesses a similar ability to refer
to novel primitive combinations, and whether it accomplishes this feat by
strategies akin to human-language compositionality. Equipped with new ways to
measure compositionality in emergent languages inspired by disentanglement in
representation learning, we establish three main results. First, given
sufficiently large input spaces, the emergent language will naturally develop
the ability to refer to novel composite concepts. Second, there is no
correlation between the degree of compositionality of an emergent language and
its ability to generalize. Third, while compositionality is not necessary for
generalization, it provides an advantage in terms of language transmission: The
more compositional a language is, the more easily it will be picked up by new
learners, even when the latter differ in architecture from the original agents.
We conclude that compositionality does not arise from simple generalization
pressure, but if an emergent language does chance upon it, it will be more
likely to survive and thrive.

Because parameter server (PS) frequently experiences network congestion, recent
studies have found that training paradigms without a centralized server
outperform the traditional server-based paradigms in terms of communication
efficiency. However, with the increasing growth of model sizes, these
server-free paradigms are also confronted with substantial communication
overhead that seriously deteriorates the performance of distributed training.
In this paper, we focus on communication efficiency of two serverless
paradigms, i.e., Ring All-Reduce (RAR) and gossip, by proposing the Quantized
Parallel Restarted Stochastic Gradient Descent (QPRSGD), an algorithm that
allows multiple local SGD updates before a global synchronization, in synergy
with the quantization to significantly reduce the communication overhead. We
establish the bound of accumulative errors according to the synchronization
mode and the network topology, which is essential to ensure the convergence
property. Under both aggregation paradigms, the algorithm achieves the linear
speedup property with respect to the number of local updates as well as the
number of workers. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm achieves a convergence
rate $O(1/\sqrt{NK^2M})$ under the gossip paradigm and outperforms all existing
compression methods, where $N$ is the times of global synchronizations, and $K$
is the number of local updates, while $M$ is the number of nodes. An empirical
study on various machine learning models demonstrates that the communication
overhead is reduced by 90\%, and the convergence speed is boosted by up to 18.6
times, in a low bandwidth network, in comparison with Parallel SGD.

an approximation subspace. Keeping the exact equations of motion with their
full nonlinearity, this provides a nonperturbative scheme that goes beyond
shell crossing. Focusing on the simplest case of a curl-free Gaussian ansatz
for the displacement and velocity fields, we find that truncations of the power
spectra on nonlinear scales directly arise from the equations of motion. This
leads to a truncated Zeldovich approximation for the density power spectrum,
but with a truncation that is not set a priori and with different power spectra
for the displacement and velocity fields. The positivity of their auto power
spectra also follows from the equations of motion. Although the density power
spectrum is only recovered up to a smooth drift on BAO scales, the predicted

triangular mesh surfaces. With the popularity of 3D scanning techniques,
scanning-derived mesh surfaces have seen a significant increase in their
application to machining. Quite often, such mesh surfaces exhibit defects such
as noises, which differentiate them from the good-quality mesh surfaces
previous research work focuses on. To generate tool paths for such poor-quality
mesh surfaces, the primary challenge lies in robustness against the defects. In
this work, a robust tool path generation method is proposed for poor-quality
mesh surfaces. In addition to robustness, the method is quite efficient,
providing the benefit of faster iterations and improved integration between
scanning and machining. The fundamental principle of the method is to convert
the tool path generation problem to the heat diffusion problem that has robust
and efficient algorithms available. The effectiveness of the method will be
demonstrated by a series of case studies and comparisons.

processes from a quantitative perspective. A well-known limitation of process
simulation is that the accuracy of the simulation results is limited by the
faithfulness of the process model and simulation parameters given as input to
the simulator. To tackle this limitation, several authors have proposed to
discover simulation models from process execution logs so that the resulting
simulation models more closely match reality. Existing techniques in this field
assume that each resource in the process performs one task at a time. In
reality, however, resources may engage in multitasking behavior. Traditional
simulation approaches do not handle multitasking. Instead, they rely on a
resource allocation approach wherein a task instance is only assigned to a
resource when the resource is free. This inability to handle multitasking leads
to an overestimation of execution times. This paper proposes an approach to
discover multitasking in business process execution logs and to generate a
simulation model that takes into account the discovered multitasking behavior.
The key idea is to adjust the processing times of tasks in such a way that
executing the multitasked tasks sequentially with the adjusted times is
equivalent to executing them concurrently with the original processing times.
The proposed approach is evaluated using a real-life dataset and synthetic
datasets with different levels of multitasking. The results show that, in the
presence of multitasking, the approach improves the accuracy of simulation
models discovered from execution logs.

estimate total gas masses for all LARS galaxies, taking into account a
metallicity-dependent gas-to-dust ratio. Star formation rates were estimated
from FIR, [C II]158$\mu$m and [O I]63$\mu$m luminosities. LARS covers a wide
dynamic range in the derived properties, with FIR-based star formation rates
from $\sim$0.5-100 $M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$, gas fractions between $\sim$15-80% and
gas depletion times ranging from a few hundred Myr up to more than 10 Gyr. The
distribution of LARS galaxies in the $\Sigma_{gas}$ vs. $\Sigma_{SFR}$
(Kennicutt-Schmidt plane) is thus quite heterogeneous. However, we find that
LARS galaxies with the longest gas depletion times, i.e. relatively high gas
surface densities ($\Sigma_{gas}$) and low star formation rate densities
($\Sigma_{SFR}$), have by far the highest Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction. A strong
$\sim$linear relation is found between Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and the total
gas (HI+H$_2$) depletion time. We argue that the Ly$\alpha$ escape in those
galaxies is driven by turbulence in the star-forming gas that shifts the
Ly$\alpha$ photons out of resonance close to the places where they originate.
We further report on an extreme [C II]158$\mu$m excess in LARS 5, corresponding
to $\sim$14$\pm$3% of the FIR luminosity, i.e. the most extreme [C II]-to-FIR
ratio observed in a non-AGN galaxy to date.

multi-modal large-scale information retrieval. State-of-the-art results in
image-text matching are achieved by inter-playing image and text features from
the two different processing pipelines, usually using mutual attention
mechanisms. However, this invalidates any chance to extract separate visual and
textual features needed for later indexing steps in large-scale retrieval
systems. In this regard, we introduce the Transformer Encoder Reasoning Network
(TERN), an architecture built upon one of the modern relationship-aware
self-attentive architectures, the Transformer Encoder (TE). This architecture
is able to separately reason on the two different modalities and to enforce a
final common abstract concept space by sharing the weights of the deeper
transformer layers. Thanks to this design, the implemented network is able to
produce compact and very rich visual and textual features available for the
successive indexing step. Experiments are conducted on the MS-COCO dataset, and
we evaluate the results using a discounted cumulative gain metric with
relevance computed exploiting caption similarities, in order to assess possibly
non-exact but relevant search results. We demonstrate that on this metric we

group members by at least 2 magnitudes. However, the scenario of their
formation remains controversial. We propose here a probabilistic analysis of
FGs, extracted from the large catalogue of candidate groups and clusters
detected by Sarron et al. (2018) in the CFHTLS survey, based on photometric
redshifts, to investigate their position in the cosmic web and probe their
environment. Based on spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, we estimate the
probability of galaxies to belong to a galaxy structure, and by imposing the
condition that the brightest group galaxy is at least brighter than the others
by 2 magnitudes, we compute the probability for a given galaxy structure to be
a FG. We analyse the mass distribution of these candidate FGs, and estimate
their distance to the filaments and nodes of the cosmic web in which they are
embedded. We find that the structures with masses lower than $2.4\times
10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ have the highest probabilities of being fossil groups (PFG).
Overall, structures with PFG$\geq$50% are located close to the cosmic web
filaments (87% are located at less than 1 Mpc from their nearest filament).
They are preferentially four times more distant from their nearest node than
from their nearest filament. We confirm that FGs have small masses and are
rare. They seem to reside closeby cosmic filaments and do not survive in nodes.
Being in a poor environment could therefore be the driver of FG formation, the
number of nearby galaxies not being sufficient to compensate for the
cannibalism of the central group galaxy.

which each unit adjusts their rhythms to achieve synchrony through mutual

synchronization. Here, we demonstrate the self-organized synchronization of
phonon lasers in a two-membrane-in-the-middle optomechanical system. The probe
of individual membrane enables to monitor the real-time transient dynamics of
synchronization, which reveal that the system enters into the synchronization
regime via torus birth bifurcation line. The phase-locking phenomenon and the
transition between in-phase and anti-phase regimes are directly observed.
Moreover, such a system greatly facilitate the controllable synchronous states,
and consequently a phononic memory is realized by tuning the system parameters.
This result is an important step towards the future studies of many-body
collective behaviors in multiresonator optomechanics with long distances, and
might find potential applications in quantum information processing and complex

when it is driven by a control field $\omega_{c}$ and a probe field
$\omega_{p}$, and works in the non-perturbative regime, as was shown in a
previous work [Xiong et al., Opt. Lett. 38, 353 (2013)]. The repetition
frequency of such a comb is equal to the mechanical frequency $\omega_{b}$ and
is untunable, which limits the precision of the comb. Here we address this
problem by driving the system with an additional strong probe field
$\omega_{f}$, and the detuning between $\omega_{f}$ and $\omega_{c}$ is equal
to $\omega_{b}/n$ (here $n$ is an integer), i.e., this detuning is a fraction
of the mechanical frequency. In this case, we obtain some interesting results.
We find that not only the integer-order (higher-order) sidebands, but also the
fraction-order sidebands, and the sum and difference sidebands between the
integer- and fraction-order sidebands, will appear in the output spectrum. The
generated nonlinear sidebands constitute an optomechanically induced sideband
comb (OMISC). The frequency range and the repetition frequency of the OMISC are
proportional to the sideband cutoff-order number and the sideband interval,
respectively. We show that we can extend the frequency range of the OMISC by
increasing the intensity of the probe field $\omega_{p}$. More importantly, we
can decrease the repetition frequency, and consequently, improve the precision
of the OMISC by increasing $n$ and the intensity of the probe field
$\omega_{f}$.

more interpretable community structures and allows the quantification of the

has given access to realize a plethora of ultralow power and fast spintronic
devices such as non-volatile magnetic memories, spin-torque nano-oscillators,
and neuromorphic computing devices. Recent advances have led to the notion that
relativistic spin-orbit coupling is an efficient source for current-induced
torques, opening the field of spin-orbitronics. Despite the significant
progress, however, the fundamental mechanism of magnetization manipulation, the
requirement of spin currents in generating current-induced torques, has
remained unchanged. Here, we demonstrate the generation of current-induced
torques without the use of spin currents. By measuring the current-induced
torque for naturally-oxidized-Cu/ferromagnetic-metal bilayers, we observed an
exceptionally high effective spin Hall conductivity at low temperatures despite
the absence of strong spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we found that the
direction of the torque depends on the choice of the ferromagnetic layer, which
counters the conventional understanding of the current-induced torque. These
unconventional features are best interpreted in terms of an orbital counterpart
of the spin torque, an orbital torque, which arises from the orbital Rashba
effect and orbital current. These findings will shed light on the underlying
physics of current-induced magnetization manipulation, potentially altering the
landscape of spin-orbitronics.

Parametric timed automata (PTAs) are a classical formalism for such systems but

set allowing to reach some given discrete state, is undecidable.
Lower-bound/upper-bound parametric timed automata (L/U-PTAs) achieve
decidability for reachability properties by enforcing a separation of
parameters used as upper bounds in the automaton constraints, and those used as
lower bounds.
  In this paper, we first study reachability. We exhibit a subclass of PTAs
(namely integer-points PTAs) with bounded rational-valued parameters for which
the parametric reachability emptiness problem is decidable. Using this class,
we present further results improving the boundary between decidability and
undecidability for PTAs and their subclasses such as L/U-PTAs.

reduce to the purely algebraic problem of factoring the monodromy map to the
symmetric group $S_n$ through the braid group $B_n$. In our approach, this
factorization is often achieved as a consequence of a stronger property: a
factorization through a free group. In the reverse direction we show that any
non-abelian surface group has infinitely many finite simple non-abelian groups
quotients with characteristic kernels which do not contain any simple loop and
hence the quotient maps do not factor through free groups. By a pullback
construction, finite dimensional Hermitian representations of braid groups
provide invariants for the braided surfaces. We show that the strong
equivalence classes of braided surfaces are separated by such invariants if and
only if they are profinitely separated.

$\textit{i.e.}$, by calculating the equilibrium penetrant partition ratio
$\mathcal K$ and penetrant diffusivity $D_\text{in}$ inside the membrane. We
vary two key parameters, namely the monomer-monomer interaction, which controls
the degree of swelling and collapse of the network, and the monomer-penetrant
interaction, which tunes the penetrant uptake and microscopic energy landscape
for diffusive transport. The results for the partition ratio $\mathcal K$ cover
four orders of magnitude and are non-monotonic versus the parameters, which is
well interpreted by a second-order virial expansion of the free energy of
transferring one penetrant from bulk into the polymeric medium. We find that
the penetrant diffusivity $D_\text{in}$ in the polydisperse networks, in
contrast to highly ordered membrane structures, exhibits relatively simple
exponential decays and obeys well-known free-volume and Kramers' escape scaling
laws. The eventually resulting permeability $\mathcal P$ thus resembles the
qualitative functional behavior (including maximization and minimization) of
the partitioning. However, partitioning and diffusion are anti-correlated,
yielding large quantitative cancellations, controlled and fine-tuned by the
network density and interactions as rationalized by our scaling laws. As a
consequence, we finally demonstrate that even small changes of
penetrant-network interactions, $\textit{e.g.}$, by half a $k_\text{B}T$,
modify the permselectivity of the membrane by almost one order of magnitude.

of electrical devices such as coils, motors, relays, solenoids and transformers
is heavily dependent on the Electrical Insulation System (EIS). Accelerated
aging methods are used to rapidly simulate the conditions in real life, which
is typically years (20,000 hours) depending on the operating conditions. The
purpose of accelerated aging is to bring lifetime of an EIS to hours, days or
weeks. Shortening the lifetime of an EIS to such an extent, allows for the
study of the insulation materials behavior as well as investigate ways to
estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for the purpose of predictive
maintenance. Unexpected failures in operation processes, where redundancy is
not present, can lead to high economical losses, machine downtime and often
health and safety risks. Conditions, under which thermal aging methods are
generally reported in the literature, typically neglect other factors, owing to
the sheer complexity and interdependence of the multifaceted aging phenomena.
This paper examines some existing thermal aging tests, which are currently used
to obtain data for enamel degradation in order to try to better understand of
how the thermal stresses degrade the EIS. Separation of these stresses, which
the EIS operate under, can yield a better understanding of how each of the
Thermal, the Electrical, the Ambient and the Mechanical (TEAM) stresses behave.

exhibit more nonlocality than maximally entangled states, (ii) entails new
notions of genuine multipartite entanglement and nonlocality that are free of
the pathological features of the conventional notions, and (iii) makes possible
a resource-theoretic account of the self-testing of entangled states which
generalizes and simplifies prior results. Along the way, we derive some
fundamental results concerning the necessary and sufficient conditions for
convertibility between pure entangled states under LOSR and highlight some of
their consequences, such as the impossibility of catalysis for bipartite pure
states. The resource-theoretic perspective also clarifies why it is neither
surprising nor problematic that there are mixed entangled states which do not
violate any Bell inequality. Our results motivate the study of
LOSR-entanglement as a new branch of entanglement theory.

while neural networks fail due to catastrophic forgetting between new and
previously-learned tasks. We consider a class-incremental setting which means
that the task-ID is unknown at inference time. The imbalance between old and
new classes typically results in a bias of the network towards the newest ones.
This imbalance problem can either be addressed by storing exemplars from
previous tasks, or by using image replay methods. However, the latter can only
be applied to toy datasets since image generation for complex datasets is a
hard problem.
  We propose a solution to the imbalance problem based on generative feature
replay which does not require any exemplars. To do this, we split the network
into two parts: a feature extractor and a classifier. To prevent forgetting, we
combine generative feature replay in the classifier with feature distillation
in the feature extractor. Through feature generation, our method reduces the
complexity of generative replay and prevents the imbalance problem. Our
approach is computationally efficient and scalable to large datasets.
Experiments confirm that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, while requiring only a fraction of the storage needed
for exemplar-based continual learning. Code available at

parameterised by the Reynolds, Froude, Weber and Ekman numbers. The variation
of the Ekman number ($Ek$), defined to be proportional of the rotational speed
of the cylinder, has a strong effect on the flow characteristics. Simulations
are conducted over a wide range of $Ek$ values ($0 \leq Ek \leq 484$) in order

results indicate that increasing $Ek$, which leads to a rise in the magnitude
of centrifugal forces, produces a stabilising effect, suppressing wave
formation. Key flow features, such as the transition from a 2D to a more
complex 3D wave regime, are influenced significantly by this stabilisation, and
are investigated in detail. Furthermore, the imposed rotation results in
distinct flow characteristics such as the development of angled waves, which
arise due to the combination of gravitationally- and centrifugally-driven
motion in the axial and azimuthal directions, respectively. We also use a

Landau levels is incorporated so that no approximations are made on the

point vector current correlation function in the complex energy plane reveals
that, in addition to the usual Unitary cut, a non-trival Landau cut appears in
the physical kinematic domains solely due to the external magnetic field.
Moreover, these kinematic domains of the Unitary and Landau cuts are found to
be significantly modified due to the AMM of the quarks. With finite AMM of the
quarks, for certain values of the external magnetic field, the kinematically
forbidden gap between the Unitary and Landau cuts are shown to vanish leading
to the generation of a continuous spectrum of dilepton emission over the whole
invariant mass region not observed earlier.

detectability of the the cross correlation assuming the the LAE deep survey of

lidar in practical applications is the presence of strong ambient illumination
which corrupts the data and can jeopardize the detection of peaks/surface in
the signals. This background noise not only complicates the observation model
classically used for 3D reconstruction but also the estimation procedure which
requires iterative methods. In this work, we consider a new similarity measure
for robust depth estimation, which allows us to use a simple observation model
and a non-iterative estimation procedure while being robust to
mis-specification of the background illumination model. This choice leads to a
computationally attractive depth estimation procedure without significant
degradation of the reconstruction performance. This new depth estimation
procedure is coupled with a spatio-temporal model to capture the natural
correlation between neighboring pixels and successive frames for dynamic scene
analysis. The resulting online inference process is scalable and well suited
for parallel implementation. The benefits of the proposed method are
demonstrated through a series of experiments conducted with simulated and real
single-photon lidar videos, allowing the analysis of dynamic scenes at 325 m

In this work, we demonstrate a lifelong 3D convolutional framework --
c(C)la(a)ss increment(t)al net(Net)work (CatNet), which considers temporal
information in videos and enables lifelong learning for egocentric gesture
video recognition by learning the feature representation of an exemplar set
selected from previous class samples. Importantly, we propose a two-stream
CatNet, which deploys RGB and depth modalities to train two separate networks.
We evaluate CatNets on a publicly available dataset -- EgoGesture dataset, and
show that CatNets can learn many classes incrementally over a long period of
time. Results also demonstrate that the two-stream architecture achieves the
best performance on both joint training and class incremental training compared
to 3 other one-stream architectures. The codes and pre-trained models used in

studying this question consists of carrying out multi-agent experiments in
which a population of agents takes part in a series of scripted and
task-oriented communicative interactions, called 'language games'. While each
individual language game is typically played by two agents in the population, a
large series of games allows the population to converge on a shared
communication system. Setting up an experiment in which a rich system for
communicating about the real world emerges is a major enterprise, as it
requires a variety of software components for running multi-agent experiments,
for interacting with sensors and actuators, for conceptualising and
interpreting semantic structures, and for mapping between these semantic
structures and linguistic utterances. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the
one hand, it introduces a high-level robot interface that extends the Babel
software system, presenting for the first time a toolkit that provides flexible
modules for dealing with each subtask involved in running advanced grounded
language game experiments. On the other hand, it provides a practical guide to
using the toolkit for implementing such experiments, taking a grounded colour

masks acting on the feature-channels. The model is trained to reduce the
bitrate by minimizing a loss on importance maps and a loss on the probability
output by a context model for arithmetic coding. In our experiments, we show
that the proposed system achieves high compression rates and high objective

major challenges for fruit harvesting robots. Different from traditional
obstacle avoidance methods, this paper presents an active obstacle separation
strategy that combines push and drag motions. The separation motion and
trajectory are generated based on the 3D visual perception of the obstacle
information around the target. A linear push is used to clear the obstacles
from the area below the target, while a zig-zag push that contains several
linear motions is proposed to push aside more dense obstacles. The zig-zag push
can generate multi-directional pushes and the side-to-side motion can break the
static contact force between the target and obstacles, thus helping the gripper
to receive a target in more complex situations. Moreover, we propose a novel
drag operation to address the issue of mis-capturing obstacles located above
the target, in which the gripper drags the target to a place with fewer
obstacles and then pushes back to move the obstacles aside for further
detachment. Furthermore, an image processing pipeline consisting of color
thresholding, object detection using deep learning and point cloud operation,
is developed to implement the proposed method on a harvesting robot. Field
tests show that the proposed method can improve the picking performance
substantially. This method helps to enable complex clusters of fruits to be

Incorporating a photon-number difference measurement, finally, the noisy target

contrast to lower dimensional ones cannot be overspun even under linear test
particle accretion. Further if a black hole in dimension $>4$ has one of its

overspun. Thus rotating black holes in six and higher dimensions, and those
with one rotation parameter switched off, would always obey the weak cosmic

we describe LinConTS, a TS-based algorithm for bandits that place a linear

for LinConTS, the regret as well as the cumulative constraint violations are
upper bounded by O(\log T) for the suboptimal arms. We develop a proof

Markovianity on the level of quantum evolution. Divisible maps provide
important generalization of Markovian semigroups. Usually one analyzes either
completely positive or just positive divisibility meaning that the
corresponding propagators are defined in terms of completely positive or
positive maps, respectively. For maps which are invertible at any moment of
time the very existence of propagator is already guaranteed and hence the only
issue is (complete) positivity and trace-preservation. However, for maps which
are not invertible the problem is much more involved since even the existence
of a propagator is not guaranteed. In this paper we propose a simple method to
construct propagators of dynamical maps using the concept of generalized
inverse. We analyze both time-continuous and time-discrete maps. Since the
generalized inverse is not uniquely defined the same applies for the
corresponding propagator. In simple examples of qubit evolution we analyze it
turns out that additional requirement of complete positivity possibly makes the

distance. This paper presents a theoretical model and experimental
characterisation of the ice growth dynamics, the final ice shape and the

we study experimentally the formation of the ice layer and we show that both

in the water, using an infrared camera. The model shows an excellent agreement
with the experimental fields. In particular, it predicts well the linear
decrease of the water surface temperature observed along the plane, confirming
that the final ice shape is a consequence of the interaction between the

conditions in which the fluid is considered as a non-Newtonian fluid and the
structure is described by a nonlinear multi-layered model. The fluid domain is
driven by a nonlinear elastic shell and thus is not fixed. To simplify the
problem, we map the moving fluid domain into a fixed domain by applying an
arbitrary Lagrange Euler mapping. Unlike the classical method by which we can
consider the problem as its entirety, we utilize the time-discretization and
split the problem into a fluid subproblem and a structure subproblem by an
operator splitting scheme. Since the structure subproblem is nonlinear,
Lax-Milgram lemma does not hold. Here we prove the existence and uniqueness by
means of the traditional semigroup theory. Noticing that the Non-Newtonian
fluid possesses a $ p- $Laplacian structure, we show the existence and
uniqueness of solutions to the fluid subproblem by considering the
Browder-Minty theorem. With the uniform energy estimates, we deduce the weak

proposed by Muha and Cani\'c [J. Differential Equations {\bf 266} (2019),

the hydromechanical properties of the designated host rock, the
Callovo-Oxfordian claystone (COx), are investigated in laboratory tests.
Experiments presented in this study are carried out to determine several
coefficients required within a transversely isotropic material model. They
include isotropic compression tests, pore pressure tests, and deviatoric
loading tests parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane. We emphasize the
adapted experimental devices and testing procedures, necessary to detect small
strains under high pressures, on a material, which is sensitive to water and
has a very low permeability. In particular, we discovered a significant
decrease of elastic stiffness with decreasing effective stress, which was
observed to be reversible. In both isotropic and deviatoric tests, a notable
anisotropic strain response was found. The Young modulus parallel to bedding
was about 1.8 times higher than the one perpendicular to the bedding plane. A
notably low Poisson ratio perpendicular to the bedding plane with values
between 0.1 and 0.2 was evidenced. While the anisotropy of the back-calculated
Biot coefficient was found to be low, a significant anisotropy of the Skempton
coefficient was computed. The performed experiments provide an overdetermined
set of material parameters at different stress levels. Using all determined
parameters in a least square error regression scheme, seven independent elastic
coefficients and their effective stress dependency are characterized.
Parameters measured under isotropic loading are well represented by this set of
coefficients, while the poroelastic framework with isotropic stress dependency
is not sufficient to describe laboratory findings from triaxial loading.

The completion time of such
a task can be profoundly affected by restart: the occasional resetting of the
task's underlying random process. Consequently, determining when restart will
impede or expedite task completion is a subject of major importance. In recent
years researchers explored this subject extensively, with main focus set on
average behavior, i.e. on mean completion times. On the one hand, the mean
approach asserts the centrality of ""sharp restart"" -- resetting with
deterministic (fixed) timers. On the other hand, a significant drawback of the
mean approach is that it provides no insight regarding tail behavior, i.e. the
occurrence likelihood of extreme completion times. Addressing sharp restart,
and shifting the focus from means to extremes, this paper establishes a
comprehensive tail-behavior analysis of completion times. Employing the
reliability-engineering notion of hazard rate, the analysis yields a set of
universal results that determine -- from a tail-behavior perspective -- when
sharp restart will impede or expedite task completion. The universal results
are formulated in terms of explicit and highly applicable hazard-rate criteria.
With the novel results at hand, a universal average-&-tail classification
manual for sharp restart is devised. The manual specifies general scenarios in
which -- rather counter-intuitively -- sharp restart has an opposite effect on
average behavior and on tail behavior: decreasing mean completion times while
dramatically increasing the likelihood of extreme completion times; and,
conversely, increasing mean completion times while dramatically decreasing the
likelihood of extreme completion times.

supported by the Pantheon sample at $\sim$32\% and $\sim$78\% CLs,
respectively, in the $\omega$CDM and $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM models. Among these

strongly. It shows that $\Omega_{k0}$ is significantly dependent on the adopted

AdS$_3$ background were found where the scalar matter profile had a singularity
at the origin $r=0$. In this paper, we find numerically static vortex solutions
where the scalar and gauge fields have a non-singular profile under Einstein
gravity in an AdS$_3$ background. Vortices with different winding numbers $n$,
VEV $v$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ are obtained. These vortices have
positive mass and are not BTZ black holes as they have no event horizon. The
mass is determined in two ways: by subtracting the numerical values of two
separate asymptotic metrics and via an integral that is purely over the matter
fields. The mass of the vortex increases as the cosmological constant becomes
more negative and this coincides with the core of the vortex becoming smaller
(compressed). We then consider the vortex with gravity in asymptotically flat
spacetime for different values of the coupling $\alpha=1/(16 \pi G)$. At the
origin, the spacetime has its highest curvature and there is no singularity. It
transitions to an asymptotic conical spacetime with angular deficit that
increases significantly as $\alpha$ decreases. For comparison, we also consider
the vortex without gravity in flat spacetime. For this case, one cannot obtain
the mass by the first method (subtracting two metrics) but remarkably, via a
limiting procedure, one can obtain an integral mass formula. In the absence of
gauge fields, there is a well-known logarithmic divergence in the energy of the
vortex. With gravity, we present this divergence in a new light. We show that
the metric acquires a logarithmic term which is the $2+1$ dimensional
realization of the Newtonian gravitational potential when General Relativity is
supplemented with a scalar field. This opens up novel possibilities which we
discuss in the conclusion.

generalized Heisenberg algebras} and denote by $\mathcal{H}_q (f,g)$, related
to generalized Heisenberg algebras, but allowing more parameters of freedom, so
as to encompass a wider range of applications and include previously studied
algebras, such as (generalized) down-up algebras. In particular, our class now
includes the enveloping algebra of the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra
and its $q$-deformation, neither of which can be realized as a generalized
Heisenberg algebra.
  This paper focuses mostly on the classification of finite-dimensional
irreducible representations of quantum generalized Heisenberg algebras, a study
which reveals their rich structure. Although these algebras are not in general
noetherian, their representations still retain some Lie-theoretic flavor. We
work over a field of arbitrary characteristic, although our results on the
representations require that it be algebraically closed.

specific conditional independence assumptions on the underlying predictors. A
variety of methods have been developed in recent years for Bayesian inference

confinement strategies on a most virulent epidemic. Our approach is motivated
by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two
populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which
the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non
confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The
model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following
a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the
differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is
observed in the COVID-19 epidemic.
  Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our
model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by
just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn
out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it
became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of
all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a
rekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second
epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the
scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a
progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the
progressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too
different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise
exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major
part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but
obeying rigorous distancing constraints.

implementation of quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential requirement

of discrete error syndrome measurements and adaptive recovery operations. These
active routines are hardware intensive, prone to introducing and propagating
errors, and expected to consume a vast majority of the processing power in a
large-scale quantum computer. In principle, QEC can be realized autonomously
and continuously by tailoring dissipation within the quantum system, but this
strategy has remained challenging so far. Here we encode a logical qubit in
Schr\""odinger cat-like multiphoton states of a superconducting cavity, and
demonstrate a corrective dissipation process that directly stabilizes an error
syndrome operator: the photon number parity. Implemented with continuous-wave
control fields only, this passive protocol realizes autonomous correction
against single-photon loss and boosts the coherence time of the multiphoton
qubit by over a factor of two. Notably, QEC is realized in a modest hardware
setup with neither high-fidelity readout nor fast digital feedback, in contrast
to the technological sophistication required for prior QEC demonstrations.
Compatible with other error suppression and phase stabilization techniques, our
experiment suggests reservoir engineering as a resource-efficient alternative
or supplement to active QEC in future quantum computing architectures.

$=$ 3/(4$\pi$r$^3_s$). Here we propose a parametrization of this function based
upon the satisfaction of exact constraints. For the static ($\omega$ = 0)
limit, we modify the model of Constantin and Pitarke at small wavevector q to
recover the known second-order gradient expansion, plus other changes. For all
frequencies $\omega$ at q $=$ 0, we use the model of Gross, Kohn, and Iwamoto.
A Cauchy integral extends this model to complex $\omega$ and implies the
standard Kramers-Kronig relations. A scaling relation permits closed forms for
not only the imaginary but also the real part of f$_{xc}$ for real $\omega$. We
then combine these ingredients by damping out the $\omega$ dependence at large
q in the same way that the q dependence is damped. Away from q $=$ 0 and
$\omega$ $=$ 0, the correlation contribution to the kernel becomes dominant
over exchange, even at r$_s$ $=$ 4, the valence electron density of metallic
sodium. The resulting correlation energy from integration over imaginary
$\omega$ is essentially exact. The plasmon pole of the density response
function is found by analytic continuation of f$_{xc}$ to $\omega$ just below
the real axis, and the resulting plasmon lifetime first decreases from infinity
and then increases as q grows from 0 toward the electron-hole continuum. A
static charge-density wave is found for r$_s$ $>$ 69, and shown to be
associated with softening of the plasmon mode. The exchange-only version of our
static kernel confirms Overhauser's 1968 prediction that correlation enhances

discretely by simplicial isometries on a connected piecewise hyperbolic
$\mathrm{CAT}(-1)$ simplicial complex with countably many simplices in finitely
many isometry types, assuming that vertex stabilizers are boundary amenable.
Consequently, they satisfy the Novikov conjecture.
  We then show that measure equivalent $2$-dimensional Artin groups of
hyperbolic type have isomorphic fixed set graphs -- an analogue of the curve
graph, introduced by Crisp. This yields classification results.
  We obtain strong rigidity theorems. Let $G=G_\Gamma$ be a $2$-dimensional
Artin group of hyperbolic type, with $\mathrm{Out}(G)$ finite. When the
automorphism groups of the fixed set graph and of the Cayley complex
$\mathfrak{C}$ coincide, every countable group $H$ which is measure equivalent
to $G$, is commensurable to a lattice in $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak{C})$. This
happens whenever $\Gamma$ is triangle-free with all labels at least $3$ --
unless $G$ is commensurable to the direct sum of $\mathbb{Z}$ and a free group.
When $\Gamma$ satisfies an additional star-rigidity condition, then
$\mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak{C})$ is countable, and $H$ is almost isomorphic to $G$.
  This has applications to orbit equivalence rigidity, and rigidity results for
von Neumann algebras associated to ergodic actions of Artin groups. We also
derive a rigidity statement regarding possible lattice envelopes of certain
Artin groups, and a cocycle superrigidity theorem from higher-rank lattices to
$2$-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type.

detected bounding boxes , e.g., ones covering only portions of human body. This
issue is common but overlooked by previous person search works. To alleviate
this issue, this paper proposes an Align-to-Part Network (APNet) for person
detection and re-Identification (reID). APNet refines detected bounding boxes
to cover the estimated holistic body regions, from which discriminative part
features can be extracted and aligned. Aligned part features naturally
formulate reID as a partial feature matching procedure, where valid part
features are selected for similarity computation, while part features on
occluded or noisy regions are discarded. This design enhances the robustness of
person search to real-world challenges with marginal computation overhead. This
paper also contributes a Large-Scale dataset for Person Search in the wild
(LSPS), which is by far the largest and the most challenging dataset for person
search. Experiments show that APNet brings considerable performance improvement
on LSPS. Meanwhile, it achieves competitive performance on existing person

due to hybridization of fermions of different bands with momenta k and k$+\pi$.
Such hybridization breaks the conservation of the number of particles in each

gap in the spectrum is calculated depending on the magnitude of on-site Coulomb
repulsion and the width of the band for the chain, as well as for square and

the gap in the fermion spectra in the Hubbard and Falicov-Kimball models within

a real (non-ideal) Paul trap, the quadrupole electric potential is not perfect

trapping efficiency. This paper presents a numerical method aiming to optimise
the geometry of a trap. It is applied to MORATrap in order to improve the
trapping efficiency and to enlarge the axial transparent solid angle compared
to LPCTrap. In the whole optimisation process, numerical computation of
electric potential and field was carried out using an electrostatic solver
based on boundary element method (BEM). The optimisation consisted in
minimising an objective function (fitness function) depending on higher order
multipoles of the potential. Finally, systematic changes of trap dimensions and
electrode displacements were applied to investigate geometrical effects on the

insensitive to obscuration; therefore, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
can be used as a tool to identify AGN in obscured systems. A well-established
upper limit to the brightness temperature of 10$^5$ K exists in star-forming
systems, thus VLBI observations can distinguish AGN from star-forming systems
via brightness temperature measurements. We present 1.6 GHz European VLBI
Network (EVN) observations of four SMGs (with measured redshifts) to search for
evidence of compact radio components associated with AGN cores. For two of the
sources, e-MERLIN images are also presented. Out of the four SMGs observed, we
detect one source, J123555.14, that has an integrated EVN flux density of 201

from a possible AGN in the remaining sources (J123600.10, J131225.73, and

the data suggest that this may be an extended, jet-dominated AGN that is
resolved by VLBI. Since the morphology of the faint radio source population is

around the world, having a severe impact on the health and life of many people
globally. One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect
the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting
this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the
fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed
specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with
COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning
models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We
first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available
datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by
board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms
was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including
ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease
in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining
3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98%
($\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity
and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix
of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions
potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain
most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While
the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a
larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy
rates. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are

the precision constraints on target estimates of the survey (Ballin &

explores the universe of the possible alternative stratifications determining
for each of them the best allocation, that is the one of minumum total size

the one that ensures the global minimum sample size. One fundamental
requirement to make this approach feasible is the possibility to estimate the
variability of target variables in generated strata; in general, as target
variable values are not available in the frame, but only proxy ones,
anticipated variance is calculated by modelling the relations between target

not only the total model variance, but also the co-variance derived by the
spatial auto-correlation. The last release of SamplingStrata enables to
consider both components of variance, thus allowing to harness spatial
auto-correlation in order to obtain more efficient samples.

crashes proposed in Kreuser and Sornette (2018). The price process is defined
as a geometric random walk combined with jumps modelled by separate, discrete
distributions associated with positive (and negative) bubbles. The key
ingredient of the model is to assume that the sizes of the jumps are
proportional to the bubble size. Thus, the jumps tend to efficiently bring back
excess bubble prices close to a normal or fundamental value (efficient
crashes). This is different from existing processes studied that assume jumps
that are independent of the mispricing. The present model is simplified
compared to Kreuser and Sornette (2018) in that we ignore the possibility of a
change of the probability of a crash as the price accelerates above the normal
price. We study the behaviour of investment strategies that maximize the
expected log of wealth (Kelly criterion) for the risky asset and a risk-free
asset. We show that the method behaves similarly to Kelly on Geometric Brownian
Motion in that it outperforms other methods in the long-term and it beats
classical Kelly. As a primary source of outperformance, we determine knowledge
about the presence of crashes, but interestingly find that knowledge of only
the size, and not the time of occurrence, already provides a significant and
robust edge. We then perform an error analysis to show that the method is
robust with respect to variations in the parameters. The method is most
sensitive to errors in the expected return.

Seyfert galaxies with circumnuclear star formation and is too gas-poor to drive
mass accretion onto the central engine. The continuum emission casts molecular
absorption features of CO, HCN, HCO$^+$, SO, SO$_2$, CS, CN, and H$_2$O, with
H$^{13}$CN and HC$^{15}$N and vibrationally-excited (v$_2 = 1$) HCN and

estimating them from multiple independent samples under minimal assumptions
about the model's interaction matrix; and (2) estimating them from one sample
in restrictive settings. We propose a unified framework that smoothly
interpolates between these two settings, enabling significantly richer
estimation guarantees from one, a few, or many samples.
  Our main theorem provides guarantees for one-sample estimation, quantifying
the estimation error in terms of the metric entropy of a family of interaction
matrices. As corollaries of our main theorem, we derive bounds when the model's
interaction matrix is a (sparse) linear combination of known matrices, or it
belongs to a finite set, or to a high-dimensional manifold. In fact, our main
result handles multiple independent samples by viewing them as one sample from
a larger model, and can be used to derive estimation bounds that are
qualitatively similar to those obtained in the afore-described multiple-sample
literature. Our technical approach benefits from sparsifying a model's
interaction network, conditioning on subsets of variables that make the
dependencies in the resulting conditional distribution sufficiently weak. We
use this sparsification technique to prove strong concentration and
anti-concentration results for the Ising model, which we believe have
applications beyond the scope of this paper.

of discrete aperiodic phase-steps at periodic intervals. We show that the
diffraction of the inscribing laser beam from the phase-step locations of the

accumulated phase, along with controlled index modulation, generates the

on-line communities so far but is employed here for the aim to represent
peoples' social behaviors where the generated communities are restricted
reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. As a result, three
findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the height of the
peaks in the time sequence of the number of infection cases tends to get
reduced corresponding to the upper bound of the size of groups where all
members meet. Second, if we adopt the constraint on m0, the number of all other
people one meets separately each at a time, to the range between 2 and 8, its
effect on the suppression of infections may be weak as far as we allow group
meetings of size W of 8 or larger. Third, such a moderate constraint may
temporarily seem to work for the reduction of infections in the early stage but
it may turn out to be just a delay of peaks. Based on these results, a policy
is proposed here: for quickly suppressing the number of infections, restrict W
to less than 4 if the constraint to make m0 at most 1 is too strict. If W is
set to less than 4, setting m0 to 4 or less works for quick reduction of
infections according to the result.

mechanical deformations give rise to a change in porosity and permeability,
which results in non-linearity of the mathematical problem. Assuming that the
deformations are very small, the model provided by Biot's theory of linear
poroelasticity is used to determine the local displacement of the skeleton of a
porous medium, as well as the fluid flow through the pores. In this continuum
scale model, the Kozeny-Carman equation is commonly used to determine the
permeability of the porous medium from the porosity. The Kozeny-Carman relation
states that flow through the pores is possible at a certain location as long as
the porosity is larger than zero at this location in the aquifer. However, from
network models it is known that percolation thresholds exist, indicating that
the permeability will be equal to zero if the porosity becomes smaller than
these thresholds. In this paper, the relationship between permeability and
porosity is investigated. A new permeability-porosity relation, based on the
percolation theory, is derived and compared with the Kozeny-Carman relation.
The strongest feature of the new approach is related to its capability to give
a good description of the permeability in case of low porosities. However, with
this network-inspired approach small values of the permeability are more likely
to occur. Since we show that the solution of Biot's model converges to the
solution of a saddle point problem for small time steps and low permeability,
we need stabilisation in the finite element approximation.

equations of fluid dynamics. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisations have
several advantageous properties. They can be used for arbitrary domains and
support a structured data layout, which is important on modern chip
architectures. For smooth solutions, higher order approximations can be
particularly efficient since errors decrease exponentially in the polynomial
degree. Due to the wide separation of timescales in atmospheric dynamics,
semi-implicit time integrators are highly efficient, since the implicit
treatment of fast waves avoids tight constraints on the time step size, and can
therefore improve overall efficiency. However, if implicit-explicit (IMEX)
integrators are used, a large linear system of equations has to be solved in
every time step. A particular problem for DG discretisations of
velocity-pressure systems is that the normal Schur-complement reduction to an
elliptic system for the pressure is not possible since the numerical fluxes
introduce artificial diffusion terms. For the shallow water equations, which
form an important model system, hybridised DG methods have been shown to
overcome this issue. However, no attention has been paid to the efficient
solution of the resulting linear system of equations. In this paper we address
this issue and show that the elliptic system for the flux unknowns can be
solved efficiently with a non-nested multigrid algorithm. The method is
implemented in the Firedrake library and we demonstrate the excellent
performance of the algorithm both for an idealised stationary flow problem in a
flat domain and for non-stationary setups in spherical geometry from the

environment in the massive theory, but rather than as a new coupling that may
require a renormalization in the ultraviolet domain. The divergence of an

highest energy photons from sources beyond redshifts of z $\geq$ 0.1 with
theoretical predictions in the presence of ALPs. We find no evidence for an
increased $\gamma$-ray transparency due to ALPs and therefore we set limits on
the ALPs parameters assuming a value of the intergalactic magnetic field
strength of 1 nG. Photon-ALP couplings above $10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ are excluded
for ALP masses $m_{a}$ $\lesssim3.0$ neV. These limits exclude a region of the
parameter space not covered by other $\gamma$-ray telescopes and are compatible
with constraints imposed by other experiments.

classification. However, applications in areas such as traffic monitoring,
social networks, and sensors produce data continuously, the so called data
streams, posing challenges to batch multi-label learning. With the lack of
stationarity in the distribution of data streams, new algorithms are needed to
online adapt to such changes (concept drift). Also, in realistic applications,
changes occur in scenarios of infinitely delayed labels, where the true classes
of the arrival instances are never available. We propose an online unsupervised
incremental method based on self-organizing maps for multi-label stream
classification with infinitely delayed labels. In the classification phase, we
use a k-nearest neighbors strategy to compute the winning neurons in the maps,
adapting to concept drift by online adjusting neuron weight vectors and dataset
label cardinality. We predict labels for each instance using the Bayes rule and
the outputs of each neuron, adapting the probabilities and conditional
probabilities of the classes in the stream. Experiments using synthetic and

a large amount of entanglement is needed in order to ensure a bosonic composite
behavior. By applying a composite boson ansatz, we found that a Wigner molecule
confined in two dimensional traps presents a bosonic behavior induced by
symmetry. The two-particle Wigner molecule ground state required by the
composite boson ansatz was obtained within the harmonic approximation in the
strong interacting regime. Our approach allows us to address few-particle
states (widely studied within a variety of theoretical and numerical
techniques) as well as a large number of particles (difficult to address due to
computational costs). For a large number of particles, we found strong
fermionic correlations exposed by the suppression of particle fluctuations. For
a small number of particles, we show that the wave function calculated within
the composite boson ansatz captures the Friedel-Wigner transition. The latter
is shown in a regime in which strong correlations due to the Pauli exclusion
principle arise, therefore, we conclude that the coboson ansatz reproduces the
many particle physics of a confined Wigner molecule, even in the presence of
strong deviations of the ideal bosonic behavior due to fermionic correlations.

subdivide into four redshift bins. In analysing our stacked samples binned by
redshift, we find evidence for a central excess of UV background light compared
to local backgrounds for clusters with $z<0.3$. We then stacked these $z<0.3$
clusters to find a statistically significant excess of $12 \pm 2.3$ photon
cm$^{-2}$ s${-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \AA $^{-1}$ \ over the median of $\sim 380$ photon

1$ Mpc, roughly consistent with the maximum radial extent of the clusters.
Analysis of possible physical processes contributing to the excess UV
brightness indicates that non-thermal emission from relativistic electrons in
the intracluster medium and faint, unresolved UV emission from cluster member

First, an implementation $\mathit{Impl}$ of $\mathit{Spec}$ may have some

$\mathit{Impl}$ may break some $\mathit{desired}$ properties that are not in

$\mathit{Impl}$. In an earlier paper, we addressed the first problem above by a
technique called Partial Quantifier Elimination (PQE). In contrast to complete
QE, in PQE, one takes out of the scope of quantifiers only a small piece of the
formula. We used PQE to generate properties of $\mathit{Impl}$ i.e. those
$\mathit{consistent}$ with $\mathit{Impl}$. Generation of an unwanted property
means that $\mathit{Impl}$ is buggy. In this paper, we address the second
problem above by using PQE to generate false properties i.e those that are
$\mathit{inconsistent}$ with $\mathit{Impl}$. Such properties are meant to
imitate the missing properties of $\mathit{Spec}$ that are not satisfied by
$\mathit{Impl}$ (if any). A false property is generated by modifying a piece of
a quantified formula describing 'the truth table' of $\mathit{Impl}$ and taking
this piece out of the scope of quantifiers. By modifying different pieces of
this formula one can generate a ""structurally complete"" set of false
properties. By generating tests detecting false properties of $\mathit{Impl}$
one produces a high quality test set. We apply our approach to verification of

are adopting sustainable transportation solutions for their everyday commutes.
However, as more people use the system, riders often encounter that bikes or
docks might not be available when they arrive to a station. As a result, many
systems like CitiBike and Divvy provide riders with information about the
network via smartphone apps so that riders can find stations with available
bikes. However, not all customers have adopted the use of these smartphone apps
for their station selection. By combining customer choice modeling and finite
capacity queueing models, we explore the impact of the smartphone app
technology to increase throughput and reduce blocking in bike sharing systems.
To this end, we prove a mean-field limit and a central limit theorem for an
empirical process of the number of stations with $k$ bikes. We also prove limit
theorems for a new process called the ratio process, which characterizes the
proportion of stations whose bike availability ratio lies within a particular
partition of the interval [0,1]. For the mean field limit, we prove that the
equilibrium exists, is unique, and that the stationary distribution of the
empirical measure converges to a Dirac mass at the same equilibrium, thus
showing an interchange of limits result ($\lim_{t\rightarrow

path dynamics of large scale bike-sharing systems. Our results illustrate that

establishing a baseline implementation of steady-state multi-conductor
unbalanced distribution network optimization problems, which includes
implementations of Power Flow and Optimal Power Flow problem types. Currently
implemented power flow formulations for these problem types include AC (polar
and rectangular), a second-order conic relaxation of the Branch Flow Model
(BFM) and Bus Injection Model (BIM), a semi-definite relaxation of BFM, and
several linear approximations, such as the simplified unbalanced BFM. The
results of AC power flow have been validated against OpenDSS, an open-source
""electric power distribution system simulator"", using IEEE distribution test
feeders (13, 34, 123 bus and LVTestCase), all parsed using a built-in OpenDSS
parser. This includes support for standard distribution system components as
well as novel resource models such as generic energy storage (multi-period) and
photovoltaic systems, with the intention to add support for additional
components in the future.

Since locating of a target using simultaneous multiple UAVs is costly and
impractical, achieving this task by utilizing single UAV becomes desirable.
Hence, in this paper, we propose an RSSI-based localization method that
utilizes only a single UAV. The proposed approach is based on clustering method
along with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The performance of the

This paper considers a fog-based IoT network, in which active IoT devices
transmit measurements of the monitored QoIs to the local edge node (EN), while
the ENs are connected to a cloud processor via limited-capacity fronthaul
links. While the conventional approach uses preambles as metadata for reserving
communication resources, here we consider assigning preambles directly to
measurement levels across all devices. The resulting Type-Based Multiple Access
(TBMA) protocol enables the efficient remote detection of the QoIs, rather than
of the individual payloads. The performance of both edge and cloud-based
detection or hypothesis testing is evaluated in terms of error exponents.
Cloud-based hypothesis testing is shown theoretically and via numerical results
to be advantageous when the inter-cell interference power and the fronthaul
capacity are sufficiently large.

that combine QM with ML (QM-ML) have been very effective in delivering the

integrating well-known signal processing (SP) techniques (i.e. short time
Fourier transform, continuous wavelet analysis and Wigner-Ville distribution)
in the QM-ML pipeline, we obtain a powerful machinery (QM-SP-ML) that can be
used for representation, visualization and forward design of molecules. More
precisely, in this study, we show that the time-frequency-like representation
of molecules encodes their structural, geometric, energetic, electronic and
thermodynamic properties. This is demonstrated by using the new representation
in the forward design loop as input to a deep convolutional neural networks
trained on DFTQM calculations, which outputs the properties of the molecules.
Tested on the QM9 dataset (composed of 133,855 molecules and 19 properties),
the new QM-SP-ML model is able to predict the properties of molecules with a
mean absolute error (MAE) below acceptable chemical accuracy (i.e. MAE < 1
Kcal/mol for total energies and MAE < 0.1 ev for orbital energies).
Furthermore, the new approach performs similarly or better compared to other ML
state-of-the-art techniques described in the literature. In all, in this study,
we show that the new QM-SP-ML model represents a powerful technique for
molecular forward design. All the codes and data generated and used in this

steady-state solution of nonlinear gas kinetic equation, removing the
long-standing problems of slow convergence and requirement of ultra-fine grids
in near-continuum flows. The key ingredients of GSIS are that the gas kinetic
equation and macroscopic synthetic equations are tightly coupled, and the
constitutive relations in macroscopic synthetic equations explicitly contain
Newton's law of shear stress and Fourier's law of heat conduction. The
higher-order constitutive relations describing rarefaction effects are
calculated from the velocity distribution function, however, their
constructions are simpler than our previous work (Su et al. Journal of
Computational Physics 407 (2020) 109245) for linearized gas kinetic equations.
On the other hand, solutions of macroscopic synthetic equations are used to
inform the evolution of gas kinetic equation at the next iteration step. A
rigorous linear Fourier stability analysis in periodic system shows that the
error decay rate of GSIS can be smaller than 0.5, which means that the
deviation to steady-state solution can be reduced by 3 orders of magnitude in
10 iterations. Other important advantages of the GSIS are (i) it does not rely
on the specific form of Boltzmann collision operator and (ii) it can be solved
by sophisticated techniques in computational fluid dynamics, making it amenable
to large scale engineering applications. In this paper, the efficiency and
accuracy of GSIS is demonstrated by a number of canonical test cases in
rarefied gas dynamics.

distribution coefficient for outgoing roads of diverges, and a priority rule
for incoming roads of merges. A general emission model is considered and its

then formulated in terms of the traffic distribution and priority parameters,

to as hypervectors. The dimension of these hypervectors is typically in the
range of tens of thousands. Proposed to solve cognitive tasks, HD computing
aims at calculating similarity among its data. Data transformation is realized
by three operations, including addition, multiplication and permutation. Its
ultra-wide data representation introduces redundancy against noise. Since
information is evenly distributed over every bit of the hypervectors, HD
computing is inherently robust. Additionally, due to the nature of those three
operations, HD computing leads to fast learning ability, high energy efficiency
and acceptable accuracy in learning and classification tasks. This paper
introduces the background of HD computing, and reviews the data representation,
data transformation, and similarity measurement. The orthogonality in high
dimensions presents opportunities for flexible computing. To balance the

they lead to significant accuracy loss in some application such as EEG
classification which is essential to be deployed in wearable devices. In this
paper, we propose an efficient multi-level binarized LSTM which has
significantly reduced computations whereas ensuring an accuracy pretty close to
full precision LSTM. By deploying 5-level binarized weights and inputs, our
method reduces area and delay of MAC operation about 31* and 27* in 65nm
technology, respectively with less than 0.01% accuracy loss. In contrast to
many compute-intensive deep-learning approaches, the proposed algorithm is
lightweight, and therefore, brings performance efficiency with accurate
LSTM-based EEG classification to real-time wearable devices.

recently created a new trend in machine learning research. In line with such
efforts, a deep learning model for one-dimensional consolidation where the
governing equation is applied as a constraint in the neural network is
presented here. A review of related research is first presented and discussed.
The deep learning model relies on automatic differentiation for applying the
governing equation as a constraint. The total loss is measured as a combination
of the training loss (based on analytical and model predicted solutions) and
the constraint loss (a requirement to satisfy the governing equation). Two
classes of problems are considered: forward and inverse problems. The forward
problems demonstrate the performance of a physically constrained neural network
model in predicting solutions for one-dimensional consolidation problems.
Inverse problems show prediction of the coefficient of consolidation.
Terzaghi's problem with varying boundary conditions are used as example and the
deep learning model shows a remarkable performance in both the forward and
inverse problems. While the application demonstrated here is a simple
one-dimensional consolidation problem, such a deep learning model integrated
with a physical law has huge implications for use in, such as, faster real-time
numerical prediction for digital twins, numerical model reproducibility and
constitutive model parameter optimization.

was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel

that (1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could

been the inability of existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based pose
regression methods to generalize to previously unseen places. Our recently
introduced CMRNet effectively addresses this limitation by enabling map
independent monocular localization in LiDAR-maps. In this paper, we now take it
a step further by introducing CMRNet++, which is a significantly more robust

independent of the camera parameters. We enable this capability by combining
deep learning with geometric techniques, and by moving the metric reasoning
outside the learning process. In this way, the weights of the network are not

penetration with the rising use of mobile devices has inspired an era of
technology that allows interfacing of physical objects and connecting them to
Internet for developing applications serving a wide range of purposes. Recent
developments in the area of wearable devices has led to the creation of another
segment in IoT, which can be conveniently referred to as Wearable Internet of
Things (WIoT). Research in this area promises to personalize healthcare in
previously unimaginable ways by allowing individual tracking of wellness and
health information. This chapter shall cover the different facets of Wearable
Internet of Things (WIoT) and ways in which it is a key driving technology
behind the concept of personalized healthcare. It shall discuss the theoretical
aspects of WIoT, focusing on functionality, design and applicability. Moreover,
it shall also elaborate on the role of wearable sensors, big data and cloud
computing as enabling technologies for WIoT.

due to ambulance not being able to reach the hospital in time. Also, with the
current annual growth of Vehicles being around 11% while the annual road
extension remaining around 4% in developing countries such as India, the
problem is further worsening. So, to deal with this problem the paper presents
a novel, easy toimplement alternative for traffic management during emergency
situations requiring only three main devices: Arduino UNO, GPS neo 6M and SIM
900A.

amount of light reaching the photovoltaic cells and by changing their external
spectral response. Currently, the soiling monitoring market is moving toward
optical sensors that measure transmittance or reflectance, rather than directly
measuring the impact of soiling on the performance of photovoltaic modules.
These sensors, which use a single optical measurement, are not able to correct
the soiling losses that depend on the solar irradiance spectra and on the
spectral response of the monitored PV material. This work investigates methods
that can improve the optical detection of soiling by extracting the full
soiling spectrum profiles using only two or three monochromatic measurements.
Spectral transmittance data, measured with a spectrophotometer and collected
during a 46-week experimental soiling study carried out in Ja\'en, Spain, was
analysed in this work. The use of a spectral profile for the hemispherical
transmittance of soiled PV glass is found to significantly improve the soiling
detection, returning the lowest errors independently of the PV materials and
irradiance conditions. In addition, this work shows that it is also possible to
select the measurement wavelengths to minimize the soiling loss detection error
depending on the monitored PV semiconductor material (silicon, CdTe, a-Si, CIGS
and a representative perovskite). The approaches discussed in this work are
also found to be more robust to potential measurement errors compared to single
wavelength measurement techniques.
