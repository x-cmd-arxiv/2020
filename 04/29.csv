Here, $k_y$ is the wavenumber in the direction perpendicular to both the

$k_y \rho_i \gtrsim 1$, the fastest growing mode is often a novel type of

as $k_y \rho_i \sim (\rho_i/\rho_e) L_{Te} / R_0 \sim 1$ and at a sufficiently
large radial wavenumber that electron finite Larmor radius effects become
important; that is, $K_x \rho_e \sim 1$, where $K_x$ is the effective radial
wavenumber. Here, $\rho_e$ is the electron gyroradius, $R_0$ is the major
radius of the last closed flux surface, and $1/L_{Te}$ is an inverse length
proportional to the logarithmic gradient of the equilibrium electron
temperature. The fastest growing toroidal ETG modes are often driven far away
from the outboard midplane. In this equilibrium, ion temperature gradient
instability is subdominant at all scales and kinetic ballooning modes are shown
to be suppressed by $\mathbf{ E} \times \mathbf{ B} $ shear. ETG modes are very
resilient to $\mathbf{ E} \times \mathbf{ B}$ shear. Heuristic quasilinear
arguments suggest that the novel toroidal ETG instability is important for

language understanding problems with a delimited set of target behaviors,
making it possible to develop models that can interpret natural utterances
without natural training data. We begin with a synthetic data generation
procedure, and train a model that can accurately interpret utterances produced
by the data generator. To generalize to natural utterances, we automatically
find projections of natural language utterances onto the support of the
synthetic language, using learned sentence embeddings to define a distance
metric. With only synthetic training data, our approach matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art models trained on natural language data in several domains.
These results suggest that simulation-to-real transfer is a practical framework
for developing NLP applications, and that improved models for transfer might
provide wide-ranging improvements in downstream tasks.

disc and dark matter halo we find a relationship between disc dominance, number
and strength of spiral arms, and the ensuing radial migration as a function of
the vertical action. We conclude that the importance of migration at large
vertical action depends on the strength of the spiral arms and therefore the
dominance of the disc. Populations with more radial action undergo less radial
migration, independently of disc dominance. Our results are important for the
future of analytical modelling of radial migration in galaxies and furthers the
understanding of radial migration which is a key component of the restructuring

current state-of-the-art robotic grasping detection systems are usually built

frame-based computer vision, neuromorphic vision is a small and young community
of research. Currently, there are limited event-based datasets due to the
troublesome annotation of the asynchronous event stream. Annotating large scale
vision dataset often takes lots of computation resources, especially the
troublesome data for video-level annotation. In this work, we consider the
problem of detecting robotic grasps in a moving camera view of a scene
containing objects. To obtain more agile robotic perception, a neuromorphic
vision sensor (DAVIS) attaching to the robot gripper is introduced to explore
the potential usage in grasping detection. We construct a robotic grasping
dataset named Event-Stream Dataset with 91 objects. A spatio-temporal mixed
particle filter (SMP Filter) is proposed to track the led-based grasp
rectangles which enables video-level annotation of a single grasp rectangle per
object. As leds blink at high frequency, the Event-Stream dataset is annotated
in a high frequency of 1 kHz. Based on the Event-Stream dataset, we develop a
deep neural network for grasping detection which consider the angle learning
problem as classification instead of regression. The method performs high
detection accuracy on our Event-Stream dataset with 93% precision at
object-wise level. This work provides a large-scale and well-annotated dataset,

learn its own reward function. Learning the reward function and optimising for
it are typically two different processes, usually performed at different
stages. We consider a continual (``one life'') learning approach where the
agent both learns the reward function and optimises for it at the same time. We
show that this comes with a number of pitfalls, such as deliberately
manipulating the learning process in one direction, refusing to learn,
``learning'' facts already known to the agent, and making decisions that are
strictly dominated (for all relevant reward functions). We formally introduce
two desirable properties: the first is `unriggability', which prevents the
agent from steering the learning process in the direction of a reward function
that is easier to optimise. The second is `uninfluenceability', whereby the
reward-function learning process operates by learning facts about the
environment. We show that an uninfluenceable process is automatically
unriggable, and if the set of possible environments is sufficiently rich, the
converse is true too.

preordered topological abelian groups, focusing on asymptotic and catalytic
versions of the order. In the asymptotic version, a measure $\mu$ dominates a
measure $\nu$ if the i.i.d.~random walk generated by $\mu$ first-order
dominates the one generated by $\nu$ at late times. In the catalytic version,
$\mu$ dominates $\nu$ if there is a third $\tau$ such that the convolution $\mu
\ast \tau$ first-order dominates $\nu \ast \tau$.
  Provided that the preorder on $G$ is induced by a suitably large positive
cone and that both measures are compactly supported Radon, our main result
gives a sufficient condition for asymptotic and catalytic dominance to hold in
terms of a family of inequalities closely related to the cumulant-generating
functions. While this sufficient condition requires these inequalities to be
strict, the non-strict versions of these inequalities are easily seen to be
necessary. In this sense, our result gives conditions that are necessary and
sufficient in generic cases. This result has been known for $G = \mathbb{R}$,
but is new already for $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n > 1$. It is a direct application
of a recently proven theorem of real algebra, namely a
\emph{Vergleichsstellensatz} for preordered semirings.
  We finally use our result to derive a formula for the rate at which the
probabilities of a random walk decay \emph{relative} to those of another, now
for walks on a preordered topological vector space with compactly supported
Radon steps. Taking one of these walks to be deterministic reproduces a version

heterogeneous graph is then constructed to capture not only the structures of
the table and the program, but also the connections between inputs with
different modalities. Such a graph reveals the related contexts of each word in

vision tasks, several new applications are nowadays more and more feasible.
Among them, a particular attention has been recently given to instance
segmentation, by exploiting the results achievable by two-stage networks (such
as Mask R-CNN or Faster R-CNN), derived from R-CNN. In these complex
architectures, a crucial role is played by the Region of Interest (RoI)
extraction layer, devoted to extracting a coherent subset of features from a
single Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) layer attached on top of a backbone.
  This paper is motivated by the need to overcome the limitations of existing
RoI extractors which select only one (the best) layer from FPN. Our intuition
is that all the layers of FPN retain useful information. Therefore, the
proposed layer (called Generic RoI Extractor - GRoIE) introduces non-local
building blocks and attention mechanisms to boost the performance.
  A comprehensive ablation study at component level is conducted to find the
best set of algorithms and parameters for the GRoIE layer. Moreover, GRoIE can
be integrated seamlessly with every two-stage architecture for both object
detection and instance segmentation tasks. Therefore, the improvements brought
about by the use of GRoIE in different state-of-the-art architectures are also
evaluated. The proposed layer leads up to gain a 1.1% AP improvement on
bounding box detection and 1.7% AP improvement on instance segmentation.

describe turbulent convection. For stars with convective envelopes, such as red
giants, this leads to an incomplete depiction of the surface layers. As a
result, the predicted stellar oscillation frequencies are haunted by systematic
errors, the so-called surface effect. Different empirically and theoretically
motivated correction relations have been proposed to deal with this issue. In
this paper, we compare the performance of these surface correction relations
for red giant branch stars. For this purpose, we apply the different surface
correction relations in asteroseismic analyses of eclipsing binaries and open
clusters. In accordance with previous studies of main-sequence stars, we find
that the use of different surface correction relations biases the derived
global stellar properties, including stellar age, mass, and distance estimates.
We furthermore demonstrate that the different relations lead to the same
systematic errors for two different open clusters. Our results overall
discourage from the use of surface correction relations that rely on reference
stars to calibrate free parameters. Due to the demonstrated systematic biasing
of the results, the use of appropriate surface correction relations is
imperative to any asteroseismic analysis of red giants. Accurate mass, age, and
distance estimates for red giants are fundamental when addressing questions
that deal with the chemo-dynamical evolution of the Milky Way galaxy. In this
way, our results also have implications for fields, such as galactic
archaeology, that draw on findings from stellar physics.

network architecture is proposed that interleaves inter-channel processing

apply a self-attention mechanism along the channel dimension to exploit the
information obtained with a varying number of microphones. The temporal
processing layers are based on a bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM)

information across time and space by stacking these two kinds of layers
alternately. Our network estimates time-frequency (TF) masks for each speaker,
which are then used to generate enhanced speech signals either with TF masking

matching anomalies and elliptic genera. We also show how to derive them by
iterative applications of some more fundamental dualities, in analogy with

the directed case only for the seemingly easier problem of replacement path
where both the source and the target nodes are fixed.
  Our new upper bound for this problem matches the existing conditional
combinatorial lower bounds. Hence, (assuming these conditional lower bounds)
our result is essentially optimal and completes the picture of the SSRP problem
in the combinatorial setting.
  Our algorithm extends to the case of small, rational edge weights. We
strengthen the existing conditional lower bounds in this case by showing that
any $O(mn^{1/2-\epsilon})$ time (combinatorial or algebraic) algorithm for some
fixed $\epsilon >0$ yields a truly subcubic algorithm for the weighted All

aiming to reconstruct high-resolution images from corresponding low-resolution

image super-resolution. However, as the deep networks go deeper, they become
more difficult to train and more difficult to restore the finer texture
details, especially under real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a
Residual Channel Attention-Generative Adversarial Network(RCA-GAN) to solve
these problems. Specifically, a novel residual channel attention block is
proposed to form RCA-GAN, which consists of a set of residual blocks with
shortcut connections, and a channel attention mechanism to model the
interdependence and interaction of the feature representations among different
channels. Besides, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is employed to
further produce realistic and highly detailed results. Benefiting from these
improvements, the proposed RCA-GAN yields consistently better visual quality
with more detailed and natural textures than baseline models; and achieves
comparable or better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods for
real-world image super-resolution.

are screened within a K-mouflage radius that helps avoiding traditional
constraints on charged dark matter models. We discuss the background cosmology
of these models in a Newtonian approach and show the equivalence with
relativistic Lema\^itre models where an inhomogeneous pressure due to the

shells of different radii evolve differently as they exit their K-mouflage
radii at different times, resulting in a breaking of the initial comoving
evolution. In the large time regime, the background cosmology is described by
comoving but inhomogeneous model with a reduced gravitational Newton constant
and a negative curvature originating from the electrostatic pressure. Baryons
do not directly feel the electrostatic interaction, but are influenced by the
inhomogeneous matter distribution induced by the electric force. We find that
shells of smaller radii evolve faster than the outer shells which feel the
repulsive interaction earlier. This mimics the discrepancy between the large
scale Hubble rate and the local one. Similarly, as galaxies and clusters are
not screened by the new interaction, large scale global flows would result from
the existence of the new dark electromagnetic interaction.

domain gap between real and synthetic data. We propose to adopt general-purpose
GAN models for pixel-level image translation, allowing to formulate the domain
gap itself as a learning problem. The obtained models are then used either
during training or inference to bridge the domain gap. Here, we focus on
training the single-stage YOLO6D object pose estimator on synthetic CAD
geometry only, where not even approximate surface information is available.
When employing paired GAN models, we use an edge-based intermediate domain and
introduce different mappings to represent the unknown surface properties. Our
evaluation shows a considerable improvement in model performance when compared
to a model trained with the same degree of domain randomization, while
requiring only very little additional effort.

limiting operator moves along the characteristic foliation induced on the
surface by the contact distribution. We show that for this stochastic process
elliptic characteristic points are inaccessible, while hyperbolic
characteristic points are accessible from the separatrices. We illustrate the
results with examples and we identify canonical surfaces in the Heisenberg
group, and in ${\rm SU}(2)$ and ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ equipped with the
standard sub-Riemannian contact structures as model cases for this setting. Our
techniques further allow us to derive an expression for an intrinsic Gaussian
curvature of a surface in a general three-dimensional contact sub-Riemannian
manifold.

exploits the interdependencies between the current and the preceding

according to the nonlinear Hertz model, whereas the tangential force is
calculated through an accurate nonlinear-spring model. Assuming a molecular
approach, we account for the long-range cohesive forces using a
Lennard-Jones(LJ)-like potential. The packing processes are studied assuming
different long-range interaction strengths. We carry out statistical

the planetary Lindblad torque which repels disc gas away from the planet's

present a simple, easy-to-use, analytic framework for calculating how gaps
deplete and how the disc's structure as a whole changes by the combined action
of Lindblad repulsion and planetary consumption. The final mass to which a
gap-embedded gas giant grows is derived in tandem. The analytics are tested
against 1D numerical experiments and calibrated using published

clearing a gap, initially accretes practically all of the gas that tries to
diffuse past, rapidly achieving super-Jupiter if not brown dwarf status. By
contrast, in inviscid discs---that may still accrete onto their central stars
by, say, magnetized winds---planets open deep, repulsion-dominated gaps. Then
only a small fraction of the disc accretion flow is diverted onto the planet,
which grows to a fraction of a Jupiter mass. Transitional disc cavities might
be cleared by families of such low-mass objects opening inviscid,

(${\lesssim}150$ pc), young (${\lesssim}500$ Myr) stars with high infrared
excesses ($L_{\mathrm{IR}} / L_\star > 10^{-5}$), including 38 with previously
resolved disks. Observations were made using the Gemini Planet Imager
high-contrast integral field spectrograph in $H$-band (1.6 $\mu$m)
coronagraphic polarimetry mode to measure both polarized and total intensities.
We resolved 26 debris disks and three protoplanetary/transitional disks. Seven
debris disks were resolved in scattered light for the first time, including
newly presented HD 117214 and HD 156623, and we quantified basic morphologies
of five of them using radiative transfer models. All of our detected debris
disks but HD 156623 have dust-poor inner holes, and their scattered-light radii
are generally larger than corresponding radii measured from resolved thermal
emission and those inferred from spectral energy distributions. To assess
sensitivity, we report contrasts and consider causes of non-detections.
Detections were strongly correlated with high IR excess and high inclination,
although polarimetry outperformed total intensity angular differential imaging
for detecting low inclination disks (${\lesssim} 70 \deg$). Based on
post-survey statistics, we improved upon our pre-survey target prioritization
metric predicting polarimetric disk detectability. We also examined
scattered-light disks in the contexts of gas, far-IR, and millimeter
detections. Comparing $H$-band and ALMA fluxes for two disks revealed tentative
evidence for differing grain properties. Finally, we found no preference for
debris disks to be detected in scattered light if wide-separation substellar
companions were present.

remains elusive, and one may ask if there is a thermodynamic quantity sensitive

$\hat{b}$-axis where ITO is prohibited by a $C_2$ symmetry. If the transition

The enhancement arises from the predominantly vortical hydrodynamic flow caused
by local deviations from charge neutrality. Its magnitude is inversely
proportional to the shear viscosity of the electron liquid and scales as the
square of the disorder correlation radius. This is qualitatively different from
the situation away from charge neutrality. In that case, the flow is
predominantly potential, and produces negative viscous contributions to the

use this method to study the inflated gas giant WASP-52b and place a

explore how to use spectra to discriminate between these two oxygen sources, we

have strong suppression of oxygen bands, and especially the 1.27$\mu$m band.
This suppression is due to additional strong, broad O$_2$-O$_2$
collisionally-induced absorption (CIA) generated in these more massive
O$_2$atmospheres, which is not present for the smaller amounts of oxygen
generated by photosynthesis. Consequently, any detection of the 1.27$\mu$m band

likely photosynthetic origin. However, the 0.69 $\mu$m O$_2$ band is relatively
unaffected by O$_2$-O$_2$ CIA, and the presence of an ocean-loss high-O$_2$

observe a universal response in the concentration parameter. We argue that
merger events are a major contributor to the uncertainty in halo concentration
at fixed halo mass and formation time. In fact, even haloes that are typically
classified as having quiescent formation histories experience multiple minor
mergers. These minor mergers drive small deviations from pseudo-evolution,
which cause fluctuations in the concentration parameters and result in
effectively irreducible scatter in the relation between concentration and
assembly history. Hence, caution should be taken when using present-day halo
concentration parameter as a proxy for the halo assembly history, especially if
the recent merger history is unknown.

retrieved a thermospheric temperature of $T=13200^{+800}_{-720}$ K and a mass
loss rate of $\dot{M}=10^{12.8\pm0.3}$ g s$^{-1}$ when the atmosphere was
assumed to be in hydrodynamical expansion and in local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE). Since the thermospheres of hot Jupiters are not expected to

for the population of the excited hydrogen. We do not find strong statistical
evidence in favor of a departure from LTE. However, our non-LTE scenario
suggests that a departure from the Boltzmann equilibrium may not be sufficient

non-LTE, Saha equilibrium departure via photo-ionization, is also likely to be
necessary to explain the data.

empirically and carefully measure the RV jitter of more than 600 stars from the

tracks stellar evolution and that in general, stars evolve through different
stages of RV jitter: the jitter in younger stars is driven by magnetic
activity, while the jitter in older stars is convectively-driven and dominated
by granulation and oscillations. We identify the ""jitter minimum"" -- where

strong anisotropy of the variational adiabatic gauge potential (AGP),
generating the adiabatic transformations, which allows us to define optimal
adiabatic paths. We find that these paths generally terminate at singular
points characterized by extensive degeneracies in the energy spectrum,
splitting the parameter space into adiabatically disconnected regions. The
anisotropy follows from singularities in the AGP, and we identify special

turbulent motions which are not isotropic but radially dominated. In contrast
to filaments without gravity, the velocity dispersion of self-gravitating
filaments does not settle in an equilibrium. Despite showing similar amounts of
driven turbulence, they continually dissipate their velocity dispersion until
the onset of core formation. This difference is connected to the evolution of
the radius as it determines the dissipation rate. In the non-gravitational case
filament growth is not limited and its radius grows linearly with time. In
contrast, there is a maximum extent in the self-gravitational case resulting in
an increased dissipation rate. Furthermore, accretion driven turbulence shows a
radial profile which is anti-correlated with density. This leads to a constant
turbulent pressure throughout the filament. As the additional turbulent
pressure does not have a radial gradient it does not contribute to the
stability of filaments and does not increase the critical line-mass. However,
this radial turbulence does affect the radius of a filament, adding to the
extent and setting its maximum value. Moreover, the radius evolution also
affects the growth timescale of cores which compared to the timescale of

ALMA reveals also the presence of [CII] emission arising from a circumgalactic

characterized by a disturbed morphology and complex kinematics. Similarly to
observations of shock-excited [CII] emitted from tidal tails in local groups,
our results can be interpreted as a possible signature of interstellar gas
stripped by strong gravitational interactions, with a possible contribution
from material ejected by galactic outflows and emission triggered by star
formation in small faint satellites. Our findings suggest that mergers could be
an efficient mechanism of gas mixing in the circumgalactic medium around high-z

oxygen-bearing, which we suggest are tracing a disk accretion shock. The
molecules C$^{34}$S, H$_2$CS and CH$_{3}$CCN trace a slow wide-angle wind or
dense structures in the outflow cavity walls. With the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA), we detect a compact continuum source ($<$2000 $\times$

galaxies in addition of an inventory of galaxy mass functions, MFs, for HI,
H$_2$, cold gas, and baryonic mass, separately into early- and late-type
galaxies. The MFs are determined using the HI and H$_2$ conditional
distributions and the galaxy stellar mass function, GSMF. For the conditional
distributions we use the compilation presented in Calette et al. 2018. For
determining the GSMF from $M_{\ast}\sim3\times10^{7}$ to $3\times10^{12}$
$M_{\odot}$, we combine two spectroscopic samples from the SDSS at the redshift
range $0.0033<z<0.2$. We find that the low-mass end slope of the GSMF, after
correcting from surface brightness incompleteness, is $\alpha\approx-1.4$,
consistent with previous determinations. The obtained HI MFs agree with radio
blind surveys. Similarly, the H$_2$ MFs are consistent with CO follow-up
optically-selected samples. We estimate the impact of systematics due to
mass-to-light ratios and find that our MFs are robust against systematic
errors. We deconvolve our MFs from random errors to obtain the intrinsic MFs.
Using the MFs, we calculate cosmic density parameters of all the baryonic
components. Baryons locked inside galaxies represent 5.4% of the universal
baryon content, while $\sim96$% of the HI and H$_2$ mass inside galaxies reside
in late-type morphologies. Our results imply cosmic depletion times of H$_2$
and total neutral H in late-type galaxies of $\sim 1.3$ and 7.2 Gyr,
respectively, which shows that late type galaxies are on average inefficient in
converting H$_2$ into stars and in transforming HI gas into H$_2$. Our results
provide a fully self-consistent empirical description of galaxy demographics in
terms of the bivariate gas--stellar mass distribution and their projections,
the MFs. This description is ideal to compare and/or to constrain galaxy
formation models.

alternative way to correct an adequate scientific Field of View (FoV) using
only natural guide stars (NGSs) to extremely large ground-based telescopes.
Thus, even in the absence of laser guide stars, a GMCAO-equipped ELT-like
telescope can achieve optimal performance in terms of Strehl Ratio (SR),
retrieving impressive results in studying star-poor fields, as in the cases of
the deep field observations. The benefits and usability of GMCAO have been
demonstrated by studying 6000 mock high redshift galaxies in the Chandra Deep
Field South region. However, a systematic study simulating observations in
several portions of the sky is mandatory to have a robust statistic of the
GMCAO performance. Technical, tomographic and astrophysical parameters,
discussed here, are given as inputs to GIUSTO, an IDL-based code that estimates
the SR over the considered field, and the results are analyzed with statistical
considerations. The best performance is obtained using stars that are
relatively close to the Scientific FoV; therefore, the SR correlates with the
mean off-axis position of NGSs, as expected, while their magnitude plays a
secondary role. This study concludes that the SRs correlate linearly with the
galactic latitude, as also expected. Because of the lack of natural guide stars
needed for low-order aberration sensing, the GMCAO confirms as a promising
technique to observe regions that can not be studied without the use of laser
beacons. It represents a robust alternative way or a risk mitigation strategy
for laser approaches on the ELTs.

since high-resolution imaging with ALMA came available. Amongst other effects,
self-scattering (i.e., scattering of thermal dust emission on other grains) is
thought to be the origin of millimetre polarisation. This opens the first
window to a direct measurement of dust grain sizes in regions of optically
thick continuum emission as it can be found in protoplanetary disks and
star-forming regions. However, the newly derived values of grain sizes are
usually around ${\sim}100\,\mu$m and thus one order of magnitude smaller than
those obtained from more indirect measurements as well as those expected from
theory (${\sim}1\,$mm). We see the origin of this contradiction in the applied
dust model of today's self-scattering simulations: a perfect compact sphere.
The aim of this study is to test our hypothesis by investigating the impact of
non-spherical grain shapes on the self-scattering signal. We apply discrete
dipole approximation simulations to investigate the influence of the grain
shape on self-scattering polarisation in three scenarios: an unpolarised and
polarised incoming wave under a fixed as well as a varying incident
polarisation angle. We find significant deviations of the resulting
self-scattering polarisation when comparing non-spherical to spherical grains,
in particular outside the Rayleigh regime, i.e. for >100$\,\mu$m size grains
observed at $870\,\mu$m wavelength. Self-scattering by oblate grains produces
higher polarisation degrees compared to spheres which challenges the
interpretation of the origin of observed millimetre polarisation. A (nearly)
perfect alignment of the non-spherical grains is required to account for the
observed millimetre polarisation in protoplanetary disks. Our findings point
towards a necessary re-evaluation of the dust grain sizes derived from (sub-)mm
polarisation.

and ""retired"" F stars -- which we refer to as ""MSRF"" stars -- that show low
levels of RV jitter ($<10$ m/s). We describe the observational signatures of
these stars that allow them to be identified in radial velocity planet
programs, for instance those performing follow-up of transiting planets
discovered by TESS. We introduce a ""jitter metric"" that combines the two
competing effects of RV jitter with age: activity and convection. Using
thresholds in the jitter metric, we can select both ""complete"" and ""pure""
samples of low jitter F stars. We also provide recipes for identifying these
stars using only Gaia colors and magnitudes. Finally, we describe a region in
the Gaia color-magnitude diagram where low jitter F stars are most highly
concentrated. By fitting a 9th order polynomial to the Gaia main sequence, we
use the height above the main sequence as a proxy for evolution, allowing for a
crude selection of low jitter MSRF stars when activity measurements are

well-studied with many applications and has sample and runtime complexity
$\Theta(n^d)$. Can one achieve better runtime if the intrinsic dimension of the

samples $(x,y)$ where $y$ is a degree at most $d$ polynomial in an unknown

both as a generalization of phase retrieval and as a special case of learning
multi-index models where the link function is an unknown low-degree polynomial.

learning.

two-loop QCD amplitudes for $b \bar{b} \rightarrow Z h$ with a CP-even and
CP-odd Higgs boson $h$. We derive the respective Ward identity for these

radio hotspots. We resolve multiple components in 3C 227 West and in 3C 105
South and characterize the diffuse NIR/optical emission of the latter. We show
that the linear size of this component ($\gtrsim$4 kpc) makes 3C 105 South a
compelling case for particles' re-acceleration in the post-shock region.
Modeling of the radio-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) of 3C 195
South and 3C 227 W1 gives clues on the origin of the detected X-ray emission.
In the context of inverse Compton models, the peculiarly steep synchrotron
curve of 3C 195 South sets constraints on the shape of the radiating particles'
spectrum that are testable with better knowledge of the SED shape at low
($\lesssim$GHz) radio frequencies and in X-rays. The X-ray emission of 3C 227
W1 can be explained with an additional synchrotron component originating in
compact ($<$100 pc) regions, such those revealed by radio observations at 22
GHz, provided that efficient particle acceleration ($\gamma\gtrsim$10$^7$) is
ongoing. The emerging picture is that of systems in which different
acceleration and radiative processes coexist.

Synchrotron emission in the optical on scales up to a few kpc was reported for
the four hotspots. Our VLA observations point out the presence of unresolved
regions with upper limit to their linear size of about 100 pc. This is the
first time that such compact components in hotspots have been detected in a
mini-sample, indicating that they are not a peculiar characteristic of a few
individual hotspots. The polarization may reach values up to 70 per cent in
compact (about 0.1 kpc scale) regions within the hotspot, indicating a highly
ordered magnetic field with size up to a hundred parsecs. On larger scales, the
average polarization of the hotspot component is about 30-45 per cent,
suggesting the presence of a significant random field component, rather than an
ordered magnetic field. This is further supported by the displacement between
the peaks in polarized intensity and in total intensity images that is observed
in all the four hotspots. The electric vector position angle is not constant,
but changes arbitrarily in the central part of the hotspot regions, whereas it
is usually perpendicular to the total intensity contours of the outermost edge
of the hotspot structure, likely marking the large-scale shock front. The
misalignment between X-ray and radio-to-optical emission suggests that the
former is tracing the current particle acceleration, whereas the latter marks
older shock fronts.

acquired amount of real-world driving data and built a comprehensive dataset,
which contains multiple ""driver-vehicle-road"" attributes. The proposed method
works in two steps. In the first step, a variable precision rough set (VPRS)
based classification technique is applied to draw a reduced core subset from
field driving dataset, which presents the essential attributes set most
relevant to driving safety assessment. In the second step, we design a decision
strategy by introducing mutual information entropy to quantify the significance

offline analysis of the driving data collected in field trials, where the aim
is to infer the emergency braking actions in next short term. The results
indicate that our proposed model is a good alternative for providing improved

parameters from radial velocity spectroscopy, not least in the search for Earth

mitigate stellar activity is to use combined analyses of both radial velocity
and time-series photometry. We present an analysis of simultaneous
disk-integrated photometry and radial velocity data of the Sun in order to
determine the useful limits of a combined analysis. We find that simple
periodogram or autocorrelation analysis of solar photometry give the correct
rotation period <50% of the time. We therefore use a Gaussian process to
investigate the time variability of solar photometry and to directly compare
simultaneous photometry with radial velocity data. We find that the
hyperparameter posteriors are relatively stable over 70 years of solar
photometry and the amplitude tracks the solar cycle. We observe good agreement
between the hyperparameter posteriors for the simultaneous photometry and
radial velocity data. Our primary conclusion is a recommendation to include an
additional prior in Gaussian process fits to constrain the evolutionary
timescale to be greater than the recurrence timescale (ie., the rotation
period) to recover more physically plausible and useful results. Our results
indicate that such simultaneous monitoring may be a useful tool in enhancing
the precision of radial velocity surveys.

change in the Casimir energy of this configuration is predicted to shift the

experiment we discuss consists of taking a superconducting film, carefully
measuring its transition temperature, bringing a conducting plate close to the
film, creating a Casimir cavity, and then measuring the transition temperature
again. The expected shifts will be small, comparable to the normal shifts one
sees in cycling superconducting films to cryogenic temperatures and so using a
NEMS resonator and doing this in situ is the only practical way to obtain
accurate, reproducible data. Using a thin Pb film and opposing Au surface, we

measure of physical irrealism and consider an initial contractive state in the
double-slit setup for which position and momentum variables of a single
particle are initially correlated. We investigate how the behavior of the
irrealism can help us to obtain information about the interference pattern,
wavelike, and particle-like properties in the double-slit setup with matter

irrealism, and around this point the state at the detection screen is squeezed

superposition. Interestingly, we show that the maximum visibility and the
number of interference fringes are related to the minimum of the irrealism.
Moreover, we demonstrate a monotonic relation between the irrealism and

treatment assignment, this leaves the study open to the introduction of
post-randomization biases. In the Strategies to Reduce Injuries and Develop
Confidence in Elders (STRIDE) trial, we were presented with the potential for
the unblinded clinicians administering the treatment, as well as the
individuals enrolled in the study, to introduce ascertainment bias into some
but not all events comprising the primary outcome. In this manuscript, we
present ways to estimate the ascertainment bias for a time-to-event outcome,
and discuss its impact on the overall power of a trial versus changing of the
outcome definition to a more stringent unbiased definition that restricts
attention to measurements less subject to potentially differential assessment.
We found that for the majority of situations, it is better to revise the
definition to a more stringent definition, as was done in STRIDE, even though
fewer events may be observed.

  post-lockdown COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives on India","21 pages, 8 figures, 1 table",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Several countries that have been successful in constraining the severity of
COVID-19 pandemic via ""lockdown"" are now considering to slowly end it, mainly
because of enormous socio-economic side-effects. An abrupt ending of lockdown
can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore,
carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post
upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of
COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age- and social
contact- structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and
Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with
fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet
and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase
in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth
of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown
phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools
for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical
intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed
SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear
conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country
specific mitigation of COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase.

useful relaxation of graphical models, but it is not clear what information
they contain (besides the obvious lack of linear association). We study
elliptical and transelliptical distributions as middle-ground between the
Gaussian and other families that are more flexible but either do not embed
strong properties or do not lead to simple interpretation. We characterize the
meaning of zero partial correlations in the elliptical family and
transelliptical copula models and show that it retains much of the dependence
structure from the Gaussian case. Regarding positive dependence, we prove
impossibility results to learn (trans)elliptical graphical models, including
that an elliptical distribution that is multivariate totally positive of order
two for all dimensions must be essentially Gaussian. We then show how to
interpret positive partial correlations as a relaxation, and obtain important
properties related to faithfulness and Simpson's paradox. We illustrate the
transelliptical model potential to study tail dependence in S&P500 data, and of
positivity to improve regularized inference.

secular behavior of the mass accretion and drag rates in the ""common-envelope""
scenario encountered when a black hole or a neutron star moves in the stellar
envelope of a red supergiant star, we have carried out the first general
relativistic simulations of the accretion flow onto a nonrotating black hole
moving supersonically in a medium with regular but different density gradients.
The simulations reveal that the supersonic motion always rapidly reaches a
stationary state and it produces a shock cone in the downstream part of the
flow. In the absence of density gradients we recover the phenomenology already
observed in the well-known Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton accretion problem, with
super-Eddington mass accretion rate and a shock cone whose axis is stably
aligned with the direction of motion. However, as the density gradient is made
stronger, the accretion rate also increases and the shock cone is progressively
and stably dragged toward the direction of motion. With sufficiently large
gradients, the shock-cone axis can become orthogonal to the direction, or even
move in the upstream region of the flow in the case of the largest density
gradient. Together with the phenomenological aspects of the accretion flow, we
have also quantified the rates of accretion of mass and momentum onto the black
hole. Simple analytic expressions have been found for the rates of accretion of
mass, momentum, drag force, and bremsstrahlung luminosity, all of which have
been employed in the astrophysical modelling of the secular evolution of a
binary system experiencing a common-envelope evolution...

consensus on the virus, its spread and containment, or on the long term social
and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently
circulating are ones suggesting that the 5G network activates the virus, that
the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a
bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it
as cover to launch a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to
dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent
events including the destruction of property, racially fueled attacks against
Asian Americans, and demonstrations espousing resistance to public health
orders countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl
social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated
machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks
supporting the generation of these stories. We show how the various narrative
frameworks fueling rumors and conspiracy theories rely on the alignment of
otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the
broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can
be monitored in near real-time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news
that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists.
Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative
frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be
helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.

easier to perform and less computationally expensive, object-based methods are
capable of producing more accurate results and account for deformable changes
in the objects within the slices. In this paper, performance of two well-known
object-based interpolation methods is analyzed and compared. Here, a deformable
registration-based method specifically designed for medical applications and a
learning-based method, trained for video frame interpolation, are considered.
While the deformable registration-based technique is capable of accurate
modeling of the changes in the shapes of the objects within slices, the
learning-based method is able to produce results with similar accuracy, but
with a much sharper appearance in a fraction of the time. This is despite the
fact that the learning-based approach is not trained on medical images and
rather is trained using regular video footage. However, experiments show that
the method is capable of accurate slice interpolation results.

by two parameters: an attachment function $f:\mathbb{N}_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$ and a
(possibly random) attachment sequence $\{m_i:i\geq 1\}$. Starting with a single
vertex, at each discrete step $i\geq 1$ a new vertex $v_i$ enters the system
with $m_i\geq 1$ edges which it sequentially connects to a pre-existing vertex
$v\in \mathcal{G}_{i-1}$ with probability proportional to
$f(\operatorname{degree}(v))$. We consider the problem of emergence of
persistent hubs: existence of a finite (a.s.) time $n^*$ such that for all
$n\geq n^*$ the identity of the maximal degree vertex (or in general the $K$
largest degree vertices for $K\geq 1$) does not change. We obtain general
conditions on $f$ and $\{m_i:i\geq 1\}$ under which a persistent hub emerges,
and also those under which a persistent hub fails to emerge. In the case of
lack of persistence, for the specific case of trees ($m_i\equiv 1$ for all

transformation between hidden layers that implicitly represents the conversion
between the true and noisy labels, and it can be readily optimized together
with other model parameters. Another is an explicit probability transition
matrix that captures the direct conversion between labels but needs to be
derived from an EM algorithm. We conduct experiments on the NYT dataset and

applied consideration of these data. The relative depth of two minima, height

agreement with the experimental data on the excitation energies, $B(E2)$ and

However, the excitation energy of the $2^+_2$ state can be reproduced only if

stars shows photometric rotational modulation, and understand its origin. One
of the underlying questions is the role of close binarity in this population,
standing upon the fact that RGs in short-period binary systems (<150 days or
so) have been observed to display strong rotational modulation. We select a
sample of about 4500 relatively bright RGs observed by Kepler, and show that
370 of them (8%) display rotational modulation. Almost all have oscillation
amplitudes below the median of the sample, while 30 of them are not oscillating
at all. Of the 85 of these RGs with rotational modulation chosen for follow-up
radial-velocity observation and analysis, 34 show clear evidence of
spectroscopic binarity. Surprisingly, 26 of the 30 non-oscillators are in this
group of binaries. To the contrary, about 85% of the active RGs with detectable
oscillations are not part of close binaries. With the help of stellar masses
and evolutionary states computed from the oscillation properties, it appears
that low-mass red-giant branch stars tend to be magnetically inactive, while
intermediate-mass ones tend to be highly active. The opposite trends are true
for helium-core burning (red clump) stars, whereby the lower-mass clump stars
are comparatively more active and the higher-mass ones less so. In other words,
we find that low-mass red-giant branch stars gain angular momentum as they
evolve to clump stars, while higher-mass ones lose angular momentum. The trend
observed with low-mass stars leads to possible scenarios of planet engulfment
or other merging events during the shell-burning phase. Regarding
intermediate-mass stars, the rotation periods are long with respect to
theoretical expectations reported in the literature, which reinforces the
existence of an unidentified sink of angular momentum after the main sequence.

traders to liquidate or establish big security positions in a fully automated
or low-touch manner. Most existing academic or industrial Algos focus on how to
""slice"" a big parent order into smaller child orders over a given time horizon.
Few models rigorously tackle the actual placement of these child orders.
Instead, placement is mostly done with a combination of empirical signals and
heuristic decision processes. A self-contained, realistic, and fully functional
Child Order Placement (COP) model may never exist due to all the inherent
complexities, e.g., fragmentation due to multiple venues, dynamics of limit
order books, lit vs. dark liquidity, different trading sessions and rules. In
this paper, we propose a reductionism COP model that focuses exclusively on the
interplay between placing passive limit orders and sniping using aggressive
takeout orders. The dynamic programming model assumes the form of a stochastic
linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and allows closed-form solutions under the
backward Bellman equations. Explored in detail are model assumptions and
general settings, the choice of state and control variables and the cost
functions, and the derivation of the closed-form solutions.

are hundreds to thousands of other lensed galaxies within the sky area spanned
by the gravitational-wave observation. However, we can constrain the lensing
galaxy's physical properties through both gravitational-wave and
electromagnetic observations. We show that these simultaneous constraints allow
one to localize quadruply lensed waves to one or at most a few galaxies with
the LIGO/Virgo/Kagra network in typical scenarios. Once we identify the host,
we can localize the binary to two sub-arcsec regions within the host galaxy.

our attention module is designed to be able to borrow clean signals from their

elementary gates required to create it from a basic initial state. The creation
complexity of quantum states is closely related to the complexity of quantum
circuits, which is crucial in developing efficient quantum algorithms that can
outperform classical algorithms. A major question unanswered so far is what
quantum states can be created with a number of elementary gates that scales
polynomially with the number of qubits. In this work we first show for an
entirely general quantum state it is exponentially hard (requires a number of
steps that scales exponentially with the number of qubits) to determine if the
creation complexity is polynomial. We then show it is possible for a large
class of quantum states with polynomial creation complexity to have common
coefficient features such that given any candidate quantum state we can design
an efficient coefficient sampling procedure to determine if it belongs to the
class or not with arbitrarily high success probability. Consequently partial

Gutierrez-Sotomayor singular flows $\varphi$, GS-flows, on singular surfaces
$M$. This theory generalizes the classical theory of Morse complexes of smooth
dynamical systems together with the corresponding cancellation theory for
non-degenerate singularities. This is accomplished by defining a GS-chain
complex for $(M,\varphi)$ and computing its spectral sequence $(E^r,d^r)$. As
$r$ increases, algebraic cancellations occur, causing modules in $E^r$ to
become trivial. The main theorems herein relate these algebraic cancellations
within the spectral sequence to a family $\{M_r,\varphi_r\}$ of GS-flows
$\varphi_r $ on singular surfaces $M_r$, all of which have the same homotopy
type as $M$. The surprising element in these results is that the dynamical
homotopical cancellation of GS-singularities of the flows $\varphi_r$ are in
consonance with the algebraic cancellation of the modules in $E^r$ of its
associated spectral sequence. Also, the convergence of the spectral sequence
corresponds to a GS-flow $\varphi_{\bar{r}}$ on $M_{\bar{r}}$, for some
$\bar{r}$, with the property that $\varphi_{\bar{r}}$ admits no further
dynamical homotopical cancellation of GS-singularities.

Information about stylistic differences can be obtained by comparing the
performances of different artists across common musical pieces. In this

systematic stylistic differences among artists that are consistent across audio
recordings of a common set of pieces, in terms of several musical features. Our
focus is on a comparison of ten different orchestras, based on data from audio
recordings of the nine Beethoven symphonies. As generative or fully parametric
models of raw audio data can be highly complex, and more complex than necessary
for our goal of identifying differences between orchestras, we propose to
reduce the data from a set of audio recordings down to pairwise distances
between orchestras, based on different musical characteristics of the
recordings, such as tempo, dynamics, and timbre. For each of these
characteristics, we obtain multiple pairwise distance matrices, one for each
movement of each symphony. We develop a hierarchical multidimensional scaling
(HMDS) model to identify and quantify systematic differences between orchestras
in terms of these three musical characteristics, and interpret the results in
the context of known qualitative information about the orchestras. This
methodology is able to recover several expected systematic similarities between
orchestras, as well as to identify some more novel results. For example, we
find that modern recordings exhibit a high degree of similarity to each other,
as compared to older recordings.

Indeed, an outstanding open problem from the classic book of Garey and Johnson
asks whether this problem is NP-hard even in the case of 3 machines and
unit-length jobs. In a recent breakthrough, Levey and Rothvoss gave a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, which runs in nearly quasi-polynomial
time, for the case when job have unit lengths. However, a substantially more
difficult case where jobs have arbitrary processing lengths has remained open.
  We make progress on this more general problem. We show that there exists a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm (with similar running time as that of
Levey and Rothvoss) for the non-migratory setting: when every job has to be
scheduled entirely on a single machine, but within a machine the job need not
be scheduled during consecutive time steps. Further, we also show that our
algorithmic framework generalizes to another classic scenario where, along with
the precedence constraints, the jobs also have communication delay constraints.
Both of these fundamental problems are highly relevant to the practice of
datacenter scheduling.

out by Thurston. Finally we take advantage of these results to incorporate in
the formalism a smooth and divergenceless vector field on the $3$-manifold. The
Bott-Taubes integrals obtained are used for constructing higher-order
asymptotic Vassiliev invariants extending the work of Komendarczyk and Voli\'c.

correlator tap outputs of the received signal to form a dictionary of
triangle-shaped functions and leverage sparse signal processing to choose a
decomposition of shifted matching triangles from said dictionary. The optimal
solution of this minimization problem discriminates the presence of a potential
spoofing attack peak by observing a decomposition of two different code-phase
values (authentic and spoofed) in a sparse vector output. We use a threshold to
mitigate false alarms. Furthermore, we present a variation of the minimization
problem by enhancing the dictionary to a higher-resolution of shifted
triangles. The proposed technique can be implemented as an advanced
fine-acquisition monitoring tool to aid in the tracking loops for spoofing
mitigation. In our experiments, we are able to distinguish authentic and
spoofer peaks from synthetic data simulations and from a real dataset, namely,
the Texas Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT). The proposed method achieves 0.3%

both quantum noise (system-bath interaction) and classical noise on a system's

classical noises are both present, their combined effect on a system's dynamics
is not necessarily a simple sum of the two individual effects. Thus previous
master equations for open systems and those for classical noise, even when
jointly used, may not capture the full physics. Our formalism can determine
whether there is interference between quantum and classical noises and will be
able to capture and describe such interference if there is any (in a
perturbative manner). We find that, interestingly, second-order interference
between quantum and classical noises vanishes identically. This work thus also
serves to justify simple additive treatments of quantum and classical noises,
especially in the weak coupling regime. For a Zeeman-splitted atom in a
stochastic magnetic field interacting with an optical cavity, we use the

tools that do not require heavy supervision and can continuously adapt. In this

Segmentation Auto-Encoder (SAE), leverages all available unlabeled scans and
merely requires a segmentation prior, which can be a single unpaired

results show that SAE can produce good quality segmentations, particularly when
the prior is good. We demonstrate that a Markov Random Field prior can yield
significantly better results than a spatially independent prior. Our code is

are contrasted for efficiency for large-scale problems with respect to the
sizes of the projected subspaces adopted for the solutions of the linear
systems. The presented results confirm earlier studies that the randomized
algorithms are to be preferred for the inversion of gravity data, and that it
is sufficient to use projected spaces of size approximately $m/8$, for data
sets of size $m$. In contrast, the Golub Kahan bidiagonalization leads to more
efficient implementations for the inversion of magnetic data sets, and it is
again sufficient to use projected spaces of size approximately $m/8$. Moreover,
it is sufficient to use projected spaces of size $m/20$ when $m$ is large, $m

of chondrite that best represents Earth is a key to resolving the state of the
early Earth. The origin of chondrites, however, remains controversial partly
because of their puzzling major element compositions, some exhibiting depletion
in Al, Ca, and Mg. Based on a new thermochemical evolution model of
protoplanetary disks, we show that planetesimals with depletion patterns
similar to ordinary and enstatite chondrites can originate at 1-2 AU just
outside where enstatite evaporates. Around the ""evaporation front"" of
enstatite, the large inward flow of refractory minerals, including forsterite,
takes place with a high pebble concentration, and the loss of those minerals
result in depletion in Al, Ca, and Mg. When evaporated solid grains re-condense
onto pebbles, the concentration of pebbles is further enhanced, potentially
triggering the streaming instability. Planetesimals with the composition of
ordinary and enstatite chondrites can thus be naturally created in the
terrestrial region. The preferential loss of forsterite also creates an
enhancement of Mg/Si and heavy Si isotopes just inside the potential source
region for ordinary and enstatite chondrites. Earth, which shows both features,
may originate just inside where ordinary and enstatite chondrites were born.

achieved impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, their
accuracy comes at the cost of intelligibility: it is usually unclear how they
make their decisions. This hinders their applicability to high stakes
decision-making domains such as healthcare. We propose Neural Additive Models
(NAMs) which combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent
intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination
of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks
are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between
their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and
classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used
intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees.
They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models
in accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets
instead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for
multitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to
their composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows
them to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.

the difference between our result and the value inferred from Planck CMB is
$1.6\sigma$. In order to test the reliability of the ANN method, and the

to the $1.4 \mu$m H$_2$O absorption feature and an adjacent line-free continuum
region. Out of $4,504$ detected sources, $3,352$ (about $75\%$) appear fainter

the hydrogen-burning limit mass (M$\simeq 0.072 M_\odot$) at $\sim 1$ Myr. Of
these, however, only $742$ sources have a negative F130M-139N color index,
indicative of the presence of H$_2$O vapor in absorption, and can therefore be

water absorption present in the atmosphere of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and

which lack water absorption. Thanks to these data we infer the Initial Mass
Function (IMF) of the ONC in the $0.005 - 1.4$M$_{\odot}$ regime, i.e. down to
few Jupiter masses. The young age of the ONC, $\sim1$ Myr, provides a snapshot
of the outcome of star formation for the present-day conditions (metallicity,
temperature, pressure) of typical Milky Way disk molecular clouds. We
demonstrate that the IMF of the ONC is well described by either a log-normal
function or a broken power-law, with parameter values qualitatively in
agreement with the canonical Chabrier or Kroupa forms for the Milky Way disk
IMF. This continuity in the mass distribution provides clues to the fact that
the same physical processes may be regulating formation of stars, brown dwarfs,
and planetary mass objects. Both the canonical IMF forms under-predict the
observed number of very low mass members (below $0.1$ M$_\odot$), a regime
where our data allows more precise constraints. Nevertheless, we do not observe
a rise or secondary peak in the brown dwarfs or planetary mass regimes. Our

Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) takes PIR further by
additionally offering database privacy, where the user cannot learn any

multiple databases are known classically, but are unrealistic because they
require long shared secret keys between the parties for secure communication

both the secure communication and shared randomness requirements. We prove that
QKD maintains the security of the SPIR protocol and that it is also secure
against any external eavesdropper. We also show how such a classical-quantum

Through key rate calculations, we show that such an implementation is feasible

(KLIP) algorithm, we have reprocessed images taken with the IR channel of the
Wide Field Camera 3 mounted on the Hubble Space Telescope to unveil faint close
companions in the wings of the stellar PSFs. Starting with a sample of $1392$
bona-fide not saturated cluster members, we detect $39$ close-pairs cluster
candidates with separation $0.16''-0.77''$. The primary masses span a range
M$_p$ $\sim 0.015-1.27$ M$_{\odot}$ whereas for the companions we derive M$_c$
$\sim 0.004-0.54$ M$_{\odot}$. Of these $39$ binary systems, $18$ were already
known while the remaining $21$ are new detections. Correcting for completeness
and combining our catalog with previously detected ONC binaries, we obtain an
overall binary fraction of $11.5\% \pm 0.9\%$. Compared to other star forming
regions, our multiplicity function is $\sim 2$ smaller than e.g. Taurus, while
compared to the binaries in the field we obtain comparable values. We analyze
the mass function of the binaries, finding differences between the mass
distribution of binaries and single stars and between primary and companion
mass distributions. The mass ratio shows a bottom-heavy distribution with
median value of $M_c/M_p \sim 0.25$. Overall our results suggest that ONC
binaries may represent a template for the typical population of field binaries,
supporting the hypothesis that the ONC may be regarded as a most typical star
forming region in the Milky Way.

robustness with respect to model mismatch; (ii) high scalability. To this end,

Multi-Task Learning (MTL) encourages knowledge sharing across multiple related
tasks so as to improve the overall performance. In MTL, a major challenge
springs from the phenomenon that sharing the knowledge with dissimilar and hard
tasks, known as negative transfer, often results in a worsened performance.
Though a substantial amount of studies have been carried out against the
negative transfer, most of the existing methods only model the transfer
relationship as task correlations, with the transfer across features and tasks
left unconsidered. Different from the existing methods, our goal is to
alleviate negative transfer collaboratively across features and tasks. To this

Collaborative Learning (TFCL). Specifically, we first propose a base model with
a heterogeneous block-diagonal structure regularizer to leverage the
collaborative grouping of features and tasks and suppressing inter-group
knowledge sharing. We then propose an optimization method for the model.
Extensive theoretical analysis shows that our proposed method has the following
benefits: (a) it enjoys the global convergence property and (b) it provides a
block-diagonal structure recovery guarantee. As a practical extension, we
extend the base model by allowing overlapping features and differentiating the
hard tasks. We further apply it to the personalized attribute prediction
problem with fine-grained modeling of user behaviors. Finally, experimental

due to the low-Q nature of multipolar modes in wavelength-scale resonators,
there is a nonlinear interaction between these modes. As a result, the OPO
threshold, compared to the single-mode case, can be reduced by a factor that is
significantly larger than the number of interacting modes. The multi-mode
interaction can also lead to a phase transition manifested through a sudden
change in the parametric gain as well as the oscillation threshold, which can
be utilized for enhanced sensing. We establish an explicit connection between
the second-harmonic generation efficiency and the OPO threshold. This allows us
to estimate the OPO threshold based on measured or simulated second-harmonic
generation in different classes of resonators, such as bound states in the
continuum and inversely designed resonators. Our approach for analyzing and
modeling miniaturized OPOs can open unprecedented opportunities for classical
and quantum nonlinear photonics.

may be bottom-heavy, and which are subjected to a linear shear flow, is
modelled computationally by two different methods: Stokesian dynamics, and a
lubrication-theory-based method. Inertia is negligible. The aim is to compute
the effective shear viscosity and, where possible, the normal stress
differences as functions of the areal fraction of spheres $\phi$, the squirming
parameter $\beta$ (proportional to the ratio of a squirmer's active stresslet
to its swimming speed), the ratio $Sq$ of swimming speed to a typical speed of
the shear flow, the bottom-heaviness parameter $G_{bh}$, the angle $\alpha$
that the shear flow makes with the horizontal, and two parameters that define
the repulsive force that is required computationally to prevent the squirmers
from overlapping when their distance apart is less than a critical value
$\epsilon a$, where $\epsilon$ is very small and $a$ is the sphere radius. The
Stokesian dynamics method allows the rheological quantities to be computed for
values of $\phi$ up to $0.75$; the lubrication-theory method can be used for
$\phi> 0.5$. A major finding of this work is that, despite very different
assumptions, the two methods of computation give overlapping results for
viscosity as a function of $\phi$ in the range $0.5 < \phi < 0.75$. This
suggests that lubrication theory, based on near-field interactions alone,
contains most of the relevant physics, and that taking account of interactions
with more distant particles than the nearest is not essential to describe the
dominant physics.

Bhojpuri, Magahi, and Maithili, languages of the Purvanchal region of India (in

Indo-Aryan (or Indic) family. They are closely related to Hindi, which is a
relatively high-resource language, which is why we compare with Hindi. We
collected corpora for these three languages from various sources and cleaned
them to the extent possible, without changing the data in them. The text
belongs to different domains and genres. We calculated some basic statistical
measures for these corpora at character, word, syllable, and morpheme levels.
These corpora were also annotated with parts-of-speech (POS) and chunk tags.
The basic statistical measures were both absolute and relative and were
exptected to indicate of linguistic properties such as morphological, lexical,
phonological, and syntactic complexities (or richness). The results were
compared with a standard Hindi corpus. For most of the measures, we tried to
the corpus size the same across the languages to avoid the effect of corpus

even if sizes were very different. Although the results are not very clear, we
try to draw some conclusions about the languages and the corpora. For POS
tagging and chunking, the BIS tagset was used to manually annotate the data.

investigate the gas dynamics and NH$_2$D chemistry in eight massive
pre/protocluster clumps. We present NH$_2$D 1$_{11}$-1$_{01}$ (at 85.926 GHz),
NH$_3$ (1, 1) and (2, 2) observations in the eight clumps using the PdBI and
the VLA, respectively. We find that the distribution between deuterium
fractionation and kinetic temperature shows a number density peak at around
$T_{\rm kin}=16.1$ K, and the NH$_2$D cores are mainly located at a temperature
range of 13.0 to 22.0 K. We detect seven instances of extremely high deuterium
fractionation of $1.0 \leqslant D_{\rm frac} \leqslant 1.41$. We find that the
NH$_2$D emission does not appear to coincide exactly with either dust continuum
or NH$_3$ peak positions, but often surrounds the star-formation active
regions. This suggests that the NH$_{2}$D has been destroyed by the central
young stellar object (YSO) due to its heating. The detected NH$_2$D lines are
very narrow with a median width of $\rm 0.98\pm0.02 km/s$. The extracted
NH$_2$D cores are gravitationally bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} < 1$), are likely
prestellar or starless, and can potentially form intermediate-mass or high-mass

dynamical movement, which can be explained by a combined process with outflow,
rotation, convergent flow, collision, large velocity gradient, and rotating
toroids. High deuterium fractionation strongly depends on the temperature
condition. NH$_2$D is a poor evolutionary indicator of high-mass star formation
in evolved stages, but a useful tracer in the starless and prestellar cores.

equations usually results in a linear system with a dense and ill-conditioned

preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method where the preconditioner $M$ is
constructed by approximating the variable coefficients with a ($T$+1)-term
Legendre series in each direction to a desired accuracy. A feature of the
proposed PCG method is that the iteration step increases slightly with the size
of the resulting matrix when reaching a certain approximation accuracy. The
efficiency of the method lies in that the system with the preconditioner $M$ is
approximately solved by a one-step iterative method based on the ILU(0)
factorization. The ILU(0) factorization of $M\in
\mathbb{R}^{(N-1)^d\times(N-1)^d}$ can be computed using $\mathcal{O}(T^{2d}

$\mathcal{O}(T^{d} N^d)$, $d=1,2,3$. To further speed up the PCG method, an
algorithm is developed for fast matrix-vector multiplications by the resulting
matrix of Legendre-Galerkin spectral discretization, without the need to
explicitly form it. The complexity of the fast matrix-vector multiplications is
of $\mathcal{O}(N^d (\log N)^2)$. As a result, the PCG method has a

imbalance of covariates between treatment groups. Weighting strategies such as
inverse propensity score weighting attempt to mitigate bias by either modeling
the treatment assignment mechanism or balancing specified covariate moments.
This paper introduces a new weighting method, called energy balancing, which
instead aims to balance weighted covariate distributions. By directly targeting
distributional imbalance, the proposed weighting strategy can be flexibly
utilized in a wide variety of causal analyses, including the estimation of
average treatment effects and individualized treatment rules. Our energy
balancing weights (EBW) approach has several advantages over existing weighting
techniques. First, it offers a model-free and robust approach for obtaining
covariate balance that does not require tuning parameters, obviating the need
for modeling decisions of secondary nature to the scientific question at hand.
Second, since this approach is based on a genuine measure of distributional
balance, it provides a means for assessing the balance induced by a given set
of weights for a given dataset. Finally, the proposed method is computationally
efficient and has desirable theoretical guarantees under mild conditions. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this EBW approach in a suite of simulation
experiments, and in studies on the safety of right heart catheterization and
the effect of indwelling arterial catheters.

different time points to track the changes in their pattern over time. In such
studies, scheduling of the data collection waves (i.e. time of participants'
visits) is often pre-determined to accommodate ease of project management and
compliance. Hence, it is common to schedule those visits at equally spaced time
intervals. However, recent publications based on simulated experiments indicate
that the power of studies and the precision of model parameter estimators is
related to the participants' visiting schemes.
  In this paper, we consider the longitudinal studies that investigate the
changing pattern of a disease outcome, (e.g. the accelerated cognitive decline
of senior adults). Such studies are often analyzed by the broken-stick model,
consisting of two segments of linear models connected at an unknown
change-point. We formulate this design problem into a high-dimensional
optimization problem and derive its analytical solution. Based on this
solution, we propose an optimal design of the visiting scheme that maximizes
the power (i.e. reduce the variance of estimators) to identify the onset of
accelerated decline. Using both simulation studies and evidence from real data,
we demonstrate our optimal design outperforms the standard equally-spaced
design.
  Applying our novel design to plan the longitudinal studies, researchers can
improve the power of detecting pattern change without collecting extra data.

linear dependency criterion is identified, which allows the best linear
unbiased estimator of the primary variable in a bivariate collocated cokriging
setup to reduce to a univariate kriging estimator. Exact optimal designs for
efficient prediction for such simple and ordinary reduced cokriging models with
one-dimensional inputs are determined. Designs are found by minimizing the
maximum and the integrated prediction variance, where the primary variable is
an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. For simple and ordinary cokriging models with
known covariance parameters, the equispaced design is shown to be optimal for
both criterion functions. The more realistic scenario of unknown covariance
parameters is addressed by assuming prior distributions on the parameter

is motivated by designing an optimal water monitoring system for an Indian
river.

specifically, it is shown that the discrete solutions satisfy a free-energy
dissipation relation analogous to the continuous model. Consequently, the
numerical solutions converge in the large time limit to stationary solutions,
for which we provide a thermodynamic characterization. Numerical experiments
complement the study.

extremely difficult due to the sign problem. Recently there has been major
progress in solving this problem based on the idea of complexifying dynamical
variables. Here we consider the complex Langevin method (CLM), which is a
promising approach for its low computational cost. The drawback of this method,
however, is the existence of a condition that has to be met in order for the
results to be correct. As a first step, we apply the method to 2D U(1) gauge
theory on a torus with a $\theta$ term, which can be solved analytically. We
find that a naive implementation of the method fails because of the topological
nature of the $\theta$ term. In order to circumvent this problem, we simulate
the same theory on a punctured torus, which is equivalent to the original model
in the infinite volume limit for $ |\theta| < \pi$. Rather surprisingly, we
find that the CLM works and reproduces the exact results for a punctured torus
even at large $\theta$, where the link variables near the puncture become very
far from being unitary.

architectures using large-scale training corpora. However, in the news domain,
neural models easily overfit by leveraging position-related features due to the
prevalence of the inverted pyramid writing style. In addition, there is an
unmet need to generate a variety of summaries for different users. In this
paper, we propose a neural framework that can flexibly control summary
generation by introducing a set of sub-aspect functions (i.e. importance,
diversity, position). These sub-aspect functions are regulated by a set of
control codes to decide which sub-aspect to focus on during summary generation.
We demonstrate that extracted summaries with minimal position bias is
comparable with those generated by standard models that take advantage of
position preference. We also show that news summaries generated with a focus on
diversity can be more preferred by human raters. These results suggest that a
more flexible neural summarization framework providing more control options
could be desirable in tailoring to different user preferences, which is useful
since it is often impractical to articulate such preferences for different
applications a priori.

  Using a Sliding Mesh Approach",,,"10.1002/fld.4919",,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For most finite element simulations, boundary-conforming meshes have
significant advantages in terms of accuracy or efficiency. This is particularly
true for complex domains. However, with increased complexity of the domain,
generating a boundary-conforming mesh becomes more difficult and time
consuming. One might therefore decide to resort to an approach where individual
boundary-conforming meshes are pieced together in a modular fashion to form a
larger domain. This paper presents a stabilized finite element formulation for
fluid and temperature equations on sliding meshes. It couples the solution
fields of multiple subdomains whose boundaries slide along each other on common
interfaces. Thus, the method allows to use highly tuned boundary-conforming
meshes for each subdomain that are only coupled at the overlapping boundary
interfaces. In contrast to standard overlapping or fictitious domain methods
the coupling is broken down to few interfaces with reduced geometric dimension.
The formulation consists of the following key ingredients: the coupling of the
solution fields on the overlapping surfaces is imposed weakly using a
stabilized version of Nitsche's method. It ensures mass and energy conservation
at the common interfaces. Additionally, we allow to impose weak Dirichlet
boundary conditions at the non-overlapping parts of the interfaces. We present
a detailed numerical study for the resulting stabilized formulation. It shows
optimal convergence behavior for both Newtonian and generalized Newtonian
material models. Simulations of flow of plastic melt inside single-screw as
well as twin-screw extruders demonstrate the applicability of the method to
complex and relevant industrial applications.

paper, we report a new mechanism for stable trapping of metallic microparticles
by using a tightly focused linearly polarized Gaussian spot. We theoretically
and experimentally demonstrated that metallic microparticles were confined off
the optical axis by such a trap. In the meanwhile, transverse spinning motion
occurred as a consequence of the asymmetric force field acting on the particle
by the trap. The off-axis trapping and transverse spinning of metallic
microparticles provide new manners for the manipulation of metallic
microparticles. The works reported in this paper are also of significance for a
better understanding of the mechanical interaction between light and metallic

contribution to the energy balance in the chromosphere is not yet fully
understood. We perform three-dimensional (3D) radiation-magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of a unipolar solar plage region at a spatial resolution of
10 km using the MURaM code. We use the swirling-strength criterion that mainly
detects the smallest vortices present in the simulation data. We additionally
degrade our simulation data to smooth-out the smaller vortices, so that also
the vortices at larger spatial scales can be detected. Vortex flows at various
spatial scales are found in our simulation data for different effective spatial
resolutions. We conclude that the observed large vortices are likely clusters
of much smaller ones that are not yet resolved by observations. We show that
the vertical Poynting flux decreases rapidly with reduced effective spatial
resolutions and is predominantly carried by the horizontal plasma motions
rather than vertical flows. Since the small-scale horizontal motions or the
smaller vortices carry most of the energy, the energy transported by vortices
deduced from low resolution data is grossly underestimated. In full resolution
simulation data, the Poynting flux contribution due to vortices is more than
adequate to compensate for the radiative losses in plage, indicating their
importance for chromospheric heating.

distributed signal processing has proven to be effective in processing its

distributed signal processing techniques is the issue of privacy in handling
sensitive data. To address this privacy issue, we propose a novel yet general
subspace perturbation method for privacy-preserving distributed optimization,
which allows each node to obtain the desired solution while protecting its
private data. In particular, we show that the dual variables introduced in each
distributed optimizer will not converge in a certain subspace determined by the
graph topology. Additionally, the optimization variable is ensured to converge
to the desired solution, because it is orthogonal to this non-convergent
subspace. We therefore propose to insert noise in the non-convergent subspace
through the dual variable such that the private data are protected, and the
accuracy of the desired solution is completely unaffected. Moreover, the
proposed method is shown to be secure under two widely-used adversary models:
passive and eavesdropping. Furthermore, we consider several distributed
optimizers such as ADMM and PDMM to demonstrate the general applicability of
the proposed method. Finally, we test the performance through a set of
applications. Numerical tests indicate that the proposed method is superior to
existing methods in terms of several parameters like estimated accuracy,
privacy level, communication cost and convergence rate.

  Methods: A dataset partition consisting of 3D knee MRI from 88 subjects at
two timepoints with ground-truth articular (femoral, tibial, patellar)
cartilage and meniscus segmentations was standardized. Challenge submissions
and a majority-vote ensemble were evaluated using Dice score, average symmetric
surface distance, volumetric overlap error, and coefficient of variation on a
hold-out test set. Similarities in network segmentations were evaluated using
pairwise Dice correlations. Articular cartilage thickness was computed per-scan
and longitudinally. Correlation between thickness error and segmentation
metrics was measured using Pearson's coefficient. Two empirical upper bounds
for ensemble performance were computed using combinations of model outputs that
consolidated true positives and true negatives.
  Results: Six teams (T1-T6) submitted entries for the challenge. No
significant differences were observed across all segmentation metrics for all
tissues (p=1.0) among the four top-performing networks (T2, T3, T4, T6). Dice
correlations between network pairs were high (>0.85). Per-scan thickness errors
were negligible among T1-T4 (p=0.99) and longitudinal changes showed minimal
bias (<0.03mm). Low correlations (<0.41) were observed between segmentation
metrics and thickness error. The majority-vote ensemble was comparable to top
performing networks (p=1.0). Empirical upper bound performances were similar
for both combinations (p=1.0).
  Conclusion: Diverse networks learned to segment the knee similarly where high
segmentation accuracy did not correlate to cartilage thickness accuracy. Voting
ensembles did not outperform individual networks but may help regularize
individual models.

the behaviour of the devices with an infidelity of $10^{-3}$. Our results show
this characterisation technique leads to superior quantum control and extension
of coherence time by effective decoupling from the non-Markovian environment.
This framework, validated by our results, is applicable to any controlled

(XCSGE as we term it), is used to predict the power generation on both wind-

of cyclists in the context of driver assistance systems. Both domains have
different requirements, are non-trivial problems, and are used to evaluate
various facets of the novel XCSGE. The two problems differ fundamentally in the
size of the data sets and the number of features. Power forecasting is based on
weather forecasts that are subject to fluctuations in their features. In the
movement primitive forecasting of cyclists, time delays contribute to the
difficulty of the prediction. The XCSGE reaches an improvement of the
prediction performance of up to 11% for wind power forecasting and 30% for
solar power forecasting compared to the worst performing model. For the
classification of movement primitives of cyclists, the XCSGE reaches an
improvement of up to 28%. The evaluation includes a comparison with other

irregular space-time samples, we show that uniform dynamical samples at
sub-Nyquist spatial rate allow one to stably reconstruct the function $\widehat
f$ away from certain, explicitly described blind spots. We also consider
several classes of finite dimensional subsets of bandlimited functions in which
the stable reconstruction is possible, even inside the blind spots. We obtain
quantitative estimates for it using Remez-Tur\'an type inequalities. En route,
we obtain a Remez-Tur\'an inequality for prolate spheroidal wave functions. To
illustrate our results, we present some numerics and explicit estimates for the
heat flow problem.

websites, emails, or other forms of digital communication, Blockchains and
distributed ledger technology are unable to establish secure bindings between
websites and corresponding Smart Contracts. For a user, it is impossible to
differentiate whether a website links to a legitimate Smart Contract set up by
owners of a business or to an illicit contract aiming to steal users' funds.
Surprisingly, current attempts to solve this issue mostly comprise of
information redundancy, e.g., displaying contract addresses multiple times in
varying forms of images and texts. These processes are burdensome, as the user
is responsible for verifying the correctness of an address. More importantly,
they do not address the core issue, as the contract itself does not contain
information about its authenticity. To solve current issues for these
applications and increase security, we propose a solution that facilitates
publicly issued SSL/TLS-certificates of Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) to
ensure the authenticity of Smart Contracts and their owners. Our approach
combines on-chain identity assertion utilizing signatures from the respective
certificate and off-chain authentication of the Smart Contract stored on the
Blockchain. This approach allows to tackle the aforementioned issue and further
enables applications such as the identification of consortia members in
permissioned networks. The system is open and transparent, as the only
requirement for usage is ownership of an SSL/TLS-certificate. To enable
privacy-preserving authenticated Smart Contracts, we allow one-way and two-way
binding between website and contract. Further, low creation and maintenance
costs, a widely accepted public key infrastructure and user empowerment will
drive potential adaption of Ethereum Authenticated Smart Contracts (AuthSC).

  Problems","8 pages;2 tables;5 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-task learning (mtl) provides state-of-the-art results in many
applications of computer vision and natural language processing. In contrast to
single-task learning (stl), mtl allows for leveraging knowledge between related
tasks improving prediction results on the main task (in contrast to an
auxiliary task) or all tasks. However, there is a limited number of comparative
studies on applying mtl architectures for regression and time series problems
taking recent advances of mtl into account. An interesting, non-linear problem
is the forecast of the expected power generation for renewable power plants.
Therefore, this article provides a comparative study of the following recent
and important mtl architectures: Hard parameter sharing, cross-stitch network,
sluice network (sn). They are compared to a multi-layer perceptron model of
similar size in an stl setting. Additionally, we provide a simple, yet
effective approach to model task specific information through an embedding
layer in an multi-layer perceptron, referred to as task embedding. Further, we
introduce a new mtl architecture named emerging relation network (ern), which
can be considered as an extension of the sluice network. For a solar power
dataset, the task embedding achieves the best mean improvement with 14.9%. The
mean improvement of the ern and the sn on the solar dataset is of similar
magnitude with 14.7% and 14.8%. On a wind power dataset, only the ern achieves
a significant improvement of up to 7.7%. Results suggest that the ern is
beneficial when tasks are only loosely related and the prediction problem is
more non-linear. Contrary, the proposed task embedding is advantageous when
tasks are strongly correlated. Further, the task embedding provides an
effective approach with reduced computational effort compared to other mtl
architectures.

pressures in the mantles of these planets, melting in deep mantle layers can be
suppressed, even if the energy releae due to tidal heating and radioactive
decay is substantial. Here we investigate whether a newly identified heating
mechanism, namely induction heating by the star's magnetic field, can drive
volcanic activity on these planets due to its unique heating pattern in the
very upper part of the mantle. In this region the pressure is not yet high
enough to preclude the melt formation. Methods. Using the super-Earth HD 3167b
as an example, we calculate induction heating in the planet's interiors
assuming an electrical conductivity profile typical of a hot rocky planet and a
moderate stellar magnetic field typical of an old inactive star. Then we use a
mantle convection code (CHIC) to simulate the evolution of volcanic outgassing
with time. Results. We show that although in most cases volcanic outgassing on
HD 3167b is not very significant in the absence of induction heating, including
this heating mechanism changes the picture and leads to a substantial increase
in the outgassing from the planet's mantle. This result shows that induction
heating combined with a high surface temperature is capable of driving
volcanism on massive super-Earths, which has important observational
implications.

extract common differentiation features to improve the generalization. However,
due to large distribution discrepancies among fake faces of different domains,
it is difficult to seek a compact and generalized feature space for the fake
faces. In this work, we propose an end-to-end single-side domain generalization
framework (SSDG) to improve the generalization ability of face anti-spoofing.
The main idea is to learn a generalized feature space, where the feature
distribution of the real faces is compact while that of the fake ones is
dispersed among domains but compact within each domain. Specifically, a feature
generator is trained to make only the real faces from different domains
undistinguishable, but not for the fake ones, thus forming a single-side
adversarial learning. Moreover, an asymmetric triplet loss is designed to
constrain the fake faces of different domains separated while the real ones
aggregated. The above two points are integrated into a unified framework in an
end-to-end training manner, resulting in a more generalized class boundary,
especially good for samples from novel domains. Feature and weight
normalization is incorporated to further improve the generalization ability.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach is effective and
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four public databases.

to temperature primarily through the effect of temperature on runoff and to
pCO$_2$ through an effect on solute concentration mediated by pH. This
increases sensitivity to land fraction, CO$_2$ outgassing, and geological
factors such as soil age and lithology, all of which are found to have a
profound effect on the position of the effective outer edge of the HZ. The
interplay between runoff sensitivity and the energetic limit on precipitation

of two Boolean matrices (MW for short) has a number of important applications,
in particular the all-pairs lowest common ancestor (LCA) problem in directed
acyclic graphs (dags). The best known upper time-bound on the MW problem for
n\times n Boolean matrices of the form O(n^{2.575}) has not been substantially
improved since 2006. In order to obtain faster algorithms for this problem, we
study quantum algorithms for MW and approximation algorithms for MW (in the
standard computational model). Some of our quantum algorithms are input or
output sensitive. Our fastest quantum algorithm for the MW problem, and
consequently for the related problems, runs in time
\tilde{O}(n^{2+\lambda/2})=\tilde{O}(n^{2.434}), where \lambda satisfies the
equation \omega(1, \lambda, 1) = 1 + 1.5 \, \lambda and \omega(1, \lambda, 1)

n^{\lambda} \times n matrix. Next, we consider a relaxed version of the MW
problem (in the standard model) asking for reporting a witness of bounded rank
(the maximum witness has rank 1) for each non-zero entry of the matrix product.
First, by adapting the fastest known algorithm for maximum witnesses, we obtain
an algorithm for the relaxed problem that reports for each non-zero entry of
the product matrix a witness of rank at most \ell in time
\tilde{O}((n/\ell)n^{\omega(1,\log_n \ell,1)}). Then, by reducing the relaxed
problem to the so called k-witness problem, we provide an algorithm that
reports for each non-zero entry C[i,j] of the product matrix C a witness of
rank O(\lceil W_C(i,j)/k\rceil ), where W_C(i,j) is the number of witnesses for
C[i,j], with high probability. The algorithm runs in
\tilde{O}(n^{\omega}k^{0.4653} +n^2k) time, where \omega=\omega(1,1,1).

Intermediates must remain faithful to the input, stand on their own as members

In this paper, we propose a conditional GAN morphing framework operating on a

to temporal samples along the transformation, and learns a proper shape prior
that enhances the plausibility of intermediate frames. While individual frame
plausibility is boosted by the adversarial setup, a special training protocol
producing sequences of frames, combined with a perceptual similarity loss,
promote smooth transformation over time. Explicit stating of correspondences is
replaced with a grid-based freeform deformation spatial transformer that
predicts the geometric warp between the inputs, instituting the smooth
geometric effect by bringing the shapes into an initial alignment. We provide
comparisons to classic as well as latent space morphing techniques, and
demonstrate that, given a set of images for self-supervision, our network
learns to generate visually pleasing morphing effects featuring believable
in-betweens, with robustness to changes in shape and texture, requiring no

requirement for several emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It is
also desirable to develop such connectivity solutions for non-static network
topologies, so that resilience to device failures can be fully realized.
Decentralized clustering has emerged as a promising technique to address this
critical challenge. Clustering of nodes around cluster heads (CHs) provides an
energy-efficient two-tier framework for peer-to-peer communication. At the same
time, decentralization ensures that the framework can quickly adapt to a
dynamically changing network topology. Although some decentralized clustering
solutions have been proposed in the literature, they either lack guarantees on
connectivity or incur significant energy overhead to maintain the clusters. In
this paper, we present Decentralized Connected Resilient IoT Clustering
(DeCoRIC), an energy-efficient clustering scheme that is self-organizing and
resilient to network changes while guaranteeing connectivity. Using experiments
implemented on the Contiki simulator, we show that our clustering scheme adapts
itself to node faults in a time-bound manner. Our experiments show that DeCoRIC
achieves 100% connectivity among all nodes while improving the power efficiency
of nodes in the system compared to the state-of-the-art techniques BEEM and
LEACH by up to 110% and 70%, respectively. The improved power efficiency also
translates to longer lifetime before first node death with a best-case of 109%
longer than BEEM and 42% longer than LEACH.

experimentally demonstrate the distillation of Gaussian EPR steering and
entanglement in lossy and noisy environments using measurement-based noiseless
linear amplification. Different from entanglement distillation, the extension
of steerable region happens in the distillation of EPR steering besides the
enhancement of steerabilities. We demonstrate that the two-way or one-way
steerable region is extended after the distillation of EPR steering when the
NLA is implemented based on Bob's or Alice's measurement results. We also show
that the NLA helps to extract secret key from insecure region in one-sided

scoring method that casts a plausibility ranking task in a full-text format and
leverages the masked language modeling head tuned during the pre-training

hypotheses given a premise, focusing on the COPA, Swag, HellaSwag and
CommonsenseQA datasets. By exploiting our scoring method without fine-tuning,
we are able to produce strong baselines (e.g. 80% test accuracy on COPA) that
are comparable to supervised approaches. Moreover, when fine-tuning directly on
the proposed scoring function, we show that our method provides a much more
stable training phase across random restarts (e.g $\times 10$ standard
deviation reduction on COPA test accuracy) and requires less annotated data

provide valuable information about the microscopic behaviour of the bath. In
this work, we study the dynamics of a forced tracer in a colloidal bath by
means of Langevin dynamics simulations and a theory model within continuum
mechanics. In the simulations, the bath is comprised by quasi-hard spheres with
a volume fraction of 50% immersed in a featureless quiescent solvent, and the
tracer is pulled with a constant small force (within the linear regime). The
theoretical analysis is based on the Navier Stokes equation, where a term
proportional to the velocity arises from coarse-graining the friction of the
colloidal particles with the solvent. As a result, the final equation is
similar to the Brinkman model, although the interpretation is different. A
length scale appears in the model, 1/k_0, where the transverse momentum
transport crosses over to friction with the solvent. The effective friction
coefficient experienced by the tracer grows with the tracer size faster than
the prediction from Stokes law. Additionally, the velocity profiles in the bath
decay faster than in a Newtonian fluid. The comparison between simulations and
theory points to a boundary condition of effective partial slip at the tracer
surface. We also study the fluctuations in the tracer position, showing that it
reaches diffusion at long times, with a subdiffusive regime at intermediate
times. The diffusion coefficient, obtained from the long-time slope of the mean
squared displacement, fulfills the Stokes-Einstein relation with the friction
coefficient calculated from the steady tracer velocity, confirming the validity
of the linear response formalism.

a single denser coronal loop, embedded in a plasma with dipolar force-free
magnetic field with a constant alpha-parameter. For the loop with no
sigmoidity, we find that the numerically determined oscillation period of the
fundamental kink mode matches the theoretical period calculated using WKB
theory. In contrast, with increasing sigmoidity of the loop, the actual period
is increasingly smaller than the one estimated by WKB theory. Translated
through coronal seismology, increasing sigmoidity results in magnetic field
estimates which are increasingly shifting towards higher values, and even
surpassing the average value for the highest alpha value considered.
Nevertheless, the estimated range of the coronal magnetic field value lies
within the mimimal/maximal limits, proving the robustness coronal seismology.
We propose that the discrepancy in the estimations of the absolute value of the
force-free magnetic field could be exploited seismologically to determine the
free energy of coronal loops, if averages of the internal magnetic field and

that they synchronize nondeterministic decision among choices of the same name.
  The motivation of the synchronization mechanism is to solve a theoretical

coordinated choices like standard ones. In other words, we want to avoid
synchronization. Now, there are two problems: (i) practically, it is a bit
complicated work to write a program using coordinated choices in which
execution synchronization never happens; and (ii) theoretically, it is unknown
whether any programs using standard choices can be written by using only
coordinated ones.

$\lambda^\parallel$ equipped with standard choices and
$\lambda^{\parallel\omega}$ equipped with coordinated choices, and give
compilation rules from the former into the latter. The challenge is to show the
correctness of the compilation because behavioral correspondence between
expressions before and after compiling cannot be defined directly by the

synchronization never happens. Then, we show that all compiled expressions can

exact balance of energy exchanges in space and time for vertical atmospheric
motions by preserving the skew-symmetry of the non-canonical Hamiltonian
formulation of the compressible Euler equations. The performance of the
integrator is accelerated by a preconditioning strategy that reduces the
dimensionality of the inner linear system. Here we reduce the four component
velocity, density, density weighted potential temperature and Exner pressure
system into a single equation for the density weighted potential temperature
via repeated Schur complement decomposition and the careful selection of
coupling terms. As currently formulated, the integrator is based on a
horizontal-vertical spatial splitting that does not permit bottom topography.
The integrator is validated for standard test cases for baroclinic instability
and a non-hydrostatic gravity wave on the sphere and a rising bubble in a

  harmonic vector analysis",,,,,"eess.AS cs.SD eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes harmonic vector analysis (HVA) based on a general
algorithmic framework of audio blind source separation (BSS) that is also
presented in this paper. BSS for a convolutive audio mixture is usually
performed by multichannel linear filtering when the numbers of microphones and
sources are equal (determined situation). This paper addresses such determined
BSS based on batch processing. To estimate the demixing filters, effective
modeling of the source signals is important. One successful example is
independent vector analysis (IVA) that models the signals via co-occurrence
among the frequency components in each source. To give more freedom to the
source modeling, a general framework of determined BSS is presented in this
paper. It is based on the plug-and-play scheme using a primal-dual splitting
algorithm and enables us to model the source signals implicitly through a
time-frequency mask. By using the proposed framework, determined BSS algorithms
can be developed by designing masks that enhance the source signals. As an
example of its application, we propose HVA by defining a time-frequency mask
that enhances the harmonic structure of audio signals via sparsity of cepstrum.
The experiments showed that HVA outperforms IVA and independent low-rank matrix
analysis (ILRMA) for both speech and music signals. A MATLAB code is provided

their scission and thereby limit the experimental study and application of
phenomena such as turbulent drag reduction and elastic turbulence. In this
paper, we study polymer scission in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, through a
combination of stochastic modelling, based on a Gaussian time-decorrelated
random flow, and direct numerical simulations (DNSs) with both one-way
(passive) and two-way (active) coupling of the polymers and the flow. For the
first scission of passive polymers, the stochastic model yields analytical
predictions which are found to be in good agreement with results from the DNSs,
for the temporal evolution of the fraction of unbroken polymers and the
statistics of the survival of polymers. The impact of scission on the dynamics
of a turbulent polymer solution is investigated through DNSs with two-way
coupling (active polymers). Our results indicate that the reduction of kinetic
energy dissipation due to feedback from stretched polymers is an inherently
transient effect, which is lost as the polymers breakup. Thus, the overall
dissipation-reduction is maximised by an intermediate polymer relaxation time,
for which polymers stretch significantly but without breaking too quickly. We
also study the dynamics of the polymer fragments which form after scission;
these daughter polymers can themselves undergo subsequent, repeated, breakups
to produce a hierarchical population of polymers with a range of relaxation
times and scission rates.

damages on communication infrastructures. For instance, after a natural
disaster, infrastructures might be entirely destroyed. Different network
paradigms were proposed in the literature in order to deploy adhoc network, and
allow dealing with the lack of communications. However, all these solutions
focus only on the performance of the network itself, without taking into
account the specificities and heterogeneity of the components which use it.
This comes from the difficulty to integrate models with different levels of
abstraction. Consequently, verification and validation of adhoc protocols
cannot guarantee that the different systems will work as expected in
operational conditions. However, the DEVS theory provides some mechanisms to
allow integration of models with different natures. This paper proposes an
integrated simulation architecture based on DEVS which improves the accuracy of

due to the complexity of the drift dynamics and lack of known optimal solutions
for the path of the search agents. This challenge was highlighted by the
unsuccessful search for Malaysian Flight 370 (MH370) which disappeared on March
8, 2014. In this paper, we propose an improvement of a search algorithm rooted
in the ergodic theory of dynamical systems which can accommodate complex
geometries and uncertainties of the drifting search areas on the ocean surface.
We illustrate the effectiveness of this algorithm in a computational
replication of the conducted search for MH370. In comparison to conventional
search methods, the proposed algorithm leads to an order of magnitude
improvement in success rate over the time period of the actual search
operation. Simulations of the proposed search control also indicate that the
initial success rate of finding debris increases in the event of delayed search
commencement. This is due to the existence of convergence zones in the search
area which leads to local aggregation of debris in those zones and hence
reduction of the effective size of the area to be searched.

semimetals (TCWSMs). The nuclear spin relaxation rate is presented as a
function of temperature and tilt parameter. We find that the relaxation rate
behaves as $(1-\zeta^2)^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\approx 9$ where $0\le \zeta <
1$ is the tilt parameter. We demonstrate that such a strong enhancement for
$\zeta\lesssim 1$ that gives rise to very fast relaxation rates, is contributed
by the combined effect of a new hyperfine interactions arising from the tilt
itself, and the anisotropy of the ellipsoidal Fermi surface. Extracting an
effective density of states (DOS) $\tilde\rho$ from the Korringa relation, we
show that it is related to the DOS $\rho$ of the tilted cone dispersion by the
""redshift factor"" $\tilde\rho=\rho/\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$. We interpret this
relation as NMR manifestation of an emergent underlying spacetime structure in
TCWSMs.

in order to deal with spectral truncations of geometric spaces (i.e. imposing
an ultraviolet cutoff in momentum space) and with tolerance relations which
provide a coarse grain approximation of geometric spaces at a finite
resolution. In our new approach the traditional role played by $C^*$-algebras
is taken over by operator systems. As part of the techniques we treat
$C^*$-envelopes, dual operator systems and stable equivalence. We define a
propagation number for operator systems, which we show to be an invariant under
stable equivalence and use to compare approximations of the same space.
  We illustrate our methods for concrete examples obtained by spectral
truncations of the circle. These are operator systems of finite-dimensional
Toeplitz matrices and their dual operator systems which are given by functions
in the group algebra on the integers with support in a fixed interval. It turns
out that the cones of positive elements and the pure state spaces for these
operator systems possess a very rich structure which we analyze including for
the algebraic geometry of the boundary of the positive cone and the metric
aspect i.e. the distance on the state space associated to the Dirac operator.
The main property of the spectral truncation is that it keeps the isometry
group intact. In contrast, if one considers the other finite approximation
provided by circulant matrices the isometry group becomes discrete, even though
in this case the operator system is a $C^*$-algebra. We analyze this in the
context of the finite Fourier transform.
  The extension of noncommutative geometry to operator systems allows one to
deal with metric spaces up to finite resolution by considering the relation
$d(x,y)<\epsilon$ between two points, or more generally a tolerance relation
which naturally gives rise to an operator system.

with the goal of efficiently coordinating distributed generators to balance
unexpected load variations with respect to nominal forecasts. To mitigate the
difficulties due to the size of the problem, the proposed methodology is
divided in two steps. First, the network is partitioned into clusters, composed
of several dispatchable and non dispatchable generators, storage systems, and
loads. A clustering algorithm is designed with the aim of obtaining clusters
with the following characteristics: (i) they must be compact, keeping the
distance between generators and loads as small as possible; (ii) they must be
able to internally balance load variations to the maximum possible extent. Once
the network clustering has been completed, a two layer control system is
designed. At the lower layer, a local Model Predictive Controller is associated
to each cluster for managing the available generation and storage elements to
compensate local load variations. If the local sources are not sufficient to
balance the cluster's load variations, a power request is sent to the
supervisory layer, which optimally distributes additional resources available
from the other clusters of the network. To enhance the scalability of the
approach, the supervisor is implemented relying on a fully distributed
optimization algorithm. The IEEE 118-bus system is used to test the proposed
design procedure in a non trivial scenario.

focus on the photometric signatures produced by rings around transiting

nonlinear dynamics that find important applications in fields such as high
power pulse compression and broadband supercontinuum generation. Such nonlinear
evolution however, depends sensitively on both the input pulse and fibre
characteristics, and optimizing propagation for application purposes requires
extensive numerical simulations based on generalizations of a nonlinear
Schr\""odinger-type equation. This is computationally-demanding and creates a
severe bottleneck in using numerical techniques to design and optimize
experiments in real-time. Here, we present a solution to this problem using a
machine-learning based paradigm to predict complex nonlinear propagation in
optical fibres with a recurrent neural network, bypassing the need for direct
numerical solution of a governing propagation model. Specifically, we show how
a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory accurately predicts the
temporal and spectral evolution of higher-order soliton compression and
supercontinuum generation, solely from a given transform-limited input pulse
intensity profile. Comparison with experiments for the case of soliton
compression shows remarkable agreement in both temporal and spectral domains.
In optics, our results apply readily to the optimization of pulse compression

However, one of the most interesting features of the approach is its inherent
ability to suppress phase noise during the carrier generation process. Besides
the comb laser source, the dispersive element is the key component in this
upconversion scheme. Ideally, it provides the right amount of dispersion over
the whole spectral range of the comb. Broader combs are expected to allow a
higher degree of phase noise suppression. The simulation of phase noise of an

paper, the dependency of the phase noise suppression on the dispersion

these elements. First, the implemented simulation tool and the simulation
parameters ensuring a correct estimation of the phase noise before and after
dispersion influence are introduced. Then, the effect of different dispersion
characteristics on the phase noise behavior is analyzed. It could be shown and
explained how the phase noise at different offset frequencies to the carrier is
affected differently depending on the dispersion characteristic and also the
comb width. Design rules for the required comb width as well as the acceptable
variation of the produced dispersion from the ideal value depending on the
demands for the phase noise improvements could be developed and will be
presented.

Individuals live in colonies and are subject to resampling and migration as
long as they are active. Each colony has a structured seed-bank into which
individuals can retreat to become dormant, suspending their resampling and
migration until they become active again. As geographic space labelling the
colonies we consider a countable Abelian group $\mathbb{G}$ endowed with the
discrete topology. The key example of interest is the Euclidean lattice
$\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{Z}^d$. Our goal is to classify the long-time behaviour of
the system in terms of the underlying model parameters. In particular, we want
to understand in what way the seed-bank enhances genetic diversity.
  We introduce three models of increasing generality, namely, individuals
become dormant: (1) in the seed-bank of their colony; (2) in the seed-bank of
their colony while adopting a random colour that determines their wake-up time;
(3) in the seed-bank of a random colony while adopting a random colour. The
extension in (2) allows us to model wake-up times with fat tails while
preserving the Markov property of the evolution. For each of the three models
we show that the system converges to a unique equilibrium depending on a single
density parameter that is determined by the initial state, and exhibits a
dichotomy of coexistence (= locally multi-type equilibrium) versus clustering
(= locally mono-type equilibrium) depending on the parameters controlling the
migration and the seed-bank. The dichotomy between clustering and coexistence
in model 1 is determined by migration only. In models (2) and (3), when the
wake-up time has infinite mean, the dichotomy is determined by both the
exchange with the seed-bank and migration. It turns out that the seed-bank
affects the long-time behaviour both quantitatively and qualitatively.

such as in Medical Imaging and other real-world applications is the requirement
of large annotated datasets prepared by clinicians or experts to train the

previously known or trained concepts plus currently existing auxiliary
information. This makes the ZSL applicable in many real-world scenarios, from
unknown object detection in autonomous vehicles to medical imaging and
unforeseen diseases such as COVID-19 Chest X-Ray (CXR) based diagnosis. We
introduce a novel and broaden solution called Few/one-shot learning, and
present the definition of the ZSL problem as an extreme case of the few-shot
learning. We review over fundamentals and the challenging steps of Zero-Shot
Learning, including state-of-the-art categories of solutions, as well as our
recommended solution, motivations behind each approach, their advantages over
each category to guide both clinicians and AI researchers to proceed with the
best techniques and practices based on their applications. We then review
through different datasets inducing medical and non-medical images, the variety
of splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss
the recent applications and future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful
intuition through this paper towards the goal of handling complex learning
tasks more similar to the way humans learn. We mainly focus on two applications
in the current modern yet challenging era: coping with an early and fast
diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, and also encouraging the readers to develop other
similar AI-based automated detection/recognition systems using ZSL.

the main enablers of such digitization at large. The recently introduced 5G New
Radio is natively designed to support both aspects of MTC to promote the
digital transformation of the society. However, it is evident that some of the
more demanding requirements cannot be fully supported by 5G networks.
Alongside, further development of the society towards 2030 will give rise to
new and more stringent requirements on wireless connectivity in general, and
MTC in particular. Driven by the societal trends towards 2030, the next
generation (6G) will be an agile and efficient convergent network serving a set
of diverse service classes and a wide range of key performance indicators
(KPI). This white paper explores the main drivers and requirements of an
MTC-optimized 6G network, and discusses the following six key research
questions:
  - Will the main KPIs of 5G continue to be the dominant KPIs in 6G; or will
there emerge new key metrics?
  - How to deliver different E2E service mandates with different KPI
requirements considering joint-optimization at the physical up to the
application layer?
  - What are the key enablers towards designing ultra-low power receivers and
highly efficient sleep modes?
  - How to tackle a disruptive rather than incremental joint design of a
massively scalable waveform and medium access policy for global MTC
connectivity?
  - How to support new service classes characterizing mission-critical and
dependable MTC in 6G?
  - What are the potential enablers of long term, lightweight and flexible

  Generation","published in TOIS 2021",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we address the problem of answering complex information needs
by conversing conversations with search engines, in the sense that users can
express their queries in natural language, and directly receivethe information
they need from a short system response in a conversational manner. Recently,
there have been some attempts towards a similar goal, e.g., studies on
Conversational Agents (CAs) and Conversational Search (CS). However, they
either do not address complex information needs, or they are limited to the
development of conceptual frameworks and/or laboratory-based user studies.
  We pursue two goals in this paper: (1) the creation of a suitable dataset,
the Search as a Conversation (SaaC) dataset, for the development of pipelines
for conversations with search engines, and (2) the development of
astate-of-the-art pipeline for conversations with search engines, the
Conversations with Search Engines (CaSE), using this dataset. SaaC is built
based on a multi-turn conversational search dataset, where we further employ
workers from a crowdsourcing platform to summarize each relevant passage into a
short, conversational response. CaSE enhances the state-of-the-art by
introducing a supporting token identification module and aprior-aware pointer
generator, which enables us to generate more accurate responses.
  We carry out experiments to show that CaSE is able to outperform strong
baselines. We also conduct extensive analyses on the SaaC dataset to show where
there is room for further improvement beyond CaSE. Finally, we release the SaaC
dataset and the code for CaSE and all models used for comparison to facilitate
future research on this topic.

truncates the full field theory to the moduli space, a finite dimensional
manifold of energy minimising field configurations, and studies the quantum
mechanical problem on this. Non-BPS theories -- the generic case -- have no
such obvious truncation. We define a quantum soliton scattering manifold as a
configuration space which satisfies asymptotic completeness and respects the
underlying classical dynamics of slow moving solitons. Having done this, we
present a new method to construct such manifolds. In the BPS case the dimension
of the $n$-soliton moduli space $\mathcal{M}_n$ is $n$ multiplied by the
dimension of $\mathcal{M}_1$. We show that this scaling is not necessarily
valid for scattering manifolds in non-BPS theories, and argue that it is false
for the Skyrme and baby-Skyrme models. In these models, we show that a relative
phase difference can generate a relative size difference during a soliton
collision. Asymptotically, these are zero and non-zero modes respectively and
this new mechanism softens the dichotomy between such modes. Using this
discovery, we then show that all previous truncations of the 2-Skyrmion
configuration space are unsuitable for the quantum scattering problem as they
have the wrong dimension. This gives credence to recent numerical work which
suggests that the low-energy configuration space is 14-dimensional (rather than
12-dimensional, as previously thought). We suggest some ways to construct a
suitable manifold for the 2-Skyrmion problem, and discuss applications of our
new definition and construction for general soliton theories.

wishes to compute the product of a user-generated data matrix with a

uploading, distributed computing at edge nodes (ENs), and output downloading.
Task offloading may suffer long delay since servers at some ENs may be
straggling due to random computation time, and wireless channels may experience
severe fading and interference. This paper aims to investigate the interplay
among upload, computation, and download latencies during the offloading process
in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime from an information-theoretic
perspective. A policy based on cascaded coded computing and on coordinated and
cooperative interference management in uplink and downlink is proposed and
proved to be approximately optimal for a sufficiently large upload time. By
investing more time in uplink transmission, the policy creates data redundancy
at the ENs, which can reduce the computation time, by enabling the use of coded
computing, as well as the download time via transmitter cooperation. Moreover,
the policy allows computation time to be traded for download time. Numerical
examples demonstrate that the proposed policy can improve over existing schemes
by significantly reducing the end-to-end execution time.

neurovascular coupling over patients and brain regions. We aim to overcome
these drawbacks in a data-driven manner by means of a novel structured
matrix-tensor factorization: the single-subject EEG data (represented as a
third-order spectrogram tensor) and fMRI data (represented as a spatiotemporal
BOLD signal matrix) are jointly decomposed into a superposition of several
sources, characterized by space-time-frequency profiles. In the shared temporal
mode, Toeplitz-structured factors account for a spatially specific,
neurovascular `bridge' between the EEG and fMRI temporal fluctuations,
capturing the hemodynamic response's variability over brain regions. We show
that the extracted source signatures provide a sensitive localization of the
ictal onset zone, and, moreover, that complementary localizing information can
be derived from the spatial variation of the hemodynamic response. Hence, this
multivariate, multimodal factorization provides two useful sets of EEG-fMRI
biomarkers, which can inform the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. We make

has been suggested that this body might be a primordial black hole (PBH). In
that case, conventional searches will fail. A possible alternative is to probe
the gravitational field of this object using small, laser-launched spacecraft,
like the ones envisioned in the Breakthrough Starshot project. With a velocity
of order $.001~c$, such spacecraft can reach Planet 9 roughly a decade after
launch and can discover it if they can report timing measurements accurate to

This process uses a background component to represent primary accidents, and a

consists of periodic daily and weekly components, a spatial component and a
long-term trend. The self-exciting components are decaying, unidirectional
functions of space and time. These components are determined via kernel
smoothing and likelihood estimation. Temporally, the background is stable
across seasons with a daily double peak structure reflecting commuting

our work is that it is model independent. We do not assume or use any nuclear
physics model but use only ML algorithms directly on the AME2016 data set. Our
results are further refined by using another ML algorithm to train the errors
of the first algorithm, and repeating this process iteratively. Our best
algorithm gives $\sigma_{\rm rms} \approx 0.58$ MeV for Binding Energy on
randomized testing sets. This is comparable to all physics models or ML
improved physics models studied in literature till date. Using the predictions
of our Machine Learning algorithm, we construct the outer crust equation of

a life-long learning process. We address two challenges of life-long
retraining: catastrophic forgetting and efficient retraining. If we combine all
past and new data it can easily become intractable to retrain the neural
network model. On the other hand, if the model is retrained using only new
data, it can easily suffer catastrophic forgetting and thus it is paramount to
strike the right balance. Moreover, if we retrain all weights of the model
every time new data is collected, retraining tends to require too many
computing resources. To solve these two issues, we propose a novel retraining
model that can select important samples and important weights utilizing
multi-armed bandits. To further address forgetting, we propose a new
regularization term focusing on synapse and neuron importance. We analyze
multiple datasets to document the outcome of the proposed retraining methods.

described by an effective standard TC Hamiltonian in the rotating frame. In
this ideal Hermitian case, the engineered TC model can exhibit the
super-radiant QPT with spin conservation at an experimentally accessible

inorganic interfaces interactions are too strong, consequently perturbing, and
even quenching, both the magnetic moment and the topological surface states at

by using ligand chemistry to tune the interaction of magnetic ions with the

on the surface of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films, robust interfaces are formed that
preserve undoped topological surface states as well as the pristine magnetic
moment of the divalent Co ions. The selected ligands allow us to tune the
interfacial hybridization within this weak interaction regime. These results,
which are in stark contrast with the observed suppression of the surface state
at the first quintuple layer of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ induced by the interaction with Co
phthalocyanines, demonstrate the capability of planar metal-organic molecules

$\theta \pm \delta$ between the two layers, by low-frequency Raman scattering.
In sufficiently aligned samples with $\theta=0^\circ$, or $\theta=60^\circ$,
and $\delta \lesssim 3^\circ$, we observe an interlayer shear mode (ISM), which
is a clear sign of a commensurate bilayer structure, i.e., the layers must
undergo an atomic reconstruction to form R-type or H-type stacking orders. We
find slightly different ISM energies of about 18~cm$^{-1}$ and 17~cm$^{-1}$ for
H-type and R-type reconstructions, respectively, independent of the exact value
of $\theta\pm \delta$. Our findings are corroborated by the fact that the ISM
is not observed in samples with twist angles, which deviate by $\delta >
3^\circ$ from $0^\circ$ or $60^\circ$. This is expected, since in such

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we aim at equipping pre-trained language models with structured
knowledge. We present two self-supervised tasks learning over raw text with the
guidance from knowledge graphs. Building upon entity-level masked language
models, our first contribution is an entity masking scheme that exploits
relational knowledge underlying the text. This is fulfilled by using a linked
knowledge graph to select informative entities and then masking their mentions.
In addition we use knowledge graphs to obtain distractors for the masked
entities, and propose a novel distractor-suppressed ranking objective which is
optimized jointly with masked language model. In contrast to existing
paradigms, our approach uses knowledge graphs implicitly, only during
pre-training, to inject language models with structured knowledge via learning
from raw text. It is more efficient than retrieval-based methods that perform
entity linking and integration during finetuning and inference, and generalizes
more effectively than the methods that directly learn from concatenated graph
triples. Experiments show that our proposed model achieves improved performance
on five benchmark datasets, including question answering and knowledge base
completion tasks.

exposed to external magnetic fields. Since many practical realizations of such
materials involve particulate inclusions of polydisperse size distributions, we
concentrate on the effect that mixed particle sizes have on the overall
deformational response. To perform a systematic study, our focus is on binary
size distributions. We systematically vary the fraction of larger particles
relative to smaller ones and characterize the resulting magnetostrictive
behavior. The consequences for systems of various different spatial particle
arrangements and different degrees of compressibility of the elastic matrix are
evaluated. In parts, we observe a qualitative change in the overall response
for selected systems of mixed particle sizes. Specifically, overall changes in
volume and relative elongations or contractions in response to an induced
magnetization can be reversed into the opposite types of behavior. Our results
should apply to the characteristics of other soft elastic composite materials

targets in the ~5-10 Myr old Upper Scorpius region for which disk masses were
measured with ALMA. We find that the mass accretion rates in this sample of old
but still survived disks are similarly high as those of the younger (<3 Myr
old) star-forming regions of Lupus and Cha I, when considering the dependence
on stellar and disk mass. In particular, several disks show high mass accretion
rates >10^-9 Msun/yr while having low disk masses. Furthermore, the median
values of the measured mass accretion rates in the disk mass ranges where our
sample is complete at a level ~60-80% are compatible in these three regions. At
the same time, the spread of mass accretion rates at any given disk mass is
still >0.9 dex even at age>5 Myr. These results are in contrast with simple
models of viscous evolution, which would predict that the values of the mass
accretion rate diminish with time, and a tighter correlation with disk mass at
age>5 Myr. Similarly, simple models of internal photoevaporation cannot
reproduce the observed mass accretion rates, while external photoevaporation
might explain the low disk masses and high accretion rates. A partial possible
solution to the discrepancy with the viscous models is that the gas-to-dust
ratio of the disks at >5 Myr is significantly different and higher than the
canonical 100, as suggested by some dust and gas disk evolution models. The
results shown here require the presence of several inter-playing processes,
such as detailed dust evolution, external photoevaporation and possibly MHD
winds, to explain the secular evolution of protoplanetary disks.

$De$, whereas the stresses on the sphere surface and in the wake first increase
and then decrease with $De$. A negative wake was observed for the two solvent
viscosity ratios tested ($\beta$ = 0.1 and 0.5), being more intense for the
more elastic fluid. In the absence of viscous dissipation, the average Nusselt
number starts to decrease with $De$ after an initial increase. Heat transfer
enhancement relative to an equivalent Newtonian fluid was observed for the
whole range of conditions tested. The temperature of the sphere decreases and
becomes more homogeneous when its thermal conductivity increases in relation to
the conductivity of the fluid, although small changes are observed in the
Nusselt number. The thermal contact resistance at the interface increases the
average temperature of the sphere, without affecting significantly the shape of
the temperature profiles inside the sphere. When viscous dissipation is

notions of faithful and plausible explanations for a model's predictions.
Attention distributions can be considered a faithful explanation if a higher
attention weight implies a greater impact on the model's prediction. They can
be considered a plausible explanation if they provide a human-understandable
justification for the model's predictions. In this work, we first explain why
current attention mechanisms in LSTM based encoders can neither provide a

that in LSTM based encoders the hidden representations at different time-steps
are very similar to each other (high conicity) and attention weights in these
situations do not carry much meaning because even a random permutation of the
attention weights does not affect the model's predictions. Based on experiments
on a wide variety of tasks and datasets, we observe attention distributions
often attribute the model's predictions to unimportant words such as
punctuation and fail to offer a plausible explanation for the predictions. To
make attention mechanisms more faithful and plausible, we propose a modified
LSTM cell with a diversity-driven training objective that ensures that the
hidden representations learned at different time steps are diverse. We show
that the resulting attention distributions offer more transparency as they (i)
provide a more precise importance ranking of the hidden states (ii) are better
indicative of words important for the model's predictions (iii) correlate
better with gradient-based attribution methods. Human evaluations indicate that
the attention distributions learned by our model offer a plausible explanation
of the model's predictions. Our code has been made publicly available at

challenge in passage retrieval. We address this problem with a
representation-based ranking approach that: (1) explicitly models the

passage expansion by propagating the importance to similar terms; and (3)
grounds the representations in the lexicon, making them interpretable. Passage
representations can be pre-computed at index time to reduce query-time latency.
We call our approach EPIC (Expansion via Prediction of Importance with
Contextualization). We show that EPIC significantly outperforms prior
importance-modeling and document expansion approaches. We also observe that the
performance is additive with the current leading first-stage retrieval methods,
further narrowing the gap between inexpensive and cost-prohibitive passage
ranking approaches. Specifically, EPIC achieves a MRR@10 of 0.304 on the
MS-MARCO passage ranking dataset with 78ms average query latency on commodity
hardware. We also find that the latency is further reduced to 68ms by pruning
document representations, with virtually no difference in effectiveness.

future 6G wireless systems. Different categories of use cases are considered,
from extreme capacity with peak data rates up to 1 Tbps, to raising the typical
data rates by orders-of-magnitude, to support broadband connectivity at railway
speeds up to 1000 km/h. To achieve these goals, not only the terrestrial
networks will be evolved but they will also be integrated with satellite
networks, all facilitating autonomous systems and various interconnected
structures. We believe that several categories of enablers at the
infrastructure, spectrum, and protocol/ algorithmic levels are required to
realize the intended broadband connectivity goals in 6G. At the infrastructure
level, we consider ultra-massive MIMO technology (possibly implemented using
holographic radio), intelligent reflecting surfaces, user-centric and scalable
cell-free networking, integrated access and backhaul, and integrated space and
terrestrial networks. At the spectrum level, the network must seamlessly
utilize sub-6 GHz bands for coverage and spatial multiplexing of many devices,
while higher bands will be used for pushing the peak rates of point-to-point
links. The latter path will lead to THz communications complemented by visible
light communications in specific scenarios. At the protocol/algorithmic level,
the enablers include improved coding, modulation, and waveforms to achieve
lower latencies, higher reliability, and reduced complexity. Different options
will be needed to optimally support different use cases. The resource
efficiency can be further improved by using various combinations of full-duplex
radios, interference management based on rate-splitting, machine-learning-based
optimization, coded caching, and broadcasting.

rapidly. This is especially critical for the high-altitude carbon cycle, for
which new feedbacks could be triggered. However, mountain carbon dynamics is
only partially known. In particular, models of the processes driving carbon
fluxes in high-altitude grasslands and Alpine tundra need to be improved. Here,
we propose a comparison of three empirical approaches using systematic
statistical analysis, to identify the environmental variables controlling
$CO_2$ fluxes. The methods were applied to a complete dataset of simultaneous
in situ measurements of the net $CO_2$ exchange, ecosystem respiration and
basic environmental variables in three sampling sites in the same catchment.
Large year-to-year variations in the gross primary production (GPP) and
ecosystem respiration (ER) dependences on solar irradiance and temperature were
observed,. We thus implemented a multi regression model in which additional
variables were introduced as perturbations of the standard exponential and
rectangular hyperbolic functions for ER and GPP, respectively. A comparison of
this model with other common modelling strategies, showed the benefits of this
approach, resulting in large explained variances (83% to 94%). The optimum
ensemble of variables explaining the inter- and intra-annual flux variability
included solar irradiance, soil moisture and day of the year for GPP, and air
temperature, soil moisture, air pressure and day of the year for the ER, in
agreement with other studies. The modelling approach discussed here provides a
basis for selecting drivers of carbon fluxes and understanding their role in
high-altitude Alpine ecosystems, also allowing for future short-range
assessments of local trends.

its natural application in the upcoming quantum networks. The security of many
multipartite device-independent (DI) protocols, such as DI conference key
agreement, relies on bounding the von Neumann entropy of the parties' outcomes
conditioned on the eavesdropper's information, given the violation of a
multipartite Bell inequality. We consider three parties testing the
Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality and certify the privacy of
their outcomes by bounding the conditional entropy of a single party's outcome
and the joint conditional entropy of two parties' outcomes. From the former
bound, we show that genuine multipartite entanglement is necessary to certify
the privacy of a party's outcome, while the latter significantly improve
previous results. We obtain the entropy bounds thanks to two general results of
independent interest. The first one drastically simplifies the quantum setup of
an $N$-partite Bell scenario. The second one provides an upper bound on the
violation of the MABK inequality by an arbitrary $N$-qubit state, as a function
of the state's parameters.

extraction of semantic relationships has been at the top of the research agenda
in the last few years. This work has been mainly motivated by the fact that
building knowledge graphs (KG) and bases (KB), as a key ingredient of
intelligent applications, is a never-ending challenge, since new knowledge
needs to be harvested while old knowledge needs to be revised. Currently,
approaches towards relation extraction from text are dominated by neural models
practicing some sort of distant (weak) supervision in machine learning from
large corpora, with or without consulting external knowledge sources. In this
paper, we empirically study and explore the potential of a novel idea of using
classical semantic spaces and models, e.g., Word Embedding, generated for
extracting word association, in conjunction with relation extraction
approaches. The goal is to use these word association models to reinforce
current relation extraction approaches. We believe that this is a first attempt
of this kind and the results of the study should shed some light on the extent
to which these word association models can be used as well as the most
promising types of relationships to be considered for extraction.

traversable and characterized by a thin-shell throat in accordance with
Israel's junction conditions. In asymptotically flat and AdS spacetimes with a
negative Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, stable neutral wormholes are
encountered when the magnitude of the coupling constant becomes significant.
The throats of such wormholes are sustained by ordinary matter and possess
finite radii. In asymptotically dS spacetimes, no stable neutral wormhole
featuring ordinary matter is observed. On the other hand, for positive
Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, stable thin-shell wormhole solutions can be
established when the throats are exclusively supported by exotic matter.
Moreover, stable charged wormholes comprised of ordinary matter are found
universally in the asymptotically flat, AdS, and dS spacetimes. Unlike their

many relevant answers highly than to retrieve all relevant answers. It follows
that a good ranking strategy would be to learn how to identify the easiest
correct answers first (i.e., assign a high ranking score to answers that have
characteristics that usually indicate relevance, and a low ranking score to
those with characteristics that do not), before incorporating more complex
logic to handle difficult cases (e.g., semantic matching or reasoning). In this
work, we apply this idea to the training of neural answer rankers using
curriculum learning. We propose several heuristics to estimate the difficulty
of a given training sample. We show that the proposed heuristics can be used to
build a training curriculum that down-weights difficult samples early in the
training process. As the training process progresses, our approach gradually
shifts to weighting all samples equally, regardless of difficulty. We present a
comprehensive evaluation of our proposed idea on three answer ranking datasets.
Results show that our approach leads to superior performance of two leading
neural ranking architectures, namely BERT and ConvKNRM, using both pointwise
and pairwise losses. When applied to a BERT-based ranker, our method yields up
to a 4% improvement in MRR and a 9% improvement in P@1 (compared to the model
trained without a curriculum). This results in models that can achieve
comparable performance to more expensive state-of-the-art techniques.

minimization has not exploited the potential of TT rank for high-order tensors.
The TT rank minimization accompany with \emph{ket augmentation}, which
transforms a lower-order tensor (e.g., visual data) into a higher-order tensor,
suffers from serious block-artifacts. To tackle this issue, we suggest the TT
rank minimization with nonlocal self-similarity for tensor completion by
simultaneously exploring the spatial, temporal/spectral, and nonlocal
redundancy in visual data. More precisely, the TT rank minimization is
performed on a formed higher-order tensor called group by stacking similar
cubes, which naturally and fully takes advantage of the ability of TT rank for
high-order tensors. Moreover, the perturbation analysis for the TT low-rankness
of each group is established. We develop the alternating direction method of
multipliers tailored for the specific structure to solve the proposed model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to

representations of such manifolds that are isometry-invariant and multi-scale.
These representations permit us to compute heat kernel signatures of each point
on that manifold, and we can use these signatures as features for
classification and segmentation that identify points that have similar
structural properties.
  Our approach adapts heat kernel signatures to unsteady flows by formulating a
notion of shape where pathlines are observations of a manifold living in a
high-dimensional space.
  We use this space to compute and visualize heat kernel signatures associated
with each pathline.
  Besides being able to capture the structural features of a pathline, heat
kernel signatures allow the comparison of pathlines from different flow
datasets through a shape matching pipeline. We demonstrate the analytic power
of heat kernel signatures by comparing both (1) different timesteps from the
same unsteady flow as well as (2) flow datasets taken from ensemble simulations
with varying simulation parameters. Our analysis only requires the pathlines
themselves, and thus it does not utilize the underlying vector field directly.
We make minimal assumptions on the pathlines: while we assume they are sampled
from a continuous, unsteady flow, our computations can tolerate pathlines that
have varying density and potential unknown boundaries. We evaluate our approach
through visualizations of a variety of two-dimensional unsteady flows.

spiral structure along the galactic disk and is observed as X-shaped in the
halo of some galaxies. While the disk field can be well explained by dynamo
action, the 3-dimensional structure of the halo field and its physical nature
is still unclear.
  Aims. As first steps towards understanding the halo fields, we want to
clarify whether the observed X-shaped field is a wide-spread pattern in the
halos of spiral galaxies and whether these halo fields are just turbulent
fields ordered by compression or shear (anisotropic turbulent fields), or have
a large-scale regular structure.
  Methods. The analysis of the Faraday rotation in the halo is the tool to
discern anisotropic turbulent fields from large-scale magnetic fields. This,
however, has been challenging until recently because of the faint halo emission
in linear polarization. Our sensitive VLA broadband observations C-band and
L-band of 35 spiral galaxies seen edge-on (called CHANG-ES) allowed us to
perform RM-synthesis in their halos and to analyze the results. We further
accomplished a stacking of the observed polarization maps of 28 CHANG-ES
galaxies at C-band.
  Results. Though the stacked edge-on galaxies were of different Hubble types,
star formation and interaction activities, the stacked image clearly reveals an
X-shaped structure of the apparent magnetic field. We detected a large-scale
(coherent) halo field in all 16 galaxies that have extended polarized intensity
in their halos. We detected large-scale field reversals in all of their halos.
In six galaxies they are along lines about vertical to the galactic midplane
(vertical RMTL) with about 2 kpc separation. Only in NGC 3044 and possibly in
NGC 3448 we observed vertical giant magnetic ropes (GMRs) similar to those
detected recently in NGC 4631.

called mereotopology. RBTS is a kind of point-free theory of space based on the
notion of region. Its origin goes back to some ideas of Whitehead, De Laguna
and Tarski to build the theory of space without the use of the notion of point.
More information on RBTS and mereotopology can be found, for instance, in
\cite{Vak2007}. Contact algebras present an algebraic formulation of RBTS and
in fact give axiomatizations of the Boolean algebras of regular closed sets of
some classes of topological spaces with an additional relation of contact. An
exhaustive study of this theory is given in \cite{DiVak2006}. Dynamic contact
algebra (DCA) \cite{Vak2014} (see also \cite{Vak2010,Vak2012}) introduced by
the present author, is a generalization of contact algebra studying regions
changing in time and presents a formal explication of Whitehead's ideas of
integrated point-free theory of space and time. DCA is an abstraction of a
special \emph{dynamic model of space}, called also \emph{snapshot} or
\emph{cinematographic} model and the paper \cite{Vak2014} contains the expected
representation theorem with respect to such models. In the present paper we
introduce a new version of DCA which is a simplified version of the definition
from \cite{Vak2014} and similar to that of \cite{Vak2012}. The aim is to use
this version as a representative example of a DCA and to develop for this
example not only the snapshot models but also topological models and the
expected topological duality theory, generalizing in a certain sense the well
known Stone duality for Boolean algebras. Abstract topological models of DCAs
present a new view on the nature of space and time and show what happens if we
are abstracting from their metric properties.

field and outflows can exist in the inner regions of an advection-dominated
accretion disc where the resistive diffusion may also be important. In the
present paper, the roles of large-scale magnetic field and outflows in the
structure of resistive advection-dominated accretion discs are explored by
assuming that the accretion flow is radially self-similar. In the non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation, the results show that the angular
velocity is always sub-Keplerian when both the outflow and the large-scale
magnetic field are taken into account. A stronger toroidal field component
leads to faster rotation, while the disc rotates with faster rate if the
vertical field component is weaker. The increase of magnetic diffusivity causes
the infall velocity to be close to Keplerian velocity. Although the previous
studies in the ideal MHD approximation have shown that the disc temperature
decreases due to the vertical field component, we find that the effect of
vertical field component on the temperature of a resistive disc depends on the
magnetic diffusivity. When the magnetic diffusivity is high, the more efficient
mechanism for decreasing the disc temperature can be the outflows, and not the
large-scale magnetic field. In such a limit of the magnetic diffusivity, the
components of the large-scale magnetic field enhance the gas temperature. The
increase of temperature can lead to heating and acceleration of the electrons
and help us to explain the origin of phenomena such as the flares in Sgr A*. On
the other hand, the infall velocity in such a limit rises as the temperature
increases, and therefore the surface density falls to too low values. Any
change in the density profile can alter the structure and the emitted spectrum
of disc.

dynamics are determined by abstract replacement operations on set systems, and
in which the conformal structure of spacetime is represented by a causal graph.
The purpose of this article is to present rigorous mathematical derivations of
many key properties of such models in the continuum limit, as first discussed
in NKS, including the fact that large classes of them obey discrete forms of
both special and general relativity. First, we prove that causal invariance
(namely, the requirement that all causal graphs be isomorphic, irrespective of
the choice of hypergraph updating order) is equivalent to a discrete version of
general covariance, with changes to the updating order corresponding to
discrete gauge transformations. This fact then allows one to deduce a discrete
analog of Lorentz covariance, and the resultant physical consequences of
discrete Lorentz transformations. We also introduce discrete notions of Riemann
and Ricci curvature for hypergraphs, and prove that the correction factor for
the volume of a discrete spacetime cone in a causal graph corresponding to
curved spacetime of fixed dimensionality is proportional to a timelike
projection of the discrete spacetime Ricci tensor, subsequently using this fact
(along with the assumption that the updating rules preserve the dimensionality
of the causal graph in limiting cases) to prove that the most general set of
constraints on the discrete spacetime Ricci tensor corresponds to a discrete
form of the Einstein field equations.

Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\tess) to constrain the planet's true spin-orbit
angle and to explore how KELT-9 b may be influenced by stellar gravity
darkening. We constrain the host star's equatorial radius to be $1.089\pm0.017$
times as large as its polar radius and its local surface brightness to vary by
$\sim38$\% between its hot poles and cooler equator. We model the stellar
oblateness and surface brightness gradient and find that it causes the transit
light curve to lack the usual symmetry around the time of minimum light. We
take advantage of the light curve asymmetry to constrain KELT-9 b's true spin
orbit angle (${87^\circ}^{+10^\circ}_{-11^\circ}$), agreeing with
\citet{gaudi2017giant} that KELT-9 b is in a nearly polar orbit. We also apply
a gravity darkening correction to the spectral energy distribution model from
\citet{gaudi2017giant} and find that accounting for rapid rotation gives a
better fit to available spectroscopy and yields a more reliable estimate for
the star's polar effective temperature.

values, in the limit of number of repetitions of the experiment going to
infinity, converges almost surely to the theoretical predictions which are

fluctuations around the mean. However in practice, we can repeat the experiment
only finitely many times, and hence fluctuations are inevitable, and may lead
to erroneous judgments. It is theoretically possible to teleport an unknown
quantum state, using entanglement, with unit fidelity. The experimentally
achieved values are however sub-unit, and often, significantly so. We show that
when the number of repetitions of the experiment is small, there is significant
probability of achieving a sub-unit experimentally achieved quantum
teleportation fidelity that uses entanglement, even classically, i.e., without
using entanglement. We further show that only when the number of repetitions of
the experiment is of the order of a few thousands, the probability of a
classical teleportation process to reach the currently achieved experimental
quantum teleportation fidelities becomes negligibly small, and hence ensure
that the experimentally obtained fidelities are due to genuine use of the

importance of an exponential-growth prediction bias (EGPB) in understanding why
the COVID-19 outbreak has exploded. The scientific basis for our inquiry is the
well-established fact that disease spread, especially in the initial stages,
follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a
widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. We define
prediction bias as the systematic error arising from faulty prediction of the
number of cases x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data
on the same. Our design permits us to identify the root of this
under-prediction as an EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate
the speed at which exponential processes unfold. Our data reveals that the
""degree of convexity"" reflected in the predicted path of the disease is
significantly and substantially lower than the actual path. The bias is
significantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative
to those at an early stage of disease progression. We find that individuals who
exhibit EGPB are also more likely to reveal markedly reduced compliance with
the WHO-recommended safety measures, find general violations of safety
protocols less alarming, and show greater faith in their government's actions.
A simple behavioral nudge which shows prior data in terms of raw numbers, as
opposed to a graph, causally reduces EGPB. Clear communication of risk via raw
numbers could increase accuracy of risk perception, in turn facilitating
compliance with suggested protective behaviors.

a general framework called Memory Augmented Neural model (MAN). MAN augments a
base neural recommender with a continuously queried and updated nonparametric

combined through another lightweight gating network. We empirically show that
MAN is well-suited for the incremental SR task, and it consistently outperforms

visual navigation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in 3D indoor scenes,
whose navigation task aims to train an agent that can intelligently make a
series of decisions to arrive at a pre-specified target location from any
possible starting positions only based on egocentric views. However, most
navigation methods currently struggle against several challenging problems,
such as data efficiency, automatic obstacle avoidance, and generalization.
Generalization problem means that agent does not have the ability to transfer
navigation skills learned from previous experience to unseen targets and
scenes. To address these issues, we incorporate two designs into classic DRL
framework: attention on 3D knowledge graph (KG) and target skill extension
(TSE) module. On the one hand, our proposed method combines visual features and
3D spatial representations to learn navigation policy. On the other hand, TSE
module is used to generate sub-targets which allow agent to learn from
failures. Specifically, our 3D spatial relationships are encoded through
recently popular graph convolutional network (GCN). Considering the real world
settings, our work also considers open action and adds actionable targets into
conventional navigation situations. Those more difficult settings are applied
to test whether DRL agent really understand its task, navigating environment,
and can carry out reasoning. Our experiments, performed in the AI2-THOR, show
that our model outperforms the baselines in both SR and SPL metrics, and
improves generalization ability across targets and scenes.

Learning and Neuroscience, by computing gradients closely matching those of
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), but with a learning rule local in space.
Given an input $x$ and associated target $y$, EP proceeds in two phases: in the
first phase neurons evolve freely towards a first steady state; in the second
phase output neurons are nudged towards $y$ until they reach a second steady
state. However, in existing implementations of EP, the learning rule is not
local in time: the weight update is performed after the dynamics of the second
phase have converged and requires information of the first phase that is no
longer available physically. In this work, we propose a version of EP named
Continual Equilibrium Propagation (C-EP) where neuron and synapse dynamics
occur simultaneously throughout the second phase, so that the weight update
becomes local in time. Such a learning rule local both in space and time opens
the possibility of an extremely energy efficient hardware implementation of EP.
We prove theoretically that, provided the learning rates are sufficiently
small, at each time step of the second phase the dynamics of neurons and
synapses follow the gradients of the loss given by BPTT (Theorem 1). We
demonstrate training with C-EP on MNIST and generalize C-EP to neural networks
where neurons are connected by asymmetric connections. We show through
experiments that the more the network updates follows the gradients of BPTT,
the best it performs in terms of training. These results bring EP a step closer
to biology by better complying with hardware constraints while maintaining its
intimate link with backpropagation.

  Propagation",,,,,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired alternative algorithm
to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks. It applies to RNNs fed by
a static input x that settle to a steady state, such as Hopfield networks. EP
is similar to BP in that in the second phase of training, an error signal
propagates backwards in the layers of the network, but contrary to BP, the
learning rule of EP is spatially local. Nonetheless, EP suffers from two major
limitations. On the one hand, due to its formulation in terms of real-time
dynamics, EP entails long simulation times, which limits its applicability to
practical tasks. On the other hand, the biological plausibility of EP is
limited by the fact that its learning rule is not local in time: the synapse
update is performed after the dynamics of the second phase have converged and
requires information of the first phase that is no longer available physically.
Our work addresses these two issues and aims at widening the spectrum of EP
from standard machine learning models to more bio-realistic neural networks.
First, we propose a discrete-time formulation of EP which enables to simplify
equations, speed up training and extend EP to CNNs. Our CNN model achieves the
best performance ever reported on MNIST with EP. Using the same discrete-time
formulation, we introduce Continual Equilibrium Propagation (C-EP): the weights
of the network are adjusted continually in the second phase of training using
local information in space and time. We show that in the limit of slow changes
of synaptic strengths and small nudging, C-EP is equivalent to BPTT (Theorem
1). We numerically demonstrate Theorem 1 and C-EP training on MNIST and
generalize it to the bio-realistic situation of a neural network with
asymmetric connections between neurons.

largely applied to facilitate computational simulations of fluid systems.
Rotation symmetry is a general property for most symmetric fluid systems.
However, in general, current machine learning methods have no theoretical way
to guarantee rotational symmetry. By observing an important property of
contraction and rotation operation on high-order symmetric tensors, we prove
that the rotation operation is preserved via tensor contraction. Based on this
theoretical justification, in this paper, we introduce Rotation-Equivariant
Network (RotEqNet) to guarantee the property of rotation-equivariance for
high-order tensors in fluid systems. We implement RotEqNet and evaluate our
claims through four case studies on various fluid systems. The property of
error reduction and rotation-equivariance is verified in these case studies.
Results from the comparative study show that our method outperforms
conventional methods, which rely on data augmentation.

applying machine learning techniques to predict if a piece of legislation (US
bill) has been subjected to lobbying activities or not. We also investigate the
influence of the intensity of the lobbying activity on how discernible a
lobbied bill is from one that was not subject to lobbying. We compare the
performance of a number of different models (logistic regression, random
forest, CNN and LSTM) and text embedding representations (BOW, TF-IDF, GloVe,
Law2Vec). We report results of above 0.85% ROC AUC scores, and 78% accuracy.
Model performance significantly improves (95% ROC AUC, and 88% accuracy) when
bills with higher lobbying intensity are looked at. We also propose a method
that could be used for unlabelled data. Through this we show that there is a
considerably large number of previously unlabelled US bills where our
predictions suggest that some lobbying activity took place. We believe our
method could potentially contribute to the enforcement of the US Lobbying
Disclosure Act (LDA) by indicating the bills that were likely to have been
affected by lobbying but were not filed as such.

nation have experienced an explosive growth in enrollment as computational
skills have proven increasingly important across many domains and in the

program at the University of California, Berkeley has tripled the size of its
graduating class in five years. The first two introductory courses for majors,
each taught by one faculty instructor and several hundred student teachers,
combine to serve nearly 2,900 students per term. This report presents three
strategies that have enabled the effective teaching, delivery, and management
of large-scale CS courses: (1) the development of autograder infrastructure and
online platforms to provide instant feedback with minimal instructor
intervention and deliver the course at scale; (2) the expansion of academic and
social student support networks resulting from changes in teaching assistant
responsibilities and the development of several near-peer mentoring
communities; and (3) the expansion of undergraduate teacher preparation
programs to meet the increased demand for qualified student teachers. These
interventions have helped both introductory and advanced courses address
capacity challenges and expand enrollments while receiving among the highest
student evaluations of teaching in department history. Implications for
inclusivity and diversity are discussed.

Here room-temperature single-source in vacuum deposition of smooth black
$\gamma$ - CsSnI3 thin films is reported. This has been done by fabricating a
solid target by completely solvent-free mixing of CsI and SnI2 powders and
isostatic pressing. By controlled laser ablation of the solid target on an
arbitrary substrate at room temperature, the formation of CsSnI3 thin films
with optimal optical properties is demonstrated. The films present a band gap
of 1.32 eV, a sharp absorption edge and near-infrared photoluminescence
emission. These properties and X-ray diffraction of the thin films confirmed
the formation of the orthorhombic (B-$\gamma$) perovskite phase. The thermal
stability of the phase was ensured by applying in situ an Al2O$_3$ capping
layer. This work demonstrates the potential of pulsed laser deposition as a
volatility-insensitive single-source growth technique of halide perovskites and
