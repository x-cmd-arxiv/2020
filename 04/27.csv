$(X,F)$ such that $F$ is invariant under the action of permutations and
idempotent, i.e., satisfies $F(x,\ldots,x)=x$ for all $x\in X$. We first
provide a structure theorem for these symmetric $n$-ary bands that extends the
classical (strong) semilattice decomposition of certain classes of bands. We
introduce the concept of strong $n$-ary semilattice of $n$-ary semigroups and
we show that the symmetric $n$-ary bands are exactly the strong $n$-ary
semilattices of $n$-ary extensions of Abelian groups whose exponents divide
$n-1$. Finally, we use the structure theorem to obtain necessary and sufficient
conditions for a symmetric $n$-ary band to be reducible to a semigroup.

finding the optimal route in the multi-cost networks. We prove this problem is
NP-hard and the existing index techniques cannot be used to this problem. We
propose a novel partition-based index with contour skyline techniques to find
the optimal route. We propose a vertex-filtering algorithm to facilitate the

  Adaptation","Technical Report",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation (HDA) addresses the transfer learning
problems where data from the source and target domains are of different
modalities (e.g., texts and images) or feature dimensions (e.g., features
extracted with different methods). It is useful for multi-modal data analysis.
Traditional domain adaptation algorithms assume that the representations of
source and target samples reside in the same feature space, hence are likely to
fail in solving the heterogeneous domain adaptation problem. Contemporary
state-of-the-art HDA approaches are usually composed of complex optimization
objectives for favourable performance and are therefore computationally
expensive and less generalizable. To address these issues, we propose a novel
Cross-Domain Structure Preserving Projection (CDSPP) algorithm for HDA. As an
extension of the classic LPP to heterogeneous domains, CDSPP aims to learn
domain-specific projections to map sample features from source and target
domains into a common subspace such that the class consistency is preserved and
data distributions are sufficiently aligned. CDSPP is simple and has
deterministic solutions by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. It is
naturally suitable for supervised HDA but has also been extended for
semi-supervised HDA where the unlabelled target domain samples are available.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on commonly used benchmark datasets
(i.e. Office-Caltech, Multilingual Reuters Collection, NUS-WIDE-ImageNet) for
HDA as well as the Office-Home dataset firstly introduced for HDA by ourselves
due to its significantly larger number of classes than the existing ones (65 vs
10, 6 and 8). The experimental results of both supervised and semi-supervised
HDA demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method against
contemporary state-of-the-art methods.

impressive progress on improving the diversity of generated responses. However,
these methods usually suffer the cost of decreased relevance accompanied by
diversity improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal response
generation framework with exemplar augmentation and curriculum optimization to
enhance relevance and diversity of generated responses. First, unlike existing
VAE-based models that usually approximate a simple Gaussian posterior
distribution, we present a Gaussian mixture posterior distribution (i.e,
multimodal) to further boost response diversity, which helps capture complex
semantics of responses. Then, to ensure that relevance does not decrease while
diversity increases, we fully exploit similar examples (exemplars) retrieved
from the training data into posterior distribution modeling to augment response
relevance. Furthermore, to facilitate the convergence of Gaussian mixture prior
and posterior distributions, we devise a curriculum optimization strategy to
progressively train the model under multiple training criteria from easy to
hard. Experimental results on widely used SwitchBoard and DailyDialog datasets
demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements compared to strong
baselines in terms of diversity and relevance.

the limited receptive field size of CNN. Besides, simple representations using
rectangle or quadrangle bounding boxes fall short when dealing with more
challenging arbitrary-shaped texts. In addition, the scale of text instances
varies greatly which leads to the difficulty of accurate prediction through a
single segmentation network. To address these problems, we innovatively propose
a two-stage segmentation based arbitrary text detector named \textit{NASK}
(\textbf{N}eed \textbf{A} \textbf{S}econd loo\textbf{K}). Specifically,
\textit{NASK} consists of a Text Instance Segmentation network namely
\textit{TIS} (\(1^{st}\) stage), a Text RoI Pooling module and a Fiducial pOint
eXpression module termed as \textit{FOX} (\(2^{nd}\) stage). Firstly,
\textit{TIS} conducts instance segmentation to obtain rectangle text proposals
with a proposed Group Spatial and Channel Attention module (\textit{GSCA}) to
augment the feature expression. Then, Text RoI Pooling transforms these
rectangles to the fixed size. Finally, \textit{FOX} is introduced to
reconstruct text instances with a more tighter representation using the
predicted geometrical attributes including text center line, text line
orientation, character scale and character orientation. Experimental results on
two public benchmarks including \textit{Total-Text} and \textit{SCUT-CTW1500}

XMM-Newton observations of PDS 456; one in September 2018 where the quasar was
bright and featureless, and two in September 2019, 22 days apart, occurring
when the quasar was five times fainter and where strong blue-shifted lines from
the wind were present. During the second September 2019 observation, three
broad ($\sigma=3000$ km s$^{-1}$) absorption lines were resolved in the high
resolution RGS spectrum, which are identified with blue-shifted OVIII
Ly$\alpha$, NeIX He$\alpha$ and NeX Ly$\alpha$. The outflow velocity of this
soft X-ray absorber was found to be $v/c=-0.258\pm0.003$, fully consistent with
iron K absorber with $v/c=-0.261\pm0.007$. The ionization parameter and column
density of the soft X-ray component ($\log\xi=3.4$, $N_{\rm H}=2\times10^{21}$
cm$^{-2}$) outflow was lower by about two orders of magnitude, when compared to
the high ionization wind at iron K ($\log\xi=5$, $N_{\rm H}=7\times10^{23}$

the 2019 observations, declining from $N_{\rm H}=10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $N_{\rm
H}=10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ over 20 days, while the iron K component was remarkably
stable. We conclude that the soft X-ray wind may originate from an
inhomogeneous wind streamline passing across the line of sight and which due to
its lower ionization, is located further from the black hole, on parsec scales,
than the innermost disk wind.

has been frequently used to improve the training of deep neural networks
(DNNs). While such a practice has been studied as a way to leverage privileged
information about the distribution of the data, a well-trained learner with
soft classification outputs should be first obtained as a prior to generate
such privileged information. To solve such chicken-egg problem, we propose
COLAM framework that Co-Learns DNNs and soft labels through Alternating
Minimization of two objectives - (a) the training loss subject to soft labels
and (b) the objective to learn improved soft labels - in one end-to-end
training procedure. We performed extensive experiments to compare our proposed
method with a series of baselines. The experiment results show that COLAM
achieves improved performance on many tasks with better testing classification
accuracy. We also provide both qualitative and quantitative analyses that
explain why COLAM works well.

mitigate the spread of disease, or not. Mitigating the spread of disease
requires an individual to change their routine behaviours to benefit others,
resulting in a 'disease dilemma' similar to the seminal prisoner's dilemma. In
the classical prisoner's dilemma, evolutionary game dynamics predict that all
individuals evolve to 'defect.' We have discovered that when the rate of
cooperation within a population is directly linked to the rate of spread of the
disease, cooperation evolves under certain conditions. For diseases which do
not confer immunity to recovered individuals, if the time scale at which
individuals receive information is sufficiently rapid compared to the time
scale at which the disease spreads, then cooperation emerges. Moreover, in the
limit as mitigation measures become increasingly effective, the disease can be
controlled, and the rate of infections tends to zero. Our model is based on
theoretical mathematics and therefore unconstrained to any single context. For
example, the disease spreading model considered here could also be used to
describe social and group dynamics. In this sense, we may have discovered a
fundamental and novel mechanism for the evolution of cooperation in a broad
sense.

astronomy research. Few fields explicitly teach students the skills to analyze
datasets, and yet the increasing push for authentic science implies these
skills should be taught.
  Purpose: The overarching motivation is to understand learning of dataset
skills within an astronomy context. Specifically, when participants work with a
200-entry Google Sheets dataset of astronomical data about quasars, what are
they learning, how are they learning it, and who is doing the learning?
  Sample: The authors studied a matched set of participants (n=87) consisting
of 54 university undergraduate students (34 male, 18 female), and 33 science
educators (16 male, 17 female).
  Design and methods: Participants explored a three-phase dataset activity and
were given an eight-question multiple-choice pre/post-test covering skills of
analyzing datasets and astronomy content, with questions spanning Bloom's
Taxonomy. Pre/post-test scores were compared and a t-test performed for
subsamples by population.
  Results: Participants exhibited learning of both dataset skills and astronomy
content, indicating that dataset skills can be learned through this astronomy
activity. Participants exhibited gains in both recall and synthesis questions,
indicating learning is non-sequential. Female undergraduate students exhibited
lower levels of learning than other populations.
  Conclusions: Implications of the study include a stronger dataset focus in
post-secondary STEM education and among science educators, and the need for
further investigation into how instructors can ameliorate the challenges faced
by female undergraduate students.

single picture of a target (one-shot) and a video of a driving subject.
Existing facial reenactment methods suffer from identity mismatch and produce
inconsistent identities when a target and a driving subject are different
(cross-subject), especially in one-shot settings. In this work, we aim to
address identity preservation in cross-subject portrait reenactment from a
single picture. We introduce a novel technique that can disentangle identity
from expressions and poses, allowing identity preserving portrait reenactment
even when the driver's identity is very different from that of the target. This
is achieved by a novel landmark disentanglement network (LD-Net), which
predicts personalized facial landmarks that combine the identity of the target
with expressions and poses from a different subject. To handle portrait
reenactment from unseen subjects, we also introduce a feature dictionary-based
generative adversarial network (FD-GAN), which locally translates 2D landmarks
into a personalized portrait, enabling one-shot portrait reenactment under
large pose and expression variations. We validate the effectiveness of our
identity disentangling capabilities via an extensive ablation study, and our
method produces consistent identities for cross-subject portrait reenactment.
Our comprehensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art single-image facial reenactment methods. We will release
our code and models for academic use.

Dynamic excitatory--inhibitory balance is a plausible mechanism that generates
such irregular activity, but it remains unclear how balance is achieved and
maintained in plastic neural networks. In particular, it is not fully
understood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in
turn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How does the dynamics
of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does
correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of
weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address
these questions, we develop a general theory of plasticity in balanced
networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity
induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly, but
significantly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain
plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and
synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable
manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the
initial state of the network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also
describe the dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons
receive targeted optogenetic input.

hardware and software limitations on constrained host platforms where the

coronavirus ever identified for the third time in the three decades capable of
infecting not only the animals but also the humans across the globe. Nearly
6000 deaths have been recorded due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak worldwide and
more than 50% of these deaths appeared to have evolved from China where the
virus was thought to originate. The endemicity of COVID-19 dramatically
surpassed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that were so far discovered in
2003 and 2012 respectively. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak not only a public health emergency but also
pandemic in nature. Currently, over 120 countries including Nigeria were
reported to have more than 157,844 confirmed cases and 5,846 deaths due mainly
to COVID-19 outbreak as of March 15, 2020, 10:55 GMT. Artificial Intelligence
(AI) is widely used to aid in the prediction, detection, response, recovery of
disease and making clinical diagnosis. In this study, we highlighted the power
of AI in the containment and mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 outbreak in
African countries such as Nigeria where human to human contact is apparently
inevitable.

  colorimetric","4 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previously, a method has been developed to find the best colour filter for a
given camera which results in the new effective camera sensitivities that best
meet the Luther condition. That is, the new sensitivities are approximately
linearly related to the XYZ colour matching functions. However, with no
constraint, the filter derived from this Luther-condition based optimisation
can be rather non-smooth and transmit very little light which are impractical
for fabrication.
  In this paper, we extend the Luther-condition filter optimisation method to
allow us to incorporate both the smoothness and transmittance bounds of the
recovered filter which are key practical concerns. Experiments demonstrate that
we can find physically realisable filters which are smooth and reasonably
transmissive with which the effective ""camera+filter"" becomes significantly
more colorimetric.

insertions and membership queries, i.e., testing if a given element is in the
set. A data structure that computes exact answers is called a dictionary. When
a (small) false positive rate $\epsilon$ is allowed, the data structure is
called a filter.
  The space usages of the standard dictionaries or filters usually depend on
the upper bound on the size of $S$, while the actual set can be much smaller.
  Pagh, Segev and Wieder (FOCS'13) were the first to study filters with varying
space usage based on the current $|S|$. They showed in order to match the space
with the current set size $n=|S|$, any filter data structure must use
$(1-o(1))n(\log(1/\epsilon)+(1-O(\epsilon))\log\log n)$ bits, in contrast to
the well-known lower bound of $N\log(1/\epsilon)$ bits, where $N$ is an upper
bound on $|S|$. They also presented a data structure with almost optimal space
of $(1+o(1))n(\log(1/\epsilon)+O(\log\log n))$ bits provided that
$n>u^{0.001}$, with expected amortized constant insertion time and worst-case
constant lookup time.
  In this work, we present a filter data structure with improvements in two
aspects:
  - it has constant worst-case time for all insertions and lookups with high
probability;
  - it uses space $(1+o(1))n(\log (1/\epsilon)+\log\log n)$ bits when
$n>u^{0.001}$, achieving optimal leading constant for all $\epsilon=o(1)$.
  We also present a dictionary that uses $(1+o(1))n\log(u/n)$ bits of space,
matching the optimal space in terms of the current size, and performs all
operations in constant time with high probability.

image quality and secret message un-detectability. The first step is a
preprocessing algorithm that reduces the size of secret images without losing
information. This results in improved stego image quality compared to other
existing image steganography methods. The proposed secret image size reduction
(SISR) algorithm is an efficient spatial domain technique. The second step is
an embedding mechanism that relies on Fibonacci representation of pixel
intensities to minimize the effect of embedding on the stego image quality. The
improvement is attained by using bit-plane(s) mapping instead of bit-plane(s)
replacement for embedding. The proposed embedding mechanism outperforms the
binary based LSB randomly embedding in two ways: reduced effect on stego
quality and increased robustness against statistical steganalysers.
Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme in terms
of: 1) SISR ratio (indirectly results in increased capacity); 2) quality of the
stego; and 3) robustness against steganalysers such as RS, and WS. Furthermore,
experimental results show that the proposed SISR algorithm can be extended to
be applicable on DICOM standard medical images. Future security standardization
research is proposed that would focus on evaluating the security, performance,
and effectiveness of steganography algorithms.

blending hollow glass micro balloons (GMB) with high density polyethylene
(HDPE). To that end, lightweight feedstock for printing syntactic foam
composites is developed. The blend for this is prepared by varying GMB content
(20, 40, and 60 volume %) in HDPE for filament extrusion, which is subsequently
used for three-dimensional printing (3DP). The rheological properties and the
melt flow index (MFI) of blends are investigated for identifying suitable
printing parameters. It is observed that the storage and loss modulus, as well
as complex viscosity, increases with increasing GMB content, whereas MFI
decreases. Further, the coefficient of thermal expansion of HDPE and foam
filaments decreases with increasing GMB content, thereby lowering the thermal
stresses in prints, which promotes the reduction in warpage. The mechanical
properties of filaments are determined by subjecting them to tensile tests,
whereas 3D printed samples are tested under tensile and flexure tests. The
tensile modulus of the filament increases with increasing GMB content (8-47%)
as compared to HDPE and exhibit comparable filament strength. 3D printed foams
show higher specific tensile and flexural modulus as compared to neat HDPE,
making them suitable candidate materials for weight sensitive applications.
HDPE having 60% by volume GMB exhibited the highest modulus and is 48.02%
higher than the printed HDPE. Finally, the property map reveals higher modulus
and comparable strength against injection and compression molded foams. Printed
foam registered 1.8 times higher modulus than molded samples. Hence, 3D printed
foams have the potential for replacing components processed through
conventional manufacturing processes that have limitations on geometrically
complex designs, lead time, and associated costs.

two examples of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and a water-dominated
atmosphere. We then simulate the infrared transmission spectra of these
atmospheres for JWST instrument modes optimized for transit observation of
exoplanet atmospheres : NIRISS, NIRSpec and MIRI. We then predict the
observability of each exoplanet's atmosphere. TOI-270c and d are excellent
targets for detecting atmospheres with JWST transmission spectroscopy,
requiring only 1 transit observation with NIRISS, NIRSpec and MIRI; higher
signal-to-noise (SNR) can be obtained for a clear H-rich atmosphere. Fewer than
3 transits with NIRISS and NIRSpec may be enough to reveal molecular features.
Water-dominated atmospheres require more transits. Water spectral features in
water-dominated atmospheres may be detectable with NIRISS in 2 or 3 transits.
We find that the detection of spectral features in a cloudy, H-rich atmosphere
does not require integrations as long as those required for the water-dominated
atmosphere, which is consistent with the differences in atmospheric mean
molecular weight. TOI-270c and d could be prime targets for JWST transit
observations of sub-Neptune atmospheres. These results provide useful
predictions for observers who may propose to use JWST to detect and
characterize the TOI-270 planet atmospheres.

phenomena in promising applications spanning from physics, chemistry, biology,
to materials science and engineering. The long range electrostatic interactions
between charged particles constitute a prominent factor in determining
structures and states of model systems. How to efficiently calculate
electrostatic interactions in model systems subjected to partial or full
periodic boundary conditions has been a grand challenging task. In the past
decades, a large variety of computational schemes have been proposed, among
which the Ewald summation method is the most reliable route to accurately deal
with electrostatic interactions in model systems. In addition, extensive effort
has been done to improve computational efficiency of the Ewald summation based
methods. Representative examples are approaches based on cutoffs, reaction
fields, multi-poles, multi-grids, and particle-mesh schemes. We sketched an
ENUF method, an abbreviation for the Ewald summation method based on
Non-Uniform fast Fourier transform technique, and have implemented this method
in particle-based simulation packages to calculate electrostatic energies and
forces at micro- and mesoscopic levels. Extensive computational studies of
conformational properties of polyelectrolytes, dendrimer-membrane complexes,
and ionic fluids demonstrated that the ENUF method and its derivatives conserve
both energy and momentum to floating point accuracy, and exhibit a
computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ with optimal physical
parameters. These ENUF based methods are attractive alternatives in molecular
simulations where high accuracy and efficiency of simulation methods are needed
to accelerate calculations of electrostatic interactions at extended
spatiotemporal scales.

valid chemical reactions at every time step of the iterative virtual multi-step

highly challenging test-bed for RL algorithms owing to the large state space

achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating structures with high QED

between the expresso shot in a glass of milk and the milk itself. Xue et al.
(Nat. Commun., vol. 8, 2017, pp. 1-6) showed that the injection velocity of
expresso determines the depth of coffee-milk mixture. After a while when a
stable stratification forms in the mixture, the layering process can be
modelled as a double diffusive convection system with a stably-stratified
coffee-milk mixture cooled from the side. More specifically, we perform
(two-dimensional) direct numerical simulations of laterally cooled double
diffusive convection for a wide parameter range, where the convective flow is
driven by a lateral temperature gradient while stabilized by a vertical
concentration gradient. When the thermal driving force dominates over the
stabilizing force, the flow behaves like vertical convection in which a
large-scale circulation develops. However, with increasing strength of the
stabilizing force, a meta-stable layered regime emerges. Initially, several
vertically-stacked convection rolls develop, and these well-mixed layers are
separated by sharp interfaces with large concentration gradients. The initial
thickness of these emerging layers can be estimated by balancing the work
exerted by thermal driving and the required potential energy to bring fluid out
of its equilibrium position in the stably stratified fluid. In the layered
regime, we further observe successive layer merging, and eventually only a
single convection roll remains. We elucidate the following merging mechanism:
As weakened circulation leads to accumulation of hot fluid adjacent to the hot
sidewall, larger buoyancy forces associated with hotter fluid eventually break
the layer interface. Then two layers merge into a larger layer, and circulation
establishes again within the merged structure.

structures that arise naturally in numerous domains and applications and are
used to represent ordered relations between entities in the domains. Examples
are task dependencies in a project plan, transaction order in distributed
ledgers and execution sequences of tasks in computer programs, just to mention
a few. We study the problem of order preserving hierarchical clustering of this
kind of ordered data. That is, if we have $a < b$ in the original data and
denote their respective clusters by $[a]$ and $[b]$, then we shall have $[a] <
[b]$ in the produced clustering. The clustering is similarity based and uses
standard linkage functions, such as single- and complete linkage, and is an
extension of classical hierarchical clustering.
  To achieve this, we define the output from running classical hierarchical
clustering on strictly ordered data to be partial dendrograms; sub-trees of
classical dendrograms with several connected components. We then construct an
embedding of partial dendrograms over a set into the family of ultrametrics
over the same set. An optimal hierarchical clustering is defined as the partial
dendrogram corresponding to the ultrametric closest to the original
dissimilarity measure, measured in the p-norm. Thus, the method is a
combination of classical hierarchical clustering and ultrametric fitting.
  A reference implementation is employed for experiments on both synthetic
random data and real world data from a database of machine parts. When compared
to existing methods, the experiments show that our method excels both in
cluster quality and order preservation.

of proposed product changes. However, given that marketplaces are inherently
connected, total average treatment effect estimates obtained through Bernoulli
randomized experiments are often biased due to violations of the stable unit
treatment value assumption. This can be particularly problematic for
experiments that impact sellers' strategic choices, affect buyers' preferences
over items in their consideration set, or change buyers' consideration sets
altogether. In this work, we measure and reduce bias due to interference in
online marketplace experiments by using observational data to create clusters
of similar listings, and then using those clusters to conduct
cluster-randomized field experiments. We provide a lower bound on the magnitude
of bias due to interference by conducting a meta-experiment that randomizes
over two experiment designs: one Bernoulli randomized, one cluster randomized.
In both meta-experiment arms, treatment sellers are subject to a different
platform fee policy than control sellers, resulting in different prices for
buyers. By conducting a joint analysis of the two meta-experiment arms, we find
a large and statistically significant difference between the total average
treatment effect estimates obtained with the two designs, and estimate that
32.60% of the Bernoulli-randomized treatment effect estimate is due to
interference bias. We also find weak evidence that the magnitude and/or
direction of interference bias depends on extent to which a marketplace is
supply- or demand-constrained, and analyze a second meta-experiment to
highlight the difficulty of detecting interference bias when treatment
interventions require intention-to-treat analysis.

transparency and accountability. Furthermore, some parliaments are bringing old
paper transcripts to semi-structured digital formats. However, these records
are often only provided as raw text or even as images, with little to no

adaptively (looking at past results) which groups to test next, with the goal
to converge to a good detection, as quickly, and with as few tests as possible.
We cast this problem as a Bayesian sequential experimental design problem.
Using the posterior distribution of infection status vectors for $n$ patients,
given observed tests carried out so far, we seek to form groups that have a
maximal utility. We consider utilities such as mutual information, but also
quantities that have a more direct relevance to testing, such as the AUC of the
ROC curve of the test. Practically, the posterior distributions on $\{0,1\}^n$
are approximated by sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers and the utility
maximized by a greedy optimizer. Our procedures show in simulations significant
improvements over both adaptive and non-adaptive baselines, and are far more
efficient than individual tests when disease prevalence is low. Additionally,
we show empirically that loopy belief propagation (LBP), widely regarded as the
SoTA decoder to decide whether an individual is infected or not given previous
tests, can be unreliable and exhibit oscillatory behavior. Our SMC decoder is
more reliable, and can improve the performance of other group testing
algorithms.

ultraviolet spectrograph conducted a series of observations that detected
emissions from both the interplanetary medium (IPM) and Pluto. In the direction
of Pluto, the IPM was found to be 133.4$\pm$0.6R at Lyman $\alpha$,
0.24$\pm$0.02R at Lyman $\beta$, and <0.10R at He I 584{\AA}. We analyzed
3,900s of data obtained shortly before closest approach to Pluto and detect
airglow emissions from H I, N I, N II, N$_2$, and CO above the disk of Pluto.
We find Pluto's brightness at Lyman $\alpha$ to be $29.3\pm1.9$R, in good
agreement with pre-encounter estimates. The detection of the N II multiplet at
1085{\AA} marks the first direct detection of ions in Pluto's atmosphere. We do
not detect any emissions from noble gasses and place a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of
0.14 R on the brightness of the Ar I 1048{\AA} line. We compare pre-encounter
model predictions and predictions from our own airglow model, based on
atmospheric profiles derived from the solar occultation observed by New
Horizons, to the observed brightness of Pluto's airglow. Although completely
opaque at Lyman $\alpha$, Pluto's atmosphere is optically thin at wavelengths
longer than 1425{\AA}. Consequently, a significant amount of solar FUV light
reaches the surface, where it can participate in space weathering processes.
From the brightness of sunlight reflected from Pluto, we find the surface has a

first detection of an C$_3$ hydrocarbon molecule, methylacetylene, in

generalizing the ""self-consistency procedure"" of Wheatland & Regnier (2009). In
that procedure, the inconsistency is resolved by an iterative process of
constructing two solutions based on the values of the force-free parameter
alpha on the two polarities of the field in the boundary (the P and N
polarities), and taking uncertainty-weighted averages of the boundary alpha
values in the P and N solutions. When the alpha values in the P and N regions
are very different, the self-consistent solution may lose high alpha values
from the boundary conditions. We show how, by altering the weighting of the
uncertainties in the P or N boundary conditions, we can preserve high alpha
values in the self-consistent solution. The weighted self-consistent
extrapolation method is demonstrated on an analytic bipole field and applied to

As a population of bursts of the repeating FRB absorbed by the synchrotron
nebula, the energy distribution of electrons in the nebula will change
significantly. As a result, the spectrum of the nebula will show a hump
steadily. For the persistent emission of FRB 121102, the total energy of bursts
injecting into the nebula is required to be about
$3.3\times10^{49}\,\unit{erg}$, the burst injection age is over $6.7\times
10^4\,\unit{yr}$, the nebula size is $\sim0.02\,\unit{pc}$, and the electron
number is about $3.2\times10^{55}$. We predict that as more bursts inject, the
brightness of the nebula would be brighter than the current observation, and
meanwhile, the peak frequency would become higher. Due to the synchrotron
absorption of the nebula, some low-frequency bursts would be absorbed, which
may explain why most bursts were detected above $\sim1~\unit{GHz}$.

interpretability research has focused on image processing techniques.
Comparatively, less attention has been paid to interpreting deep learning

highly sequential domains such as natural language processing and physiological

distribution function for an ideal gas with a finite number of point particles
and its $q$-index are analytically determined. The two-particle correlation
function is also derived. The degree of correlation diminishes continuously
with the growth of the number of particles. The ideal finite gas system is
usually correlated, becomes less correlated when the number of particles grows,
and is finally, fully uncorrelated when the molecular chaos regime is reached.

on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas,
e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a

find that the flatband is isolated from other dispersive bands and the light
can still be localized even with the perturbation from the group velocity
dispersion of the waveguide. Our work points out a route towards manipulating
the localization performance of a wavepacket of light along both the spatial
dimension and the frequency dimension, which holds the potential implication
for controlling the storage of optical information in dispersive materials.

realizing the holographic display. The numerical aperture (NA) of digital
hologram other than a pixel specification has been known to determine the
angular field extent of image. Here, we provide a valid foundation for the
dependence of viewing angle on the hologram numerical aperture by investigating
mathematically the internal structure of the sampled point spread function
showing a self-similarity of its modulating curves. The enhanced-NA Fresnel
hologram reconstructs the images at a viewing angle larger than a diffraction
angle by a hologram pixel pitch where its angle value is expressed in terms of
the NA of whole hologram aperture, which is systematically observed by optical
hologram imaging. Finally, we found that the aliased replica noises generated
in the enhanced-NA Fresnel diffraction regime are effectively suppressed within
the diffraction scope by a digitized pixel. This characteristic enables us to
overcome the image reduction and to remove the interference of high-order
images, which leads to the wide viewing-angle holographic display. Optical
experiments are shown to be consistent with the results of numerical
simulation.

gravitational degrees of freedom and that does not have an Einstein frame.
According to the classification in JCAP 01 (2019) 017 [arXiv:1810.01047
[gr-qc]], this is a type-II minimally modified gravity theory. The theory is
characterized by the gravitational constant $G_{\rm N}$ and a function
$V(\phi)$ of a non-dynamical auxiliary field $\phi$ that plays the role of dark
energy. Once one fixes a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, the
form of $V(\phi)$ is determined and the theory no longer possesses a free
parameter or a free function, besides $G_{\rm N}$. For $V'(\phi) = 0$ the
theory reduces to general relativity (GR) with $G_N$ being the Newton's
constant and $V=const.$ being the cosmological constant. For $V'(\phi) \ne 0$,
it is shown that gravity behaves differently from GR but that GR with $G_{\rm
N}$ being the Newton's constant is recovered for weak gravity at distance and
time scales sufficiently shorter than the scale associated with $V(\phi)$.
Therefore this theory provides the simplest framework of cosmology in which
deviations from GR can be tested by observational data.

the geometry of the resulting posterior distribution and can be prohibitively
slow. An alternative is to use a Laplace approximation to marginalize out the
latent Gaussian variables and then integrate out the remaining hyperparameters
using dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo sampler. To implement this scheme efficiently, we derive a novel adjoint
method that propagates the minimal information needed to construct the gradient
of the approximate marginal likelihood. This strategy yields a scalable
differentiation method that is orders of magnitude faster than state of the art
differentiation techniques when the hyperparameters are high dimensional. We
prototype the method in the probabilistic programming framework Stan and test
the utility of the embedded Laplace approximation on several models, including
one where the dimension of the hyperparameter is $\sim$6,000. Depending on the
cases, the benefits can include an alleviation of the geometric pathologies
that frustrate Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and a dramatic speed-up.

optimization problems with positive variables that become convex when the
variables, objective functions, and constraint functions are replaced with
their logs. We focus specifically on LLCPs generated by disciplined geometric
programming, a grammar consisting of a set of atomic functions with known
log-log curvature and a composition rule for combining them. We represent a
parametrized LLCP as the composition of a smooth transformation of parameters,
a convex optimization problem, and an exponential transformation of the convex
optimization problem's solution. The derivative of this composition can be
computed efficiently, using recently developed methods for differentiating
through convex optimization problems. We implement our method in CVXPY, a
Python-embedded modeling language and rewriting system for convex optimization.
In just a few lines of code, a user can specify a parametrized LLCP, solve it,
and evaluate the derivative or its adjoint at a vector. This makes it possible
to conduct sensitivity analyses of solutions, given perturbations to the
parameters, and to compute the gradient of a function of the solution with
respect to the parameters. We use the adjoint of the derivative to implement
differentiable log-log convex optimization layers in PyTorch and TensorFlow.

capable of dynamically adapting its fuzzy sets to reflect the changes in the
stochastic process based on the residual errors, without the need to retraining
the model. This method can handle non-stationary and heteroskedastic data as
well as scenarios with concept-drift. The proposed approach allows the model to
be trained only once and remain useful long after while keeping reasonable
accuracy. The flexibility of the method by means of computational experiments
was tested with eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several
kinds of concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ, SP500 and

expressivity and ability to handle intractably large Hilbert spaces. In
particular, methods based on variational Monte Carlo have proven to be
successful in describing the physics of bosonic systems such as the
Bose-Hubbard (BH) model. However, this technique has not been systematically
tested on the parameter space of the BH model, particularly at the boundary
between the Mott insulator and superfluid phases. In this work, we evaluate the
capabilities of variational Monte Carlo with a trial wavefunction given by a
Restricted Boltzmann Machine to reproduce the quantum ground state of the BH
model on several points of its parameter space. To benchmark the technique, we
compare its results to the ground state found through exact diagonalization for
small one-dimensional chains. In general, we find that the learned ground state
correctly estimates many observables, reproducing to a high degree the phase
diagram for the first Mott lobe and part of the second one. However, we find
that the technique is challenged whenever the system transitions between
excitation manifolds, as the ground state is not learned correctly at these
boundaries. We improve the quality of the results produced by the technique by
proposing a method to discard noisy probabilities learned in the ground state.

momentum space. The realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect provided
conclusive evidence for the intrinsic mechanism of the AH effect in magnetic
topological insulators (TIs). Here we fabricated magnetic TI/TI
heterostructures and found both the magnitude and sign of the AH effect in the
magnetic TI layer can be altered by tuning the TI thickness and/or the electric
gate voltage. The sign change of the AH effect with increasing TI thickness is
attributed to the charge transfer across the TI and magnetic TI layers,
consistent with first-principles calculations. By fabricating the magnetic
TI/TI/magnetic TI sandwich heterostructures with different dopants, we created
an artificial topological Hall (TH) effect-like feature in Hall traces. This
artificial TH effect is induced by the superposition of two AH effects with
opposite signs instead of the formation of chiral spin textures in the samples.
Our study provides a new route to engineer the Berry curvature in magnetic
topological materials that may lead to potential technological applications.

federated learning, and propose a framework, Anti-GAN, to prevent attackers
from learning the real distribution of the victim's data. The core idea of
Anti-GAN is to corrupt the visual features of the victim's private training
images, such that the images restored by the attacker are indistinguishable to
human eyes. Specifically, in Anti-GAN, the victim first projects the personal
dataset onto a GAN's generator, then mixes the fake images generated by the
generator with the real images to obtain the training dataset, which will be
fed into the federated model for training. We redesign the structure of the
victim's GAN to encourage it to learn the classification features (instead of
the visual features) of the real images. We further introduce an unsupervised
task to the GAN model for obfuscating the visual features of the generated
images. The experiments demonstrate that Anti-GAN can effectively prevent the
attacker from learning the distribution of the private images, meanwhile
causing little harm to the accuracy of the federated model.

$P^{(\ell)}_{{\rm h}E}$), and those of the auto-power spectrum of the $E$ mode,
$P^{(\ell)}_{EE}(k)$, based on the $E$/$B$-mode decomposition. The IA power
spectra have non-vanishing amplitudes over the linear to nonlinear scales, and
the large-scale amplitudes at $k\lesssim 0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ are related to
the matter power spectrum via a constant coefficient ($A_{\rm IA}$), similar to
the linear bias parameter of galaxy or halo density field. We find that the
cross- and auto-power spectra $P_{\delta E}$ and $P_{EE}$ at nonlinear scales,
$k\gtrsim 0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, show different $k$-dependences relative to the
matter power spectrum, suggesting a violation of the nonlinear alignment model
commonly used to model contaminations of cosmic shear signals. The IA power
spectra exhibit baryon acoustic oscillations, and vary with halo samples of
different masses, redshifts and cosmological parameters ($\Omega_{\rm m},
S_8$). The cumulative signal-to-noise ratio for the IA power spectra is about
60% of that for the halo density power spectrum, where the super-sample
covariance is found to give a significant contribution to the total covariance.
Thus our results demonstrate that the IA power spectra of galaxy shapes,

transition: in the entire high temperature regime of the model, a Quantitative
Arrow's Theorem holds showing that the probability of paradox for any voting
rule satisfying the axioms is non-negligible; this is tight because the
probability of paradox under pairwise majority goes to zero when approaching
the critical temperature, and becomes exponentially small in the number of
voters beyond it. We prove this occurs in another natural model of correlated
voters and conjecture this phenomena is quite general.

functions and equipped with many sensors, which in turn brings broad attack
surface. Moreover, the execution environment of ADVs is often open and complex.
Hence, ADVs are always at risk of safety and security threats. This paper
proposes a fast method called Multi-IF, using multiple invocation features of
system calls to detect anomalies in self-driving systems. Since self-driving
functions take most of the computation resources and upgrade frequently,
Multi-IF is designed to work under such resource constraints and support
frequent updates. Given the collected sequences of system calls, the
combination of different syntax patterns is used to analyze and construct
feature vectors of those sequences. By taking the feature vectors as inputs,
one-class support vector machine is adopted to determine whether the current
sequence of system calls is abnormal, which is trained with the feature vectors
from the normal sequences. The evaluations on both simulated and real data
prove that the proposed method is effective in identifying the abnormal
behavior after minutes of feature extraction and training. Further comparisons
with the existing methods on the ADFA-LD data set also validate that the
proposed approach achieves a higher accuracy with less time overhead.

approximate a model's posterior on latent variables by combining the amortized

strong autoregressive decoders, VAE often converges to a degenerated local
optimum known as ""posterior collapse"". Previous approaches consider the
Kullback Leibler divergence (KL) individual for each datapoint. We propose to
let the KL follow a distribution across the whole dataset, and analyze that it
is sufficient to prevent posterior collapse by keeping the expectation of the

simple but effective approach to set a lower bound of the expectation by
regularizing the distribution of the approximate posterior's parameters.
Without introducing any new model component or modifying the objective, our
approach can avoid the posterior collapse effectively and efficiently. We
further show that the proposed BN-VAE can be extended to conditional VAE
(CVAE). Empirically, our approach surpasses strong autoregressive baselines on
language modeling, text classification and dialogue generation, and rivals more
complex approaches while keeping almost the same training time as VAE.

is motivated by the recent interest in adopting coarse quantization in massive
MIMO systems--as an effective way to scale down the hardware complexity and
energy consumption. Classical MIMO detection techniques consider unquantized
observations, and many of them are not applicable to the one-bit MIMO case. We
develop a new non-convex optimization algorithm for the one-bit ML MIMO
detection problem, using a strategy called homotopy optimization. The idea is
to transform the ML problem into a sequence of approximate problems, from easy
(convex) to hard (close to ML), and with each problem being a gradual
modification of its previous. Then, our attempt is to iteratively trace the
solution path of these approximate problems. This homotopy algorithm is well
suited to the application of deep unfolding, a recently popular approach for
turning certain model-based algorithms into data-driven, and performance
enhanced, ones. While our initial focus is on one-bit MIMO detection, the
proposed technique also applies naturally to the classical unquantized MIMO
detection. We performed extensive simulations and show that the proposed
homotopy algorithms, both non-deep and deep, have satisfactory bit-error
probability performance compared to many state-of-the-art algorithms. Also, the
deep homotopy algorithm has attractively low computational complexity.

parameters must be carefully set. However, little attention has been given on
how to set these values in an online manner. In this article we suggest two
novel procedures that address this issue.
  The core part of the procedures is to estimate the current tracking mean
squared error (MSE). The MSE is decomposed in tracking variance and bias and
novel and efficient procedures to estimate these quantities are presented. It
is shown that estimation bias can be tracked by associating it with the portion
of observations below the quantile estimates.
  The first procedure runs an ensemble of $L$ quantile estimators for wide
range of values of the tuning parameters and typically around $L = 100$. In
each iteration an oracle selects the best estimate by the guidance of the
estimated MSEs. The second method only runs an ensemble of $L = 3$ estimators
and thus the values of the tuning parameters need from time to time to be
adjusted for the running estimators. The procedures have a low memory foot
print of $8L$ and a computational complexity of $8L$ per iteration.
  The experiments show that the procedures are highly efficient and track
quantiles with an error close to the theoretical optimum. The Oracle approach
performs best, but comes with higher computational cost. The procedures were
further applied to a massive real-life data stream of tweets and proofed real
world applicability of them.

disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on chest X-rays, which is urgently demanded

COVID-19 from chest X-rays is still a globally recognized challenge because of
two bottlenecks: 1) imaging features of COVID-19 share some similarities with
other pneumonia on chest X-rays, and 2) the misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 is
very high, and the misdiagnosis cost is expensive. While a few pioneering works
have made much progress, they underestimate both crucial bottlenecks. In this
paper, we report our solution, discriminative cost-sensitive learning (DCSL),
which should be the choice if the clinical needs the assisted screening of
COVID-19 from chest X-rays. DCSL combines both advantages from fine-grained
classification and cost-sensitive learning. Firstly, DCSL develops a
conditional center loss that learns deep discriminative representation.
Secondly, DCSL establishes score-level cost-sensitive learning that can
adaptively enlarge the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 examples into other
classes. DCSL is so flexible that it can apply in any deep neural network. We
collected a large-scale multi-class dataset comprised of 2,239 chest X-ray
examples: 239 examples from confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,000 examples with
confirmed bacterial or viral pneumonia cases, and 1,000 examples of healthy
people. Extensive experiments on the three-class classification show that our
algorithm remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. It achieves an

  (NTIRE)",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, image enhancement and restoration have become important
applications on mobile devices, such as super-resolution and image deblurring.
However, most state-of-the-art networks present extremely high computational
complexity. This makes them difficult to be deployed on mobile devices with
acceptable latency. Moreover, when deploying to different mobile devices, there
is a large latency variation due to the difference and limitation of deep
learning accelerators on mobile devices. In this paper, we conduct a search of
portable network architectures for better quality-latency trade-off across
mobile devices. We further present the effectiveness of widely used network
optimizations for image deblurring task. This paper provides comprehensive
experiments and comparisons to uncover the in-depth analysis for both latency
and image quality. Through all the above works, we demonstrate the successful
deployment of image deblurring application on mobile devices with the
acceleration of deep learning accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first paper that addresses all the deployment issues of image deblurring
task across mobile devices. This paper provides practical
deployment-guidelines, and is adopted by the championship-winning team in NTIRE
2020 Image Deblurring Challenge on Smartphone Track.

on economic theory as regularizers for statistical models. We show that even if
a structural model is misspecified, as long as it is informative about the
data-generating mechanism, our method can outperform both the (misspecified)
structural model and un-structural-regularized statistical models. Our method
permits a Bayesian interpretation of theory as prior knowledge and can be used
both for statistical prediction and causal inference. It contributes to
transfer learning by showing how incorporating theory into statistical modeling
can significantly improve out-of-domain predictions and offers a way to
synthesize reduced-form and structural approaches for causal effect estimation.
Simulation experiments demonstrate the potential of our method in various
settings, including first-price auctions, dynamic models of entry and exit, and
demand estimation with instrumental variables. Our method has potential
applications not only in economics, but in other scientific disciplines whose
theoretical models offer important insight but are subject to significant
misspecification concerns.

tunneling processes inside the Coulomb blockade region. Our work paves the way
for systematic investigations of temporal fluctuations in interacting quantum
systems, for example close to a Kondo resonance or in a Luttinger liquid.

major directions: (1) an increasing accuracy of mathematical approaches and (2)
an increasing flexibility in usage by reducing the dependency on calibration
objects. These two trends, however, seem to be contradictory since the overall
accuracy is directly related to the accuracy of the pose estimation of the
calibration object and therefore demanding large objects, while an increased
flexibility leads to smaller objects or noisier estimation methods.
  The method presented in this paper aims to resolves this problem in two
steps: First, we derive a simple closed-form solution with a shifted focus
towards the equation of translation that only solves for the necessary hand-eye
transformation. We show that it is superior in accuracy and robustness compared
to traditional approaches. Second, we decrease the dependency on the
calibration object to a single 3D-point by using a similar formulation based on
the equation of translation which is much less affected by the estimation error
of the calibration object's orientation. Moreover, it makes the estimation of
the orientation obsolete while taking advantage of the higher accuracy and
robustness from the first solution, resulting in a versatile method for
continuous hand-eye calibration.

for discussions of the origin of dust in the early Universe. However, this
suffers from limited sampling of the infrared spectral-energy distribution.
Here we present an algorithm for deriving the temperature and mass of dust in a
galaxy, assuming dust to be in radiative equilibrium. We formulate the
algorithm for three geometries: a thin spherical shell, a homogeneous sphere,
and a clumpy sphere. We also discuss effects of the mass absorption
coefficients of dust at ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths, $\kappa_{\rm UV}$
and $\kappa_{\rm IR}$, respectively. As an example, we apply the algorithm to a
normal, dusty star-forming galaxy at $z=7.5$, A1689zD1, for which three data
points in the dust continuum are available. Using $\kappa_{\rm
UV}=5.0\times10^4$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ and $\kappa_{\rm IR}=30(\lambda/100\mu
m)^{-\beta}$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ with $\beta=2.0$, we obtain dust temperatures of
38--70~K and masses of $10^{6.5-7.3}$ M$_\odot$ for the three geometries
considered. We obtain similar temperatures and masses from just a single data
point in the dust continuum, suggesting the usefulness of the algorithm for
high-$z$ galaxies with limited infrared observations. In the clumpy-sphere
case, the temperature becomes equal to that of the usual modified black-body
fit, because an additional parameter describing the clumpiness works as an
adjuster. The best-fit clumpiness parameter is $\xi_{\rm cl}=0.1$,
corresponding to $\sim10$\% of the volume filling factor of the clumps in this
high-$z$ galaxy if the clump size is $\sim10$ pc, similar to that of giant
molecular clouds in the local Universe.

studied in detail. Our measurements show no thermal hysteresis across the
magnetic transition for the parent compound which is in contrast with the
previous report and corroborate the second order nature of the transition. The
magnetic transition could be tuned continuously with Mn substitution at the Fe
site. The Mn substitution leads to a linear increase in the unit cell volume
and a slight reduction in the effective moment. A detailed critical analysis of
the magnetization data for $x = 0.0$ and 0.2 is performed in the critical
regime using the modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher plot, universal curve
scaling, and scaling analysis of magnetocaloric effect. The magnetization
isotherms follow modified Arrott plots with critical exponent ($\beta \simeq
0.308$, $\gamma \simeq 1.448$, and $\delta \simeq 5.64$) for the parent
compound ($x=0.0$) and ($\beta \simeq 0.304$, $\gamma \simeq 1.445$, and
$\delta \simeq 5.64$) for $x = 0.2$. The Kouvel-Fisher and universal scaling
plots of the magnetization isotherms further confirm the reliability of our
critical analysis and values of the exponents. These values of the critical
exponents are found to be same for both the parent and doped samples which do
not fall under any of the standard universality classes. A reasonable
magnetocaloric effect $\Delta S_{\rm m}\simeq-6.67$~J/Kg-K and -5.84~J/Kg-K for
$x= 0.0$ and 0.2 compounds, respectively, with a huge relative cooling power

of magnetocaloric effect further mimics the second order character of the
magnetic transition. The obtained critical exponents from the critical analysis
of magnetocaloric effect agree with the values deduced from the magnetic

Refine background",,"10.1145/3406325.3451082",,"quant-ph cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the universal blind quantum computation problem, a client wants to make
use of a single quantum server to evaluate $C|0\rangle$ where $C$ is an
arbitrary quantum circuit while keeping $C$ secret. The client's goal is to use
as few resources as possible. This problem, with a representative protocol by
Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS09, arXiv:0807.4154], has become
fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own
importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can
be later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation
verification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either
information-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public
key encryptions).
  In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives,
modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum
computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol.
Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, BFK [FOCS09,
arXiv:0807.4154]), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first
phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum
gates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is
entirely classical -- it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the
protocol's first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of
the circuit size. Given the security parameter $\kappa$, its complexity is only
a fixed polynomial of $\kappa$, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or
several circuits) of size up to a subexponential of $\kappa$. In contrast,
known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that
scale with the size of the circuit [FOCS09, arXiv:0807.4154], or require
trapdoor assumptions [Mahadev, FOCS18, arXiv:1708.02130].

that has been considered so far as a normal K-type red giant. Its parallax
measured by Gaia and the derived luminosity suggest that it is actually a
supergiant, whereas its derived distance to the galactic plane and its spatial
velocity of 54.1 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the local standard of rest suggest
that it is also a runaway star. However, intrinsic limitations in determining
the trigonometric parallaxes of cool supergiants, even in the Gaia era, require
accurate spectral classifications for confirmation. We reliably classify HD
137071 as a K4II star establishing its membership to the extreme Population I,
which is in agreement with the luminosity derived using the Gaia DR2 parallax
measurement. Kinematical data from the Gaia DR2 catalog confirm its high
spatial velocity and its runaway nature. Combining the spectral classification
with astrometric information, a state-of-the-art galactic potential model, and
evolutionary models for high-mass stars we trace the motion of HD 137071 back
to the proximities of the galactic plane and speculate on which of the two
proposed mechanisms for the production of runaway stars may be responsible for
the high velocity of HD 137071. The available data favor the formation of HD

to exhaustively retrieve objects densely distributed in the image, across a

real-life object detection applications, for example in remote sensing, instead
require dealing with large images that contain only a few small objects of a
single class, scattered heterogeneously across the space. In addition, they are
often subject to strict computational constraints, such as limited battery
capacity and computing power. To tackle these more practical scenarios, we
propose a novel flexible detection scheme that efficiently adapts to variable
object sizes and densities: We rely on a sequence of detection stages, each of
which has the ability to predict groups of objects as well as individuals.
Similar to a detection cascade, this multi-stage architecture spares
computational effort by discarding large irrelevant regions of the image early
during the detection process. The ability to group objects provides further
computational and memory savings, as it allows working with lower image
resolutions in early stages, where groups are more easily detected than
individuals, as they are more salient. We report experimental results on two
aerial image datasets, and show that the proposed method is as accurate yet
computationally more efficient than standard single-shot detectors,
consistently across three different backbone architectures.

the points of $P$ with radius $\alpha\cdot r_i$ for $1\le i\le k$, such that
all points of $P$ are contained in the union of the chosen balls. They showed
that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within any factor even in tree

sensors for 3D object detection. Because the camera and LiDAR sensor signals
have different characteristics and distributions, fusing these two modalities
is expected to improve both the accuracy and robustness of 3D object detection.
One of the challenges presented by the fusion of cameras and LiDAR is that the
spatial feature maps obtained from each modality are represented by
significantly different views in the camera and world coordinates; hence, it is
not an easy task to combine two heterogeneous feature maps without loss of
information. To address this problem, we propose a method called 3D-CVF that
combines the camera and LiDAR features using the cross-view spatial feature
fusion strategy. First, the method employs auto-calibrated projection, to
transform the 2D camera features to a smooth spatial feature map with the
highest correspondence to the LiDAR features in the bird's eye view (BEV)
domain. Then, a gated feature fusion network is applied to use the spatial
attention maps to mix the camera and LiDAR features appropriately according to
the region. Next, camera-LiDAR feature fusion is also achieved in the
subsequent proposal refinement stage. The camera feature is used from the 2D
camera-view domain via 3D RoI grid pooling and fused with the BEV feature for
proposal refinement. Our evaluations, conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes 3D
object detection datasets demonstrate that the camera-LiDAR fusion offers
significant performance gain over single modality and that the proposed 3D-CVF
achieves state-of-the-art performance in the KITTI benchmark.

This motivates the derivation of a macroscopic partial differential equations
model for the interactions between the self-propelled particles and the

system of non-linear, non-local partial differential equations. Linear
stability analysis shows that patterning is expected if the interactions are
strong enough and allows for the predictions of pattern size from model

induce short-ranged SPP aggregation, irrespective of whether obstacles and SPPs

available. One of them that is becoming very popular is hand tracking, as the
idea to replace controllers for interactions in virtual worlds. This experiment
aims to compare different interaction types in VR using either controllers or
hand tracking. Participants had to play two simple VR games with various types
of tasks in those games - grabbing objects or typing numbers. While playing,
they were using interactions with different visualizations of hands and
controllers. The focus of this study was to investigate user experience of
varying interactions (controller vs. hand tracking) for those two simple tasks.
Results show that different interaction types statistically significantly
influence reported emotions with Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), where for hand
tracking participants were feeling higher valence, but lower arousal and
dominance. Additionally, task type of grabbing was reported to be more
realistic, and participants experienced a higher presence. Surprisingly,
participants rated the interaction type with controllers where both where hands
and controllers were visualized as statistically most preferred. Finally, hand
tracking for both tasks was rated with the System Usability Scale (SUS) scale,
and hand tracking for the task typing was rated as statistically significantly
more usable. These results can drive further research and, in the long term,
contribute to help selecting the most matching interaction modality for a task.

are key in deducing physical parameters for millions of spectra in a short
time. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable us to connect observables

parameters, chemical abundances, or labels in general). We trained a CNN,
adopting stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from APOGEE
DR16 (resolution R=22500) data as training set labels. As input, we used parts
of the intermediate-resolution RAVE DR6 spectra (R~7500) overlapping with the
APOGEE DR16 data as well as broad-band ALL_WISE and 2MASS photometry, together
with Gaia DR2 photometry and parallaxes. We derived precise atmospheric
parameters Teff, log(g), and [M/H] along with the chemical abundances of
[Fe/H], [alpha/M], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] for 420165 RAVE
spectra. The precision typically amounts to 60K in Teff, 0.06 in log(g) and
0.02-0.04 dex for individual chemical abundances. Incorporating photometry and
astrometry as additional constraints substantially improves the results in
terms of the accuracy and precision of the derived labels. We provide a
catalogue of CNN-trained atmospheric parameters and abundances along with their
uncertainties for 420165 stars in the RAVE survey. CNN-based methods provide a
powerful way to combine spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric data
without the need to apply any priors in the form of stellar evolutionary
models. The developed procedure can extend the scientific output of RAVE
spectra beyond DR6 to ongoing and planned surveys such as Gaia RVS, 4MOST, and
WEAVE. We call on the community to place a particular collective emphasis and
on efforts to create unbiased training samples for such future spectroscopic

work under this assumption tend to be vulnerable to even small changes in the

misleading elements at arbitrary positions. We believe that studying algorithms

more robust algorithms. We investigate two classical combinatorial-optimization

submodular function maximization. Our main technical contribution is a novel
streaming algorithm for the latter that computes a $0.55$-approximation. While
the algorithm itself is clean and simple, an involved analysis shows that it
emulates a subdivision of the input stream which can be used to greatly limit

accurately determining a quantum transition frequency is essential. However,
the exact relation between a desired transition frequency and the controllable
experimental parameters is usually absent. Here, we propose an efficient scheme
to search the suitable conditions for a desired quantum transition via an
adaptive Bayesian algorithm, and experimentally demonstrate it by using
coherent population trapping in an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms.
The transition frequency is controlled by an external magnetic field, which can
be tuned in realtime by applying a d.c. voltage. Through an adaptive Bayesian
algorithm, the voltage can automatically converge to the desired one from a
random initial value only after few iterations. In particular, when the
relation between the target frequency and the applied voltage is nonlinear, our
algorithm shows significant advantages over traditional methods. This work
provides a simple and efficient way to determine a transition frequency, which
can be widely applied in the fields of precision spectroscopy, such as atomic

merely an artefact of how ffCNNs are trained. Here, we use visual crowding as a
well-controlled, specific probe to test global shape computations. Our results
provide evidence that ffCNNs cannot produce human-like global shape
computations for principled architectural reasons. We lay out approaches that
may address shortcomings of ffCNNs to provide better models of the human visual
system.

this end, we develop an elegant and systematic framework wherein two
architectures are devised to jointly detect an unknown number of NLJs and to
estimate their respective angles of arrival. The followed approach relies on
the likelihood ratio test in conjunction with a cyclic estimation procedure
which incorporates at the design stage a sparsity promoting prior. As a matter
of fact, the problem at hand owns an inherent sparse nature which is suitably
exploited. This methodological choice is dictated by the fact that, from a
mathematical point of view, classical maximum likelihood approach leads to
intractable optimization problems (at least to the best of authors' knowledge)
and, hence, a suboptimum approach represents a viable means to solve them.
Performance analysis is conducted on simulated data and shows the effectiveness
of the proposed architectures in drawing a reliable picture of the
electromagnetic threats illuminating the radar system.

solve spatial search problems. A widely used quantum algorithm for this
problem, introduced by Childs and Goldstone [Phys. Rev. A 70, 022314 (2004)],
finds a marked node on a graph of $n$ nodes via a continuous-time quantum walk.
This algorithm is said to be optimal if it can find any of the nodes in
$O(\sqrt{n})$ time. However, given a graph, no general conditions for the
optimality of the algorithm are known and previous works demonstrating optimal
quantum search for certain graphs required an instance-specific analysis. In
fact, the demonstration of necessary and sufficient conditions a graph must
fulfill for quantum search to be optimal has been a long-standing open problem.
  In this work, we make significant progress towards solving this problem. We
derive general expressions, depending on the spectral properties of the
Hamiltonian driving the walk, that predict the performance of this quantum
search algorithm provided certain spectral conditions are fulfilled. Our
predictions are valid, for example, for (normalized) Hamiltonians whose
spectral gap is considerably larger than $n^{-1/2}$. This allows us to derive
necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal quantum search in this regime,
as well as provide new examples of graphs where quantum search is sub-optimal.
In addition, by extending this analysis, we are also able to show the
optimality of quantum search for certain graphs with very small spectral gaps,
such as graphs that can be efficiently partitioned into clusters. Our results
imply that, to the best of our knowledge, all prior results analytically
demonstrating the optimality of this algorithm for specific graphs can be
recovered from our general results.

predict an extensive variety of scenarios, which can be constrained through
observations of the abundant isotopes $^{56}$Ni and $^{44}$Ti. Direct evidence
of the latter was previously found only in two core-collapse supernova events,
and appears to be absent in thermonuclear supernovae.Aims: We aim to to
constrain the supernova progenitor types of Cas A, SN 1987A, Vela Jr.,
G1.9+0.3, SN1572, and SN1604 through their $^{44}$Ti ejecta masses and
explosion kinematics. Methods: We analyzed INTEGRAL/SPI observations of the
candidate sources utilizing an empirically motivated high-precision background
model. We analyzed the three dominant spectroscopically resolved de-excitation
lines at 68, 78, and 1157\,keV emitted in the decay chain of $^{44}$Ti. The
fluxes allow the determination of the production yields of $^{44}$Ti. Remnant
kinematics were obtained from the Doppler characteristics of the lines.
Results: We find a significant signal for Cas A in all three lines with a
combined significance of 5.4$\sigma$. The fluxes are $(3.3 \pm 0.9) \times
10^{-5}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and $(4.2 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-5}$ ph cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ for the $^{44}$Ti and $^{44}$Sc decay, respectively. We obtain higher
fluxes for $^{44}$Ti with our analysis of Cas A than were obtained in previous
analyses. We discuss potential differences. Conclusions: We obtain a high
$^{44}$Ti ejecta mass for Cas A that is in disagreement with ejecta yields from
symmetric 2D models. Upper limits for the other core-collapse supernovae are in
agreement with model predictions and previous studies. The upper limits we find
for the three thermonuclear supernovae consistently exclude the double
detonation and pure helium deflagration models as progenitors.

generates tiny phase shift of the same PPG signal in different parts of the

a meta-model, which consists of a synthetic gradient network and an
initialization network. Each variational posterior is derived from synthetic

where we do not have access to the true gradient. Our results on the

outperform previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we conduct two zero-shot

Reconstructing the normal section profile is an effective approach to determine
the critical geometric parameter and wear of the wheel in the community of
railway safety. The existing reconstruction methods typically require a sensor
working in a constrained position and pose, suffering poor flexibility and
limited viewangle. This paper proposes a pose-unconstrained normal section
profile reconstruction framework for 3D revolving structures via multiple 3D
general section profiles acquired by a multi-line structured light vision
sensor. First, we establish a model to estimate the axis of 3D revolving
geometrical structure and the normal section profile using corresponding
points. Then, we embed the model into an iterative algorithm to optimize the
corresponding points and finally reconstruct the accurate normal section
profile. We conducted real experiment on reconstructing the normal section
profile of a 3D wheel. The results demonstrate that our algorithm reaches the
mean precision of 0.068mm and good repeatability with the STD of 0.007mm. It is
also robust to varying pose variations of the sensor. Our proposed framework
and models are generalized to any 3D wheeltype revolving components.

of all hashtags used in a period of time, we identify the scaling laws
underpinning the hashtag frequency distribution (Zipf's law), the number of
unique hashtags as a function of sample size (Heaps' law), and the fluctuations
around expected values (Taylor's law). While these scaling laws appear to be
universal, in the sense that similar exponents are observed irrespective of

strongly on time, with the appearance of bursts at the minute scale, fat-tailed
noise, and long-range correlations. We quantify this dynamics by computing the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between hashtag distributions obtained $\tau$ times
apart and we find that the speed of change decays roughly as $1/\tau$. Our
findings are based on the analysis of 3.5 billion hashtags used between 2015

determine an upper bound for the minimax risk of estimation for the quadratic
functional. The upper bound consists of two terms, one that mimics a classical
bias-variance trade-off and a second that causes the typical elbow effect in
quadratic functional estimation. Using a minimax optimal estimator of the
quadratic functional as a test statistic, we derive an upper bound for the
nonasymptotic minimax radius of testing for nonparametric alternatives.
Interestingly, the term causing the elbow effect in the estimation case
vanishes in the radius of testing. We provide a matching lower bound for the

yields a lower bound for the quadratic functional estimation problem, we obtain
a lower bound for the risk of estimation. Lastly, we prove a matching lower

showers generated by Earth-skimming tau neutrinos. Signals from several

occurs. In the latter regime the two species phase separate, thereby forming a
particle-hole pair. For two impurities we find that below a critical lattice
depth they are delocalized among two neighboring outer lattice wells and are
two-body correlated. This transition is characterized by a crossover from
strong to a suppressed interspecies entanglement for increasing impurity-medium
repulsion. Turning to the dynamical response of the mixture, upon quenching the
interspecies repulsion to smaller values, we reveal that the predominant
tunneling process for a single impurity corresponds to that of a particle-hole
pair, whose dynamical stability depends strongly on the quench amplitude.
During the time-evolution a significant increase of the interspecies
entanglement is observed, caused by the build-up of a superposition of states
and thus possesses a many-body nature. In the case of two bosonic impurities
the particle-hole pair process becomes unstable in the course of the dynamics
with the impurities aggregating in adjacent lattice sites while being strongly
correlated.

Res. 2 (2020) 028002",,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, a method of ultrafast polarization switching in ferroelectrics has
been suggested. The basic idea of the method is to employ the effect of
self-acceleration of polarization dynamics due to a resonator feedback field.
This is the idea of principle whose efficiency is demonstrated by an Ising-type
model in a transverse field. Of course, the practical realization of the method
requires the choice of appropriate materials, which is a separate problem. For
example, the standard order-disorder ferroelectrics with spatially symmetric
double-well potentials cannot be used for this purpose, since, because of the
symmetry, they lack the transverse polarization. However, ferroelectrics with
asymmetric potentials, possessing this polarization, can be used. Moreover, if
the potential asymmetry, hence the transverse polarization, could be regulated,
e.g., by shear stress or shear strain, this could provide a tool for governing
the process of polarization switching.

couple of fully convolutional discriminators dealing with different domains:
the first discriminates between ground truth and generated maps, while the
second between segmentation maps coming from synthetic or real world data. The
self-training module exploits the confidence estimated by the discriminators on
unlabeled data to select the regions used to reinforce the learning process.
Furthermore, the confidence is thresholded with an adaptive mechanism based on
the per-class overall confidence. Experimental results prove the effectiveness

perform very well and give practically identical results. We also re-analyze

the efficacy (response) of various doses of antidepressant drugs. All models
suggest that the dose-response curve increases between zero dose and 40 mg of

Later, in 2018, this was extended for changes of size $\frac{\log n}{\log \log

  In this paper we extend these results by showing that, for changes of

undirected reachability, and (2) directed reachability under insertions. For
classes of directed graphs for which efficient parallel algorithms can compute
non-zero circulation weights, reachability can be maintained with update
formulas that may use ""modulo 2"" quantifiers under changes of polylogarithmic

  Bisimilarity",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Robin Milner (1984) gave a sound proof system for bisimilarity of regular
expressions interpreted as processes: Basic Process Algebra with unary Kleene
star iteration, deadlock 0, successful termination 1, and a fixed-point rule.
He asked whether this system is complete. Despite intensive research over the
last 35 years, the problem is still open.
  This paper gives a partial positive answer to Milner's problem. We prove that
the adaptation of Milner's system over the subclass of regular expressions that
arises by dropping the constant 1, and by changing to binary Kleene star
iteration is complete. The crucial tool we use is a graph structure property
that guarantees expressibility of a process graph by a regular expression, and
is preserved by going over from a process graph to its bisimulation collapse.

  through a simulation study of wheat yield in Japan","12 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by Precision Agriculture",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On-farm experiments can provide farmers with information on more efficient
crop management in their own fields. Developments in precision agricultural
technologies, such as yield monitoring and variable-rate application
technology, allow farmers to implement on-farm experiments. Research frameworks
including the experimental design and the statistical analysis method strongly
influences the precision of the experiment. Conventional statistical approaches
(e.g., ordinary least squares regression) may not be appropriate for on-farm
experiments because they are not capable of accurately accounting for the
underlying spatial variation in a particular response variable (e.g., yield
data). The effects of experimental designs and statistical approaches on type I
error rates and estimation accuracy were explored through a simulation study
hypothetically conducted on experiments in three wheat fields in Japan.
Isotropic and anisotropic spatial linear mixed models were established for
comparison with ordinary least squares regression models. The repeated designs
were not sufficient to reduce both the risk of a type I error and the
estimation bias on their own. A combination of a repeated design and an
anisotropic model is sometimes required to improve the precision of the
experiments. Model selection should be performed to determine whether the
anisotropic model is required for analysis of any specific field. The
anisotropic model had larger standard errors than the other models, especially
when the estimates had large biases. This finding highlights an advantage of
anisotropic models since they enable experimenters to cautiously consider the
reliability of the estimates when they have a large bias.

hit-time of photons in long scintillator detectors is investigated. This
research is motivated by the recent development of the positron emission
tomography scanners based on plastic scintillators. The proposed method
constitutes a new way of signal processing in Multi-Voltage-Technique. It is
based on the determination of the degree of similarity between the registered
signals and the synchronized model signals stored in a library. The library was
established for a set of well defined hit-positions along the length of the
scintillator. The Mahalanobis distance was used as a measure of similarity
between the two compared signals. The method was validated on the experimental
data measured using two-strips J-PET prototype with dimensions of 5x9x300
mm$^3$. The obtained Time-of-Flight (TOF) and spatial resolutions amount to
325~ps (FWHM) and 25~mm (FWHM), respectively. The TOF resolution was also
compared to the results of an analogous study done using Linear Fitting method.
The best TOF resolution was obtained with this method at four pre-defined
threshold levels which was comparable to the resolution achieved from the
Mahalanobis distance at two pre-defined threshold levels. Although the
algorithm of Linear Fitting method is much simpler to apply than the
Mahalanobis method, the application of the Mahalanobis distance requires a
lower number of applied threshold levels and, hence, decreases the costs of
electronics used in PET scanner.

osteoarthritis is investigated using the sounds generated by the knee joint
during walking. Methods: The information contained in the time-frequency domain
of these signals and its compressed representations is exploited and their
discriminant properties are studied. Their efficacy for the task of normal vs
abnormal signal classification is evaluated using a comprehensive experimental
framework. Based on this, the impact of the feature extraction parameters on
the classification performance is investigated using Classification and
Regression Trees (CART), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifiers. Results: It is shown that classification is
successful with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve
of 0.92. Conclusion: The analysis indicates improvements in classification
performance when using non-uniform frequency scaling and identifies specific
frequency bands that contain discriminative features. Significance: Contrary to
other studies that focus on sit-to-stand movements and knee flexion/extension,
this study used knee sounds obtained during walking. The analysis of such
signals leads to non-invasive detection of knee osteoarthritis with high
accuracy and could potentially extend the range of available tools for the
assessment of the disease as a more practical and cost effective method without

sequential product operation modeled after the L\""uders product $(a,b)\mapsto
\sqrt{a}b\sqrt{a}$ on C*-algebras. A SEA is called normal when it has all
suprema of directed sets, and the sequential product interacts suitably with
these suprema. The effects on a Hilbert space and the unit interval of a von
Neumann or JBW algebra are examples of normal SEAs that are in addition convex,
i.e. possess a suitable action of the real unit interval on the algebra.
Complete Boolean algebras form normal SEAs too, which are convex only when
$0=1$.
  We show that any normal SEA $E$ splits as a direct sum $E\equiv E_b\oplus E_c
\oplus E_{ac}$ of a complete Boolean algebra $E_b$, a convex normal SEA $E_c$,
and a newly identified type of normal SEA $E_{ac}$ we dub purely almost-convex.
Along the way we show, among other things, that a SEA which contains only
idempotents must be a Boolean algebra; and we establish a spectral theorem
using which we settle for the class of normal SEAs a problem of Gudder
regarding the uniqueness of square roots. After establishing our main result,
we propose a simple extra axiom for normal SEAs that excludes the seemingly
pathological a-convex SEAs. We conclude the paper by a study of SEAs with an
associative sequential product. We find that associativity forces normal SEAs
satisfying our new axiom to be commutative, shedding light on the question of
why the sequential product in quantum theory should be non-associative.

occurred. To this end, I develop a Bayesian dose-response model for a single
ordinal toxicity. By constructing this model's priors to align with the AFM11

partition has also become a popular clustering algorithm and still is
extensively studied. However, these algorithms and their variants still suffer
from some difficulties such as determination of the optimal number of clusters
which is a key factor for clustering quality. A common approach for overcoming
this difficulty is to use the trial-and-validation strategy, i.e., traversing
every integer from large number like $\sqrt{n}$ to 2 until finding the optimal
number corresponding to the peak value of some cluster validity index. But it
is scarcely possible to naturally construct an adaptively agglomerative
hierarchical cluster structure as using the trial-and-validation strategy. Even
possible, existing different validity indices also lead to different number of
clusters. To effectively mitigate the problems while motivated by convex
clustering, in this paper we present a Centroid Auto-Fused Hierarchical Fuzzy
c-means method (CAF-HFCM) whose optimization procedure can automatically
agglomerate to form a cluster hierarchy, more importantly, yielding an optimal
number of clusters without resorting to any validity index. Although a
recently-proposed robust-learning fuzzy c-means (RL-FCM) can also automatically
obtain the best number of clusters without the help of any validity index,
so-involved 3 hyper-parameters need to adjust expensively, conversely, our
CAF-HFCM involves just 1 hyper-parameter which makes the corresponding
adjustment is relatively easier and more operational. Further, as an additional
benefit from our optimization objective, the CAF-HFCM effectively reduces the
sensitivity to the initialization of clustering performance. Moreover, our
proposed CAF-HFCM method is able to be straightforwardly extended to various
variants of FCM.

finding symbolic expressions that match data from an unknown function. To make
the symbolic regression more efficient, one can also use dimensionally-aware
genetic programming that constrains the physical units of the equation.
Nevertheless, there is no formal analysis of how much dimensionality awareness
helps in the regression process. In this paper, we conduct a fitness landscape
analysis of dimensionallyaware genetic programming search spaces on a subset of
equations from Richard Feynmans well-known lectures. We define an
initialisation procedure and an accompanying set of neighbourhood operators for
conducting the local search within the physical unit constraints. Our
experiments show that the added information about the variable dimensionality
can efficiently guide the search algorithm. Still, further analysis of the
differences between the dimensionally-aware and standard genetic programming
landscapes is needed to help in the design of efficient evolutionary operators
to be used in a dimensionally-aware regression.

quantum dot hybrid system coupled to two electronic reservoirs and a phonon
bath is proposed and analyzed in detail. While investigating the non-trivial
role of electron-phonon interactions, we show that, although they are well
known to be detrimental from a general refrigeration perspective, can be
engineered to favorably improve the trade-off between the cooling power (CP)
and the coefficient-of-performance (COP). Furthermore, an additional
improvement in the trade-off can be facilitated by applying a high electronic
thermal bias. However, the allowed maximum of the thermal bias being strongly
limited by the electron-phonon coupling, in turn, determines the lowest
achievable temperature of the cooled body. It is further demonstrated that such
interactions drive a phonon flow between the dot and bath whose direction and
magnitude depend on the temperature difference between the dot and bath. To
justify its impact in optimizing the peak CP and COP, we show that a weak
coupling with the bath is preferable when the phonons relax through it and a
strong coupling is suitable in the opposite case when the phonons are extracted
from the bath. Finally, in studying the effect of asymmetry in electronic
couplings, we show that a stronger coupling is favorable with the contact whose
temperature is closer to that of the bath. Combining these aspects, we believe
that this study could offer important guidelines for a possible realization of
molecular and quantum dot thermoelectric refrigerator.

technologies, such as humanoid robots, chatbots, and virtual assistants. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and rating humor in short
texts based on a popular linguistic theory of humor. The proposed technical
method initiates by separating sentences of the given text and utilizing the
BERT model to generate embeddings for each one. The embeddings are fed to
separate lines of hidden layers in a neural network (one line for each
sentence) to extract latent features. At last, the parallel lines are
concatenated to determine the congruity and other relationships between the
sentences and predict the target value. We accompany the paper with a novel
dataset for humor detection consisting of 200,000 formal short texts. In
addition to evaluating our work on the novel dataset, we participated in a live
machine learning competition focused on rating humor in Spanish tweets. The
proposed model obtained F1 scores of 0.982 and 0.869 in the humor detection
experiments which outperform general and state-of-the-art models. The
evaluation performed on two contrasting settings confirm the strength and
robustness of the model and suggests two important factors in achieving high
accuracy in the current task: 1) usage of sentence embeddings and 2) utilizing
the linguistic structure of humor in designing the proposed model.

CV/AI applications. Though CNNs show near human or better than human
performance in many critical tasks, they are quite vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. These attacks are potentially dangerous in real-life deployments.
Though there have been many adversarial attacks proposed in recent years, there
is no proper way of quantifying the effectiveness of these attacks. As of
today, mere fooling rate is used for measuring the susceptibility of the
models, or the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Fooling rate just
considers label flipping and does not consider the cost of such flipping, for
instance, in some deployments, flipping between two species of dogs may not be
as severe as confusing a dog category with that of a vehicle. Therefore, the
metric to quantify the vulnerability of the models should capture the severity
of the flipping as well. In this work we first bring out the drawbacks of the
existing evaluation and propose novel metrics to capture various aspects of the
fooling. Further, for the first time, we present a comprehensive analysis of
several important adversarial attacks over a set of distinct CNN architectures.
We believe that the presented analysis brings valuable insights about the

2016, we analyze whether international oil prices affect the bank stability in
an oil-dependent country. We posit that a decrease in international oil prices
has a negative long-run macroeconomic impact for an oil-exporting country,
which further deteriorates the bank financial stability. More specifically, a
decrease in international oil prices leads for an oil-exporting country as
Russia to a currency depreciation and to a deterioration of the fiscal stance.
In addition, given the positive correlation of oil and stock prices documented
by numerous previous studies, a decrease in international oil prices represents
a negative signal for the stock markets investors, negatively affecting banks'
share prices and thus, their capacity to generate sustainable earnings. In this
context, the bank financial stability can be menaced. With a focus on public
listed banks and using a Pool Mean Group (PMG) estimator, we show that an
increase in international oil prices and in the price to book value ratio has a

  Arbitrary Transactions in Ethereum-like Blockchains",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transactions represent a fundamental component in blockchains as they are the
primary means for users to change the blockchain state. Current blockchain
systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum require users to constantly observe the
state changes of interest or the events taking place in a blockchain and
requires the user to explicitly release the required transactions to respond to
the observed events in the blockchain. This paper proposes EventWarden, a
decentralized event-driven proxy service for users to outsource transactions in
Ethereum-like blockchains. EventWarden employs a novel combination of smart
contracts and blockchain logs. EventWarden allows a user to create a proxy
smart contract that specifies an interested event and also reserves an
arbitrary transaction to release. Upon observing the occurrence of the
prescribed event, anyone in the Blockchain network can call the proxy contract
to earn the service fee reserved in the contract by proving to the contract
that the event has been recorded into blockchain logs, which then automatically
triggers the proxy contract to release the reserved transaction. We show that
the reserved transaction can only get released from the proxy contract when the
prescribed event has taken place. We also demonstrate that as long as a single
member in the Blockchain network is incentivized by the service fee to call the
proxy contract after the prescribed event has taken place, the reserved
transaction is guaranteed to get released. We implement EventWarden over the
Ethereum official test network. The results demonstrate that EventWarden is
effective and is ready-to-use in practice.

Presented here are developments incorporated in this new detector: a) sensor
technologies using resistive materials and multi-anode read-out that allow high

the classic example based image super-resolution approaches and come up with a

conditional variational autoencoder to encode the reference for dense feature

With the aid of the discriminator, an additional overhead of super-resolution
subnetwork is attached to super-resolve the denoised image with photo-realistic
visual quality. We participated the NTIRE2020 Real Image Super-Resolution

for the characterization of the chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres.
Taking advantage of the broad spectral coverage of the CARMENES spectrograph,
we initiated a survey aimed at characterizing a broad range of planetary
systems. Here, we report our observations of three transits of \tplanet with
CARMENES in search of \het\ absorption. On one of the nights, the He~{\sc i}
region was heavily contaminated by OH$^-$ telluric emission and, thus, it was
not useful for our purposes. The remaining two nights had a very different
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) due to weather. They both indicate the presence of
\het\ absorption in the transmission spectrum of \tplanet, although a
statistically valid detection can only be claimed for the night with higher
S/N. For that night, we retrieved a 1.5$\pm$0.3\% absorption depth, translating
into a $R_p(\lambda)/R_p = 1.15\pm 0.14$ at this wavelength.
Spectro-photometric light curves for this same night also indicate the presence
of extra absorption during the planetary transit with a consistent absorption
depth. The \het\ absorption is modeled in detail using a radiative transfer
code, and the results of our modeling efforts are compared to the observations.
We find that the mass-loss rate, \mlr, is confined to a range of
3\,$\times\,10^{10}$\,\gs\ for $T$ = 6000\,K to 10\,$\times\,10^{10}$\,\gs\ for
$T$ = 9000\,K. We discuss the physical mechanisms and implications of the
He~{\sc i} detection in \tplanet and put it in context as compared to similar
detections and non-detections in other Neptune-size planets. We also present
improved stellar and planetary parameter determinations based on our visible

group 1H polarizations that are orders of magnitude larger than their thermal
counterparts. Suitable procedures can exploit this to deliver 2D 1H-15N
correlations with good resolution and enhanced sensitivity. These enhancements
depend on the exchange rates between the amides and the water, thereby yielding
diagnostic information about solvent accessibility. This study applied this
HyperW method to four proteins exhibiting a gamut of exchange behaviors: PhoA4,
an unfolded 122-residue fragment; barstar, a fully folded ribonuclease
inhibitor; R17, a 13.3 kDa system possessing folded and unfolded forms under
slow interconversion; and drkN SH3, a protein domain whose folded and unfolded
forms interchange rapidly and with temperature-dependent population ratios. For
PhoA4 HyperW sensitivity enhancements were larger than 300-fold, as expected
for an unfolded protein sequence. Though fully folded barstar also exhibited
substantial enhancements; these, however, were not uniform, and according to
CLEANEX experiments reflected the solvent-exposed residues. R17 showed the
expected superposition of 100-fold enhancements for its unfolded form,
coexisting with more modest folded counterparts. Unexpected, however, was the
behavior of drkN SH3, for which HyperW enhanced the unfolded but even more
certain folded protein sites. These preferential enhancements were repeatedly
and reproducibly observed; a number of explanations including three-site
exchange magnetization transfers between water, unfolded and folded states;
cross-correlated relaxation processes from hyperpolarized structural waters and
labile sidechain protons; and the possibility that faster solvent exchange
rates characterize certain folded sites over their unfolded counterparts are
considered to account for them.

and how it will help improve our understanding of urban mobility patterns.
Readily available and sizable farecard data captures trips in a public
transportation network. However, such data typically lacks temporal modalities
and as such the task of inferring trip semantic, station function, and user
profile is quite challenging. As existing approaches either focus on
station-level or user-level signals, they are prone to overfitting and generate
less credible and insightful results. To properly learn such characteristics
from trip data, we propose a Collective Learning Framework through Latent
Representation, which augments user-level learning with collective patterns
learned from station-level signals. This framework uses a novel, so-called
Tidal-Regularized Non-negative Matrix Factorization method, which incorporates
domain knowledge in the form of temporal passenger flow patterns in generic
Non-negative Matrix Factorization. To evaluate our model performance, a user
stability test based on the classical Rand Index is introduced as a metric to
benchmark different unsupervised learning models. We provide a qualitative
analysis of the station functions and user profiles for the Washington D.C.
metro and show how our method supports spatiotemporal intra-city mobility
exploration.

fields, and their interactions are determined uniquely by the assigned
transformation properties, i.e., the quantum numbers associated with the
underlying symmetry of the model. These fields constitute a finite number of
group invariant operators which are assembled to build a polynomial, known as
the Lagrangian. The order of the polynomial is determined by the mass
dimension. In this paper, we have introduced a Mathematica package, GrIP, that
computes the complete set of operators that form a basis at each such order for
a model containing any number of fields transforming under connected compact
groups. The spacetime symmetry is restricted to the Lorentz group. The first
part of the paper is dedicated to formulating the algorithm of GrIP. In this
context, the detailed and explicit construction of the characters of different
representations corresponding to connected compact groups and respective Haar
measures have been discussed in terms of the coordinates of their respective
maximal torus. In the second part, we have documented the user manual of GrIP
that captures the generic features and guides to prepare the input file. This
program works very efficiently to find out the higher mass (non-supersymmetric)
and canonical (supersymmetric) dimensional operators relevant to the Effective
Field Theory. We have demonstrated the working principles with two examples:-
the SM and the MSSM. We have further highlighted important features of GrIP,
e.g., identification of effective operators leading to specific rare processes
linked with the violation of baryon and lepton numbers, using several BSM
scenarios. We have also tabulated a complete set of dimension-6 operators for
each such model. Some of the operators possess rich flavour structures which
are discussed in detail. This work paves the way towards BSM-EFT.

advances in Information Retrieval (IR), largely owed to fine-tuning deep
language models (LMs) for document ranking. While remarkably effective, the
ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of
magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each
query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single
relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that
adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT
introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query
and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction
step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining
this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep
LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document
representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond
reducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model,
ColBERT's pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging
vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large
document collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage
search datasets. Results show that ColBERT's effectiveness is competitive with
existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while
executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring four orders-of-magnitude
fewer FLOPs per query.

Additionally, hand-designed meta-RL architectures may not include suitable

The analysis of the evolved networks reveals the ability of the proposed

lattice, the cover time, namely the time to visit every site, continues to
attract widespread interest. Much insight about cover times is gained by
mapping to the (spaceless) coupon-collector problem, which amounts to ignoring
spatio-temporal correlations, and an early conjecture that the limiting cover
time distribution of regular random walks on large lattices converges to the
Gumbel distribution in $d \geq 3$ was recently proved rigorously. Furthermore,
a number of mathematical and numerical studies point to the robustness of the
Gumbel universality to modifications of the \textit{spatial} features of the
random search processes (e.g.\ introducing persistence and/or intermittence, or
changing the graph topology). Here we investigate the robustness of the Gumbel
universality to dynamical modification of the \textit{temporal} features of the
search, specifically by allowing the random walker to ""accelerate"" or
""decelerate"" upon visiting a previously unexplored site. We generalise the
mapping mentioned above by relating the statistics of cover times to the
roughness of $1/f^\alpha$ Gaussian signals, leading to the conjecture that the
Gumbel distribution is but one of a family of cover time distributions, ranging
from Gaussian for highly accelerated cover, to exponential for highly
decelerated cover. While our conjecture is confirmed by systematic Monte Carlo
simulations in dimensions $d > 3$, our results for acceleration in $d=3$
challenge the current understanding of the role of correlations in the cover

throughput and resource utilization. However, the previous solutions for
mapping multiple programs onto a quantum chip often lead to resource
under-utilization, high error rate and low fidelity. In this paper, we propose
a new approach to map concurrent quantum programs. Our approach has three
critical components. The first one is the Community Detection Assisted
Partition (CDAP) algorithm, which partitions physical qubits for concurrent
quantum programs by considering both physical typology and the error rates,
avoiding the waste of robust resources. The second one is the X-SWAP scheme
that enables inter-program SWAP operations to reduce the SWAP overheads.
Finally, we propose a compilation task scheduling framework, which dynamically
selects concurrent quantum programs to be executed based on estimated fidelity,
increasing the throughput of the quantum computer. We evaluate our work on
publicly available quantum computer IBMQ16 and a simulated quantum chip IBMQ20.
Our work outperforms the previous solution on multi-programming in both
fidelity and SWAP overheads by 12.0% and 11.1%, respectively.

normalization coefficient (ANC) from phase-shift data has been formulated and
applied to resonance states. This differs from the conventional effective-range
function (ERF) method by fitting only the nuclear part of the ERF. It also
differs from the method which was proposed for bound states by Ram\'irez
Su\'arez and Sparenberg (see Ref. below) which also named the $\Delta$ method
where a pole condition defines by the Eq. $\Delta_l=0$ ($\Delta_l$ is the
function in the ERF determined only by the scattering phase shift). Here the
standard pole condition, including the Coulomb part into the relate equation,
is used for a resonant state. It has been shown that the ERF method does not
work for large-charge colliding nuclei. Moreover, even for lower charges it is
not clear that the results of the ERF method are accurately enough. The Coulomb
part forms a background, which smooths an ERF energy dependence. Therefore, one
needs to find when the ERF method becomes inaccurate and this requires
recalculating some published results by the $\Delta$ method. This project has
already been started in a recent paper for resonances in the $\alpha$-$\alpha$
scattering. Here this method is applied using the $\Delta_l$-function fittings
to the experimental $p$-${}^4$He scattering phase-shift data in the $P_{3/2}$
and $P_{1/2}$ resonance states. The calculation results are compared with those
obtained earlier by the ERF method. The main changes concern resonance energy

the last two decades in the probability mass of the right tail of the wage
distribution, through the analysis of the corresponding tail index. In
specific, a conditional tail index estimator is introduced which explicitly
allows for right tail censoring (top-coding), which is a feature of the widely
used current population survey (CPS), as well as of other surveys. Ignoring the
top-coding may lead to inconsistent estimates of the tail index and to under or
over statements of inequality and of its evolution over time. Thus, having a
tail index estimator that explicitly accounts for this sample characteristic is
of importance to better understand and compute the tail index dynamics in the
censored right tail of the wage distribution. The contribution of this paper is
threefold: i) we introduce a conditional tail index estimator that explicitly
handles the top-coding problem, and evaluate its finite sample performance and
compare it with competing methods; ii) we highlight that the factor values used
to adjust the top-coded wage have changed over time and depend on the
characteristics of individuals, occupations and industries, and propose
suitable values; and iii) we provide an in-depth empirical analysis of the

the presence of a weak magnetic field in thermal medium and obtained the
relevant structure functions. The structure functions give the real and

respective dielectric permittivities. The real and imaginary parts of the
dielectric permittivity will be used to evaluate the real and imaginary parts
of the complex heavy quark potential. The real-part of the potential is found
to be more screened, whereas the magnitude of the imaginary-part of the
potential gets increased on increasing the value of both temperature and
magnetic field. In addition to this, we have observed that the real-part gets
slightly more screened while the imaginary part gets increased in the presence
of a weak magnetic field as compared to their counterparts in the absence of a
magnetic field. The increase in the screening of the real-part of the potential
leads to the decrease of binding energies of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$, whereas
the increase in the magnitude of the imaginary part leads to the increase of
thermal width with the temperature and magnetic field both. Also the binding
energy and thermal width in the presence of weak magnetic field become smaller
and larger, respectively, as compared to that in the pure thermal case. We have
finally obtained the dissociation temperatures for $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$,

observation leads to the slightly early dissociation of quarkonia because of
the presence of a weak magnetic field.

of ultra high energy particles. Similar processes wherein collision takes place
slightly inside the black hole event horizon or just outside or inside of white

scenario of fermion compositeness. These operators are routinely used in
experimental searches at the LHC to constraint contact and gauge interactions
between ordinary Standard Model fermions and excited states of mass $M$. We
derive the unitarity bound for the production process of an excited neutrino,
then we implement such bound and compare it with the recent experimental
exclusion curves for Run 2, the High-Luminosity and High-Energy configurations
of the LHC. The results also apply to the searches where a generic single
excited state is produced via dimension-6 contact interactions. The unitarity
bound, so far overlooked in these effective models, is quite compelling and can
serve as a guide for exploring the parameter space ($M,\Lambda$) in addition to
the standard request $M \le \Lambda$.

Access to smaller physical separations between 5 and 20 au is the next step for

with indirect techniques (radial velocity, transit, astrometry with Gaia). In
that context, we recently proposed a new algorithm, Keplerian-Stacker,
combining multiple observations acquired at different epochs and taking into
account the orbital motion of a potential planet present in the images to boost
the ultimate detection limit. We showed that this algorithm is able to find
planets in time series of simulated images of SPHERE even when a planet remains
undetected at one epoch. Here, we validate the K-Stacker algorithm performances
on real SPHERE datasets, to demonstrate its resilience to instrumental speckles
and the gain offered in terms of true detection. This will motivate future
dedicated multi-epoch observation campaigns in high-contrast imaging to search
for planets in emitted and reflected light. Results. We show that K-Stacker
achieves high success rate when the SNR of the planet in the stacked image
reaches 7. The improvement of the SNR ratio goes as the square root of the
total exposure time. During the blind test and the redetection of HD 95086 b,

claims of it being a single-lined spectroscopic binary with a 79-day orbit

implied that the visible primary star is a stripped He-rich star. However, the
nature of the secondary, which was proposed to be a black hole, a neutron star,
or a main sequence star, remains unknown. Based on 26 newly acquired
spectroscopic observations, we perform an orbital analysis and spectral
disentangling of LB-1 to elucidate the nature of the system. Our analysis
reveals that LB-1 contains two components of comparable brightness in the
optical. The narrow-lined primary, which we estimate to contribute ~55% in the
optical, has spectral properties that suggest that it is a stripped star: it
has a small spectroscopic mass (~1 Msun) for a B-type star and it is He- and
N-rich. The ""hidden"" secondary, which contributes about 45% of the optical
flux, is a rapidly rotating (vsini ~ 300 km/s) B3 V star with a decretion disk
-- a Be star. Hence, LB-1 does not contain a compact object. Instead, it is a
rare Be binary system consisting of a stripped star (the former mass donor) and
a Be star rotating at near its critical velocity (the former mass accretor).
This system is a clear example that binary interactions play a decisive role in
the production of rapid stellar rotators and Be stars.

  We show $O(n+\min\{|{\cal P}|\sqrt{n},n\sqrt{|{\cal P}|}\})$ bound on a
subgraph that is an $1$-fault-tolerant reachability preserver for a given
vertex-pair set ${\cal P}\subseteq V\times V$, i.e., it preserves reachability

failure. Our result is a significant improvement over the previous best $O(n

preserver construction. We prove our upper bound by exploiting the special
structure of single fault-tolerant reachability preserver for any pair, and
then considering the interaction among such structures for different pairs.
  In the lower bound side, we show that a 2-fault-tolerant reachability
preserver for a vertex-pair set ${\cal P}\subseteq V\times V$ of size
$\Omega(n^\epsilon)$, for even any arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, requires at

In this work, we introduce examples of such multi-object operational tasks in
the form of subchannel discrimination and subchannel exclusion games, in which
the player harnesses the resources contained within a state-measurement pair.
We prove that for any state-measurement pair in which either of them is

pair outperforms any possible free state-measurement pair. These results hold
for arbitrary convex resources of states, and arbitrary convex resources of

utilizes the positional and temporal data of the buses obtained from the Global
Positioning System (GPS) to constitute: (1) a set of empirical velocity
distributions of the buses, and (2) a set of exponential distributions of
inter-arrival time of passengers at the bus stops. Monte Carlo sampling is then
performed on these two derived probability distributions to yield the
stochastic dynamics of both the buses' motion and passengers' arrival. Our EMB
model is generic and can be applied to any real-world bus network system. In
particular, we have validated the model against the Nanyang Technological
University's Shuttle Bus System by demonstrating its accuracy in capturing the
bunching dynamics of the shuttle buses. Furthermore, we have analyzed the
efficacy of three intervention strategies: holding, no-boarding, and
centralized-pulsing, against bus bunching by incorporating the rule-set of
these strategies into the model. Under the scenario where the buses have the
same velocity, we found that all three strategies improve both the waiting and
travelling time of the commuters. However, when the buses have different
velocities, only the centralized-pulsing scheme consistently outperform the
control scenario where the buses periodically bunch together.

equipment. While existing supply chains are struggling to meet the surge in
demand, the limited supply of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has
placed healthcare workers at risk. This paper presents a method for scalable
and distributed manufacturing of FFR filter material based on a combination of
centrifugal melt spinning utilizing readily available cotton candy machines as
an example. The proposed method produces nonwoven polypropylene fabric material
with filtering efficiency of up to 96% for particles 0.30-0.49 {\mu}m in
diameter. We additionally demonstrate a scalable means to test for filtration
efficiency and pressure drop to ensure a standardized degree of quality in the
output material. We perform preliminary optimization of relevant parameters for
scale-up and propose that this is a viable method to rapidly produce up to one
million N95 FFRs per day in distributed manner with just six machines per site
operating across 200 locations. We share this work as a starting point for
others to rapidly construct, replicate and develop their own affordable modular
processes aimed at producing high quality filtration material to address the
current FFR shortage globally.

nonlinear, and/or time non-revisal physical systems. By virtue of the
Maxwell-Betti reciprocal theorem, breaking the time-reversal symmetry of
dynamic mechanical systems is only possible using nonlinear materials.
Nonetheless, nonlinear materials should be accompanied by geometrical
asymmetries to achieve nonreciprocity in static systems. Here, we further
investigate this and demonstrate a novel nonreciprocal elasticity concept. We
show that the nonreciprocity of static mechanical systems can be achieved only
and only if the material exhibits nonreciprocal elasticity. We experimentally
demonstrate linear and nonlinear materials with nonreciprocal elasticities. By
means of topological mechanics, we demonstrate that the mechanical
nonreciprocity requires nonreciprocal elasticity no matter what the material is

hardness of input words, and thus improve efficiency. The main challenge is how
to measure such hardness and decide the required depths (i.e., layers) to
conduct. Previous works generally build a halting unit to decide whether the
computation should continue or stop at each layer. As there is no specific
supervision of depth selection, the halting unit may be under-optimized and
inaccurate, which results in suboptimal and unstable performance when modeling
sentences. In this paper, we get rid of the halting unit and estimate the
required depths in advance, which yields a faster depth-adaptive model.
Specifically, two approaches are proposed to explicitly measure the hardness of
input words and estimate corresponding adaptive depth, namely 1) mutual
information (MI) based estimation and 2) reconstruction loss based estimation.
We conduct experiments on the text classification task with 24 datasets in
various sizes and domains. Results confirm that our approaches can speed up the

ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) will be replaced by seven layers of
CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). The latest innovations in silicon
imaging technology allow for the construction of large, ultra-thin silicon
wafers which can further improve the capabilities of the ALICE tracker. The
research and development studies towards the construction of a novel vertex
detector have started. The detector installation has been proposed for the
third LHC long shutdown (LS3) during which the three innermost layers shall be
replaced by three cylindrical layers of large curved CMOS wafers. This upgrade
(ITS3) will further improve the impact parameter resolution and the tracking
efficiency of low momentum particles. The innermost layer will be positioned
closer to the interaction point and the material budget will be reduced down to
0.05$\%X_0$ per layer. Monte Carlo simulations of a simplified ITS3 geometry
within the ITS2 design indicate an improvement in the impact parameter
resolution and the tracking efficiency, which are of crucial importance for
measurements of heavy-flavour hadrons. This contribution shows the improved
performance for the example of the $\Lambda_{\mathrm{b}}$, for which the
significance of its measurement is extracted based on these MC simulations. A
significant improvement by almost a factor of three in the low momentum region

a mainshock generating alarm in the population, we are interested in
forecasting if a similar magnitude earthquake will follow. We classify the
earthquake clusters associated with mainshocks of magnitude Mm into two
classes: if the strongest aftershock has a magnitude >=Mm-1 (swarms or large
aftershock seismic sequences) as type A, otherwise (smaller aftershocks seismic
sequences) as type B. A large aftershock following a main shock can cause
significant damages to already weakened buildings and infrastructures, so a
timely advisory information to the civil protection is of great interest for
effective decision-making. For the first time, we applied to a new catalogue a
pattern recognition algorithm for cluster type forecasting that we developed
for all Italy (Gentili and Di Giovambattista, 2017). Thanks to the lower
completeness magnitude of the local OGS catalogue, compared to the national
one, and to a new version of the algorithm, we were able to lower the threshold
of the clusters mainshocks magnitude from 4.5 to 3.7. The method has been
validated by rigorous statistical tests. We tested the algorithm on the 1976

A cluster. Successful results were obtained also on other three smaller

stands out as an area of study that enables students to construct individually
realistic goals based on their current position. Via the expected score
provided by the ITS, a student can instantaneously compare one's expected score
to one's actual score, which directly corresponds to the reliability that the
ITS can instill. In other words, refining the precision of predicted scores
strictly correlates to the level of confidence that a student may have with an
ITS, which will evidently ensue improved student engagement. However, previous
studies have solely concentrated on improving the performance of a prediction
model, largely lacking focus on the benefits generated by its practical
application. In this paper, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the score
prediction model deployed in a real-world setting significantly impacts user
engagement by providing empirical evidence. To that end, we apply a
state-of-the-art deep attentive neural network-based score prediction model to

attentive neural networks, to verify whether the more accurate model engenders
any student engagement. The results conclude that the attentive model not only
induces high student morale (e.g. higher diagnostic test completion ratio,

voltage space with values in power space; both spaces have real Euclidean
coordinates. The central issue is a differential geometric analysis of the

present different methods for computing tangent vectors, tangent planes and
normals of the SSB and the normals' derivatives. Using the latter we compute
normal and principal curvatures. All this is needed for tracing the orthogonal
projection of points on curves in voltage or power space onto the SSB on points
closest to the given points on the curve, thus obtaining estimates for their
distance to the SSB. As another example how these concepts can be useful, we

catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Although we know about the cases of
using this method to preserve skills when adapting pre-trained networks to
particular tasks, it has not obtained widespread distribution yet. In this
paper, we would like to propose an alternative method of overcoming
catastrophic forgetting based on the total absolute signal passing through each
connection in the network. This method has a simple implementation and seems to
us essentially close to the processes occurring in the brain of animals to
preserve previously learned skills during subsequent learning. We hope that the
ease of implementation of this method will serve its wide application.

recognized from a long distance away, can be widely used in public security.
Considering 3D pose estimation is more challenging than 2D pose estimation in
practice , we research on using 2D joints to recognize gait in this paper, and
a new model-based gait recognition method JointsGait is put forward to extract
gait information from 2D human body joints. Appearance-based gait recognition
algorithms are prevalent before. However, appearance features suffer from
external factors which can cause drastic appearance variations, e.g. clothing.
Unlike previous approaches, JointsGait firstly extracted spatio-temporal
features from 2D joints using gait graph convolutional networks, which are less
interfered by external factors. Secondly, Joints Relationship Pyramid Mapping
(JRPM) are proposed to map spatio-temporal gait features into a discriminative
feature space with biological advantages according to the relationship of human
joints when people are walking at various scales. Finally, we design a fusion
loss strategy to help the joints features to be insensitive to cross-view. Our
method is evaluated on two large datasets, Kinect Gait Biometry Dataset and
CASIA-B. On Kinect Gait Biometry Dataset database, JointsGait only uses
corresponding 2D coordinates of joints, but achieves satisfactory recognition
accuracy compared with those model-based algorithms using 3D joints. On CASIA-B
database, the proposed method greatly outperforms advanced model-based methods
in all walking conditions, even performs superior to state-of-art
appearance-based methods when clothing seriously affect people's appearance.
The experimental results demonstrate that JointsGait achieves the state-of-art
performance despite the low dimensional feature (2D body joints) and is less
affected by the view variations and clothing variation.
