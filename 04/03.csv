  with Latent Variable Model","Accepted to CVPR 2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, driven by the increasing concern on diet and health, food computing
has attracted enormous attention from both industry and research community. One
of the most popular research topics in this domain is Food Retrieval, due to
its profound influence on health-oriented applications. In this paper, we focus
on the task of cross-modal retrieval between food images and cooking recipes.
We present Modality-Consistent Embedding Network (MCEN) that learns
modality-invariant representations by projecting images and texts to the same
embedding space. To capture the latent alignments between modalities, we
incorporate stochastic latent variables to explicitly exploit the interactions
between textual and visual features. Importantly, our method learns the
cross-modal alignments during training but computes embeddings of different
modalities independently at inference time for the sake of efficiency.
Extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed MCEN
outperforms all existing approaches on the benchmark Recipe1M dataset and
requires less computational cost.

of \emph{boosted-$t$ $+$ high-$p_{\rm T}$-$\ell$}. We consider all possible
vector LQ models within the Buchm\""{u}ller-R\""{u}ckl-Wyler classifications with
the desired decay. We propose simple phenomenological Lagrangians that are
suitable for bottom-up/experimental studies and, at the same time, can cover
the relevant parameter spaces of these models. In this simplified framework, we
study the pair and single production channels of vector LQs at the LHC.
Interestingly, we find that, like the pair production, the cross sections of
some single production processes also depend on the parameter $\kappa$ that
appears in the gluon-vector LQ coupling. We adopt a search strategy of
selecting events with at least one boosted hadronic top quark and exactly two
high-$p_{\rm T}$ leptons of the same flavor and opposite sign. This combines
events from the pair and single production processes and, therefore, can
enhance the discovery potential beyond that of the pair-production-only
searches. For $5\sigma$ discovery we find that vector LQs can be probed up to
$2.55$ TeV for $100\%$ branching ratio in the $t\ell $ decay mode and
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ new couplings at the $14$ TeV LHC with $3$ ab$^{-1}$ of

the position error between the road shape and the real lane, and a search-based

that today's sheer volume of accessible information, combined with consumers'

ideological fragmentation in the age of increased sharing. As social media,
search engines, and other real-time information sharing outlets purport to
facilitate access to information, a need for content filtering arises due to
the ensuing information overload. In general, consumers select information that
matches their individual views and values. The bias inherent in such selection
is echoed by today's information curation services that maximize user
engagement by filtering new content in accordance with observed consumer
preferences. Consequently, individuals get exposed to increasingly narrower
bands of the ideology spectrum, thus fragmenting society into increasingly
ideologically isolated enclaves. We call this dynamic the paradox of
information access. The model also suggests the disproportionate damage
attainable with a small infusion of well-positioned misinformation. The paper

the SNR asymptotically gets worse when the AAV's WV $A_w$ becomes large, i.e.,
in the case $g|A_w|^2>>1$, where $g$ is the measurement strength. (ii) With the
increase of $g$ (but also small), we find that the SNR is comparable to the
result under the AAV limit, while both can reach -- actually the former can
slightly exceed -- the SNR of the standard measurement. However, along a
further increase of $g$, the WV technique will become less efficient than the
standard measurement, despite that the postselection probability is increased.
(iii) We find that the Fisher information can characterize the estimate
precision qualitatively well as the SNR, yet their difference will become more
prominent with the increase of $g$. (iv) We carry out analytic expressions of
the SNR in the presence of technical noises and illustrate the particular
advantage of the imaginary WV measurement. The non-perturbative result of the

focus on processes with single and double proton dissociation. Highly excited
remnant systems hadronise producing particles that can be vetoed in the
calorimeter. We calculate associated gap survival factors. The gap survival
factors depend on the process, mass of the remnant system and collision energy.
The rapidity gap survival factor due to remnant fragmentation for double
dissociative (DD) collisions is smaller than that for single dissociative (SD)
process. We observe approximate factorisation: $S_{R,DD} \approx S_{R,SD}^2$
when imposing rapidity veto. For the $W^+W^-$ final state, the remnant
fragmentation leads to a taming of the cross section when the rapidity gap
requirement is imposed. Also for $t \bar t$ quark-antiquark pairs such a
condition reverses the hierarchy observed for the case when such condition is

tests. Dietary intake, which is also commonly collected by self-report and
subject to measurement error, is a major factor linked to diabetes and other
chronic diseases. These errors can bias exposure-disease associations that
ultimately can mislead clinical decision-making. We have extended an existing
semiparametric likelihood-based method for handling error-prone, discrete
failure time outcomes to also address covariate error. We conduct an extensive
numerical study to compare the proposed method to the naive approach that
ignores measurement error in terms of bias and efficiency in the estimation of
the regression parameter of interest. In all settings considered, the proposed
method showed minimal bias and maintained coverage probability, thus
outperforming the naive analysis which showed extreme bias and low coverage.
This method is applied to data from the Women's Health Initiative to assess the
association between energy and protein intake and the risk of incident diabetes
mellitus. Our results show that correcting for errors in both the self-reported
outcome and dietary exposures leads to considerably different hazard ratio
estimates than those from analyses that ignore measurement error, which
demonstrates the importance of correcting for both outcome and covariate error.

performance-critical component and explain why it works. Besides, we also
discover that Global Max Pooling works better in general when compared to
Global Average Pooling. Additionally, our proposed fast moving proxies also
addresses small gradient issue of proxies, and this component synergizes well
with low temperature scaling and Global Max Pooling. Our enhanced model, called
ProxyNCA++, achieves a 22.9 percentage point average improvement of Recall@1
across four different zero-shot retrieval datasets compared to the original
ProxyNCA algorithm. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the

  on the Lambert Function",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are ubiquitous in modern control theory, as
well as in a variety of other fields in science and engineering. Their analytic
centers, i.e. the maximum determinant elements of the feasible set spanned by
these LMIs, are the solution of many well-known problems in statistics,
communications, geometry, and control and can be approximated to arbitrary
precision by semidefinite programs (SDPs). The quality of these approximations
is measured with respect to the difference in log-determinant of both the exact
and the approximate solution to these SDPs, a quantity that follows directly
from the duality theory of semidefinite programming. However, in many
applications the relevant parameters are functions of the entries of the LMI
argument $X$. In these cases it is of interest to develop metrics that quantify
the quality of approximate solutions based on the error on these parameters,
something that the log-determinant error fails to capture due to the non-linear
interaction of all the matrix entries. In this work we develop upper bounds on
the Frobenius norm error between suboptimal solutions $X_f$ and the exact
optimizer $X_*$ of maximum determinant problems, a metric that provides a
direct translation to the entry-wise error of $X$ and thus to the relevant
parameters of the application. We show that these bounds can be expressed
through the use of the Lambert function $W(x)$, i.e. the solution of the
equation $W(x) e^{W(x)}= x$, and derive novel bounds for one of its branches to
generate efficient closed-form bounds on the Euclidean distance to the LMI
analytic center. Finally, we test the quality of these bounds numerically in
the context of interior point methods termination criteria.

on top of the XBWT tree transform of Ferragina et al. [FOCS 2005] and
generalizes the \emph{r-index} locate machinery of Gagie et al. [SODA 2018,
JACM 2020] based on the run-length encoded Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT). Our
first contribution is to propose a suitable generalization of the run-length
BWT to tries. We show that this natural generalization enjoys several of the
useful properties of its counterpart on strings: in particular, the transform
natively supports counting occurrences of a query pattern on the trie's paths
and its size $r$ captures the trie's repetitiveness and lower-bounds a natural
notion of trie entropy. Our main contribution is a much deeper insight into the
combinatorial structure of this object. In detail, we show that a data
structure of $O(r\log n) + 2n + o(n)$ bits, where $n$ is the number of nodes,
allows locating the $occ$ occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in
nearly-optimal $O(m\log\sigma + occ)$ time, where $\sigma$ is the alphabet's
size. Our solution consists in sampling $O(r)$ nodes that can be used as
""anchor points"" during the locate process. Once obtained the pre-order
identifier of the first pattern occurrence (in co-lexicographic order), we show
that a constant number of constant-time jumps between those anchor points lead
to the identifier of the next pattern occurrence, thus enabling locating in
optimal $O(1)$ time per occurrence.

existing solutions to this problem adopt the filtering-and-verification

of candidate graphs. However, they have a limitation that the number of
candidates grows extremely rapidly as a GED threshold increases. To address the
limitation, we propose a new approach that utilizes GED computation results in
generating candidate graphs. The main idea is that whenever we identify a
result graph of the query, we immediately regenerate candidate graphs using a
subset of pre-computed graphs similar to the identified result graph. To speed
up GED computation, we also develop a novel GED computation algorithm. The
proposed algorithm reduces the search space for GED computation by utilizing a
series of filtering techniques, which have been used to generate candidates in
existing solutions. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the
proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the art techniques.

non-analyticities in the Loschmidt echo, a phenomenon known as dynamical phase
transition (DPT). Despite considerable research into the underlying mechanisms
behind this phenomenon, several open questions still remain. Motivated by this,
we put forth a detailed study of DPTs from the perspective of quantum phase
space and entropy production, a key concept in thermodynamics. We focus on the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and use spin coherent states to construct the
corresponding Husimi-$Q$ quasi-probability distribution. The entropy of the
$Q$-function, known as Wehrl entropy, provides a measure of the coarse-grained
dynamics of the system and, therefore, evolves non-trivially even for closed
systems. We show that critical quenches lead to a quasi-monotonic growth of the
Wehrl entropy in time, combined with small oscillations. The former reflects
the information scrambling characteristic of these transitions and serves as a
measure of entropy production. On the other hand, the small oscillations imply
negative entropy production rates and, therefore, signal the recurrences of the
Loschmidt echo. Finally, we also study a Gaussification of the model based on a
modified Holstein-Primakoff approximation. This allows us to identify the
relative contribution of the low energy sector to the emergence of DPTs. The
results presented in this article are relevant not only from the dynamical
quantum phase transition perspective, but also for the field of quantum
thermodynamics, since they point out that the Wehrl entropy can be used as a
viable measure of entropy production.

evolution with larger variations of the wave-number spectrum. It also results
in an actual increase in intermittency as computed from the fitted exponents of

LIGO and Virgo pass through the LISA mHz frequency band at an earlier stage of
their orbital evolution,it is foreseen that their SGWB will also be observable
by LISA with Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) $\sim 53$. Unlike the stochastic
signal from Galactic white dwarf binaries, for which a subtraction is expected
to be possible by exploiting its yearly modulation (induced by the motion of
the LISA constellation), the background from unresolved stellar origin black
hole and neutron star binaries acts as a foreground for other stochastic
signals of cosmological or astrophysical origin, which may also be present in
the LISA band. Here, we employ a principal component analysis to model and
extract an additional hypothetical SGWB in the LISA band, without making any a
priori assumptions on its spectral shape. At the same time, we account for the
presence of the foreground from stellar origin black holes and neutron stars,
as well as for possible uncertainties in the LISA noise calibration. We find
that our technique leads to a linear problem and is therefore suitable for fast

variety of problems. When it comes to real-world scenarios such as
recommendation system and online advertising, however, it is essential to
consider the resource consumption of exploration. In practice, there is
typically non-zero cost associated with executing a recommendation (arm) in the
environment, and hence, the policy should be learned with a fixed exploration
cost constraint. It is challenging to learn a global optimal policy directly,
since it is a NP-hard problem and significantly complicates the exploration and
exploitation trade-off of bandit algorithms. Existing approaches focus on
solving the problems by adopting the greedy policy which estimates the expected
rewards and costs and uses a greedy selection based on each arm's expected
reward/cost ratio using historical observation until the exploration resource
is exhausted. However, existing methods are hard to extend to infinite time
horizon, since the learning process will be terminated when there is no more
resource. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical adaptive contextual bandit
method (HATCH) to conduct the policy learning of contextual bandits with a
budget constraint. HATCH adopts an adaptive method to allocate the exploration
resource based on the remaining resource/time and the estimation of reward
distribution among different user contexts. In addition, we utilize full of
contextual feature information to find the best personalized recommendation.
Finally, in order to prove the theoretical guarantee, we present a regret bound
analysis and prove that HATCH achieves a regret bound as low as $O(\sqrt{T})$.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed method on both synthetic data sets and the real-world applications.

predictive bandits, and focus on scenarios where the decision maker is allowed
to measure at most one arm per round. We derive asymptotic instance-specific
regret lower bounds for these problems, and develop algorithms whose regret
match these fundamental limits. We illustrate the performance of our algorithms

be achieved by using reward predictions, and investigate the impact of the

to make predictions regarding individual patients' behaviour in terms of taking

do this by leveraging a number of machine learning models. In particular, we
demonstrate the use of a connected IoT device; a ""Smart Sharps Bin"", invented

(w_1w_2)^\mu for all \mu >0. We study this process for scale-free percolation,
for (finite and infinite) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and for
Hyperbolic Random Graphs, all with power law degree distributions with exponent
\tau > 1. For \tau < 3, we find a threshold behaviour, depending on how fast
the cumulative distribution function of L decays at zero. If it decays at most
polynomially with exponent smaller than (3-\tau)/(2\mu) then explosion happens,
i.e., with positive probability we can reach infinitely many vertices with
finite cost (for the infinite models), or reach a linear fraction of all
vertices with bounded costs (for the finite models). On the other hand, if the
cdf of L decays at zero at least polynomially with exponent larger than
(3-\tau)/(2\mu), then no explosion happens. This behaviour is arguably a better
representation of information spreading processes in social networks than the
case without penalising factor, in which explosion always happens unless the
cdf of L is doubly exponentially flat around zero. Finally, we extend the
results to other penalty functions, including arbitrary polynomials in w_1 and
w_2. In some cases the interesting phenomenon occurs that the model changes
behaviour (from explosive to conservative and vice versa) when we reverse the
role of w_1 and w_2. Intuitively, this could corresponds to reversing the flow
of information: gathering information might take much longer than sending it
out.

from CH3 radicals to CH3CHO under the explored experimental conditions, likely
because the formation of the latter competes with the formation of larger
hydrocarbons. In addition, the conversion of NH2 into NH2CHO at 10 K increases
with the NH3 abundance in the ice, and also with the temperature in
CO-dominated CO:NH3 ices. This is consistent with the presence of a small NH2
and HCO reorientation barrier for the formation of NH2CHO, which is overcome
with an increase in the ice temperature. The measured NH2CHO and CH3CHO
formation efficiencies and rates are similar to those found during electron
irradiation of the same ice samples under comparable conditions, suggesting
that both UV photons and cosmic rays would have similar contributions to the
solid-state formation of these species in space. Finally, the measured
conversion yields (up to one order of magnitude higher for NH2CHO) suggest that
in circumstellar environments, where the observed NH2CHO/CH3CHO abundance ratio
is 0.1, there are likely additional ice and/or gas phase formation pathways for
CH3CHO.

results of the Solar-wind with Hydrogen Ion Exchange and Large-scale Dynamics
(SHIELD) model, a new, self-consistent, kinetic-MHD model of the outer
heliosphere within the Space Weather Modeling Framework. The charge-exchange
mean free path is on order of the size of the heliosphere; therefore, the
neutral atoms cannot be described as a fluid. The SHIELD model couples the MHD
solution for a single plasma fluid to the kinetic solution from for neutral
hydrogen atoms streaming through the system. The kinetic code is based on the
Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS), a Monte Carlo method for solving the
Boltzmann equation. The SHIELD model accurately predicts the increased
filtration of interstellar neutrals into the heliosphere. In order to verify
the correct implementation within the model, we compare the results of the
SHIELD model to other, well-established kinetic-MHD models. The SHIELD model
matches the neutral hydrogen solution of these studies as well as the shift in
all heliospheric boundaries closer to the Sun in comparison the the multi-fluid
treatment of the neutral hydrogen atoms. Overall the SHIELD model shows
excellent agreement to these models and is a significant improvement to the
fluid treatment of interstellar hydrogen.

a crucial step in extracting dynamical properties from quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. The average spectrum method provides an elegant solution by
integrating over all non-negative spectra weighted by how well they fit the
data. In a recent paper, we found that discretizing the functional integral as
in Feynman's path-integrals, does not have a well-defined continuum limit.
Instead, the limit depends on the discretization grid whose choice may strongly
bias the results. In this paper, we demonstrate that sampling the grid points,
instead of keeping them fixed, also changes the functional integral limit and
rather helps to overcome the bias considerably. We provide an efficient
algorithm for doing the sampling and show how the density of the grid points
acts now as a default model with a significantly reduced biasing effect. The
remaining bias depends mainly on the width of the grid density, so we go one
step further and average also over densities of different widths. For a certain
class of densities, including Gaussian and exponential ones, this width
averaging can be done analytically, eliminating the need to specify this
parameter without introducing any computational overhead.

probability, a common strategy is to design one that works with constant
probability, and then boost the probability using independent repetitions.
Important examples of this approach are small space algorithms for estimating
the number of distinct elements in a stream, or estimating the set similarity
between large sets. Using standard strongly universal hashing to process each
element, we get a sketch based estimator where the probability of a too large
error is, say, 1/4. By performing $r$ independent repetitions and taking the
median of the estimators, the error probability falls exponentially in $r$.
However, running $r$ independent experiments increases the processing time by a
factor $r$.
  Here we make the point that if we have a hash function with strong
concentration bounds, then we get the same high probability bounds without any
need for repetitions. Instead of $r$ independent sketches, we have a single
sketch that is $r$ times bigger, so the total space is the same. However, we
only apply a single hash function, so we save a factor $r$ in time, and the
overall algorithms just get simpler.
  Fast practical hash functions with strong concentration bounds were recently
proposed by Aamand em et al. (to appear in STOC 2020). Using their hashing
schemes, the algorithms thus become very fast and practical, suitable for
online processing of high volume data streams.

for our understanding of real observational data. In using synthetic data, one
can verify the extent to which source parameters can be recovered and evaluate
how various data corruption effects can be calibrated. These studies are
important when proposing observations of new sources, in the characterization
of the capabilities of new or upgraded instruments, and when verifying
model-based theoretical predictions in a comparison with observational data. We
present the SYnthetic Measurement creator for long Baseline Arrays (SYMBA), a
novel synthetic data generation pipeline for Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) observations. SYMBA takes into account several realistic atmospheric,
instrumental, and calibration effects. We used SYMBA to create synthetic
observations for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a mm VLBI array, which has
recently captured the first image of a black hole shadow. After testing SYMBA
with simple source and corruption models, we study the importance of including
all corruption and calibration effects. Based on two example general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) model images of M87, we performed
case studies to assess the attainable image quality with the current and future
EHT array for different weather conditions. The results show that the effects
of atmospheric and instrumental corruptions on the measured visibilities are
significant. Despite these effects, we demonstrate how the overall structure of
the input models can be recovered robustly after performing calibration steps.
With the planned addition of new stations to the EHT array, images could be
reconstructed with higher angular resolution and dynamic range. In our case
study, these improvements allowed for a distinction between a thermal and a
non-thermal GRMHD model based on salient features in reconstructed images.

the related covariant Poisson bracket if we restrict our attention to a single
flow in the hierarchy. Our framework offers an alternative approach to define

predicted knowledge graph triples. We first conduct an evaluation under the
standard closed-world assumption (CWA), in which predicted triples not already
in the knowledge graph are considered false, and show that existing calibration
techniques are effective for KGE under this common but narrow assumption. Next,
we introduce the more realistic but challenging open-world assumption (OWA), in
which unobserved predictions are not considered true or false until
ground-truth labels are obtained. Here, we show that existing calibration
techniques are much less effective under the OWA than the CWA, and provide
explanations for this discrepancy. Finally, to motivate the utility of
calibration for KGE from a practitioner's perspective, we conduct a unique case
study of human-AI collaboration, showing that calibrated predictions can
improve human performance in a knowledge graph completion task.

In contrast, we propose a general-purpose method that works on both indoor and

bounding box parameters are estimated in one pass for every point, aggregated

latent codes representing the shape of each detected object. The latent shape
space and shape decoder are learned on a synthetic dataset and then used as

Thus our model is able to extract shapes without access to ground-truth shape

generating synthetic low-resolution (LR) images $\mathcal{Y}^g$ corresponding
to real-world high-resolution (HR) images $\mathcal{X}^r$ in the real-world LR
domain $\mathcal{Y}^r$, and then utilizing the pseudo pairs $\{\mathcal{Y}^g,

image translation itself is an extremely challenging task, the SR performance
of these approaches are severely limited by the domain gap between generated
synthetic LR images and real LR images. In this paper, we propose a novel
domain-distance aware super-resolution (DASR) approach for unsupervised
real-world image SR. The domain gap between training data (e.g.
$\mathcal{Y}^g$) and testing data (e.g. $\mathcal{Y}^r$) is addressed with our

from real data in the target domain while domain-distance weighted supervision
brings forward the more rational use of labeled source domain data. The

inter-particle separation and are therefore well described as a set of
classical waves. This applies to, for instance, the QCD axion as well as to
lighter axion-like particles such as fuzzy dark matter. We show that the
interference of waves inside a halo inevitably leads to vortices, locations
where chance destructive interference takes the density to zero. The phase of
the wavefunction has non-trivial winding around these points. This can be
interpreted as a non-zero velocity circulation, so that vortices are sites
where the fluid velocity has a non-vanishing curl. Using analytic arguments and
numerical simulations, we study the properties of vortices and show they have a
number of universal features: (1) In three spatial dimensions, the generic
defects take the form of vortex rings. (2) On average there is about one vortex
ring per de Broglie volume and (3) generically only single winding ($\pm 1$)
vortices are found in a realistic halo. (4) The density near a vortex scales as
$r^2$ while the velocity goes as $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance to vortex.
(5) A vortex segment moves at a velocity inversely proportional to its
curvature scale so that smaller vortex rings move faster, allowing momentary
motion exceeding escape velocity. We discuss observational/experimental
signatures from vortices and, more broadly, wave interference. In the
ultra-light regime, gravitational lensing by interference substructures leads
to flux anomalies of $5-10 \%$ in strongly lensed systems. For QCD axions,
vortices lead to a diminished signal in some detection experiments but not in
others. We advocate the measurement of correlation functions by axion detection
experiments as a way to probe and capitalize on the expected interference
substructures.

practically impossible. However, remarkably, due to rapid progress in quantum
information science (QIS), such tests may soon be achievable. Here, we uncover
an exciting new theoretical link between QG and QIS that also leads to a
radical new way of testing QG with QIS experiments. Specifically, we find that
only a quantum, not classical, theory of gravity can create non-Gaussianity, a
QIS resource that is necessary for universal quantum computation, in the
quantum field state of matter. This allows for tests based on QIS in which
non-Gaussianity in matter is used as a signature of QG. In comparison to
previous studies of testing QG with QIS where entanglement is used to witness
QG when all other quantum interactions are excluded, our non-Gaussianity
witness cannot be created by direct classical gravity interactions,
facilitating tests that are not constrained by the existence of such processes.
Our new signature of QG also enables tests that are based on just a single
rather than multi-partite quantum system, simplifying previously considered
experimental setups. We describe a table-top test of QG that uses our
non-Gaussianity signature and which is based on just a single quantum system, a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in a single location. In contrast to proposals
based on opto-mechanical setups, BECs have already been manipulated into
massive non-classical states, aiding the prospect of testing QG in the near
future.

approximating them as Gaussian Processes (GPs). A DNN trained with gradient
flow was shown to map to a GP governed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK),
whereas earlier works showed that a DNN with an i.i.d. prior over its weights
maps to the so-called Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). Here we consider
a DNN training protocol, involving noise, weight decay and finite width, whose
outcome corresponds to a certain non-Gaussian stochastic process. An analytical
framework is then introduced to analyze this non-Gaussian process, whose
deviation from a GP is controlled by the finite width. Our contribution is
three-fold: (i) In the infinite width limit, we establish a correspondence
between DNNs trained with noisy gradients and the NNGP, not the NTK. (ii) We
provide a general analytical form for the finite width correction (FWC) for
DNNs with arbitrary activation functions and depth and use it to predict the
outputs of empirical finite networks with high accuracy. Analyzing the FWC
behavior as a function of $n$, the training set size, we find that it is
negligible for both the very small $n$ regime, and, surprisingly, for the large
$n$ regime (where the GP error scales as $O(1/n)$). (iii) We flesh out
algebraically how these FWCs can improve the performance of finite

compared to a control sample of central galaxies mass-matched at accretion.
Most cluster discs become non-discy by $z=0$, in stark contrast with the
control discs, of which a significant fraction remains discy over the same
timescales. Cluster discs become non-discy accompanied by gas removal and star
formation quenching, loss of dark matter and little growth or a loss of stellar
mass. In contrast, control discs transform while also losing gas mass and
quenching, but growing significantly in dark matter and stellar mass. Most
cluster satellites change morphologies on similar timescales regardless of
stellar mass, in $\sim0.5-4$ Gyr after accretion. Cluster discs that
experienced more numerous and closer pericentric passages show the largest
change in morphology. Morphological change in all cases requires the presence
of a gravitational perturbation to drive stellar orbits to non-discy
configurations, along with gas removal/heating to prevent replenishment of the
disc through continued star-formation. For cluster discs, the perturbation is
impulsive tidal shocking at pericentres and not tidal stripping of outer disc
stellar material, whereas for control discs, a combination of mergers and AGN
feedback appears to be the key driving force behind morphological
transformations.

developing such a technique by generalizing our previous, fully ab initio
finite temperature Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (FT-AFQMC) method to
model periodic solids and employing it to uncover the finite temperature
physics of periodic hydrogen chains. Based upon our calculations of these
chains' many-body thermodynamic quantities and correlation functions, we
outline their metal-insulator and magnetic ordering as a function of both H-H
bond distance and temperature. At low temperatures approaching the ground
state, we observe both metal-insulator and ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic
crossovers at bond lengths between 0.5 and 0.75 {\AA}. We then demonstrate how
this low-temperature ordering evolves into a metallic phase with decreasing
magnetic order at higher temperatures. By comparing the features we observe to
those previously seen in one-dimensional, half-filled Hubbard models at finite
temperature and in ground state hydrogen chains, interestingly, we identify
signatures of the Pomeranchuk effect in hydrogen chains for the first time and
show that spin and charge excitations that typically arise at distinct
temperatures in the Hubbard model are indistinguishably coupled in these
systems. Beyond qualitatively revealing the many-body phase behavior of
hydrogen chains, our efforts shed light on the further theoretical developments

able to search for similar and deviating trends across different galaxies. We
investigate the mass dependence of the individual systems on the production of
$\alpha$-elements, but also try to shed light on the long-standing puzzle of
the dominant production site of r-process elements. We use data from the Keck

$13$ dSph galaxies. We automatize the step of obtaining stellar parameters, but
run a full spectrum synthesis to derive all abundances except for iron. The
homogenized set of abundances yielded the unique possibility to derive a
relation between the onset of type Ia supernovae and the stellar mass of the
galaxy. Furthermore, we derived a formula to estimate the evolution of
$\alpha$-elements. Placing all abundances consistently on the same scale is
crucial to answer questions about the chemical history of galaxies. By
homogeneously analysing Ba and Eu in the 13 systems, we have traced the onset
of the s-process and found it to increase with metallicity as a function of the
galaxy's stellar mass. Moreover, the r-process material correlates with the
$\alpha$-elements indicating some co-production of these, which in turn would
point towards rare core-collapse supernovae rather than binary neutron star
mergers as host for the r-process at low [Fe/H] in the investigated dSph

red QSOs are $\times 3$ more common than typical QSOs, but the excess
diminishes among the most radio-loud and the most radio-quiet systems in our

formation is an important source of low-frequency emission among radio-quiet

insight into these physical differences, here we use the DR14 Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) and more sensitive, higher resolution radio data from the Very
Large Array (VLA) Stripe 82 (S82) and VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz (C3GHz) surveys. With
the S82 data, we perform morphological analyses at a resolution and depth three
times that of the FIRST radio survey, and confirm an enhancement in radio-faint
and compact red quasars over typical quasars; we now also find tentative
evidence for an enhancement in red quasars with slightly extended radio
structures ($16-43$ kpc at $z=1.5$). These analyses are complemented by C3GHz,
which is deep enough to detect radio emission from star-formation processes.
From our data we find that the radio enhancement from red quasars is due to AGN
activity on compact scales ($< 43$ kpc) for radio-intermediate-radio-quiet
sources ($-5<R<-3.4$, where $R=L_{1.4GHz}/L_{6 \mu m}$), which decreases at
$R<-5$ as the radio emission from star-formation starts to dilute the AGN
component. Overall our results argue against a simple orientation scenario and
are consistent with red quasars representing a younger, earlier phase in the
overall evolution of quasars.

systems consisting of a neutron star and a low- or intermediate-mass donor star

account beaming effects, stellar rotation, general angular momentum losses, and
a detailed and self-consistent calculation of the mass-transfer rate. We study
the conditions that lead to dynamical stability of these systems, which depends
strongly on the response of the donor star to mass loss. Using two values for

likelihood of detection, the types of white-dwarf remnants left behind by the
donors, and the total amount of mass accreted by the neutron stars. We also
compare our results to the observed pulsating ULXs. Our results suggest that a

anomaly-free $Z^\prime$-models a NP-interpretation of $\Delta A_{\text{CP}}$
suggests measurable CP-asymmetries in semileptonic decays such as $D \to \pi\,
\ell^+ \ell^-$ or $D \to \pi \pi\, \ell^+ \ell^-$. Conversely, an observation
of CP-violation in $c \to u\, e^+ e^-$ or $c \to u\, \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays
supports a NP--interpretation of $\Delta A_{\text{CP}}$. Flavorful
$U(1)^\prime$-extensions provide explicit U--spin and isospin breaking which
can be probed in patterns of hadronic decays of charm mesons. We work out
signatures for CP-asymmetries in $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$, $D^0 \to K^+ K^-$ and
$D^0 \to \pi^0 \pi^0$, $D^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0$ decays, which can be probed in the
future at LHCb and Belle II and provide further informative cross checks.

uses sparse radial trajectories to accelerate imaging speed. Errors in the
radial k-space trajectories are measured using a special k-space trajectory
mapping sequence and corrected for image reconstruction. A physical
compartmental model is used to fit the measured multi-echo MR signals to obtain
fractions of water, fat and bone components for each voxel, which are then used
to estimate the continuous LAC map for PET attenuation correction. The
performance of the proposed method was evaluated via phantom and in vivo human
studies, using LACs from Computed Tomography (CT) as reference. Compared to
Dixon- and atlas-based MRAC methods, the proposed method yielded PET images
with higher correlation and similarity in relation to the reference. The
relative absolute errors of PET activity values reconstructed by the proposed
method were below 5% in all of the four lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal,

small molecules targeting novel viral proteins with high affinity and
off-target selectivity. CogMol combines adaptive pre-training of a molecular
SMILES Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and an efficient multi-attribute
controlled sampling scheme that uses guidance from attribute predictors trained
on latent features. To generate novel and optimal drug-like molecules for
unseen viral targets, CogMol leverages a protein-molecule binding affinity
predictor that is trained using SMILES VAE embeddings and protein sequence
embeddings learned unsupervised from a large corpus. CogMol framework is
applied to three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins: main protease, receptor-binding
domain of the spike protein, and non-structural protein 9 replicase. The
generated candidates are novel at both molecular and chemical scaffold levels
when compared to the training data. CogMol also includes insilico screening for
assessing toxicity of parent molecules and their metabolites with a multi-task
toxicity classifier, synthetic feasibility with a chemical retrosynthesis
predictor, and target structure binding with docking simulations. Docking
reveals favorable binding of generated molecules to the target protein
structure, where 87-95 % of high affinity molecules showed docking free energy
< -6 kcal/mol. When compared to approved drugs, the majority of designed
compounds show low parent molecule and metabolite toxicity and high synthetic
feasibility. In summary, CogMol handles multi-constraint design of
synthesizable, low-toxic, drug-like molecules with high target specificity and
selectivity, and does not need target-dependent fine-tuning of the framework or
target structure information.

metrology. In this work, based on continuous-variable models, we propose a new
design of the signal-probe Hamiltonian which generates an exponential
enhancement of measurement sensitivity. The key idea is to include into the
system an ancilla that does not couple directly to the signal. An immediate
benefit of such design is one can expand quantum Fisher information(QFI) into a
power series in time, making it possible to achieve a higher-order time scaling
in QFI. Specifically, one can design the interaction for a qubit-oscillator
Ramsey interferometer to achieve a quartic time scaling, based on which, one
can further design a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators to achieve an
exponential time scaling in QFI. Our results show that linear scaling in both
time and the number of coupling terms is sufficient to obtain exponential
enhancement. Such exponential advantage is closely related to the
characteristic commutation relations of quadratures.

propose a neural network framework utilizing short-sequence information in
language recognition. In particular, a new model is proposed for incorporating
relevance in language recognition, where parts of speech data are weighted more
based on their relevance for the language recognition task. This relevance
weighting is achieved using the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)

uses segment level i-vector/x-vector representations that are aggregated in the

modeled in an end-to-end neural model. Experiments are performed using the

the mathematical formalism that supports quantum mechanics. The method uses
projective quantum measurement as a way of building a prediction function.
Specifically, the relationship between input and output variables is
represented as the state of a bipartite quantum system. The state is estimated
from training samples through an averaging process that produces a density
matrix. Prediction of the label for a new sample is made by performing a
projective measurement on the bipartite system with an operator, prepared from
the new input sample, and applying a partial trace to obtain the state of the
subsystem representing the output. The method can be seen as a generalization
of Bayesian inference classification and as a type of kernel-based learning
method. One remarkable characteristic of the method is that it does not require
learning any parameters through optimization. We illustrate the method with
different 2-D classification benchmark problems and different quantum
information encodings.

given query shape and present a novel deep deformation-aware embedding to solve
this retrieval task. 3D model retrieval is a fundamental operation for
recovering a clean and complete 3D model from a noisy and partial 3D scan.
However, given a finite collection of 3D shapes, even the closest model to a
query may not be satisfactory. This motivates us to apply 3D model deformation
techniques to adapt the retrieved model so as to better fit the query. Yet,
certain restrictions are enforced in most 3D deformation techniques to preserve
important features of the original model that prevent a perfect fitting of the
deformed model to the query. This gap between the deformed model and the query
induces asymmetric relationships among the models, which cannot be handled by
typical metric learning techniques. Thus, to retrieve the best models for
fitting, we propose a novel deep embedding approach that learns the asymmetric
relationships by leveraging location-dependent egocentric distance fields. We
also propose two strategies for training the embedding network. We demonstrate
that both of these approaches outperform other baselines in our experiments
with both synthetic and real data. Our project page can be found at

of minimal obstructions (forbidden induced subgraphs minimal with the property
of not having an $M$-partition).
  It is known that for every $3 \times 3$ matrix $M$ over $\{ 0, 1, \ast \}$,
there are finitely many chordal minimal obstructions for the problem of
determining whether a graph admits an $M$-partition, except for two matrices,
$M_1 = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0 & \ast & \ast \\ \ast & 0 & 1 \\ \ast & 1 &

received much attention since the seminal theoretical work of Turing on

place under the influence of large fluctuations. It is then natural to inquire
about the precision of such pattern. In particular, spontaneous pattern
formation is a nonequilibrium phenomenon, and the relation between the
precision of a pattern and the thermodynamic cost associated with it remains
unexplored. Here, we analyze this relation with a paradigmatic stochastic
reaction-diffusion model, the Brusselator in one spatial dimension. We find
that the precision of the pattern is maximized for an intermediate
thermodynamic cost, i.e., increasing the thermodynamic cost beyond this value
makes the pattern less precise. Even though fluctuations get less pronounced
with an increase in thermodynamic cost, we argue that larger fluctuations can
also have a positive effect on the precision of the pattern.

the supremum over equivalent admissible probability measures to the reference

second one is a penalty for the adversary player for deviating from the

spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan, P.R. China, and subsequently, across the
world. The swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealth
transmissions in which infected patients may be asymptomatic. Undetected
transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus
and pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been
asked by the public is ""Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?"". While
different regions established their own criteria for screening infected cases,
the screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and
understanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The
shortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our
ability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians
are facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands.
On one hand, they are striving to achieve the best outcome by optimizing the
usage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are challenged by the
patients' frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not being
tested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under
investigation). In this paper, we evaluate the situation from the statistical
viewpoint by factoring into the considerations of the uncertainty and
inaccuracy of the test, an issue that is often overlooked by the general
public. We aim to shed light on the tough situation by providing evidence-based
reasoning from the statistical angle, and we expect this examination will help
the general public understand and assess the situation rationally. Most
importantly, the development offers recommendations for physicians to make
sensible evaluations to optimally use the limited resources for the best

develop an algorithm to link dendrogram structures through time using the
three-dimensional density field from magnetohydrodynamical simulations, thus
creating histories for all dense cores in the domain. We find that the
population-wide distributions of core properties are relatively invariant in
time, and quantities like the core mass function match with observations.
Despite this consistency, an individual core may undergo large (>40%),
stochastic variations due to the redefinition of the dendrogram structure
between timesteps. This variation occurs independent of environment and stellar
content. We identify a population of short-lived (<200 kyr) overdensities
masquerading as dense cores that may comprise ~20% of any time snapshot.
Finally, we note the importance of considering the full history of cores when
interpreting the origin of the initial mass function; we find that, especially
for systems containing multiple stars, the core mass defined by a dendrogram
leaf in a snapshot is typically less than the final system stellar mass. This
work reinforces that there is no time-stable density contour that defines a
star-forming core. The dendrogram itself can induce significant structure
variation between timesteps due to small changes in the density field. Thus,
one must use caution when comparing dendrograms of regions with different ages
or environment properties because differences in dendrogram structure may not
come solely from the physical evolution of dense cores.

absence of different types of memory effects. The fragile and jammed states
exhibit memory, while the elastic and pinning dominated regimes do not. In the
fragile regime, the system organizes into a pinned state during the first drive
pulse, flows during the second drive pulse which is applied in the
perpendicular direction, and then returns to a pinned state during the third
drive pulse which is applied in the same direction as the first pulse. This
behavior is the hallmark of fragility that has been proposed for jamming in
particulate matter by Cates et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1841 (1998)]. For
stronger disorder, we observe a robust jamming state in which a memory effect
is still present but the system reaches a pinned or reduced flow state during
the perpendicular drive pulse, similar to what appears in granular systems
under shear jamming. We show that the different states produce signatures in
the spatial vortex configurations, with memory effects arising from the
coexistence of an elastic component and a pinned component in the vortex
assembly. The sequential perpendicular driving protocol we propose for

Notably, despite significant advances in integrated electro-optic modulators,
related acousto-optic modulator concepts have remained relatively unexplored in

modulation within silicon waveguides using electrically-driven surface acoustic
waves (SAWs). By co-integrating SAW transducers in piezoelectric AlN with a

elasto-optic effect to mediate linear light-sound coupling. Through
lithographic design, acousto-optic phase and single-sideband amplitude
modulators in the range of 1-5 GHz are fabricated, exhibiting index modulation
strengths comparable to existing electro-optic technologies. Extending this
traveling-wave, acousto-optic interaction to cm-scales, we create

operation bandwidths of >100 GHz and insertion losses <0.6 dB are achieved.

modulation, necessary for a robust acousto-optic isolator, is within reach. The
acousto-optic modulator design is compatible with both CMOS fabrication and
existing silicon photonic device technologies. These results represent a
promising new approach to implement compact and scalable acousto-optic
modulators, frequency-shifters, and non-magnetic optical isolators and
circulators in integrated photonic circuits.

diagnosis of respiratory diseases, we propose, develop and test an Artificial

deployable via a smartphone app. The app, named AI4COVID-19 records and sends
three 3-second cough sounds to an AI engine running in the cloud, and returns a
result within two minutes. Methods: Cough is a symptom of over thirty
non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the diagnosis of a COVID-19
infection by cough alone an extremely challenging multidisciplinary problem. We
address this problem by investigating the distinctness of pathomorphological
alterations in the respiratory system induced by COVID-19 infection when
compared to other respiratory infections. To overcome the COVID-19 cough
training data shortage we exploit transfer learning. To reduce the misdiagnosis
risk stemming from the complex dimensionality of the problem, we leverage a
multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture. Results: Results
show AI4COVID-19 can distinguish among COVID-19 coughs and several types of
non-COVID-19 coughs. The accuracy is promising enough to encourage a
large-scale collection of labeled cough data to gauge the generalization
capability of AI4COVID-19. AI4COVID-19 is not a clinical grade testing tool.
Instead, it offers a screening tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone. It
can also be a clinical decision assistance tool used to channel
clinical-testing and treatment to those who need it the most, thereby saving
more lives.

the justification of coarse-graining, the approach to equilibrium and the arrow

videos due to their rich yet redundant information over space and time.
However, introducing attention in a deep neural network for action recognition
is challenging for two reasons. First, an effective attention module needs to
learn what (objects and their local motion patterns), where (spatially), and
when (temporally) to focus on. Second, a video attention module must be
efficient because existing action recognition models already suffer from high
computational cost. To address both challenges, a novel What-Where-When (W3)
video attention module is proposed. Departing from existing alternatives, our
W3 module models all three facets of video attention jointly. Crucially, it is
extremely efficient by factorizing the high-dimensional video feature data into
low-dimensional meaningful spaces (1D channel vector for `what' and 2D spatial
tensors for `where'), followed by lightweight temporal attention reasoning.
Extensive experiments show that our attention model brings significant
improvements to existing action recognition models, achieving new
state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmarks.

Pearson correlation coefficient between method prediction and ground truth for

controls had a predicted PO of less than 1%, 2 had between 1-2%. Automated
processing time to compute the severity scores was 10 seconds per case compared

studies of the Holstein model. Conventional wisdom says that Eliashberg theory
is applicable as long as vertex corrections remain small. For small ratio of
the phonon energy $\Omega_0$ and the Fermi energy $E_F$, this condition is
supposed to hold even when the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$
is larger than one, i.e., in the strong coupling regime. A comparison between
various quantities computed in the Migdal approximation and those computed by
Quantum Monte Carlo prove that this belief is wrong, and we identify
analytically some of the ways in which this breakdown occurs for various
""normal state"" properties at $\lambda = \lambda_{cr}$, where $\lambda_{cr} =
O(1)$. The breakdown occurs at temperatures high enough that neither
superconducting nor charge-density wave correlations extend over any
significant range of distances, so it cannot be associated with the onset of an
instability toward any of the relevant ordered ground-states - rather it is
associated with the local physics of classical bipolaron formation. Still, we
show that certain properties, including the superconducting $T_c$ and the
superconducting gap structure below $T_c$, can be accurately inferred from the
strong-coupling limit of Eliashberg theory at $\lambda \leq \lambda_{cr}$.

algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a decentralized framework
named RACE: Reinforced Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Collision AvoidancE.
Leveraging a hierarchical architecture we develop an algorithm named Co-DDPG to
efficiently train autonomous vehicles. Through a security abiding channel, the
autonomous vehicles distribute their driving policies. We use the relative
distances obtained by the opponent sensors to build the VANET instead of
locations, which ensures the vehicle's location privacy. With a leader-follower
architecture and parameter distribution, RACE accelerates the learning of
optimal policies and efficiently utilizes the remaining resources. We implement
the RACE framework in the widely used TORCS simulator and conduct various
experiments to measure the performance of RACE. Evaluations show that RACE
quickly learns optimal driving policies and effectively avoids collisions.
Moreover, RACE also scales smoothly with varying number of participating
vehicles. We further compared RACE with existing autonomous driving systems and
show that RACE outperforms them by experiencing 65% less collisions in the
training process and exhibits improved performance under varying vehicle
density.

learning models that imitate human driving behavior. Most of today's autonomous
driving datasets contain only a few trajectories per location and are recorded
with test vehicles that are cautiously driven by trained drivers. In particular
in interactive scenarios such as highway merges, the test driver's behavior
significantly influences other vehicles. This influence prevents recording the
whole traffic space of human driving behavior. In this work, we present a novel
methodology to extract trajectories of traffic objects using infrastructure
sensors. Infrastructure sensors allow us to record a lot of data for one
location and take the test drivers out of the loop. We develop both a hardware
setup consisting of a camera and a traffic surveillance radar and a trajectory
extraction algorithm. Our vision pipeline accurately detects objects, fuses
camera and radar detections and tracks them over time. We improve a
state-of-the-art object tracker by combining the tracking in image coordinates
with a Kalman filter in road coordinates. We show that our sensor fusion
approach successfully combines the advantages of camera and radar detections
and outperforms either single sensor. Finally, we also evaluate the accuracy of
our trajectory extraction pipeline. For that, we equip our test vehicle with a
differential GPS sensor and use it to collect ground truth trajectories. With
this data we compute the measurement errors. While we use the mean error to
de-bias the trajectories, the error standard deviation is in the magnitude of
the ground truth data inaccuracy. Hence, the extracted trajectories are not

in a diverse range of fields. Although spectral clustering is a popular and
effective method, it fails to consider higher-order structure and can perform
poorly on directed networks. One approach is to capture and cluster
higher-order structures using motif adjacency matrices. However, current
formulations fail to take edge weights into account, and thus are somewhat
limited when weight is a key component of the network under study.
  We address these shortcomings by exploring motif-based weighted spectral
clustering methods. We present new and computationally useful matrix formulae
for motif adjacency matrices on weighted networks, which can be used to
construct efficient algorithms for any anchored or non-anchored motif on three
nodes. In a very sparse regime, our proposed method can handle graphs with a
million nodes and tens of millions of edges. We further use our framework to
construct a motif-based approach for clustering bipartite networks.

and times given a collection of images of a dynamic scene. A key challenge for
the novel view synthesis arises from dynamic scene reconstruction where
epipolar geometry does not apply to the local motion of dynamic contents. To
address this challenge, we propose to combine the depth from single view (DSV)
and the depth from multi-view stereo (DMV), where DSV is complete, i.e., a
depth is assigned to every pixel, yet view-variant in its scale, while DMV is
view-invariant yet incomplete. Our insight is that although its scale and
quality are inconsistent with other views, the depth estimation from a single
view can be used to reason about the globally coherent geometry of dynamic
contents. We cast this problem as learning to correct the scale of DSV, and to
refine each depth with locally consistent motions between views to form a
coherent depth estimation. We integrate these tasks into a depth fusion network
in a self-supervised fashion. Given the fused depth maps, we synthesize a
photorealistic virtual view in a specific location and time with our deep
blending network that completes the scene and renders the virtual view. We
evaluate our method of depth estimation and view synthesis on diverse
real-world dynamic scenes and show the outstanding performance over existing
methods.

develop a novel event-triggered distributed learning rule that is based on the

the complex broad Ha and Hb lines. This is especially seen in Ha which appears
to be double-peaked. It seems that a very broad component of ~10,000 km/s in
width in the Balmer lines is appearing. The trends in the optical, UV, and
X-ray light curves are similar, with the amplitudes of variability being
significantly larger in the case of UV and X-ray bands. The increase of the
continuum emission, the variability of the coronal lines, and the very broad
component in the Balmer lines may indicate that the AGN of NGC 3516 is finally
leaving the low-activity state in which it has been for the last ~3 years.

nanostructures on suspended graphene field effect transistors using AC-EBL,
focusing on the in situ characterization of the impact of electron beam
exposure on device electronic transport quality. When AC-EBL is performed on a
graphene channel (local exposure) or on the outside vicinity of a graphene
channel (non-local exposure), the charge transport characteristics of graphene
can be significantly affected due to charge doping and scattering. While the
detrimental effect of non-local exposure can be largely removed by vigorous
annealing, local-exposure induced damage is irreversible and cannot be fixed by
annealing. We discuss the possible causes of the observed exposure effects. Our
results provide guidance to the future development of high-energy electron beam

construct achieve macro-F1 average performance scores of up to 83 per cent. Our
results show that job ads data and employment statistics were the highest

which makes the learning problem harder, resulting in degraded performance and
limited generalization in indoor environments and long-sequence visual odometry
application. To address this issue, we propose a novel system that explicitly
disentangles scale from the network estimation. Instead of relying on PoseNet
architecture, our method recovers relative pose by directly solving fundamental
matrix from dense optical flow correspondence and makes use of a two-view
triangulation module to recover an up-to-scale 3D structure. Then, we align the
scale of the depth prediction with the triangulated point cloud and use the
transformed depth map for depth error computation and dense reprojection check.
Our whole system can be jointly trained end-to-end. Extensive experiments show
that our system not only reaches state-of-the-art performance on KITTI depth

of existing self-supervised depth-pose learning methods under a variety of
challenging scenarios, and achieves state-of-the-art results among

agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical
resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is
applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19
pandemic by the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the US Department of
Homeland Security (FEMA) to different states in the US. Findings suggest that
if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19
patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be
nearly adequate to meet the projected needs. However, when more than 75% of the
available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients,
various degrees of shortfall are expected. In an extreme case, where the demand
is assumed to be concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast
confidence interval, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till
05/31/20) is about 28,500 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 2,700

worse-than-average to severe demand scenario cases, NY requires between
7,600-9,200 additional ventilators for COVID-19 patients during its peak

  Multiparty session types (MPST) provide a framework for verifying conformance

neglect the event-driven nature of web applications, or lack compatibility with

describes the interactions of the global communication protocol observed by the

electron-hole excitations by the electric field. We find a general connection

In coherent evolution, the electron-hole coherence can manifest as a sizeable
ac Hall velocity. When environmental noise is taken into account, its joint
action with the electric field favors a form of electron-hole coherence that is
function of wavevector and field only, leading to a dc nonlinear Hall effect.
The Hall current has all odd order terms in field, and still retains the

the method uses penalty terms to constrain the elements of the precision

be inferred from the parental walk. We show that this is is the case for a lazy

number density profile of UDGs in the three clusters. The number density
profiles of UDGs and bright galaxies show a discrepancy in the central region
of the clusters: the profile of UDGs shows a flattening as clustercentric
distance decreases, while that of bright galaxies shows a continuous increase.
This implies that UDGs are prone to disruption in the central region of the
clusters. The relation between the abundance of UDGs and virial masses of their
host systems is described by a power-law with an index nearly one: $N({\rm
UDG})\propto M_{200}^{0.99\pm0.05}$ for $M_{200}>10^{13}~M_{\odot}$. We
estimate approximately dynamical masses of UDGs using the fundamental manifold
method, and find that most UDGs have dwarf-like masses $(M_{200}<10^{11}$
$M_{\odot})$. This implies that most UDGs have a dwarf-like origin and a small
number of them could be failed $L^{*}$ galaxies. These results suggest that
multiple origins may contribute to the formation and evolution of UDGs in
massive galaxy clusters.

reducing the computational complexity to be linear with the total number of

topic, with benefits of not requiring expensive 3D data. However, most work in
this direction requires multi-view images for each object instance as training
supervision, which oftentimes does not apply in practice. In this paper, we
relax the common multi-view assumption and explore a more challenging yet more
realistic setup of learning 3D shape from only single-view images. The major
difficulty lies in insufficient constraints that can be provided by single view
images, which leads to the problem of pose entanglement in learned shape space.
As a result, reconstructed shapes vary along input pose and have poor accuracy.
We address this problem by taking a novel domain adaptation perspective, and
propose an effective adversarial domain confusion method to learn
pose-disentangled compact shape space. Experiments on single-view
reconstruction show effectiveness in solving pose entanglement, and the

scheme for implementing a one-sided matching market using the power of a
pricing mechanism. Their method has nice properties -- it is incentive
compatible in the large and produces an allocation that is Pareto optimal --
and hence it provides an attractive, off-the-shelf method for running an
application involving such a market. With matching markets becoming ever more
prevalant and impactful, it is imperative to finally settle the computational
complexity of this scheme.
  We present the following partial resolution:
  1. A combinatorial, strongly polynomial time algorithm for the special case
of $0/1$ utilities.
  2. An example that has only irrational equilibria, hence proving that this
problem is not in PPAD. Furthermore, its equilibria are disconnected, hence
showing that the problem does not admit a convex programming formulation.
  3. A proof of membership of the problem in the class FIXP.
  We leave open the (difficult) question of determining if the problem is
FIXP-hard. Settling the status of the special case when utilities are in the
set $\{0, {\frac 1 2}, 1 \}$ appears to be even more difficult.

encoding. The ISP rendering begins with a white-balance procedure that is used
to remove the color cast of the scene's illumination. The ISP then applies a
series of nonlinear color manipulations to enhance the visual quality of the

modulate the field-like SOT in W/CoFeB/MgO trilayers through tuning the
interfacial spin accumulation. By performing spin Hall magnetoresistance
measurement, we find that the CoFeB with enhanced spin dephasing, either
generated from larger layer thickness or from proper annealing, can distinctly
boost the spin absorption and enhance the interfacial spin mixing conductance
G_r. While the damping-like torque efficiency increases with G_r, the
field-like torque efficiency turns out to decrease with it. The results suggest
that the interfacial spin accumulation, which largely contributes to a

have downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) to optimize downlink
transmissions by beamforming. The DL CSI is usually measured at mobile stations
(MSs) through DL training and fed back to the BS in frequency division
duplexing (FDD). The DL training and uplink (UL) feedback might become
infeasible due to insufficient coherence time interval when the channel rapidly
changes due to high speed of MSs. Without the feedback from MSs, it may be
possible for the BS to directly obtain the DL CSI using the inherent relation
of UL and DL channels even in FDD, which is called DL extrapolation. Although
the exact relation would be highly nonlinear, previous studies have shown that
a neural network (NN) can be used to estimate the DL CSI from the UL CSI at the
BS. Most of previous works on this line of research trained the NN using full
dimensional UL and DL channels; however, the NN training complexity becomes
severe as the number of antennas at the BS increases. To reduce the training
complexity and improve DL CSI estimation quality, this paper proposes a novel
DL extrapolation technique using simplified input and output of the NN. It is
shown through many measurement campaigns that the UL and DL channels still
share common components like path delays and angles in FDD. The proposed
technique first extracts these common coefficients from the UL and DL channels
and trains the NN only using the path gains, which depend on frequency bands,
with reduced dimension compared to the full UL and DL channels. Extensive
simulation results show that the proposed technique outperforms the
conventional approach, which relies on the full UL and DL channels to train the
NN, regardless of the speed of MSs.

letter, we show a general framework to unify QZE-QAZE effects and parity-time
(PT) symmetry breaking transitions, in which the dissipative Hamiltonian
associated to the measurement effect is mapped onto a PT-symmetric non-

QZE (QAZE) and their crossover behavior. As a concrete example, we show that,
in a two-level system periodically coupled to a dissipative environment, QZE
starts at an exceptional point (EP), which separates the PT-symmetric (PTS)
phase and PT-symmetry broken (PTB) phase, and ends at the resonance point (RP)
of the maximum PT-symmetry breaking; while QAZE extends the rest of PTB phase
and remains the whole PTS phase. Such findings reveal a hidden relation between

online security monitoring, but practically it suffers from high computational
burden using state-of-the-art methods, such as time-domain simulation (TDS),
with numerous scenarios taken into account (e.g., operating points (OPs) and
N-1 contingencies). The purpose of this work is to establish a data-driven
framework to generate sufficient critical samples close to the boundary within
a limited time, covering all critical scenarios in current OP. Therefore,
accurate TSB can be periodically refreshed by tracking current OP in time. The
idea is to develop a search strategy to obtain more data samples near the
stability boundary, while traverse the rest part with fewer samples. To achieve
this goal, a specially designed transient index sensitivity based search
strategy and critical scenarios selection mechanism are proposed, in order to
find out the most representative scenarios and periodically update TSB for
online monitoring. Two case studies validate effectiveness of the proposed

time series at sites with incomplete records based on the concept of
conditional independence in graphical models. The goal is to fill in gaps of
historical data or extend records at streamflow stations no longer in operation
or even estimate streamflow at ungauged locations. This is achieved by first
selecting relevant stations in the hydrometric network as reference (donor)
stations and then using them to infer the missing data. The selection process
transforms fully connected streamflow stations in the hydrometric network into
a sparsely connected network represented by a precision matrix using a Gaussian
graphical model. The underlying graph encodes conditional independence
conditions which allow determination of an optimum set of reference stations
from the fully connected hydrometric network for a study area. The sparsity of
the precision matrix is imposed by using the Graphical Lasso algorithm with an
L1-norm regularization parameter and a thresholding parameter. The two
parameters are determined by a multi-objective optimization process. In
addition, an algorithm based on the conditional independence concept is
presented to allow a removal of gauges with the least loss of information. Our
approaches are illustrated with daily streamflow data from a hydrometric
network of 34 gauges between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 1980 over the Ohio

Generalization (DG), the problem of training a model that is robust to domain
shift by design. Various DG approaches have been proposed with different
motivating intuitions, but they typically optimize for a single step of domain
generalization -- training on one set of domains and generalizing to one other.
Our sequential learning is inspired by the idea lifelong learning, where
accumulated experience means that learning the $n^{th}$ thing becomes easier
than the $1^{st}$ thing. In DG this means encountering a sequence of domains
and at each step training to maximise performance on the next domain. The
performance at domain $n$ then depends on the previous $n-1$ learning problems.
Thus backpropagating through the sequence means optimizing performance not just
for the next domain, but all following domains. Training on all such sequences
of domains provides dramatically more `practice' for a base DG learner compared
to existing approaches, thus improving performance on a true testing domain.
This strategy can be instantiated for different base DG algorithms, but we
focus on its application to the recently proposed Meta-Learning Domain
generalization (MLDG). We show that for MLDG it leads to a simple to implement
and fast algorithm that provides consistent performance improvement on a
variety of DG benchmarks.

extracts deep semantic information from a fully convolutional FEN and fuses it
with the best ResNet-based feature maps to strengthen the target representation

deep meaning and underlying rationale of the scaling exponents remain to be
brought to light. In this paper, the theories of linear algebra and regression
analysis are employed to reveal the mathematical and statistic essence of
allometric scaling exponents. Suppose that the geometric measure relations
between a set of elements in an urban system follow the allometric growth law.
An allometric scaling exponent is proved to equal in theory to the ratio of the
standard deviation of one logarithmic measure to the standard deviation of
another logarithmic measure. In empirical analyses based on observational data,
the scaling exponent is equal to the product between the standard deviation
ratio and the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient. The mathematical
derivation results can be verified by empirical analysis: the scaling exponent
values based on the standard deviation ratios are completely identical to those
based on the conventional method. This finding can be generalized to city
fractals and city size distribution to explain fractal dimensions of urban
space and Zipf scaling exponent of urban hierarchy. A conclusion can be reached
that scaling exponents reflect the ratios of characteristic lengths. This study
may be helpful for comprehending scaling from a new perspective and the

kinds of pancreatic lesions with noncontrast CT. Methods: Our algorithm
combines the radiomics method and a support tensor machine (STM) by the
evidence reasoning (ER) technique to construct a binary classifier, called
RadSTM-ER. RadSTM-ER takes advantage of the handcrafted features used in
radiomics and learning features learned automatically by the STM from the CTs
for presenting better characteristics of lesions. The patient cohort consisted
of 135 patients with pathological diagnosis results where 97 patients had
malignant lesions. Twenty-seven patients were randomly selected as independent
test samples, and the remaining patients were used in a 5-fold cross validation
experiment to confirm the hyperparameters, select optimal handcrafted features
and train the model. Results: RadSTM-ER achieved independent test results: an
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8951, an accuracy
of 85.19%, a sensitivity of 88.89%, a specificity of 77.78%, a positive
predictive value of 88.89% and a negative predictive value of 77.78%.
Conclusions: These results are better than the diagnostic performance of the
five experimental radiologists, four conventional AI algorithms, which
initially demonstrate the potential of noncontrast CT-based RadSTM-ER in cancer
risk prediction for all kinds of pancreatic lesions.

detection, while ignoring the spatiotemporal information in consecutive point
cloud frames. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end online 3D video object
detector that operates on point cloud sequences. The proposed model comprises a
spatial feature encoding component and a spatiotemporal feature aggregation
component. In the former component, a novel Pillar Message Passing Network
(PMPNet) is proposed to encode each discrete point cloud frame. It adaptively
collects information for a pillar node from its neighbors by iterative message
passing, which effectively enlarges the receptive field of the pillar feature.
In the latter component, we propose an Attentive Spatiotemporal Transformer GRU
(AST-GRU) to aggregate the spatiotemporal information, which enhances the
conventional ConvGRU with an attentive memory gating mechanism. AST-GRU
contains a Spatial Transformer Attention (STA) module and a Temporal
Transformer Attention (TTA) module, which can emphasize the foreground objects
and align the dynamic objects, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed 3D video object detector achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the large-scale nuScenes benchmark.

long-standing problem has been to extend this formalism to amplitudes involving

closed-loop case. In the present series of papers, we develop a suitable
formalism for the case of quantum electrodynamics in vacuum (part one and two)
and in a constant external electromagnetic field (part three), based on
second-order fermions and the symbol map. We derive this formalism from
standard field theory, but also give an alternative derivation intrinsic to the
worldline theory. In this first part, we use it to obtain a Bern-Kosower type
master formula for the fermion propagator, dressed with $N$ photons, in terms
of the ""$N$-photon kernel,"" where off-shell this kernel appears also in
""subleading"" terms involving only $N-1$ of the $N$ photons. Although the
parameter integrals generated by the master formula are equivalent to the usual
Feynman diagrams, they are quite different since the use of the inverse symbol
map avoids the appearance of long products of Dirac matrices. As a test we use
the $N=2$ case for a recalculation of the one-loop fermion self energy, in $D$
dimensions and arbitrary covariant gauge, reproducing the known result. We find
that significant simplification can be achieved in this calculation choosing an
unusual momentum-dependent gauge parameter.

realize due to the large variation of the shape, size, and appearance of these
tissues in different patients. In this paper, we present an end-to-end
trainable deep segmentation model termed Crossover-Net for robust segmentation
in medical images. Our proposed model is inspired by an insightful observation:
during segmentation, the representation from the horizontal and vertical
directions can provide different local appearance and orthogonality context
information, which helps enhance the discrimination between different tissues
by simultaneously learning from these two directions. Specifically, by
converting the segmentation task to a pixel/voxel-wise prediction problem,
firstly, we originally propose a cross-shaped patch, namely crossover-patch,
which consists of a pair of (orthogonal and overlapped) vertical and horizontal
patches, to capture the orthogonal vertical and horizontal relation. Then, we
develop the Crossover-Net to learn the vertical-horizontal crossover relation
captured by our crossover-patches. To achieve this goal, for learning the
representation on a typical crossover-patch, we design a novel loss function to
(1) impose the consistency on the overlap region of the vertical and horizontal
patches and (2) preserve the diversity on their non-overlap regions. We have
extensively evaluated our method on CT kidney tumor, MR cardiac, and X-ray
breast mass segmentation tasks. Promising results are achieved according to our
extensive evaluation and comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation
models.

considers both short-range motions and long-range aggregations. In this paper,
we propose a Temporal Excitation and Aggregation (TEA) block, including a
motion excitation (ME) module and a multiple temporal aggregation (MTA) module,
specifically designed to capture both short- and long-range temporal evolution.
In particular, for short-range motion modeling, the ME module calculates the
feature-level temporal differences from spatiotemporal features. It then
utilizes the differences to excite the motion-sensitive channels of the
features. The long-range temporal aggregations in previous works are typically
achieved by stacking a large number of local temporal convolutions. Each
convolution processes a local temporal window at a time. In contrast, the MTA
module proposes to deform the local convolution to a group of sub-convolutions,
forming a hierarchical residual architecture. Without introducing additional
parameters, the features will be processed with a series of sub-convolutions,
and each frame could complete multiple temporal aggregations with
neighborhoods. The final equivalent receptive field of temporal dimension is
accordingly enlarged, which is capable of modeling the long-range temporal
relationship over distant frames. The two components of the TEA block are
complementary in temporal modeling. Finally, our approach achieves impressive
results at low FLOPs on several action recognition benchmarks, such as
Kinetics, Something-Something, HMDB51, and UCF101, which confirms its

frequency-dependent squeezed vacuum states realized using a filter cavity is a

the spectral evolution of the pulses can be characterized as parabolic shapes
with linear chirp and kW peak power. By compressed these, high energy
femtoseconds pulses can be obtained starting initial picoseconds pulses.
Spatial beam profile could be preserved in both multimode fibers under the

improves the spatial beam cleaning process under the different initial

over-approximating nonlinear systems in a bounded domain by solving a sequence
of linear programs, resulting in a sequence of affine upper and lower
hyperplanes with expanding operating regions. Although the affine abstraction
problem can be solved offline using a single linear program, existing
approaches suffer from a computation space complexity that grows exponentially
with the state dimension. Hence, the motivation for incremental abstraction is
to reduce the space complexity for high-dimensional systems, but at the cost of
yielding potentially worse abstractions/overapproximations. Specifically, we
start with an operating region that is a subregion of the state space and
compute two affine hyperplanes that bracket the nonlinear function locally.
Then, by incrementally expanding the operating region, we dynamically update
the two affine hyperplanes such that we eventually yield hyperplanes that are
guaranteed to over-approximate the nonlinear system over the entire domain.
Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using
numerical examples of high-dimensional nonlinear systems.

over-approximating it with a deliberate loss of information. It was not

problem solving. We introduce a method to automatically abstract ASP programs
that preserves their structure by reducing the vocabulary while ensuring an
over-approximation (i.e., each original answer set maps to some abstract answer
set). This allows for generating partial answer set candidates that can help
with approximation of reasoning. Computing the abstract answer sets is
intuitively easier due to a smaller search space, at the cost of encountering
spurious answer sets. Faithful (non-spurious) abstractions may be used to
represent projected answer sets and to guide solvers in answer set
construction. For dealing with spurious answer sets, we employ an ASP debugging
approach to help with abstraction refinement, which determines atoms as badly
omitted and adds them back in the abstraction. As a show case, we apply
abstraction to explain unsatisfiability of ASP programs in terms of blocker
sets, which are the sets of atoms such that abstraction to them preserves
unsatisfiability. Their usefulness is demonstrated by experimental results.

probability of placing splits along strong predictors, thus providing an

using representative finite samples. Moreover, we quantify the immediate gain
from targeting in terms of increased strength of individual trees.
Macroeconomic and financial applications show that the bias-variance trade-off
implied by targeting, due to increased correlation among trees in the forest,
is balanced at a medium degree of targeting, selecting the best 10--30\% of
commonly applied predictors. Improvements in predictive accuracy of targeted RF
relative to ordinary RF are considerable, up to 12-13\%, occurring both in

Actually we plan to study the effect of the fragmentation of the habitat on
biodiversity. A simple neutral model for the evolution of abundances in a
vegetal metacommunity is introduced. Migration between the communities is
explicitely modelized in a deterministic way, while the reproduction process is
dealt with using Wright-Fisher models, independently within each community. The
large population limit of the model is considered. The hydrodynamic limit of
this split-step method is proved to be the solution of a partial differential
equation with a deterministic part coming from the migration process and a
diffusion part due to the Wright-Fisher process. Finally, the diversity of the
metacommunity is adressed through one of its indicator, the mean extinction
time of a species. At the limit, using classical comparison principles, the
exchange process between the communities is proved to slow down extinction.
This shows that the existence of corridors seems to be good for the
biodiversity.

catalogs to constrain cosmological parameters governing the shape of the matter
power spectrum. The BOSS data are divided into twelve concentric shells over
the redshift range $0.2 < z < 0.6$, and we extract the genus from the projected
two-dimensional galaxy density fields. We compare the genus amplitudes to their
Gaussian expectation values, exploiting the fact that this quantity is
relatively insensitive to non-linear gravitational collapse. The genus
amplitude provides a measure of the shape of the linear matter power spectrum,
and is principally sensitive to $\Omega_{\rm c}h^{2}$ and scalar spectral index
$n_{\rm s}$. A strong negative degeneracy between $\Omega_{\rm c}h^{2}$ and
$n_{\rm s}$ is observed, as both can increase small scale power by shifting the
peak and tilting the power spectrum respectively. We place a constraint on the
particular combination $n_{\rm s}^{3/2} \Omega_{\rm c}h^{2}$ -- we find $n_{\rm
s}^{3/2} \Omega_{\rm c}h^{2} = 0.1121 \pm 0.0043$ after combining the LOWZ and
CMASS data sets, assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This result is
practically insensitive to reasonable variations of the power spectrum
amplitude and linear galaxy bias. Our results are consistent with the Planck
best fit $n_{\rm s}^{3/2}\Omega_{\rm c}h^{2} = 0.1139 \pm 0.0009$.

as disassembling object representations. Given an image featuring multiple
objects, the goal of disassembling is to acquire a latent representation, of
which each part corresponds to one category of objects. Disassembling thus
finds its application in a wide domain such as image editing and few- or
zero-shot learning, as it enables category-specific modularity in the learned
representations. To this end, we propose an unsupervised approach to achieving
disassembling, named Unsupervised Disassembling Object Representation (UDOR).
UDOR follows a double auto-encoder architecture, in which a fuzzy
classification and an object-removing operation are imposed. The fuzzy
classification constrains each part of the latent representation to encode
features of up to one object category, while the object-removing, combined with
a generative adversarial network, enforces the modularity of the
representations and integrity of the reconstructed image. Furthermore, we
devise two metrics to respectively measure the modularity of disassembled
representations and the visual integrity of reconstructed images. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed UDOR, despited unsupervised, achieves
truly encouraging results on par with those of supervised methods.

Another is the diffuse X-ray background that dominates below 7 keV and has a

spectral shape can be obtained from the blind detector data of all the blank

apparent anharmonic shape of the QPP in this superflare results from a
superposition of two intrinsic modes of periods of 49 min and 86 min, which
display quasi-harmonic behaviors and different modulation patterns. The two
reconstructed signals are consistent with slow-mode transverse and/or

two modes evinced by SSA favors the interpretation of the observed QPP pattern
as due to the excitation in a coronal loop of the second harmonic of a standing
slow-mode magnetoacoustic oscillation and a global kink oscillation

interpretations cannot however be ruled out on the basis of the available data.

the first image of the black hole shadow enhance the possibilities of testing
gravitational theories in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we study the
physical properties and the shadow image of a class of Kerr-like rotating black
holes, whose $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is generically broken. Such black hole
solutions could arise in effective low-energy theories of a fundamental quantum
theory of gravity, such as string theory. Within a theory-agnostic framework,
we require that the Kerr-like solutions are asymptotically flat, and assume
that a Carter-like constant is preserved, enabling the geodesic equations to be
fully separable. Subject to these two requirements, we find that the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ asymmetry of the spacetime is characterized by two arbitrary
functions of polar angle. The shadow image turns out to be $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetric on the celestial coordinates. Furthermore, the shadow is completely
blind to one of the arbitrary functions. The other function, although would
affect the apparent size of the shadow, it hardly distorts the shadow contour
and has merely no degeneracy with the spin parameter. Therefore, the parameters
in this function can be constrained with black hole shadows, only when the mass
and the distance of the black hole from the earth are measured with great
precision.

set of user-specific, non-orthogonal, binary spreading sequences for uplink

sequence provides the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of at most 3 dB for
multicarrier transmission. Exploiting the theoretical connection to Reed-Muller
codes, we conduct a probabilistic analysis to search for a permutation set for
Golay sequences, which presents theoretically bounded low coherence for the
spreading matrix. Simulation results confirm that the PAPR of transmitted
multicarrier signals via the spreading sequences is significantly lower than
those for random bipolar, Gaussian, and Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. Also, thanks
to the low coherence, the performance of compressed sensing (CS) based joint
channel estimation (CE) and multiuser detection (MUD) using the spreading
sequences turns out to be superior or comparable to those for the other ones.
Unlike ZC sequences, the binary Golay spreading sequences have only two phases
regardless of the sequence length, which can be suitable for low cost MTC
devices.

of social distancing, specifically mobility restrictions and lock-downs. Such
measures impose a hurtful toll on the economy, and are difficult to sustain for
extended periods. As an alternative, we propose here an alternating quarantine
strategy, in which at every instance, half of the population remains under
lock-down while the other half continues to be active, maintaining a routine of
weekly succession between activity and quarantine. This regime affords a dual
partition:\ half of the population interacts for only half of the time,
resulting in a dramatic reduction in transmission, comparable to that achieved
by a population-wide lock-down. All the while, it enables socioeconomic
continuity at $50\%$ capacity. The proposed weekly alternations also address an
additional challenge, with specific relevance to COVID-19. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2
exhibits a relatively long incubation period, in which individuals experience
no symptoms, but may already contribute to the spread. Unable to selectively
isolate these invisible spreaders, we resort to population-wide restrictions.
However, under the alternating quarantine routine, if an individual was exposed
during their active week, by the time they complete their quarantine they will,
in most cases, begin to exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates the
majority of pre-symptomatic individuals during their infectious phase, leading
to a rapid decline in the viral spread, thus addressing one of the main
challenges in COVID-19 mitigation.

the source and channel coding as two independent processes, in many practical
communication scenarios this decomposition is limited by the finite bit-length

coding (NECST) is proposed to sidestep this problem. While it leverages the
advancements of amortized inference and deep learning to improve the encoding
and decoding process, it still cannot always achieve compelling results in
terms of compression and error correction performance due to the limited
robustness of its learned coding networks. In this paper, motivated by the
inherent connections between neural joint source-channel coding and discrete
representation learning, we propose a novel regularization method called
Infomax Adversarial-Bit-Flip (IABF) to improve the stability and robustness of
the neural joint source-channel coding scheme. More specifically, on the
encoder side, we propose to explicitly maximize the mutual information between
the codeword and data; while on the decoder side, the amortized reconstruction
is regularized within an adversarial framework. Extensive experiments conducted
on various real-world datasets evidence that our IABF can achieve
state-of-the-art performances on both compression and error correction

decision forests) have achieved remarkable success recently to solve problems
such as facial age estimation and head pose estimation. Most existing methods
pursue robust and unbiased solutions either through learning discriminative
features, or reweighting samples. We argue what is more desirable is learning
gradually to discriminate like our human beings, and hence we resort to
self-paced learning (SPL). Then, a natural question arises: can self-paced
regime lead deep discriminative models to achieve more robust and less biased
solutions? To this end, this paper proposes a new deep discriminative
model--self-paced deep regression forests with consideration on
underrepresented examples (SPUDRFs). It tackles the fundamental ranking and
selecting problem in SPL from a new perspective: fairness. This paradigm is
fundamental and could be easily combined with a variety of deep discriminative
models (DDMs). Extensive experiments on two computer vision tasks, i.e., facial
age estimation and head pose estimation, demonstrate the efficacy of SPUDRFs,
where state-of-the-art performances are achieved.

efficiently train a deep neural network (DNN). It has been shown that using the
first and second order statistics (e.g., mean and variance) to perform Z-score
standardization on network activations or weight vectors, such as batch
normalization (BN) and weight standardization (WS), can improve the training
performance. Different from these existing methods that mostly operate on
activations or weights, we present a new optimization technique, namely
gradient centralization (GC), which operates directly on gradients by
centralizing the gradient vectors to have zero mean. GC can be viewed as a
projected gradient descent method with a constrained loss function. We show
that GC can regularize both the weight space and output feature space so that
it can boost the generalization performance of DNNs. Moreover, GC improves the
Lipschitzness of the loss function and its gradient so that the training
process becomes more efficient and stable. GC is very simple to implement and
can be easily embedded into existing gradient based DNN optimizers with only
one line of code. It can also be directly used to fine-tune the pre-trained
DNNs. Our experiments on various applications, including general image
classification, fine-grained image classification, detection and segmentation,
demonstrate that GC can consistently improve the performance of DNN learning.

are considered a major health-care challenge. One major driver for the rapid
spatial spread of diseases is human mobility. In particular, the travel
patterns of individuals determine their spreading potential to a great extent.
These travel behaviors can be captured and modelled using novel location-based
data sources, e.g., smart travel cards, social media, etc. Previous studies
have shown that individuals who cannot be characterized by their most
frequently visited locations spread diseases farther and faster; however, these
studies are based on GPS data and mobile call records which have position
uncertainty and do not capture explicit contacts. It is unclear if the same
conclusions hold for large scale real-world transport networks. In this paper,
we investigate how mobility patterns impact disease spread in a large-scale

findings, our results reveal that individuals with mobility patterns
characterized by their most frequently visited locations and who typically
travel large distances pose the highest spreading risk.

latent representations. Burda et al. in their seminal paper showed that
learning capacity of VAE is limited by over-pruning. It is a phenomenon where a
significant number of latent variables fail to capture any information about
the input data and the corresponding hidden units become inactive. This
adversely affects learning diverse and interpretable latent representations. As
variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) extends VAE for graph-structured data, it
inherits the over-pruning problem. In this paper, we adopt a model based
approach and propose epitomic VGAE (EVGAE),a generative variational framework
for graph datasets which successfully mitigates the over-pruning problem and
also boosts the generative ability of VGAE. We consider EVGAE to consist of
multiple sparse VGAE models, called epitomes, that are groups of latent
variables sharing the latent space. This approach aids in increasing active
units as epitomes compete to learn better representation of the graph data. We
verify our claims via experiments on three benchmark datasets. Our experiments
show that EVGAE has a better generative ability than VGAE. Moreover, EVGAE
outperforms VGAE on link prediction task in citation networks.

based entirely on properties of the bath and the system-bath coupling, without
any requirements on the level structure within the system itself. The master
equation is derived using a Markov approximation that is distinct from that
used in earlier approaches. We provide a rigorous bound for the error induced
by this Markov approximation; the error is controlled by a dimensionless
combination of intrinsic correlation and relaxation timescales of the bath. Our
master equation is accurate on the same level of approximation as the
Bloch-Redfield equation. In contrast to the Bloch-Redfield approach, our
approach ensures preservation of the positivity of the density matrix. As a
result, our method is robust, and can be solved efficiently using stochastic
evolution of pure states (rather than density matrices). We discuss how our
method can be applied to static or driven quantum many-body systems, and
illustrate its power through numerical simulation of a spin chain that would be
challenging to treat by existing methods.

studying extensions of the standard cosmological model capable of addressing
this outstanding issue. Broadly speaking, models that have been successful in
reducing the the tension between the CMB and local measurements (without

subject of intense research over the past decades. In this regard, the
theoretical models used to explain cooperation in human societies have been
complemented with a growing interest in experimental studies to validate the
proposed mechanisms. In this work, we rely on previous experimental findings to
build a theoretical model based on two cooperation driving mechanisms:
second-order reputation and memory. Specifically, taking the Donation Game as a
starting point, the agents are distributed among three strategies, namely
Unconditional Cooperators, Unconditional Defectors, and Discriminators, where
the latter follow a second-order assessment rule: Shunning, Stern Judging,
Image Scoring, or Simple Standing. A discriminator will cooperate if the
evaluation of the recipient's last actions contained in his memory is above a
threshold of (in)tolerance. In addition to the dynamics inherent to the game,
another imitation dynamics, involving much longer times (generations), is
introduced. The model is approached through a mean-field approximation that
predicts the macroscopic behavior observed in Monte Carlo simulations. We found
that, while in most second-order assessment rules, intolerance hinders
cooperation, it has the opposite (positive) effect under the Simple Standing
rule. Furthermore, we show that, when considering memory, the Stern Judging
rule shows the lowest values of cooperation, while stricter rules show higher
cooperation levels.

trade-off between fast convergence of state estimates and quality of control

research topic because there are a wide variety of applications in various
areas such as string processing and computational biology. Although several
enumeration algorithms for characteristic substrings have been proposed, they
are not space-efficient in that their space-usage is proportional to the length
of an input string. Recently, the run-length encoded Burrows-Wheeler transform
(RLBWT) has attracted increased attention in string processing, and various
algorithms for the RLBWT have been developed. Developing enumeration algorithms
for characteristic substrings with the RLBWT, however, remains a challenge. In
this paper, we present r-enum (RLBWT-based enumeration), the first enumeration
algorithm for characteristic substrings based on RLBWT. R-enum runs in $O(n
\log \log (n/r))$ time and with $O(r \log n)$ bits of working space for string
length $n$ and number $r$ of runs in RLBWT, where $r$ is expected to be
significantly smaller than $n$ for highly repetitive strings (i.e., strings
with many repetitions). Experiments using a benchmark dataset of highly
repetitive strings show that the results of r-enum are more space-efficient
than the previous results. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of
r-enum to a huge string by performing experiments on a 300-gigabyte string of

combining AMTnet's 3D proposal architecture with an online action tube

needed for accurate action detection and facilitates running inference online;
(2) an efficient fusion technique allowing the deep network to learn strong
spatiotemporal action representations. This is achieved by augmenting the
previous Action Micro-Tube (AMTnet) action detection framework in three
distinct ways: by adding a parallel motion stIn this paper, we propose a new

both streams in an end-to-end fashion and merging RGB and optical flow features

phenomenon, we employed the differential coloration efficiency concept, defined
as the derivative of the optical density with respect to the inserted charge.
We also made use of its extension to a complex quantity in the context of
frequency-resolved studies. Combined $\textit{in situ}$ electrochemical and
optical experiments were performed on electrochromic
$\textit{a}\mathrm{WO}_{3}$ thin films for a wide lithium intercalation range
using an optical wavelength of $810~\mathrm{nm}$ ($1.53~\mathrm{eV}$).
Quasi-equilibrium measurements were made by chronopotentiometry (CP). Dynamic
frequency-dependent measurements were carried out by simultaneous
electrochemical and color impedance spectroscopy (SECIS). The differential
coloration efficiency obtained from CP changes sign at a critical intercalation
level. Its response exhibits an excellent agreement with a theoretical model
that considers electronic transitions between $\mathrm{W}^{4+}$,
$\mathrm{W}^{5+}$, and $\mathrm{W}^{6+}$ sites. For the SECIS experiment, the
low-frequency limit of the differential coloration efficiency shows a general
trend similar to that from CP. However, it does not change sign at a critical
ion insertion level. This discrepancy could be due to degradation effects
occurring in the films at high $\mathrm{Li}^+$ insertion levels. The
methodology and results presented in this work can be of great interest both

in the Active Galactic Nucleus SDSS J022700.77-042020.6. A sudden increase in
flux of J0227-0420 during the second half of 2009 is clearly shown in the
long-term optical, UV, and NIR light curves. A plateau phase, following an
initial decline, is seen in the NUV and optical u, g, r, i light curves.
Moreover, we find possible evidence that the plateau phase in the NUV band may
lag behind the optical ones by approximately 70-80 days with also a much
shorter duration, i.e. $\sim$7-15 days against $\sim$40-50 days. The long-term
NUV/optical (after the plateau phase), NIR and MIR light curves can be well
characterized with a form of $L(t)\propto t^{-\beta}$, consistent with the
expectation of a TDE. The plateaus can be explained if the stellar streams
collide with the pre-existing AGN disk at different radii. Though the overall
fallback rate decreases, the material in the outer disk gradually drifts inward
and increases the local accretion rate at the inner region, producing the
optical and UV plateaus. The possible lag between the optical and NUV plateaus
can then be attributed to viscosity delay. The index $\beta$ of the NIR $J, H,
K_s$ bands ($\sim1.4-3.3$) is steeper than that of the UV/optical
($\sim0.7-1.3$) and MIR bands ($\sim0.9-1.8$), which may suggest that a certain
fraction of the dust in the inner region of the dusty torus may be sublimated
during the TDE phase. Our results indicate that, due to collisions between
stellar debris and pre-existing disk, the light curves of TDEs occurring in AGN
may show distinctive features, which may shed new light on the accretion
process.

non-parametric fine pixel-wise alignment. Coarse alignment is performed using
RANSAC on off-the-shelf deep features. Fine alignment is learned in an
unsupervised way by a deep network which optimizes a standard structural

intersecting if any two of its members share a common element. Consider an
intersecting family, a direct problem is to determine its maximal size and the
inverse problem is to characterize its extremal structure and its corresponding
stability. The famous Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem answered both direct and
inverse problems and led the era of studying intersection problems for finite
sets.
  In this paper, we consider the following quantitative intersection problem
which can be viewed an inverse problem for Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type theorems: For
$\mathcal{F}\subseteq {[n]\choose k}$, define its \emph{total intersection} as
$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{F})=\sum_{F_1,F_2\in \mathcal{F}}|F_1\cap F_2|$. Then,
what is the structure of $\mathcal{F}$ when it has the maximal total
intersection among all families in ${[n]\choose k}$ with the same family size?
  Using a pure combinatorial approach, we provide two structural
characterizations of the optimal family of given size that maximizes the total
intersection. As a consequence, for $n$ large enough and $\mathcal{F}$ of
proper size, these characterizations show that the optimal family $\mathcal{F}$
is indeed $t$-intersecting ($t\geq 1$). To a certain extent, this reveals the
relationship between properties of being intersecting and maximizing the total
intersection. Also, we provide an upper bound on $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{F})$ for
several ranges of $|\mathcal{F}|$ and determine the unique optimal structure
for families with sizes of certain values.

initial process of the second order in the fine structure constant in a laser
field effectively reduces into two successive processes of the first order: the
laser-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process and the laser-assisted process of an
intermediate electron (positron) scattering by a nucleus. It is shown that
there is a threshold energy for the initial gamma quantum, which significantly
depends on the number of absorbed photons of a wave. In the resonant condition
the electron-positron pair energy is determined by the outgoing angle of a
positron (for the channel A) or an electron (for the channel B) relative to the
initial gamma quantum momentum. The differential cross sections for the first

head-mounted display (HMD) and 2) via a traditional computer screen.
Furthermore, participants were asked to rate their emotional state 1) in

Results indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in

statistically significant difference could be found for the different rating

may help to identify the strange partner of the hidden-charm pentaquark
recently observed by the LHCb collaboration, the existence of which has been
predicted by a chiral unitary approach. We conclude that this strange
pentaquark has a good chance of experimental detection if it is present in the
range between $4450-4500$ MeV. Finally, in the $\phi \, \Lambda$ spectrum we
expect a contribution from a dynamically generated resonance at around $2160$
MeV, but with the present model parameters there is little chance for its
experimental detection.

text can only add value to the virtual environment if it is designed and
created in such a way that users can comfortably read it. With the aim to
explore what values for text parameters users find comfortable while reading in
virtual reality, a study was conducted allowing participants to manipulate text
parameters such as font size, distance, and contrast. Therefore two different
standalone virtual reality devices were used, Oculus Go and Quest, together
with three different text samples: Short (2 words), medium (21 words), and long
(51 words). Participants had the task of setting text parameters to the best
and worst possible value. Additionally, participants were asked to rate their
experience of reading in virtual reality. Results report mean values for
angular size (the combination of distance and font size) and color contrast
depending on the different device used as well as the varying text length, for
both tasks. Significant differences were found for values of angular size,
depending on the length of the displayed text. However, different device types
had no significant influence on text parameters but on the experiences reported
using the self-assessment manikin (SAM) scale.

analyses is here quantified for the first time for turbulent channel flows.
Direct numerical simulations (DNS) at $Re_{\tau} =179$ and $Re_{\tau} =543$ are
performed. The CSDs are computed for highly energetic structures typical of
buffer-layer and large-scale motions, for different temporal frequencies. The
CSD of the non-linear forcing is shown not to be uncorrelated (white) in space,
which implies the forcing is structured. Since the non-linear forcing is
non-solenoidal by construction and the velocity of an incompressible flow is
affected only by the solenoidal part of the forcing, this solenoidal part is
evaluated. It is shown that the solenoidal part of the non-linear forcing is
the combination of oblique streamwise vortices and a streamwise component which
counteract each other, as in a destructive interference. It is shown that a
rank-2 approximation of the forcing, with only the most energetic SPOD
(spectral proper orthogonal decomposition) modes, leads to the bulk of the
response. The projections of the non-linear forcing onto the right-singular
vectors of the resolvent are evaluated. The left-singular vectors of the
resolvent associated with very low-magnitude singular values are non-negligible
since the non-linear forcing term has a non-negligible projection onto the
linear sub-optimals of resolvent analysis. The same projections are computed
when the forcing is modelled with an eddy-viscosity approach. It is clarified
that this modelling improves the accuracy of the prediction since the
projections are closer to those associated with the non-linear forcing from DNS
data.

algorithms, stability is based on the Dice-Sorensen index for comparing two
rule sets generated by an algorithm using two independent samples. The
simplicity is based on the sum of the lengths of the rules derived from the

Moreover, using multi-scale convolutions without considering their importance
may confuse the model. ii) Employing multi-level features helps the model use
both local and global context. However, treating all features equally results
in information redundancy. Therefore, there needs to be a mechanism to
intelligently select which features in different levels are useful. To address
the first challenge, we propose a Multi-scale Attention Guided Module. This
module not only extracts multi-scale features effectively but also gives more
attention to more discriminative feature maps corresponding to the scale of the
salient object. To address the second challenge, we propose an Attention-based
Multi-level Integrator Module to give the model the ability to assign different
weights to multi-level feature maps. Furthermore, our Sharpening Loss function
guides our network to output saliency maps with higher certainty and less
blurry salient objects, and it has far better performance than the
Cross-entropy loss. For the first time, we adopt four different backbones to
show the generalization of our method. Experiments on five challenging datasets

leading to blindness. While human experts can easily identify severe stages of
ROP, the diagnosis of earlier stages, which are the most relevant to
determining treatment choice, are much more affected by variability in
subjective interpretations of human experts. In recent years, there has been a
significant effort to automate the diagnosis using deep learning. This paper
builds upon the success of previous models and develops a novel architecture,
which combines object segmentation and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to
construct an effective classifier of ROP stages 1-3 based on neonatal retinal
images. Motivated by the fact that the formation and shape of a demarcation
line in the retina is the distinguishing feature between earlier ROP stages,
our proposed system first trains an object segmentation model to identify the
demarcation line at a pixel level and adds the resulting mask as an additional
""color"" channel in the original image. Then, the system trains a CNN classifier
based on the processed images to leverage information from both the original
image and the mask, which helps direct the model's attention to the demarcation
line. In a number of careful experiments comparing its performance to previous
object segmentation systems and CNN-only systems trained on our dataset, our
novel architecture significantly outperforms previous systems in accuracy,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline.

the observed collapse in $P_T/P_L$ is simply due to a strong dependence of the

state-of-the-art methods directly regress 3D hand meshes from 2D depth images
via 2D convolutional neural networks, which leads to artefacts in the

propose a novel architecture with 3D convolutions trained in a
weakly-supervised manner. The input to our method is a 3D voxelized depth map,
and we rely on two hand shape representations. The first one is the 3D
voxelized grid of the shape which is accurate but does not preserve the mesh
topology and the number of mesh vertices. The second representation is the 3D
hand surface which is less accurate but does not suffer from the limitations of
the first representation. We combine the advantages of these two
representations by registering the hand surface to the voxelized hand shape. In
the extensive experiments, the proposed approach improves over the state of the

prostate biopsies has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis. The
assessment and quantification of PNI is; however, labor intensive. In the study
we aimed to develop an algorithm based on deep neural networks to aid
pathologists in this task.
  Methods: We collected, digitized and pixel-wise annotated the PNI findings in
each of the approximately 80,000 biopsy cores from the 7,406 men who underwent
biopsy in the prospective and diagnostic STHLM3 trial between 2012 and 2014. In
total, 485 biopsy cores showed PNI. We also digitized more than 10% (n=8,318)
of the PNI negative biopsy cores. Digitized biopsies from a random selection of
80% of the men were used to build deep neural networks, and the remaining 20%
were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
  Results: For the detection of PNI in prostate biopsy cores the network had an
estimated area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.98 (95%
CI 0.97-0.99) based on 106 PNI positive cores and 1,652 PNI negative cores in
the independent test set. For the pre-specified operating point this translates
to sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.97. The corresponding positive and
negative predictive values were 0.67 and 0.99, respectively. For localizing the
regions of PNI within a slide we estimated an average intersection over union
of 0.50 (CI: 0.46-0.55).
  Conclusion: We have developed an algorithm based on deep neural networks for
detecting PNI in prostate biopsies with apparently acceptable diagnostic
properties. These algorithms have the potential to aid pathologists in the
day-to-day work by drastically reducing the number of biopsy cores that need to
be assessed for PNI and by highlighting regions of diagnostic interest.

occurrence of close-in planets that are located within the first au around
their host star. We aim to reveal the morphology of the disk inner rim using
near-infrared interferometric observations with milli-arcsecond resolution
provided by infrared interferometry. We provide reconstructed images of 15
objects selected from the Herbig AeBe survey carried out with PIONIER at the
VLTI, using SPARCO. We find that 40% of the systems are centrosymmetric at the
angular resolution of the observations. For the rest of the objects, we find
evidence for asymmetric emission due to moderate-to-strong inclination of a
disk-like structure for 30% of the objects and noncentrosymmetric morphology
due to a nonaxisymmetric and possibly variable environment (30%). Among the
systems with a disk-like structure, 20% show a resolved dust-free cavity. The
image reconstruction process is a powerful tool to reveal complex disk inner
rim morphologies. At the angular resolution reached by near-infrared
interferometric observations, most of the images are compatible with a
centrally peaked emission (no cavity). For the most resolved targets, image
reconstruction reveals morphologies that cannot be reproduced by generic
parametric models. Moreover, the nonaxisymmetric disks show that the spatial
resolution probed by optical interferometers makes the observations of the
near-infrared emission sensitive to temporal evolution with a time-scale down
to a few weeks. The evidence of nonaxisymmetric emission that cannot be
explained by simple inclination and radiative transfer effects requires
alternative explanations, such as a warping of the inner disks. Interferometric
observations can, therefore, be used to follow the evolution of the asymmetry
of those disks at a sub-au scale.

Secondly,the user's pointing direction may not be very accurate, so the robot

  Modelling using a Convolutional Neural Network",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stress is a growing concern in modern society adversely impacting the wider
population more than ever before. The accurate inference of stress may result
in the possibility for personalised interventions. However, individual
differences between people limits the generalisability of machine learning
models to infer emotions as people's physiology when experiencing the same
emotions widely varies. In addition, it is time consuming and extremely
challenging to collect large datasets of individuals' emotions as it relies on
users labelling sensor data in real-time for extended periods. We propose the
development of a personalised, cross-domain 1D CNN by utilising transfer
learning from an initial base model trained using data from 20 participants
completing a controlled stressor experiment. By utilising physiological sensors
(HR, HRV EDA) embedded within edge computing interfaces that additionally
contain a labelling technique, it is possible to collect a small real-world
personal dataset that can be used for on-device transfer learning to improve
model personalisation and cross-domain performance.

periodically activated to schedule the transmission of sensor or actuator data.
Therein, a preassigned traffic specification acts as a constraint on the
scheduled transmissions, ensuring that they are triggered at an admissible rate
for the underlying communication network. In this paper, we extend the theory
of rollout control by considering bounded disturbances on the controlled plant
in the presence of state and input constraints. We use methods from tube MPC,
where the error between the nominal (undisturbed) system, used as a prediction
model, and the real system is kept in a robust control invariant set. This
approach requires satisfaction of a \emph{maximum} inter-transmission interval
in closed loop, a guarantee that is not straightforward to obtain in rollout
control. Our main contribution is to introduce a novel tube MPC scheme adapted
for rollout control, which contains an additional constraint on the predicted
transmission schedule. We show that by virtue of this schedule constraint, the
inter-transmission interval is bounded in closed loop. We also establish
recursive feasibility of this novel MPC scheme and show convergence of the
system.

prediction horizon. Earlier works needed to look backwards and preserve prior
regressor data. Instead, we present a procedure for the offline generation of a
persistently exciting reference trajectory perturbing the equilibrium. With the
new approach we demonstrate exponential convergence of nonlinear systems under
the influence of the adaptive model predictive control combined with a
recursive least squares identifier with forgetting factor despite bounded
noise. The results are, at this stage, local in state and parameter-estimate

the modelling of this evolution by means of atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo
(AKMC) simulations, necessarily using small system sizes, introduces strong
space and time correlations between the vacancies and interstitials, which may
strongly affect the recombination rate and the point defect concentrations. In
such situations, standard rate theory models fail to predict the actual point
defect concentrations. The effect is especially strong when the elimination of
point defects occurs only by recombination, but can still be significant in the
presence of sinks. We propose a new Correlated Pair Theory that fully takes
into account the correlations between vacancy and interstitial pairs and
predicts point defect concentrations in good agreement with AKMC simulations,
even in very small systems. The Correlated Pair Theory can be used to modify
the elimination rates in AKMC simulations to yield point defect concentrations

In this paper we present a new phenomenological approach, together with its
inferencial implementation, for measuring deviations from general relativity
(GR) on cosmological scales concurrently with a determination of $H_0$. We
consider gravitational waves (GWs) propagating in an expanding homogeneous and
isotropic background, but with a modified friction term and dispersion relation
relative to that of GR. We find that a single binary neutron star GW detection
will poorly constrain the GW friction term. However, a joint analysis including
the GW phase and GW-GRB detection delay could improve constraints on some GW
dispersion relations provided the delay is measured with millisecond precision.
We also show that, for massive gravity, by combining 100 binary neutron stars
detections with observed electromagnetic counterparts and hosting galaxy
identification, we will be able to constrain the Hubble constant, the GW
damping term and the GW dispersion relation with 2\%, 15\% and 2 \% accuracy,
respectively. We emphasise that these three parameters should be measured
together in order avoid biases. Finally we apply the method to GW170817, and
demonstrate that for all the GW dispersions relations we consider, including
massive gravity, the GW must be emitted $\sim$ 1.74s before the Gamma-ray burst
(GRB). Furthermore, at the GW merger peak frequency, we show that the
fractional difference between the GW group velocity and $c$ is $\lesssim

The existence of an instability in finite nuclei for D1M* when coordinate-space
methods are used to solve the HF equations (as shown in Eur. Phys. J. A(2019)
55:150) is independently confirmed using a computer code based on a quasi-local

confirm that the most affected quantity in the coordinate-space calculation is
the spatial density at the origin. Our study reveals that some findings
concerning these instabilities are not easy to reconcile with the arguments
used in Eur. Phys. J. A (2019) 55:150. For instance, some nuclei such as $^4$He
and $^{40}$Ca, which diverge in HF mesh-point calculations performed with D1M*,
become perfectly stable when Coulomb force is switched off. We have also found
instabilities in some nuclei when the D1M interaction is used. Finally, a
connection between the occupancy of $s$-orbitals near the Fermi level and the
appearance of instabilities is observed. Several convergence and stability
studies are performed with HO basis of different sizes and oscillator

enables expansion and truncation in inverse powers of $\Lambda_{\chi SB}\simeq

  Static$\chi$NL are made entirely of nucleons with even parity, total spin
zero, and even $Z$ and $N$; local expectation values for spin and momenta
vanish. They explain the power of pion-less $SU(2)\chi PT$ to capture

reconstruction approaches. One of the problems in CS approaches is determining
the regularization parameters, which control the balance between data fidelity
the spatial and temporal regularization terms. A data-driven approach is
proposed for the total variation regularization parameter selection such that
the reconstructions yield expected sparsity levels in the regularization
domains. The expected sparsity levels are obtained from the measurement data
for the temporal regularization and from a reference image for the spatial
regularization. Two formulations are proposed. The first is a 2D search for a
parameter pair which produces expected sparsity in both the temporal and
spatial regularization domains. In the second approach, the sparsity-based
parameter selection is split to two 1D searches using the S-curve method. The
approaches are evaluated using simulated and experimental DCE-MRI. In the
simulated test case, both proposed methods produce a parameter pair that is
close to the RMSE optimal pair, and the reconstruction error is also close to
minimum. In the experimental test case, the methods produce almost similar
parameter selection, and the reconstructions are of high perceived quality.
Both approaches lead to a highly feasible selection of the temporal and spatial
regularization parameters in both the simulated and experimental test cases
while the sequential method is computationally more efficient.

estimates a nonlinear diffeomorphism that lifts the dynamics to a higher

programming with coinductive types, allowing productivity to be encoded in
types, and for reasoning about advanced programming language features using an
abstract form of step-indexing. CloTT has previously been shown to enjoy a
number of syntactic properties including strong normalisation, canonicity and
decidability of the equational theory. In this paper we present a denotational
semantics for CloTT useful, e.g., for studying future extensions of CloTT with
constructions such as path types.
  The main challenge for constructing this model is to model the notion of
ticks on a clock used in CloTT for coinductive reasoning about coinductive
types. We build on a category previously used to model guarded recursion with
multiple clocks. In this category there is an object of clocks but no object of
ticks, and so tick-assumptions in a context can not be modelled using standard
tools. Instead we model ticks using dependent right adjoint functors, a
generalisation of the category theoretic notion of adjunction to the setting of
categories with families. Dependent right adjoints are known to model
Fitch-style modal types, but in the case of CloTT, the modal operators
constitute a family indexed internally in the type theory by clocks. We model
this family using a dependent right adjoint on the slice category over the
object of clocks. Finally we show how to model the tick constant of CloTT using
a semantic substitution.
  This work improves on a previous model by the first two named authors which
not only had a flaw but was also considerably more complicated.

power-law dominated, with a contribution from photoionized emission from cold

by 60 percent and the Balmer line intensities decreased by 50 percent between

the X-ray flux from a clear broad-line Seyfert 1 type in 1999 to a Seyfert 1.9

(LTL) are used to specify high-level tasks. We then train deep neural networks
to approximate the value function and policy using an actor-critic
reinforcement learning method. The LTL specification is converted into an

of solving a motion planning problem with LTL specifications using
reinforcement learning is to sample a trajectory and then assign a high reward
for training if the trajectory satisfies the entire LTL formula. However, the
sampling complexity needed to find such a trajectory is too high when we have a
complex LTL formula for continuous state and action spaces. As a result, it is
very unlikely that we get enough reward for training if all sample trajectories
start from the initial state in the automata. In this paper, we propose a
method that samples not only an initial state from the state space, but also an
arbitrary state in the automata at the beginning of each training episode. We
test our algorithm in simulation using a car-like robot and find out that our

call PDDY, for this problem. It is constructed by applying Davis-Yin splitting
to a monotone inclusion in a primal-dual product space, where the operators are
monotone under a specific metric depending on L. We show that three existing

convergence analysis: it allows us to derive sublinear convergence rates in
general, and linear convergence results in presence of strong convexity.
Moreover, within our broad and flexible analysis framework, we propose new
stochastic generalizations of the algorithms, in which a variance-reduced
random estimate of the gradient of F is used, instead of the true gradient.

others without themselves being detected. In this paper, we attempt to
interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed

four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and
compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of
these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number $R_{t}$ of the

our model by matching predictions in the duration 3 March - 1 April 2020 for

the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth

demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead

signals have been proposed, but the performance of each heuristic depends on
the particular trained network. This leaves the data scientist with a difficult
choice. When using any one saliency metric for the entire pruning process, we
run the risk of the metric assumptions being invalidated, leading to poor
decisions being made by the metric. Ideally we could combine the best aspects
of different saliency metrics. However, despite an extensive literature review,
we are unable to find any prior work on composing different saliency metrics.
The chief difficulty lies in combining the numerical output of different
saliency metrics, which are not directly comparable.
  We propose a method to compose several primitive pruning saliencies, to
exploit the cases where each saliency measure does well. Our experiments show

(GrC) has emerged as a new multi-disciplinary paradigm and received much
attention in recent years. Information granules forming an abstract and
efficient characterization of large volumes of numeric data have been
considered as the fundamental constructs of GrC. By generating prototypes and
partition matrix, fuzzy clustering is a commonly encountered way of information
granulation. Degranulation involves data reconstruction completed on a basis of
the granular representatives. Previous studies have shown that there is a
relationship between the reconstruction error and the performance of the
granulation process. Typically, the lower the degranulation error is, the
better performance of granulation is. However, the existing methods of
degranulation usually cannot restore the original numeric data, which is one of
the important reasons behind the occurrence of the reconstruction error. To
enhance the quality of degranulation, in this study, we develop an augmented
scheme through modifying the partition matrix. By proposing the augmented
scheme, we dwell on a novel collection of granulation-degranulation mechanisms.
In the constructed approach, the prototypes can be expressed as the product of
the dataset matrix and the partition matrix. Then, in the degranulation
process, the reconstructed numeric data can be decomposed into the product of
the partition matrix and the matrix of prototypes. Both the granulation and
degranulation are regarded as generalized rotation between the data subspace
and the prototype subspace with the partition matrix and the fuzzification

mappings under consideration are Sobolev homeomorphisms and their weak limits.
They are monotone in the sense of C. B. Morrey. One major advantage of adopting
monotone Sobolev mappings lies in the existence of the energy-minimal
deformations. However, injectivity is inevitably lost, so an obvious question
to ask is: what are the largest subsets of the reference configuration on which
minimal deformations remain injective? The fact that such subsets have full
measure should be compared with the notion of global invertibility which deals
with subsets of the deformed configuration instead. In this connection we
present a Cantor type construction to show that both the branch set and its

the elastic deformations be free along the boundary, known as frictionless

nonlinear decomposition functions, as well as applying our previously developed

estimates that are not compatible with the measurements. Finally, given new
interval estimates, the observer updates the over-approximation of the unknown

is built by adopting the quadratic collision operator for the lower-order terms
and the diffusive Fokker-Planck operator for the higher-order terms in the
Hermite expansion of the reduced collision operator. The numerical scheme is
split into three steps according to the Strang splitting, where different
expansion centers are employed for different numerical steps to take advantage
of the Hermite functions. The standard normalized Hermite basis [36] is adopted
during the convection and collision steps to utilize the precalculated
coefficients of the quadratic collision terms, while the one constituted by the
local macroscopic velocity and temperature is utilized for the acceleration
step, by which the effect of the external force can be simplified to an ODE.
Projections between different expansion centers are achieved by an algorithm
proposed in [29]. Several numerical examples are studied to test and validate

particular, the effect of complex interconnections among financial institutions
on financial stability has been widely recognized. A recent debate focused on
the effects of unconventional policies aimed at achieving both price and
financial stability. In particular, Quantitative Easing (QE, i.e., the
large-scale asset purchase programme conducted by a central bank upon the
creation of new money) has been recently implemented by the European Central
Bank (ECB). In this context, two questions deserve more attention in the
literature. First, to what extent, by injecting liquidity, the QE may alter the
bank-firm lending level and stimulate the real economy. Second, to what extent
the QE may also alter the pattern of intra-financial exposures among financial
actors (including banks, investment funds, insurance corporations, and pension
funds) and what are the implications in terms of financial stability. Here, we
address these two questions by developing a methodology to map the
macro-network of financial exposures among institutional sectors across
financial instruments (e.g., equity, bonds, and loans) and we illustrate our
approach on recently available data (i.e., data on loans and private and public
securities purchased within the QE). We then test the effect of the
implementation of ECB's QE on the time evolution of the financial linkages in

implementation in experiments remains elusive so far. Here we propose a class

sheet conductivity and can support the in-plane ultrahigh-k magnetic designer
polaritons. Based on such metasurfaces, we report the first experimental
observation of the all-angle negative refraction of designer polaritons at
extremely deep-subwavelength scales. Moreover, we directly visualize the
designer polaritons with hyperbolic dispersions. Importantly, for these
hyperbolic polaritons, we find that their squeezing factor is ultra-large and,
to be specific, it can be up to 129 in the experiments, a record-breaking value
exceeding those in naturally hyperbolic materials. The present scheme for the
achievement of negative refraction is also applicable to other natural
materials and may enable intriguing applications in nanophotonics. Besides, the
proposed metasurfaces are readily tailorable in space and frequency, which
could serve as a versatile platform to explore the extremely high confinement
