groups with free, isometric, measure-preserving, ergodic actions on two
manifolds are quasi-isometric, then the corresponding groups are uniformly
measured equivalent (UME). It was earlier known from the work of de Laat-Vigolo
that if two warped cones are QI, then their stable products are QI. Our result
strengthens this result and go further to prove UME of the groups. However,
Fisher-Nguyen-Limbeek proves that if the warped cones corresponding to two
finitely presented groups with no free abelian factors are QI, then there is an
affine commensuration of the two actions. Our result can be seen as an
extension of their result in the setting of infinite presentability under some
extra assumptions.

superradiance which occurs around rotating black holes are investigated. This
is made by computing the amplification factors of massless scalar waves being
scattered by the black hole. It is shown that the increase of the tidal charge
intensity leads to a considerable enhancement of energy extraction from
near-extreme black holes. Such improvement results from the fact that extreme
black holes with more negative tidal charges spin faster. Maximum amplification
decreases with the increase of the tidal charge intensity if the angular
momentum of the black hole per unit mass is fixed. The tidal charge may also
change crucially the superradiance phenomenon of massless scalar waves causing
maximum amplification to occur for $m > 1$ differently from the case of Kerr
black holes.

the unique path between x and z. This notion can be extended to order-theoretic
trees defined as partial orders such that the set of nodes larger than any node
is linearly ordered. In such generalized trees, the unique ""path"" between two

  We generalize some results obtained in a previous article for the betweenness
of join-trees. Join-trees are order-theoretic trees such that any two nodes
have a least upper-bound. The motivation was to define conveniently the
rank-width of a countable graph. We called quasi-tree the structure based on
the betweenness relation of a join-tree. We proved that quasi-trees are
axiomatized by a first-order sentence.
  Here, we obtain a monadic second-order axiomatization of betweenness in
order-theoretic trees. We also define and compare several induced betweenness

absolute values of the predicted abundances need to be corrected, even by large
factors, in order to reach the best agreement. We suggest how the current
stellar yields should be modified to reproduce the data and we discuss whether
such corrections are reasonable in the light of the current knowledge of
stellar nucleosynthesis. However, we also critically discuss the observations.
Our results suggest that Si, Ca, Cr and Ni are the elements for which the
required corrections are the smallest, while for Mg and Al moderate
modifications are necessary. On the other hand, O and K need the largest
corrections to reproduce the observed patterns, a conclusion already reached

which interpolates between honeycomb lattice ($\alpha=0$) and dice lattice

merge and a gap opens while the flat band remains unchanged. Therefore, the
low-energy spectrum, along this merging direction, exhibits a transition from a
linear dispersion in the Dirac phase to a quadratic dispersion in the gapped
phase. However, along the perpendicular direction the spectrum remains linear.
Here we theoretically study the tunneling properties of particles through a

find that the tunneling properties are similar to those of undeformed

super-Klein tunneling, for $\alpha=1$ when the energy is equal to half of the

perfect Klein tunneling turns into the anti-Klein tunneling effect for all

motions are both central features in the fields of nuclear structure and
reactions. From a theoretical point of view, describing such phenomena requires
increasing the complexity of the many-body wavefunction of the system to
account for long-range correlations. One of the challenges, when going in this
direction, is to keep the approach tractable within our current computational
resources while gaining a maximum of predictive power for the phenomenon under
study. In the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM), the many-body wave function is
a linear superposition of (generally non-orthogonal) many-body states (the
generator states) labeled by a few collective coordinates. Such a method has
been widely used in structure studies to restore the symmetries broken by
single-reference approaches. In the domain of reactions, its time-dependent
version (TDGCM) has been developed and applied to predict the dynamics of
heavy-ion collisions or fission where the collective fluctuations play an
essential role. In this review, we present the recent developments and
applications of the TDGCM in nuclear reactions. We recall the formal
derivations of the TDGCM and its most common approximate treatment, the
Gaussian Overlap Approximation. We also emphasize the Schr\""odinger
Collective-Intrinsic Model (SCIM) variant focused on the inclusion of
quasiparticle excitations into the description. Finally, we highlight several

globally low latency, high availability, scalability, and built-in fault
tolerance. Unfortunately, programming correct applications on top of such
systems has proven to be very challenging, in large part because of the weak
consistency guarantees they offer. These complexities are exacerbated when we
try to adapt existing highly-performant concurrent libraries developed for
shared-memory environments to this setting. The use of these libraries,
developed with performance and scalability in mind, is highly desirable. But,
identifying a suitable notion of correctness to check their validity under a
weakly consistent execution model has not been well-studied, in large part
because it is problematic to naively transplant criteria such as
linearizability that has a useful interpretation in a shared-memory context to
a distributed one where the cost of imposing a (logical) global ordering on all
actions is prohibitive.
  In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing appropriate semantics and
specifications for highly-concurrent libraries in a weakly-consistent,
replicated setting. We use these specifications to develop a static analysis
framework that can automatically detect correctness violations of library
implementations parameterized with respect to the different consistency
policies provided by the underlying system. We use our framework to analyze the
behavior of a number of highly non-trivial library implementations of stacks,
queues, and exchangers. Our results provide the first demonstration that
automated correctness checking of concurrent libraries in a weakly

study has shown that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can be used for non-invasive
detection of head and neck tumors, as precancerous or cancerous lesions show
specific spectral signatures that distinguish them from healthy tissue.
However, HSI data processing is challenging due to high spectral variations,
various image interferences, and the high dimensionality of the data.
Therefore, performance of automatic HSI analysis has been limited and so far,
mostly ex-vivo studies have been presented with deep learning. In this work, we
analyze deep learning techniques for in-vivo hyperspectral laryngeal cancer
detection. For this purpose we design and evaluate convolutional neural

we propose EMPIR, ensembles of quantized DNN models with different numerical

attacks. EMPIR is based on the observation that quantized neural networks often
demonstrate much higher robustness to adversarial attacks than full precision
networks, but at the cost of a substantial loss in accuracy on the original
(unperturbed) inputs. EMPIR overcomes this limitation to achieve the 'best of
both worlds', i.e., the higher unperturbed accuracies of the full precision
models combined with the higher robustness of the low precision models, by
composing them in an ensemble. Further, as low precision DNN models have
significantly lower computational and storage requirements than full precision
models, EMPIR models only incur modest compute and memory overheads compared to
a single full-precision model (<25% in our evaluations). We evaluate EMPIR
across a suite of DNNs for 3 different image recognition tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10

epoch of slitless spectroscopy with HST, we can resolve spectra of individual
lensed supernova images for the first time. This allows us to perform an
independent measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images,
$\Delta t = 1.4 \pm 5.0$ days, which is consistent with the time-delay measured
from the light-curves.
  We also present measurements of narrow emission and absorption lines
characterizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy at z=0.4087, as well
as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z=0.2163. We detect strong Na ID
absorption in the host galaxy, indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass
of SNe Ia displaying ""anomalously"" large Na ID column densities in comparison
to the amount of dust extinction derived from their light curves. For the
deflecting galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion,
$\sigma = 129 \pm 4$ km/s, which significantly constrains the lens model.
  Since the time-delay between the SN images is negligible, we can use
unresolved ground based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor ~70 from lensing
magnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented
signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as
pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the
Si II-line indicate that iPTF16geu, besides being lensed, is a normal SN Ia,
indistinguishable from well-studied ones in the local universe, providing
support for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We do not detect any

the blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and
[6,6]-phenyl-C$_{61}$-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Microscopic
understanding of the energy conversion mechanism in this system involves the
relationship between the electronic structure and the atomistic geometry of
P3HT:PCBM interfaces. In this work, the effect of the number of P3HT layers on
the electronic structure of the P3HT:PCBM interface is studied by means of
first-principles $GW$. We apply the substrate screening approach to accelerate
such calculations and to better understand the many-body dielectric screening
at the interface. The quasiparticle band gap of the entire interface is found
to decrease as the number of P3HT layers increases. The gaps of the individual
components of the interface are found to be smaller than their isolated
counterparts, with strong dependence on the number of P3HT layers. Importantly,
when comparing the system of P3HT:PCBM - where a single interface is present -
and the system of P3HT:PCBM:P3HT, where an interface is formed on either side
of PCBM, we find that the two systems exhibit very different quasiparticle
energy level alignments. We discuss possible implications of our findings in
related experiments. The observed trends in layer-dependent quasiparticle
electronic structure of P3HT:PCBM interfaces provide computational insight into
energy conversion pathways in these materials.

Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an
additional 24.5% reduction in mobility the following week, and subsequent

mobility were associated with substantial reductions in case growth 2 to 4

Investigating the latter option, we introduce the \textit{Quantum Computational
Hybrid} (QCH) security model, where we assume that computationally secure
encryption may only be broken after time much longer than the coherence time of
available quantum memories. We propose an explicit $d$-dimensional key
distribution protocol, that we call MUB-\textit{Quantum Computational Timelock}
(MUB-QCT) where one bit is encoded on a qudit state chosen among $d+1$ mutually
unbiased bases (MUBs). Short-term-secure encryption is used to share the basis
information with legitimate users while keeping it unknown from Eve until after
her quantum memory decoheres. This allows reducing Eve's optimal attack to an
immediate measurement followed by post-measurement decoding. \par We
demonstrate that MUB-QCT enables everlasting secure key distribution with input
states containing up to $O(\sqrt{d})$ photons. This leads to a series of
important improvements when compared to QKD: on the functional side, the
ability to operate securely between one sender and many receivers, whose
implementation can moreover be untrusted; significant performance increase,
characterized by a $O(\sqrt{d})$ multiplication of key rates and an extension
by $25 {\rm} km \times \log(d)$ of the attainable distance over fiber.
Implementable with a large number of modes with current or near-term multimode
photonics technologies, the MUB-QCT construction has the potential to provide a
radical shift to the performance and practicality of quantum key distribution.

from the critical issue of mRNA instability and degradation, which is a major
obstacle in the storage, distribution, and efficacy of the vaccine. Previous
work showed that optimizing secondary structure stability lengthens mRNA
half-life, which, together with optimal codons, increases protein expression.
Therefore, a principled mRNA design algorithm must optimize both structural
stability and codon usage to improve mRNA efficiency. However, due to
synonymous codons, the mRNA design space is prohibitively large, e.g., there
are $\sim\!10^{632}$ mRNAs for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which poses
insurmountable challenges to previous methods. Here we provide a surprisingly
simple solution to this hard problem by reducing it to a classical problem in
computational linguistics, where finding the optimal mRNA is akin to finding
the most likely sentence among similar sounding alternatives. Our algorithm,
named LinearDesign, takes only 11 minutes for the Spike protein, and can
jointly optimize stability and codon usage. Experimentally, without chemical
modification, our designs substantially improve mRNA half-life and protein
expression in vitro, and dramatically increase antibody response by up to
23$\times$ in vivo, compared to the codon-optimized benchmark. Our work enables
the exploration of highly stable and efficient designs that are previously
unreachable and is a timely tool not only for vaccines but also for mRNA
medicine encoding all therapeutic proteins (e.g., monoclonal antibodies and
anti-cancer drugs).

fuels with renewables as a primary source of energy. Non-electric renewable
potential being limited, this implies extending the use of electricity

electrification or synthetic fuels. Modeling the transformation towards such an
energy system is challenging, because it imposes to consider fluctuations of
wind and solar and the manifold ways the demand side could adjust to these

  This paper introduces a graph-based method to formulate energy system models
to address these challenges. By organizing sets in rooted trees, two features
to facilitate modeling high shares of renewables and sector integration are
enabled. First, the method allows the level of temporal and spatial detail to
be varied by energy carrier. This enables modeling with a high level of detail
and a large scope, while keeping models computationally tractable. Second, the
degree to which energy carriers are substitutable when converted, stored,
transported, or consumed can be modeled to achieve a detailed but flexible
representation of sector integration. An application of the formulation
demonstrates that the variation of temporal detail achieves an average
reduction in computation time of 70\%.

a method and empirical evidence towards a robot learning framework that
facilitates continuous adaption. In particular, we demonstrate how to adapt
vision-based robotic manipulation policies to new variations by fine-tuning via
off-policy reinforcement learning, including changes in background, object
shape and appearance, lighting conditions, and robot morphology. Further, this
adaptation uses less than 0.2% of the data necessary to learn the task from

substantial performance gains over the course of fine-tuning, and that
pre-training via RL is essential: training from scratch or adapting from
supervised ImageNet features are both unsuccessful with such small amounts of
data. We also find that these positive results hold in a limited continual
learning setting, in which we repeatedly fine-tune a single lineage of policies
using data from a succession of new tasks. Our empirical conclusions are
consistently supported by experiments on simulated manipulation tasks, and by
52 unique fine-tuning experiments on a real robotic grasping system pre-trained

correlate with SN Ia distance modulus residuals. We use a compiled sample of
$\sim1450$ spectroscopically confirmed, photometric light-curves of SN Ia and
propose a solution to these three problems simultaneously that also explains an
empirical 11$\sigma$ detection of the dependence of Hubble residual scatter on
SN Ia color. We introduce a physical model of color where intrinsic SN Ia
colors with a relatively weak correlation with luminosity are combined with
extrinsic dust-like colors ($E(B-V)$) with a wide range of extinction parameter
values ($R_V$). This model captures the observed trends of Hubble residual
scatter and indicates that the dominant component of SN Ia intrinsic scatter is
from variation in $R_V$. We also find that the recovered $E(B-V)$ and $R_V$
distributions differ based on global host-galaxy stellar mass and this explains
the observed correlation ($\gamma$) between mass and Hubble residuals seen in
past analyses as well as an observed 4.5$\sigma$ dependence of $\gamma$ on SN
Ia color. This finding removes any need to prescribe different intrinsic
luminosities to different progenitor systems. Finally we measure biases in the
equation-of-state of dark energy ($w$) up to $|\Delta w|=0.04$ by replacing
previous models of SN color with our dust-based model; this bias is larger than
any systematic uncertainty in previous SN Ia cosmological analyses.

intergalactic small-scale structure and the 21 cm signal during reionization.
Streaming velocities reduced clumping in the intergalactic medium (IGM) on mass
scales of $\sim 10^4 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$. This effect produced a distinct
baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the 21 cm power spectrum at wave
numbers $k\sim 0.1$ h/Mpc, near which forthcoming surveys will be most
sensitive. In contrast to the highly uncertain impact of streaming velocities
on star formation, the effect on clumping is better constrained because it is
set mainly by cosmology and straightforward gas dynamics. We quantify the
latter using coupled radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that capture the Jeans
scale of pre-reionization gas. The clumping factor of ionized gas is reduced by
5-10\% in regions with RMS streaming velocities. The suppression peaks $\approx
5$ Myr after a region is reionized, but disappears within 200 Myr due to
pressure smoothing. We model the corresponding impact on the 21 cm signal and
find that the BAO feature is most likely to appear at $\approx$ 10 \%
ionization. During this phase, the feature may appear at the 1 \% (5 \%) level
at $k \sim 0.1 (0.06)$ h/Mpc with an amplitude that varies by a factor of $<
10$ across a range of reionization histories. We also provide a model for the
signal originating from streaming velocity's impact on ionizing sources, which
can vary by 4 orders of magnitude depending on highly uncertain source
properties. We find that the clumping signal probably dominates the source one
unless Population III star formation in $10^6 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ halos
contributed significantly to the first 10\% of reionization.

relativistic jet pointing 15 to 30 degrees away from the direction of
observation. The cocoon was energized by the interaction of the incipient jet
with the non-relativistic baryon wind from the merger remnant, resulting in a
structured outflow with a narrow core and broad wings. In this paper, we couple
the observational constraints on the structured outflow with a model for the
jet-wind interaction to constrain the intrinsic properties with which the jet
was launched by the central engine, including its time delay from the merger
event. Using wind prescriptions inspired by magnetized BNS merger simulations,
we find that the jet was launched within about 0.4 s from the merger, implying
that the 1.74 s observed delay was dominated by the fireball propagation up to
the photospheric radius. We also constrain, for the first time for any
gamma-ray burst, the jet opening angle at injection and set a lower limit to
its asymptotic Lorentz factor. These findings suggest an initially
Poynting-flux dominated jet, launched via electromagnetic processes. If the jet
was powered by an accreting black hole, they also provide a significant
constraint on the survival time of the metastable neutron star remnant.

materials, including topological insulators, semimetals and twisted bilayers. A
unifying property of these systems is strong orbital hybridization, which
involves pairing of states with non-trivial Bloch wave functions. In contrast
to naive expectation, many of these superconductors are relatively resilient to
disorder. Here we study the effects of a generic disorder on superconductivity
in doped 3D Dirac systems, which serve as a paradigmatic example for the
dispersion near a band crossing point. We argue that due to strong orbital
hybridization, interorbital scattering processes are naturally present and must
be taken into account. We calculate the reduction of the critical temperature
for a variety of pairing states and scattering channels using Abrikosov-Gor'kov
theory. In that way, the role of disorder is captured by a single parameter
$\Gamma$, the pair scattering rate. This procedure is very general and can be
readily applied to different band structures and disorder configurations. Our
results show that interorbital scattering has a significant effect on
superconductivity, where the robustness of different pairing states highly
depends on the relative strength of the different interorbital scattering
channels. Our analysis also reveals a protection, analogous to the Anderson's
theorem, of the odd-parity pairing state with total angular momentum zero (the
B-phase of superfluid $^3$He). This odd-pairty state is a singlet of partners
under $\mathcal{CT}$ symmetry (rather than $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in the
standard Anderson's theory), where $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are chiral

thermodynamics, entropy has been increasing ever since the Big Bang. The fact
that matter is in thermal equilibrium in the very early Universe, as indicated
by the cosmic microwave background, has led to the idea that gravitational
entropy must be very low in the beginning. Penrose proposed that gravitational
entropy can be quantified by the Weyl curvature, which increases as structures
formed. A concrete realization of such a measure is the Clifton-Ellis-Tavakol
gravitational entropy, which has been shown to be increasing in quite a number
of cosmological models. In this work, we show a counter-example involving a
class of inhomogeneous universes that are supported by a chameleon massless
scalar field and exhibit anisotropic spacetime shearing effects. In fact, in
our model the Clifton-Ellis-Tavakol gravitational entropy is increasing
although the magnitude of the Weyl curvature is decreasing; this is due to the
growth of the spacetime shear. The topology and the values of the three free
parameters of the model are constrained by imposing a positive energy density
for the cosmic fluid, and the thermodynamical requirements which follow from
the cosmological holographic principle and the second law. It is shown that a
negative deceleration parameter and a time decreasing Weyl curvature
automatically follow from those conditions. Thus, we argue that our model can
account for the formation of some primordial structures, like the Large Quasar

In particular, we train a GAN to produce both weak lensing convergence maps and
dark matter overdensity field data for multiple redshifts, cosmological

spectral indices and corresponding thermal (free-free) emission fractions for a
sample of 335 discrete regions having significant detections in at least two
radio bands. After removing 14 likely background galaxies, we find that the
median thermal fraction at 33 GHz is $92 \pm 0.8\%$ with a median absolute
deviation of $11\%$, when a two-component power-law model is adopted to fit the
radio spectrum. Limiting the sample to 238 sources that are confidently
identified as star-forming regions, and not affected by potential AGN
contamination (i.e., having galactocentric radii $r_{\rm G} \geq 250$ pc),
results in a median thermal fraction of $93 \pm 0.8 \%$ with a median absolute
deviation of $10\%$. We further measure the thermal fraction at 33 GHz for 163
regions identified at 7"" resolution to be $94 \pm 0.8 \%$ with a median
absolute deviation of $8\%$. Together, these results confirm that free-free
emission dominates the radio spectra of star-forming regions on scales up to
$\sim$500 pc in normal star-forming galaxies. We additionally find a factor of
$\sim$1.6 increase in the scatter of the measured spectral index and thermal
fraction distributions as a function of decreasing galactocentric radius. This
trend is likely reflective of the continuous star-formation activity occurring
in the galaxy centers, resulting a larger contribution of diffuse nonthermal
emission relative to star-forming regions in the disk.

Three concepts of noise were considered: antagonistic noise in the linear term,
stochastic noise in the linear term, and noise in the quadratic term, as well
as combinations of the first and second with the last. It was experimentally
obtained that error accumulation is absent for any of the considered concepts,
which differs from the folklore opinion that, as in accelerated methods, error
accumulation must take place. The paper gives motivation for why the error may
not accumulate. The dependence of the solution error both on the magnitude
(scale) of the noise and on the size of the solution using the conjugate
gradient method was also experimentally investigated. Hypotheses about the
dependence of the error in the solution on the noise scale and the size

applications, such as image retrieval, automatic navigation, and disabled
people support. A well-developed task of image description generation is image
captioning, which usually generates a short captioning sentence and thus
neglects many of fine-grained properties, e.g., the information of subtle
objects and their relationships. In this paper, we study the visual paragraph
generation, which can describe the image with a long paragraph containing rich
details. Previous research often generates the paragraph via a hierarchical
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-like model, which has complex memorising,
forgetting and coupling mechanism. Instead, we propose a novel pure CNN model,
ParaCNN, to generate visual paragraph using hierarchical CNN architecture with
contextual information between sentences within one paragraph. The ParaCNN can
generate an arbitrary length of a paragraph, which is more applicable in many
real-world applications. Furthermore, to enable the ParaCNN to model paragraph
comprehensively, we also propose an adversarial twin net training scheme.
During training, we force the forwarding network's hidden features to be close
to that of the backwards network by using adversarial training. During testing,
we only use the forwarding network, which already includes the knowledge of the
backwards network, to generate a paragraph. We conduct extensive experiments on
the Stanford Visual Paragraph dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

translated into multi-sorted first-order logic with theories, including

formulate a SIR-type Markov jump process as the solution of a stochastic
differential equation with respect to a Poisson Random Measure (PRM), and how
to simulate the process trajectory deterministically from a parameter value and
a PRM realisation.
  This forms the basis of our Data Augmented MCMC, which consists in augmenting
parameter space with the unobserved PRM value. The resulting simple
Metropolis-Hastings sampler acts as an efficient simulation-based inference
method, that can easily be transferred from model to model. Compared with a
recent Data Augmentation method based on Gibbs sampling of individual infection
histories, PRM-augmented MCMC scales much better with epidemic size and is far
more flexible.
  PRM-augmented MCMC also yields a posteriori estimates of the PRM, that
represent process stochasticity, and which can be used to validate the model.
If the model is good, the posterior distribution should exhibit no pattern and
be close to the PRM prior distribution. We illustrate this by fitting a
non-seasonal model to some simulated seasonal case count data. Applied to the
Zika epidemic of 2013 in French Polynesia, our approach shows that a simple
SEIR model cannot correctly reproduce both the initial sharp increase in the
number of cases as well as the final proportion of seropositive.
  PRM-augmentation thus provides a coherent story for Stochastic Epidemic Model
inference, where explicitly inferring process stochasticity helps with model
validation.

like C$_{2}$, C$_{3}$ and CN were absent in comet C/2016 R2. However, the comet
spectrum showed very strong emission bands from ionic species like CO$^{+}$ and
N$_{2}^{+}$. A mean N$_{2}$/CO ratio of 0.09 $\pm$ 0.02 was derived from the
spectra and an extremely low depletion factor of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.4 has been
estimated for this ratio as compared to the solar nebula. We have also detected
minor emission features beyond 5400 Angstroms, albeit marginally. The column
densities of CO$^{+}$ and N$_{2}^{+}$ were calculated from their emission

The low depletion factor of N$_{2}$/CO ratio in this comet, as compared to the

approach is to use asymptotic analysis to show that the optimal smoothing
parameter is a polynomial function of the sample size and an unknown constant.
The unknown constant is then estimated through empirical subsample
extrapolation. The proposed method significantly reduces the computational
costs of selecting smoothing parameters in high-dimensional and large samples.
We show smoothing parameters chosen by the proposed method tend to the optimal
smoothing parameters that minimise a specific risk function. In addition, the
estimator based on the proposed smoothing parameters achieves the optimal
convergence rate. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the numerical
advantage of the proposed method over competing methods in terms of relative
efficacies and running time. On an application to molecular dynamics data with
nearly one million observations, the proposed method has the best prediction
performance.

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recently it has been noticed that the
viral Spike protein has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins
may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the
Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource, ELM, and were presented with candidate short
linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with
potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton and
cell signalling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates.
They suggest potential interactions with the AP2 mu2 subunit as well as I-BAR,
LC3, PDZ, PTB and SH2 domains found in signalling and regulatory proteins
present in epithelial lung cells. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences,
suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, often involving tyrosine
phosphorylation status. Candidate LIR motifs are present in the tails of ACE2
and integrin beta3, suggesting that these proteins can directly recruit
autophagy components. We also noticed that the extracellular part of ACE2 has a
conserved MIDAS structural motif, which are commonly used by beta integrins for
ligand binding, potentially supporting the proposal that integrins and ACE2
share common ligands. The findings presented here identify several molecular
links and testable hypotheses that might help uncover the mechanisms of
SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry and replication, and strengthen the possibility
that it might be possible to develop host-directed therapies to dampen the
efficiency of viral entry and hamper disease progression. The strong sequence
conservation means that these putative SLiMs are good candidates: Nevertheless,
SLiMs must always be validated by experimentation before they can be stated to
be functional.

boron-substituted GNRs suspended between tip and sample of a scanning tunneling

imaging data, producing powerful networks agnostic to contrast introduced by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While classical registration methods
accurately estimate the spatial correspondence between images, they solve an
optimization problem for every new image pair. Learning-based techniques are
fast at test time but limited to registering images with contrasts and
geometric content similar to those seen during training. We propose to remove
this dependency on training data by leveraging a generative strategy for
diverse synthetic label maps and images that exposes networks to a wide range
of variability, forcing them to learn more invariant features. This approach
results in powerful networks that accurately generalize to a broad array of MRI
contrasts. We present extensive experiments with a focus on 3D neuroimaging,
showing that this strategy enables robust and accurate registration of
arbitrary MRI contrasts even if the target contrast is not seen by the networks
during training. We demonstrate registration accuracy surpassing the state of
the art both within and across contrasts, using a single model. Critically,
training on arbitrary shapes synthesized from noise distributions results in
competitive performance, removing the dependency on acquired data of any kind.
Additionally, since anatomical label maps are often available for the anatomy
of interest, we show that synthesizing images from these dramatically boosts
performance, while still avoiding the need for real intensity images. Our code
is available at https://w3id.org/synthmorph.

atmospheric perturbations. Each image was reduced via bias and dark frames to
account for sensor noise, and then the full width at half maximum for each

imply that at small scales aperture size primarily controls the observed
maximum angular resolution, but further data are required to substantiate the

keV and a drop at higher energies. The distortions allow the most important
cluster parameters to be measured. The spectral shape of the distortions and
its dependence on the gas temperature, optical depth, and surface density
distribution law have been studied using Monte Carlo computations and confirmed
by analytical estimations. In the cluster frame the maximum of the background
decrease due to the recoil effect occurs at ~500-600 keV. The photoionization
of H- and He-like iron and nickel ions leads to additional distortions in the
background spectrum - a strong absorption line with the threshold at ~9 keV
(and also to an absorption jump at ~2 keV for cold clusters). The absorption of
intrinsic thermal radiation from the cluster gas by these ions also leads to
such lines. In nearby (z<1) clusters the line at ~2 keV is noticeably enhanced
by absorption in the colder (~10^6 K) plasma of their peripheral (~3 Mpc)
regions; moreover, the absorption line at ~1.3 keV splits off from it. The
redshift of distant clusters shifts the absorption lines in the background
spectrum (at ~2, ~9, and ~500 keV) to lower energies. Thus, in contrast to the
microwave background scattering effect, this effect depends on the cluster
redshift z, but in a very peculiar way. When observing clusters at z>1, the
effect allows one to determine how the X-ray background evolved and how it was
""gathered"" with z. To detect the effect, the accuracy of measurements should
reach ~0.1%. We consider the most promising clusters for observing the effect
and discuss the techniques whereby the influence of the thermal gas radiation
hindering the detection of background distortions should be minimal.

rectifying the coefficients of a noisy image in the transform domain, using a
set of scalar shrinkage function (SFs). A plethora of papers deals with the
optimal shape of the SFs and the transform used, where it is known that
applying the SFs in redundant bases provides improved results. This paper
provides a complete picture of the interrelations between the transform used,
the optimal shrinkage functions, and the domains in which they are optimized.
In particular, we show that for subband optimization, where each SF is
optimized independently for a particular band, optimizing the SFs in the
spatial domain is always better than or equal to optimizing the SFs in the
transform domain. For redundant bases, we provide the expected denoising gain

quantification of (i) risk reduced due to cooperation, and (ii) the increased
accuracy of risk assessment due to cooperation. If either is significant,
cooperation can be viewed as a desirable practice for meeting the stringent
risk budget of increasingly automated vehicles; if not, then cooperation - with
its various drawbacks - need not be pursued. Collision risk is evaluated over
an ego vehicle's trajectory based on a dynamic probabilistic occupancy map and
a loss function that maps collision-relevant state information to a cost
metric. The risk evaluation framework is demonstrated using real data captured
from two cooperating vehicles traversing an urban intersection.

by re-considering the RH-relations and the shock refraction equations.
Non-dissociating gas in thermal equilibrium state, with excited translational,
rotational, vibrational, and electronic degrees of freedom is considered. When
applied to N2 gas at T=3000 K, 11% density increase and 17% temperature and 7%
pressure jump decrease were found, compared to that in ideal gas. The derived
relations are largely built on experimental data thus avoiding the complexity
of careful accounting for all real gas effects and still offering satisfactory
precision levels. The main result is that in real gases the effect in the
interaction can be stronger than that in an ideal gas. The findings can be of
interest in design of efficient combustors for hypersonic systems, detonation,
space and craft design, shock-flame interaction, in astrophysics, and fusion

understanding of default risk. Managers seek to steer away from trouble, credit

Topological Data Analysis tools this paper explores whether failing firms from
the United States organise neatly along the five predictors of default proposed
by the Z-score models. Firms are represented as a point cloud in a five
dimensional space, one axis for each predictor. Visualising that cloud using
Ball Mapper reveals failing firms are not often neighbours. As new modelling
approaches vie to better predict firm failure, often using black boxes to
deliver potentially over-fitting models, a timely reminder is sounded on the
importance of evidencing the identification process. Value is added to the
understanding of where in the parameter space failure occurs, and how firms
might act to move away from financial distress. Further, lenders may find
opportunity amongst subsets of firms that are traditionally considered to be in
danger of bankruptcy but actually sit in characteristic spaces where failure
has not occurred.

algorithm for weighted graphs undergoing edge insertions and deletions. We
obtain a trade-off between amortized update time and expected stretch against

a tree of expected stretch $ O (\log^4 n) $ with update time $ m^{1/2 + o(1)} $
or a tree of expected stretch $ n^{o(1)} $ with update time $ n^{o(1)} $ (for
edge weights polynomial in $ n $). A guarantee of the latter type has so far
only been known for maintaining tree embeddings with average (instead of
expected) stretch [Chechik/Zhang, SODA '20].
  Our main result has direct implications to fully dynamic approximate distance
oracles and fully dynamic buy-at-bulk network design. For dynamic distance
oracles, our result is the first to break the $ O (\sqrt{m}) $ update-time
barrier. For buy-at-bulk network design, a problem which also in the static

non-trivial dynamic algorithm. As probabilistic tree embeddings are an
important tool in static approximation algorithms, further applications of our
result in dynamic approximation algorithms are conceivable.
  From a technical perspective, we obtain our main result by first designing a
decremental algorithm for probabilistic low-diameter decompositions via a
careful combination of Bartal's ball-growing approach [FOCS '96] with the
pruning framework of Chechik and Zhang [SODA '20]. We then extend this to a
fully dynamic algorithm by enriching a well-known 'decremental to fully
dynamic' reduction with a new bootstrapping idea to recursively employ a fully
dynamic algorithm instead of a static one in this reduction.

down the economy while staying within the capacity of the healthcare system. We
base our analysis on a detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model, which
takes into account different population groups and phases of the disease,
including incubation, infection period, hospitalization, and treatment in the
intensive care unit (ICU). We model the healthcare capacity as the total number
of hospital and ICU beds for the whole country. We calibrate the model
parameters to data reported in several recent research papers. For high- and
low-risk population groups, we calculate the number of total and intensive care
hospitalizations, and deaths as functions of time. The main conclusion is that
countries, which enforce reasonable hygienic measures on time can avoid
lockdowns throughout the pandemic provided that the number of spare ICU beds
per million is above the threshold of about 100. In countries where the total
number of ICU beds is below this threshold, a limited period quarantine to
specific high-risk groups of the population suffices. Furthermore, in the case
of an inadequate capacity of the healthcare system, we incorporate a feedback
loop and demonstrate that quantitative impact of the lack of ICU units on the
death curve. In the case of inadequate ICU beds, full- and partial-quarantine
scenarios outcomes are almost identical, making it unnecessary to shut down the
whole economy. We conclude that only a limited-time quarantine of the high-risk
group might be necessary, while the rest of the economy can remain operational.

for Care Improvement (BPCI) participating providers and non-participating
providers for both Major Joint Replacement of the Lower Extremity (MJRLE) and
Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) episodes. Methods: A
difference-in-differences approach estimated the differential change in
outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries who had an MJRLE or AMI at a BPCI
participating hospital between the baseline (January 2011 through September
2013) and intervention (October 2013 through December 2016) periods and
beneficiaries with the same episode (MJRLE or AMI) at a matched comparison
hospital. Main Outcomes and Measures: Medicare payments, LOS, and readmissions
during the episode, which includes the anchor hospitalization and the 90-day
post discharge period. Results: Mean total Medicare payments for an MJRLE
episode and the 90-day post discharge period declined $444 more (p < 0.0001)
for Medicare beneficiaries with episodes initiated in a BPCI-participating
provider than for the beneficiaries in a comparison provider. This reduction
was mainly due to reduced institutional post-acute care (PAC) payments. Slight
reductions in carrier payments and LOS were estimated. Readmission rates were
not statistically different between the BPCI and the comparison populations.
These findings suggest that PAC use can be reduced without adverse effects on
recovery from MJRLE. The lack of statistically significant differences in
effects for AMI could be explained by a smaller sample size or more
heterogenous recovery paths in AMI. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, as
currently designed, bundled payments can be effective in reducing payments for
MJRLE episodes of care, but not necessarily for AMI. Most savings came from the
declines in PAC. These findings are consistent with the results reported in the
BPCI model evaluation for CMS.

must be spontaneously broken in the confinement phase, and there exist $N$
vacua. Theories with even $K$ possess a physical $\theta$ angle despite the

to spontaneous $CP$ breaking. Both of these predictions are explicitly
confirmed by reliable semiclassics on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with the

with a function which specifies a minimum acceptable rate of energy dissipation
for the CLF at different points in the state-space. Treating the energy
dissipation condition as a constraint on the desired closed-loop behavior of

solved using model-free policy optimization algorithms using data collected
from the plant. We discuss when the optimization learns a stabilizing
controller for the real world system and derive conditions on the structure of
the learned controller which ensure that the optimization is strongly convex,
meaning the globally optimal solution can be found reliably. We validate the
approach in simulation, first for a double pendulum, and then generalize the
framework to learn stable walking controllers for underactuated bipedal robots
using the Hybrid Zero Dynamics framework. By encoding a large amount of

much-involved physics and mathematics (as compared with nonrelativistic quantum
chemistry), it is still necessary to clean up the essentials underlying the
relativistic electronic structure theories and methodologies (such that
uninitiated readers can pick up quickly the right ideas and tools for further
development or application) and meanwhile pinpoint future directions of the
field. To this end, the three aspects of electronic structure calculations,

parametric modeling assumptions. However, the use of machine learning may
result in complications for inference. Doubly-robust cross-fit estimators have
been proposed to yield better statistical properties.
  We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of several
different estimators for the average causal effect (ACE). The data generating
mechanisms for the simulated treatment and outcome included log-transforms,
polynomial terms, and discontinuities. We compared singly-robust estimators
(g-computation, inverse probability weighting) and doubly-robust estimators
(augmented inverse probability weighting, targeted maximum likelihood
estimation). Nuisance functions were estimated with parametric models and
ensemble machine learning, separately. We further assessed doubly-robust
cross-fit estimators.
  With correctly specified parametric models, all of the estimators were
unbiased and confidence intervals achieved nominal coverage. When used with
machine learning, the doubly-robust cross-fit estimators substantially
outperformed all of the other estimators in terms of bias, variance, and
confidence interval coverage.
  Due to the difficulty of properly specifying parametric models in high
dimensional data, doubly-robust estimators with ensemble learning and
cross-fitting may be the preferred approach for estimation of the ACE in most
epidemiologic studies. However, these approaches may require larger sample
sizes to avoid finite-sample issues.

better than $250$ ps (150 ps) for energy depositions above 2 MeVee (5 MeVee).
Cosmic rays and a variety of radioactive sources were used to calibration the

the server imposes a geometric regularizer after each round to encourage

query is a cell phone picture rather than a digital scan. To solve this
problem, we introduce a mid-level feature representation called a bootleg score
which explicitly encodes the rules of Western musical notation. We convert both
the MIDI and the sheet music into bootleg scores using deterministic rules of
music and classical computer vision techniques for detecting simple geometric
shapes. Once the MIDI and cell phone image have been converted into bootleg

diagram that contains winding numbers $w=0, 1$, and $2$. In the presence of

numerically calculated. We find that the disorder drives phase transitions:
$w=0 \rightarrow 1, 0 \rightarrow 2 $, $1 \rightarrow 2$ and $2 \rightarrow 1$,
in which the non-zero winding numbers driven by disorder are called the
topological Anderson insulating (TAI) phases. The transition mechanisms in this
long-range SSH model are investigated by means of localization length and
self-energy. We find that the localization length has a drastic change at the
transition point, and the corresponding critical disorder strength is obtained
by further using Born approximation to the self-energy. The origin for the $w =
0$ to $w = 1, 2$ transitions is attributed to the energy gap renormalization
(first Born approximation), while for the transitions from $w=1$ to $w=2$ and
vice versa are the strong scattering (self-consistent Born approximation). The
result of self-consistent Born approximation suggests that in the thermodynamic
limit, the gap closing point is not at the Fermi level for the system with
localized edge states. This agrees with the topological protection of edge
states, such that the pre-existent edge states are protected from being
scattered into bulk. Given the experimental feasibility of the long-range SSH

weak oscillating magnetic field. We derive a Lindblad master equation for the
orbital and spin degrees of freedom, where one- and two-phonon processes are
considered for the phonon-induced relaxation, and the thermal dependence of Ham
reduction factors is calculated. We find that the suppression of ESR signals is
due to phonon broadening but not based on the common assumption of orbital
quenching. Our results can be applied to explain the experimentally observed
absence of the ESR signal in color centers in diamond, such as the neutral

number of data points that belong to each class in an unlabeled sample.
Traditionally, researchers in this field assume the availability of labelled
observations for all classes to induce a quantification model. However, we
often face situations where the number of classes is large or even unknown, or
we have reliable data for a single class. When inducing a multi-class
quantifier is infeasible, we are often concerned with estimates for a specific
class of interest. In this context, we have proposed a novel setting known as
One-class Quantification (OCQ). In contrast, Positive and Unlabeled Learning
(PUL), another branch of Machine Learning, has offered solutions to OCQ,
despite quantification not being the focal point of PUL. This article closes
the gap between PUL and OCQ and brings both areas together under a unified
view. We compare our method, Passive Aggressive Threshold (PAT), against PUL
methods and show that PAT generally is the fastest and most accurate algorithm.
PAT induces quantification models that can be reused to quantify different
samples of data. We additionally introduce Exhaustive TIcE (ExTIcE), an
improved version of the PUL algorithm Tree Induction for c Estimation (TIcE).
We show that ExTIcE quantifies more accurately than PAT and the other assessed
algorithms in scenarios where several negative observations are identical to
the positive ones.

memory walls among the memory components of multiple LSM-trees and between the
write memory and the buffer cache. Optimal memory allocation among these

LSM-tree implementations instead adopt static memory allocation schemes due to
their simplicity and robustness, sacrificing performance. In this paper, we
attempt to break down these memory walls in LSM-based storage systems. We first
present a memory management architecture that enables adaptive memory
management. We then present a partitioned memory component structure with new
flush policies to better exploit the write memory to minimize the write cost.
To break down the memory wall between the write memory and the buffer cache, we
further introduce a memory tuner that tunes the memory allocation between these
two regions. We have conducted extensive experiments in the context of Apache
AsterixDB using the YCSB and TPC-C benchmarks and we present the results here.

previous works, the silicate strength is weakly correlated with the hydrogen
column density ($N_\mathrm{H}^\mathrm{X}$), albeit with large scatters. For
X-ray unobscured AGNs, the silicate-strength-derived $V$-band extinction and
the broad-H$\alpha$-inferred one are both small; however, for X-ray obscured

mainly focus on how to learn discriminative features, our method considers how
to compare and fuse the extracted feature pair to reason about the kin
relations. The proposed GKR constructs a star graph called kinship relational
graph where each peripheral node represents the information comparison in one
feature dimension and the central node is used as a bridge for information
communication among peripheral nodes. Then the GKR performs relational
reasoning on this graph with recursive message passing. Extensive experimental
results on the KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets show that the proposed GKR
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

recombination of electrons and holes is accompanied by excitation of other

excess energy of the excited carriers is normally rapidly converted to heat,
making Auger processes difficult to probe directly. Here, we employ a technique
in which the Auger-excited carriers are detected by their ability to tunnel out
of the semiconductor through a thin barrier, generating a current. We employ
vertical van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with monolayer WSe2 as the
semiconductor and the wide band gap hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as the tunnel
barrier to preferentially transmit high-energy Auger-excited carriers to a
graphite electrode. The unambiguous signatures of Auger processes are a rise in
the photocurrent when excitons are created by resonant excitation, and negative
differential photoconductance resulting from the shifts of the exciton
resonances with voltage. We detect holes Auger-excited by both neutral and
charged excitons, and find that the Auger scattering is surprisingly strong
under weak excitation. The selective extraction of Auger carriers at low,
controlled carrier densities that is enabled by vdW heterostructures
illustrates an important addition to the techniques available for probing

However, heterogeneous and limited computation and communication resources on

In this article, we propose a novel framework of 'learning to learn' for

We first model the dynamic determination of collaboration strategy (i.e. the
allocation of local iterations at edge servers and global aggregations on the
Cloud during collaborative learning process) as an online optimization problem
to achieve the tradeoff between the performance of EL and the resource
consumption of edge servers. Then, we propose an Online Learning for EL (OL4EL)

both synchronous and asynchronous learning patterns, and can be used for both
supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. To evaluate the performance of
OL4EL, we conducted both real-world testbed experiments and extensive
simulations based on docker containers, where both Support Vector Machine and
K-means were considered as use cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
OL4EL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EL and other collaborative ML

these reduced models hold promise for understanding key physical mechanisms,

obtained by projection of the MHD equations onto a truncated modal basis, and
data-driven models, obtained by modern machine learning and system

reduction for nonlinear MHD systems. To avoid separate modal decompositions for
the magnetic, velocity, and pressure fields, we introduce an energy inner
product to synthesize all of the fields into a dimensionally-consistent,
reduced-order basis. Next, we obtain an analytic model by Galerkin projection
of the Hall-MHD equations onto these modes. We illustrate how global
conservation laws constrain the model parameters, revealing symmetries that can
be enforced in data-driven models, directly connecting these models to the
underlying physics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on data

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning framework
for collaborative model training with a network of clients (edge devices). FL
offers default client privacy by allowing clients to keep their sensitive data
on local devices and to only share local training parameter updates with the
federated server. However, recent studies have shown that even sharing local
parameter updates from a client to the federated server may be susceptible to
gradient leakage attacks and intrude the client privacy regarding its training
data. In this paper, we present a principled framework for evaluating and
comparing different forms of client privacy leakage attacks. We first provide
formal and experimental analysis to show how adversaries can reconstruct the
private local training data by simply analyzing the shared parameter update
from local training (e.g., local gradient or weight update vector). We then
analyze how different hyperparameter configurations in federated learning and
different settings of the attack algorithm may impact on both attack
effectiveness and attack cost. Our framework also measures, evaluates, and
analyzes the effectiveness of client privacy leakage attacks under different
gradient compression ratios when using communication efficient FL protocols.
Our experiments also include some preliminary mitigation strategies to
highlight the importance of providing a systematic attack evaluation framework
towards an in-depth understanding of the various forms of client privacy
leakage threats in federated learning and developing theoretical foundations
for attack mitigation.

when sequential data are targeted. For example, in a safety-critical
environment, it is crucial to have an automatic detection system to screen the
streaming data gathered by monitoring sensors and to report abnormal
observations if detected in real-time. Oftentimes, stakes are much higher when
these potential anomalies are intentional or goal-oriented. We propose an
end-to-end framework for sequential anomaly detection using inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL), whose objective is to determine the
decision-making agent's underlying function which triggers his/her behavior.
The proposed method takes the sequence of actions of a target agent (and
possibly other meta information) as input. The agent's normal behavior is then
understood by the reward function which is inferred via IRL. We use a neural
network to represent a reward function. Using a learned reward function, we
evaluate whether a new observation from the target agent follows a normal
pattern. In order to construct a reliable anomaly detection method and take
into consideration the confidence of the predicted anomaly score, we adopt a
Bayesian approach for IRL. The empirical study on publicly available real-world
data shows that our proposed method is effective in identifying anomalies.

reliability that (i) judiciously switches off a small number of tie lines so
that the control areas are connected in a tree structure; and (ii) leverages a
unified frequency control paradigm to provide congestion management in real

provide stronger guarantees on failure localization and mitigation. We

shedding is inevitable. Moreover, generators under our approach adjust their

necessary for plant growth and survival. It is produced in the mesophyll cells
of leaves and translocated to different parts of the plant through the phloem.
Progress in understanding this transport mechanism remains fraught with
experimental difficulties thereby prompting interest in theoretical approaches
and laboratory studies. The Munch pressure and mass flow model is one of the
commonly accepted hypotheses for describing the physics of sucrose transport in
the phloem systems. It is based on osmosis to build an energy potential
difference between the source and the sink. The flow responding to this energy
potential is assumed laminar and described by the Hagen-Poiseulle equation.
This study revisits such osmotically driven flow in tubes by including the
effects of Taylor dispersion on mass transport, which has not been considered
in the context of phloem flow. Taylor dispersion is an effect in tube flow
where shear flow can increase the effective transport of species. It is shown
that in addition to the conventional Taylor dispersion diffusive correction
derived for closed pipe walls, a new adjustments to the mean advective terms,
arise because of osmotic effects. These new terms act as local sources and
sinks of sucrose, though their overall average effect is zero. Because the
molecular Schmidt number is very large for sucrose in water, the role of a
radial Peclet number emerges as controlling the sucrose front speed and travel
times above and beyond the much studied Munch number. This study establishes
upper limits on expected Taylor dispersion speed-up of sucrose transport.

fidelity of generation models w.r.t.\ logical inference. The new task poses
challenges to the existing monotonic generation frameworks due to the mismatch
between sequence order and logical order. In our experiments, we
comprehensively survey different generation architectures (LSTM, Transformer,
Pre-Trained LM) trained with different algorithms (RL, Adversarial Training,
Coarse-to-Fine) on the dataset and made following observations: 1) Pre-Trained
LM can significantly boost both the fluency and logical fidelity metrics, 2) RL

high language fluency. The code and data are available at

in common with the Ic-BL SN2006aj, which was associated with the low-luminosity
gamma-ray burst (LLGRB) 060218. First, the 10 GHz radio light curve is on the
faint end of LLGRB-SNe ($L_\mathrm{radio} \approx 10^{37}$erg/s): we model our
VLA observations (spanning 13-43 d) as synchrotron emission from a mildly
relativistic ($v \gtrsim 0.3c$) forward shock. Second, with Swift and Chandra
we detect X-ray emission ($L_X \approx 10^{41}$erg/s) that is not naturally
explained as inverse Compton emission or as part of the same synchrotron
spectrum as the radio emission. Third, high-cadence ($6\times$/night) data from
the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) shows a double-peaked optical light curve,
the first peak from shock-cooling emission from extended low-mass material
(mass $M<10^{-2} M_\odot$ at radius $R>10^{12}$cm) and the second peak from the
radioactive decay of Ni-56. SN2020bvc is the first confirmed double-peaked
Ic-BL SN discovered without a GRB trigger, and shows X-ray and radio emission
similar to LLGRB-SNe: this is consistent with models in which the same
mechanism produces both the LLGRB and the shock-cooling emission. For four of
the five other nearby ($z\lesssim0.05$) Ic-BL SNe with ZTF high-cadence data,
we rule out a first peak like that seen in SN2006aj and SN2020bvc, i.e. that
lasts $\approx 1$d and reaches a peak luminosity $M \approx -18$. X-ray and
radio follow-up observations of future such events will establish whether
double-peaked optical light curves are indeed predictive of LLGRB-like X-ray
and radio emission.

because of the asynchronous interplay of components and the environment.
Bounded synthesis automatically generates an implementation for the
specification of the distributed system if one exists. So far, bounded
synthesis for distributed systems does not utilize their asynchronous nature.
Instead, concurrent behavior of components is encoded by all interleavings and
only then checked against the specification. We close this gap by identifying
true concurrency in synthesis of asynchronous distributed systems represented
as Petri games. This defines when several interleavings can be subsumed by one
true concurrent trace. Thereby, fewer and shorter verification problems have to
be solved in each iteration of the bounded synthesis algorithm. For Petri
games, experimental results show that our implementation using true concurrency
outperforms the implementation based on checking all interleavings.

front-ends employed in broad-band communications through \textit{lossy}
channels. Time-domain receivers for broad-band communication typically deal
with large integrated noise due to its high bandwidth of operation. However,
unlike traditional wireline systems that are typically not noise-limited,
channels with high channel-loss render the input signal swing to be very small
imposing several challenges in RX design as the circuits operate in the
noise-limited regime. This simultaneous high integrated noise and low
signal-swing limits the maximum achievable data-rate for a target
bit-error-rate (BER) and deteriorates the energy-efficiency of the RX. In this
work, transient, noise and gain performance of different standard signaling
blocks have been obtained with closed-form expressions and are validated
through spice-simulations. Multi-integrator cascade has been proposed which
provides significant gain with relatively lower power consumption than the
standard gain elements. Also, maximum achievable data-rate and optimum energy
efficiency for different channel losses have been obtained theoretically for
different architectures revealing their advantages and limitations. All the
pertaining circuits have been designed in 65 nm CMOS process with a 1 V supply
voltage.

usually perform an unbiased search. This is reasonable and desirable in a
black-box scenario. For combinatorial optimization problems, often more
knowledge about the structure of optimal solutions is given, which can be
leveraged by means of biased search operators. We consider the Minimum Spanning
Tree (MST) problem in a single- and multi-objective version, and introduce a
biased mutation, which puts more emphasis on the selection of edges of low rank
in terms of low domination number. We present example graphs where the biased
mutation can significantly speed up the expected runtime until (Pareto-)optimal
solutions are found. On the other hand, we demonstrate that bias can lead to
exponential runtime if heavy edges are necessarily part of an optimal solution.
However, on general graphs in the single-objective setting, we show that a
combined mutation operator which decides for unbiased or biased edge selection
in each step with equal probability exhibits a polynomial upper bound -- as
unbiased mutation -- in the worst case and benefits from bias if the
circumstances are favorable.

$\approx$ 1.5 K). Unlike in fully-gapped superconductors, the magnetic
penetration depth $\lambda(T)$ does not saturate at low temperatures, but
instead it shows a $T^2$-dependence, characteristic of gap nodes. Both the
superfluid density and the electronic specific heat are best described by a
two-gap model comprising of a nodeless gap and a gap with nodes, rather than by
single-band models. At the same time, zero-field muon-spin spectra exhibit
increased relaxation rates below the onset of superconductivity, implying that
TRS is broken in the superconducting state of CaPtAs, hence indicating its
unconventional nature. Our observations suggest CaPtAs to be a new remarkable
material which links two apparently disparate classes, that of TRS-breaking

non negligible inter-spin interactions. Moreover, we show that the local
asympotic transport features cannot be recovered from the global ones by
letting the inter-spin coupling vanish thus pointing to the existence of
different coupling ranges where only one approach is physically tenable and
possibly a region where the two descriptions may coexist.

reduce this number of the equations and obtain a complete Lie symmetry

Consequently, trustworthy data act as fuel for applications that rely on the

debugging, risk assessment, forensic analysis, and performance tuning.
Currently, secure and reliable data communication in IoT is based on public-key
cryptosystems such as Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC). Nevertheless, reliance
on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken
by the impending quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical
primitives to quantum-safe primitives is indispensable to ensure the overall
security of data en route. In this paper, we investigate applications of one of
the post-quantum signatures called Hash-Based Signature (HBS) schemes for the
security of IoT devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the
evolution of HBS schemes with emphasis on their construction parameters and
associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline the striking features of
HBS schemes and their significance for the IoT security in the quantum era. We
investigate the optimal selection of HBS in the IoT networks with respect to
their performance-constrained requirements, resource-constrained nature, and
design optimization objectives. In addition to ongoing standardization efforts,
we also highlight current and future research and deployment challenges along
with possible solutions. Finally, we outline the essential measures and
recommendations that must be adopted by the IoT ecosystem while preparing for

Prediction (BP) and Exposure Shifting (ES). The former is designed to control
the brightness of the resulting image by estimating a guideline exposure time
$t_1$. The latter learns to approximate an exposure-shifting operator $ES$,
converting a low-light image with real exposure time $t_0$ to a noise-free
image with guideline exposure time $t_1$. Additionally, structural similarity

quality, and a new Campus Image Dataset (CID) is proposed to overcome the
limitations of the existing datasets and to supervise the training of the
proposed model. Using the proposed model, we can achieve high-quality low-light
image enhancement from a single raw image. In quantitative tests, it is shown
that the proposed method has the lowest Noise Level Estimation (NLE) score

The time-averaged flux is 1.5E-10 erg/cm2/s (3-78 keV, corrected for the
absorption), translating into an average luminosity of about 9E35 erg/s (1-100
keV, assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc). The NuSTAR observation allowed us to
perform the most sensitive search for cyclotron resonant scattering features in
the hard X-ray spectrum, resulting in no significant detection in any of the
different spectral extractions adopted (time-averaged, temporally-selected,
spin-phase-resolved and intensity-selected spectra). The pulse profile showed
an evolution with both the energy (3-12 keV energy range compared with 12-78
keV band) and the X-ray flux: a double peaked profile was evident at higher
fluxes (and in both energy bands), while a single peaked, sinusoidal profile
was present at the lowest intensity state achieved within the NuSTAR
observations (in both energy bands). The intensity-selected analysis allowed us
to observe an anti-correlation of the pulsed fraction with the X-ray
luminosity. The pulse profile evolution can be explained by X-ray photon
scattering in the accreting matter above magnetic poles of a neutron star at
the quasi-spherical settling accretion stage.

parallel, resulting in faster generation speed compared to their autoregressive
(AR) counterparts but at the cost of lower accuracy. Different techniques
including knowledge distillation and source-target alignment have been proposed
to bridge the gap between AR and NAR models in various tasks such as neural
machine translation (NMT), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text to
speech (TTS). With the help of those techniques, NAR models can catch up with
the accuracy of AR models in some tasks but not in some others. In this work,
we conduct a study to understand the difficulty of NAR sequence generation and
try to answer: (1) Why NAR models can catch up with AR models in some tasks but
not all? (2) Why techniques like knowledge distillation and source-target
alignment can help NAR models. Since the main difference between AR and NAR
models is that NAR models do not use dependency among target tokens while AR
models do, intuitively the difficulty of NAR sequence generation heavily
depends on the strongness of dependency among target tokens. To quantify such
dependency, we propose an analysis model called CoMMA to characterize the
difficulty of different NAR sequence generation tasks. We have several
interesting findings: 1) Among the NMT, ASR and TTS tasks, ASR has the most
target-token dependency while TTS has the least. 2) Knowledge distillation
reduces the target-token dependency in target sequence and thus improves the
accuracy of NAR models. 3) Source-target alignment constraint encourages
dependency of a target token on source tokens and thus eases the training of
NAR models.

extractive model that directly extracts a text span is more suitable for

reconstruction of dynamic MRI with motion compensation by learning an optical

form of an optical flow model that is sparsely represented over a learned
dictionary. This has the advantage that ground truth data is not required in
the training of the optical flow term. Furthermore, we present an efficient
optimisation scheme to tackle the non-convex problem based on an alternating

cases of a generalised eigenvalue problem. We show analytically that the
leading corrections to an energy $E_l$ in all three methods due to unresolved
states decay asymptotically exponentially like $\exp(-(E_{n}-E_l)t)$. Using
synthetic data we show that these corrections behave as expected also in
practice. We propose a novel combination of the generalised eigenvalue and the
Prony method, denoted as GEVM/PGEVM, which helps to increase the energy gap
$E_{n}-E_l$. We illustrate its usage and performance using lattice QCD

complexity of HSI data. Subspace clustering has been proven to be powerful for
exploiting the intrinsic relationship between data points. Despite the
impressive performance in the HSI clustering, traditional subspace clustering
methods often ignore the inherent structural information among data. In this
paper, we revisit the subspace clustering with graph convolution and present a
novel subspace clustering framework called Graph Convolutional Subspace
Clustering (GCSC) for robust HSI clustering. Specifically, the framework
recasts the self-expressiveness property of the data into the non-Euclidean
domain, which results in a more robust graph embedding dictionary. We show that
traditional subspace clustering models are the special forms of our framework
with the Euclidean data. Basing on the framework, we further propose two novel
subspace clustering models by using the Frobenius norm, namely Efficient GCSC
(EGCSC) and Efficient Kernel GCSC (EKGCSC). Both models have a globally optimal
closed-form solution, which makes them easier to implement, train, and apply in
practice. Extensive experiments on three popular HSI datasets demonstrate that
EGCSC and EKGCSC can achieve state-of-the-art clustering performance and
dramatically outperforms many existing methods with significant margins.

this correspondence we study an anharmonic oscillator driven by a periodic
external force with slowly varying amplitude both classically and within the
framework of quantum mechanics. The energy change of the oscillator induced by
the driving is closely related to the probability distribution of work for the
system. With the amplitude $\lambda(t)$ of the drive increasing from zero to a
maximum $\lambda_{max}$ and then going back to zero again initial and final
Hamiltonian coincide. The main quantity of interest is then the probability
density $P(E_f|E_i)$ for transitions from initial energy $E_i$ to final energy
$E_f$. In the classical case non-diagonal transitions with $E_f\neq E_i$ mainly
arise due to the mechanism of separatrix crossing. We show that approximate
analytical results within the pendulum approximation are in accordance with
numerical simulations. In the quantum case numerically exact results are
complemented with analytical arguments employing Floquet theory. For both

complex underlying data distribution, are however known to be tricky in the
training process, which would probably result in mode collapse or performance
deterioration. Current approaches of dealing with GANs' issues almost utilize
some practical training techniques for the purpose of regularization, which on
the other hand undermines the convergence and theoretical soundness of GAN. In
this paper, we propose to stabilize GAN training via a novel particle-based
variational inference -- Langevin Stein variational gradient descent (LSVGD),
which not only inherits the flexibility and efficiency of original SVGD but
aims to address its instability issues by incorporating an extra disturbance
into the update dynamics. We further demonstrate that by properly adjusting the
noise variance, LSVGD simulates a Langevin process whose stationary
distribution is exactly the target distribution. We also show that LSVGD
dynamics has an implicit regularization which is able to enhance particles'
spread-out and diversity. At last we present an efficient way of applying
particle-based variational inference on a general GAN training procedure no
matter what loss function is adopted. Experimental results on one synthetic
dataset and three popular benchmark datasets -- Cifar-10, Tiny-ImageNet and
CelebA validate that LSVGD can remarkably improve the performance and stability

training the model and/or during inference, once the model is deployed.
Scenarios where images are captured and processed in physically separated
locations are increasingly common (e.g. autonomous vehicles, cloud computing).
In addition, many devices suffer from limited resources to store or transmit
data (e.g. storage space, channel capacity). In these scenarios, lossy image
compression plays a crucial role to effectively increase the number of images
collected under such constraints. However, lossy compression entails some
undesired degradation of the data that may harm the performance of the
downstream analysis task at hand, since important semantic information may be
lost in the process. Moreover, we may only have compressed images at training
time but are able to use original images at inference time, or vice versa, and
in such a case, the downstream model suffers from covariate shift. In this
paper, we analyze this phenomenon, with a special focus on vision-based
perception for autonomous driving as a paradigmatic scenario. We see that loss
of semantic information and covariate shift do indeed exist, resulting in a
drop in performance that depends on the compression rate. In order to address
the problem, we propose dataset restoration, based on image restoration with
generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our method is agnostic to both the
particular image compression method and the downstream task; and has the
advantage of not adding additional cost to the deployed models, which is
particularly important in resource-limited devices. The presented experiments
focus on semantic segmentation as a challenging use case, cover a broad range
of compression rates and diverse datasets, and show how our method is able to
significantly alleviate the negative effects of compression on the downstream
visual task.

massive B-type stars (age range $\sim$ 0.07-0.12 Myr) are traced, which are
located away from the center of the stellar cluster NGC 6910 (age $\sim$ 4.5

is conceptually simple and elegant. We further show that it is compatible with
the frequency-dependent squeezing, which reduces both the shot noise and the

the main superoutburst. The spectra during the post-superoutburst stage showed
the Balmer, He I and possible sodium doublet features. The mass ratio is
derived as 0.0880(9) from the period of the superhump. During the third and

peculiar phenomena can be explained by the enhanced viscosity and large radius

of great interest in information technology. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation is parametrized with magnetic exchange interactions extracted from
first-principles. Depending on the nature of the defect and the magnitude of
the applied magnetic field, the skyrmion deforms by either shrinking or
increasing in size, experiencing thereby elliptical distortions. After applying
a magnetic field of 10 Tesla, ultrasmall skyrmions are driven along a straight
line towards the various defects which permits a simple analysis of the impact
of the impurities. Independently from the nature of the skyrmion-defect complex
interaction a gyrotropic motion is observed. A repulsive force leads to a
skyrmion trajectory similar to the one induced by an attractive one. We unveil
that the circular motion is clockwise around pinning impurities but counter

interaction nature of the defects by observing the skyrmions trajectories.
Moreover, and as expected, the skyrmion always escapes the repulsive defects in
contrast to the pinning defects, which require a minimal depinning current to
observe impurity avoidance. This unveils the richness of the motion regimes of
skyrmions. We discuss the results of the simulations in terms of the Thiele
equation, which provides a reasonable qualitative description of the observed
phenomena. Finally, we show an example of a double track made of pinning
impurities, where the engineering of their mutual distance allows to control
the skyrmion motion with enhanced velocity.

formation ended 4.5 billion years in the past. The simulation is a precise
orbit determination method that does not involve ad hoc initial conditions or
assumptions such as those found in planetesimal disk relaxation models upon
which their conclusions depend. It can therefore be used to independently test
origin theories based on relaxation models by examining the past orbits of
specific real objects. Here, we examined 17 multiple-opposition
high-inclination Centaurs and the two polar trans-neptunian objects 2008 KV42
and (471325) 2011 KT19. The statistical distributions show that their orbits
were nearly polar 4.5 Gyr in the past, and were located in the scattered disk
and inner Oort cloud regions. Early polar inclinations cannot be accounted for
by current Solar system formation theory as the early planetesimal system must
have been nearly flat in order to explain the low-inclination asteroid and
Kuiper belts. Furthermore, the early scattered disk and inner Oort cloud
regions are believed to have been devoid of Solar system material as the
planetesimal disk could not have extended far beyond Neptune's current orbit in
order to halt the planet's outward migration. The nearly polar orbits of
high-inclination Centaurs 4.5 Gyr in the past therefore indicate their probable
early capture from the interstellar medium.

short range 1D quantum systems. However, the only known case for which this is
rigorously proven is for the particular case of finite range translational
invariant interactions. The proof was obtained by Araki in his seminal paper of
1969 as a consequence of pioneering locality estimates for the time-evolution
operator that allowed him to prove its analiticity on the whole complex plane,
when applied to a local observable. However, as for now there is no
mathematical proof of the abscence of 1D thermal phase transitions if one
allows exponential tails in the interactions. In this work we extend Araki's
result to include exponential (or faster) tails. Our main result is the
analyticity of the time-evolution operator applied on a local observable on a
suitable strip around the real line. As a consequence we obtain that thermal
states in 1D exhibit exponential decay of correlations above a threshold
temperature that decays to zero with the exponent of the interaction decay,
recovering Araki's result as a particular case. Our result however still leaves
open the possibility of 1D thermal short range phase transitions. We conclude
with an application of our result to the spectral gap problem for Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS) on 2D lattices, via the holographic duality due to

Humans, however, recognize actions on unknown objects or even when objects are

visual object features. Here, we focus on the role of inter-object relations
that change during an action. We designed a virtual reality setup and tested
recognition speed for 10 different manipulation actions on 50 subjects. All
objects were abstracted by emulated cubes so the actions could not be inferred
using object information. Instead, subjects had to rely only on the information
that comes from the changes in the spatial relations that occur between those
cubes. In spite of these constraints, our results show the subjects were able
to predict actions in, on average, less than 64% of the action's duration. We
employed a computational model -an enriched Semantic Event Chain (eSEC)-
incorporating the information of spatial relations, specifically (a) objects'
touching/untouching, (b) static spatial relations between objects and (c)
dynamic spatial relations between objects. Trained on the same actions as those
observed by subjects, the model successfully predicted actions even better than
humans. Information theoretical analysis shows that eSECs optimally use
individual cues, whereas humans presumably mostly rely on a mixed-cue strategy,
which takes longer until recognition. Providing a better cognitive basis of
action recognition may, on one hand improve our understanding of related human

need a correspondingly higher TPC operation rate in the next Run 3 of the LHC.
The operational gated MWPC readout used so far cannot be used at such fast
rates. Therefore a new readout chamber is needed with a novel technology and
without any compromise on the momentum and energy resolution. As a solution the
Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) technology is applied. This new readout chamber
consists of inner-(IROC) and outer (OROC) readout chambers with a 4 stage GEM
cascade in order to reduce back-drifting ion space charges. These quadruple
stacks have proven to provide sufficient ion blocking capabilities. This
structure also preserves the intrinsic energy resolution and keeps the
space-charge distortions at a tolerable level. The GEMs cannot be repaired
during operation, therefore to minimize the unsuitable foils, the Quality
Assurance system is developed. These cleanroom measurements investigate the
hole size uniformity, the gain uniformity and the electrical stability. Due to
the continuous readout, higher readout rate is possible. The new ASIC-SAMPA has
been developed for this purpose. After the ROC assembly some of chambers were
tested in the ALICE cavern, and a test campaign started for the further testing

their robustness against model misspecification even when Bayesian inference is
inconsistent. The PAC-Bayesian alpha-posterior is a generalization of the
standard Bayes posterior which can be tempered with a parameter alpha to handle
inconsistency. Data driven methods for tuning alpha have been proposed but are
still few, and are often computationally heavy. Additionally, the adequacy of
these methods in cases where we use variational approximations instead of exact
alpha-posteriors is not clear. This narrows their usage to simple models and
prevents their application to large-scale problems. We hence need fast methods
to tune alpha that work with both exact and variational alpha-posteriors.
First, we propose two data driven methods for tuning alpha, based on
sample-splitting and bootstrapping respectively. Second, we formulate the
(exact or variational) posteriors of three popular statistical models, and
modify them into alpha-posteriors. For each model, we test our strategies and
compare them with standard Bayes and Grunwald's SafeBayes. While bootstrapping
achieves mixed results, sample-splitting and SafeBayes perform well on the
exact and variational alpha-posteriors we describe, and achieve better results
than standard Bayes in misspecified or complex models. Additionally,
sample-splitting outperforms SafeBayes in terms of speed. Sample-splitting
offers a fast and easy solution to inconsistency and typically performs
similarly or better than Bayesian inference. Our results provide hints on the
calibration of alpha in PAC-Bayesian and Gibbs posteriors, and may facilitate
using these methods in large and complex models.

combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple model filter.
Moreover, we consider the computability of the population size and provide its

the design of optimal sampling patterns for these k-space coefficients has
received significant attention, with many CS MRI methods exploiting
variable-density probability distributions. Realizing that an optimal sampling
pattern may depend on the downstream task (e.g. image reconstruction,
segmentation, or classification), we here propose joint learning of both
task-adaptive k-space sampling and a subsequent model-based proximal-gradient
recovery network. The former is enabled through a probabilistic generative
model that leverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation to sample across trainable
beliefs while maintaining differentiability. The proposed combination of a
highly flexible sampling model and a model-based (sampling-adaptive) image
reconstruction network facilitates exploration and efficient training, yielding
improved MR image quality compared to other sampling baselines.

optimization of logistics and production. Thus, the most accurate prediction
possible is desirable. In order to optimally train predictive models, the
deviation of the forecast compared to the actual demand needs to be assessed by
a proper metric. However, if a metric does not represent the actual prediction
error, predictive models are insufficiently optimized and, consequently, will
yield inaccurate predictions. The most common metrics such as MAPE or RMSE,
however, are not suitable for the evaluation of forecasting errors, especially
for lumpy and intermittent demand patterns, as they do not sufficiently account
for, e.g., temporal shifts (prediction before or after actual demand) or
cost-related aspects. Therefore, we propose a novel metric that, in addition to
statistical considerations, also addresses business aspects. Additionally, we
evaluate the metric based on simulated and real demand time series from the

density of the AGN in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 at 1.5 GHz with the e-MERLIN
array. We present new high resolution e-MERLIN observations at 5 GHz and
compare these to archival MERLIN observations to investigate the reported
variability. Our new observations allow us to probe the nuclear region at a
factor three times higher-resolution than the previous e-MERLIN study. We
separate the core component, C4, into three separate components: C4W, C4E and
X. The AGN is thought to reside in component C4W, but this component has
remained constant between epochs within uncertainties. However, we find that
the Eastern-most component, C4E, has increased in peak flux density from
19.35$\pm$1.10 to 37.09$\pm$1.86 mJy/beam, representing a 8.2 sigma increase on

continued interaction between the jet and the emission line region (ELR),
observed for the first time in a low-luminosity AGN such as NGC 4151. We
identify discrete resolved components at 5 GHz along the jet axis, which we
interpret as areas of jet-ELR interaction.

and many of these flows are characterized by a dominant oscillation, such as
the vortex shedding in the wake of nearly all transportation vehicles. The
ability to control vortex shedding is critical to improve the aerodynamic
performance of these unsteady fluid flow systems. This goal requires precise
characterization of how perturbations affect the long-time phase of the
oscillatory flow, as well as the ability to control transient behaviors. In
this work, we develop an energy-efficient flow control strategy to rapidly
alter the oscillation phase of time-periodic fluid flows, leveraging theory
developed for periodic biological systems. First, we perform a
phase-sensitivity analysis to construct a reduced-order model for the response
of the flow oscillation to impulsive control inputs at various phases. Next, we
introduce two control strategies for real-time phase control based on the
phase-sensitivity function: 1) optimal phase control, obtained by solving the
Euler-Lagrange equations as a two-point boundary value problem, and 2)
model-predictive control (MPC). Our approach is demonstrated for two unsteady
flow systems, the incompressible laminar flow past a circular cylinder and the
flow past an airfoil. We show that effective phase control may be achieved with
several actuation strategies, including blowing and rotary control. Moreover,
our control approach uses realistic measurements of the lift force on the body,
rather than requiring high-dimensional measurements of the full flow field.

integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb$^{-1}$, collected with the LHCb experiment. The
polarisation is determined in a fiducial region of $\Lambda^0_b$ transverse
momentum and pseudorapidity of $1 < p_{T} < 20$ GeV$/c$ and $2 < \eta < 5$,
respectively. The data are consistent with $\Lambda^0_b$ baryons being produced
unpolarised in this region. The parity-violating asymmetry parameter of the
$\Lambda\rightarrow p\pi^-$ decay is also determined from the data and its
value is found to be consistent with a recent measurement by the BES\,III

$\mathcal{K}$ an arbitrary Galois extension of $K$. Then for each non-negative
integer $r$ we define a natural notion of a `non-commutative Euler system of
rank $r$' for $T$ relative to the extension $\mathcal{K}/K$. We prove that if
$p$ is odd and $T$ and $\mathcal{K}/K$ satisfy certain mild hypotheses, then
there exist non-commutative Euler systems that control the Galois structure of
cohomology groups of $T$ over intermediate fields of $\mathcal{K}/K$ and have
rank that depends explicitly on $T$. As a first concrete application of this
approach, we (unconditionally) extend the classical Euler system of cyclotomic
units to the setting of arbitrary totally real Galois extensions of
$\mathbb{Q}$ and describe explicit links between this extended cyclotomic Euler
system, the values at zero of derivatives of Artin $L$-series and the Galois
structures of ideal class groups. As an important preliminary to the
formulation and proof of these results, we introduce natural non-commutative
generalizations of several standard constructions in commutative algebra
including higher Fitting invariants, higher exterior powers and the
Grothendieck-Knudsen-Mumford determinant functor on perfect complexes that are
of independent interest.

  production on Pt(111)","23 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over 90 % of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. Related work
thus responds to major societal demand. This study is of water-gas shift on
platinum for hydrogen production. The close-packed Pt(111) surface catalyses
this process.
  Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This is also true for
reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting
but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since
bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, this work
adopts Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology. QMC is a stochastic approach to
solving the Schr\""odinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous
systems involving solids.
  The present work considers co-adsorption of water and carbon monoxide on
Pt(111). The water is partially dissociated while its oxygen atom binds to CO
losing a hydrogen atom. This concerted step is rate-limiting. The resulting
adsorbed formate species then decomposes to readily eliminated carbon dioxide
and the clean-fuel product is H$_2$.
  The Transition-State geometry can be optimized using molecular Quantum Monte
Carlo force constants, on the basis of our earlier work using the CASINO
software.
  Our embedded active site approach is used. This allows a high-level
configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in
plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face.
The resulting periodic function is used to guide the Quantum Monte Carlo
calculation.
  Results are given here on mechanism and QMC activation barrier for water
addition to CO pre-adsorbed on Pt(111) of 17 +/- 0.2 c.f. apparent measured
value of 17.05 kcal/mol. They are encouraging for investigating similar or
complex catalytic systems.

correspondences between a pair of images. We adopt the recent Neighbourhood
Consensus Networks that have demonstrated promising performance for difficult
correspondence problems and propose modifications to overcome their main
limitations: large memory consumption, large inference time and poorly
localised correspondences. Our proposed modifications can reduce the memory
footprint and execution time more than $10\times$, with equivalent results.
This is achieved by sparsifying the correlation tensor containing tentative
matches, and its subsequent processing with a 4D CNN using submanifold sparse
convolutions. Localisation accuracy is significantly improved by processing the
input images in higher resolution, which is possible due to the reduced memory
footprint, and by a novel two-stage correspondence relocalisation module. The
proposed Sparse-NCNet method obtains state-of-the-art results on the HPatches
Sequences and InLoc visual localisation benchmarks, and competitive results in
the Aachen Day-Night benchmark.

nearest fixed-point value is the predominant approach. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, this is not the best we can do. In this paper, we propose
AdaRound, a better weight-rounding mechanism for post-training quantization
that adapts to the data and the task loss. AdaRound is fast, does not require
fine-tuning of the network, and only uses a small amount of unlabelled data. We
start by theoretically analyzing the rounding problem for a pre-trained neural
network. By approximating the task loss with a Taylor series expansion, the
rounding task is posed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
problem. We simplify this to a layer-wise local loss and propose to optimize
this loss with a soft relaxation. AdaRound not only outperforms
rounding-to-nearest by a significant margin but also establishes a new
state-of-the-art for post-training quantization on several networks and tasks.
Without fine-tuning, we can quantize the weights of Resnet18 and Resnet50 to 4
bits while staying within an accuracy loss of 1%.

comparable or smaller than the time required for the system to achieve the
steady state, transient effects become important. For complex systems, a
quantitative description of these effects may be a very difficult problem. We
suggest a simple tractable model to describe these phenomena. The model is
based on approximation of the actual Fourier spectrum of the system by that
composed of the superposition of the spectra of uncoupled harmonic oscillators
(normal modes). The physical nature of the underlying system is employed to
select the proper approximation. This reduces the dynamics of the system to
tractable dynamics of just a few driven oscillators. The method is simple and
may be applied to many types of resonances. As an illustration, the approach is
employed to describe the sharp intensive spikes observed in the recent
numerical simulation of short light pulses scattered by a cylinder in the
proximity of destructive Fano interference [Phys. Rev. A., vol. 100, 053824

effective neutrino masses $\widetilde{m}^{}_i$ (for $i = 1, 2, 3$) and the
effective mixing matrix $V^{}_{\alpha i}$ (for $\alpha = e, \mu, \tau$ and $i =
1, 2, 3$). When the matter parameter $a \equiv 2\sqrt{2} G^{}_{\rm F} N^{}_e E$
is taken as an independent variable, a complete set of first-order ordinary
differential equations for $\widetilde{m}^2_i$ and $|V^{}_{\alpha i}|^2$ have
been derived in the previous works. In the present paper, we point out that
such a system of differential equations possesses both the continuous
symmetries characterized by one-parameter Lie groups and the discrete symmetry
associated with the permutations of three neutrino mass eigenstates. The
implications of these symmetries for solving the differential equations and
looking for differential invariants are discussed.

networks of narrow ridges are common in arid regions. Here, we consider the
initial instability and the ultimate fate of buoyancy-driven convection that
could lead to such patterns. Specifically, we look at convection in a deep
porous medium with a constant through-flow boundary condition on a horizontal
surface, which resembles the situation found below an evaporating salt lake.
The system is scaled to have only one free parameter, the Rayleigh number,
which characterises the relative driving force for convection. We then solve
the resulting linear stability problem for the onset of convection. Further
exploring the non-linear regime of this model with pseudo-spectral numerical
methods, we demonstrate how the growth of small downwelling plumes is itself
unstable to coarsening, as the system develops into a dynamic steady state. In
this mature state we show how the typical speeds and length-scales of the
convective plumes scale with forcing conditions, and the Rayleigh number.
Interestingly, a robust length-scale emerges for the pattern wavelength, which
is largely independent of the driving parameters. Finally, we introduce a
spatially inhomogeneous boundary condition -- a modulated evaporation rate --
to mimic any feedback between a growing salt crust and the evaporation over the
dry salt lake. We show how this boundary condition can introduce phase-locking
of the downwelling plumes below sites of low evaporation, such as at the ridges
of salt polygons.

this is the largest amplitude flare detected by the $Kepler/K2$ mission. The
next coolest star on which we identified a flare was an L2 dwarf: 2MASS
J08585891+1804463. Combining the energies of all the flares which we have
identified on 9 L dwarfs with the total observation time which was dedicated by
$Kepler$ to all 45 L dwarfs, we construct a composite flare frequency
distribution (FFD). The FFD slope is quite shallow (-0.51$\pm$0.17), consistent
with earlier results reported by Paudel et al. (2018) for one particular L0
dwarf, for which the FFD slope was found to be -0.34. Using the composite FFD,
we predict that, in early and mid-L dwarfs, a superflare of energy 10$^{33}$
erg occurs every 2.4 years and a superflare of energy 10$^{34}$ erg occurs
every 7.9 years. Analysis of our L dwarf flares suggests that magnetic fields
of $\geq$0.13-1.3 kG are present on the stellar surface: such fields could
suppress Type II radio bursts.

unfitted (or immersed, or embedded) finite element methods. By reformulating
the original boundary value problem over a surrogate (approximate)
computational domain, the SBM avoids integration over cut cells and the
associated problematic issues regarding numerical stability and matrix
conditioning. Accuracy is maintained by modifying the original boundary
conditions using Taylor expansions. Hence the name of the method, that {\it
shifts} the location and values of the boundary conditions. In this article, we
present enhanced variational SBM formulations for the Poisson and Stokes
problems with improved flexibility and robustness. These simplified variational
forms allow to relax some of the assumptions required by the mathematical
proofs of stability and convergence of earlier implementations. First, we show
that these new SBM implementations can be proved asymptotically stable and
convergent even without the rather restrictive assumption that the inner
product between the normals to the true and surrogate boundaries is positive.
Second, we show that it is not necessary to introduce a stabilization term
involving the tangential derivatives of the solution at Dirichlet boundaries,
therefore avoiding the calibration of an additional stabilization parameter.
Finally, we prove enhanced $L^{2}$-estimates without the cumbersome assumption
- of earlier proofs - that the surrogate domain is convex. Instead we rely on a
conventional assumption that the boundary of the true domain is smooth, which
can also be replaced by requiring convexity of the true domain. The
aforementioned improvements open the way to a more general and efficient
implementation of the Shifted Boundary Method, particularly in complex
three-dimensional geometries. We present numerical experiments in two and three
dimensions.

systems based on its relation to information. To apply this definition in
practice requires access to the physical system's microstates, which may be
prohibitively inefficient to sample or difficult to obtain experimentally. It
is beneficial, therefore, to relate the entropy to other integrated properties
which are accessible out of equilibrium. We focus on the structure factor,
which describes the spatial correlations of density fluctuations and can be
directly measured by scattering. The information gained by a given structure
factor regarding an otherwise unknown system provides an upper bound for the
system's entropy. We find that the maximum-entropy model corresponds to an
equilibrium system with an effective pair-interaction. Approximate closed-form
relations for the effective pair-potential and the resulting entropy in terms
of the structure factor are obtained. As examples, the relations are used to
estimate the entropy of an exactly solvable model and two simulated systems out
of equilibrium. The focus is on low-dimensional examples, where our method, as
well as a recently proposed compression-based one, can be tested against a
rigorous direct-sampling technique. The entropy inferred from the structure
factor is found to be consistent with the other methods, superior for larger
system sizes, and accurate in identifying global transitions. Our approach
allows for extensions of the theory to more complex systems and to higher-order

risk states of flooded pedestrians in terms of a commonly used flood Hazard
Rating (HR) metric, variable walking speed, and instability due to toppling
and/or sliding. Our analysis reveal significantly prolonged evacuation times
and risk exposure levels as stability and walking speed behavioural rules
become more sophisticated. It also allows to identify more conservative HR
thresholds due to unstable pedestrians, and a new formula to directly estimate
walking speed states as function of HR for stable pedestrian in floodwater.

local and global scales, such as influenza A(H1N1), SARS, MERS, and recently
COVID-19 disease, makes it crucial to keep designing models of disease
propagation and strategies to prevent or mitigate their effects in populations.
Since isolated systems are exceptionally rare to find in any context,
especially in human contact networks, here we examine the
susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex
network formed by two distinct networks or layers, interconnected through a
fraction $q$ of shared individuals (overlap). We model the interactions through
weighted networks, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or
disordered); weights represent the contact times of the interactions. Using
branching theory supported by simulations, we analyze a social distancing
strategy that reduces the average contact time in both layers, where the
intensity of the distancing is related to the topology of the layers. We find
that the critical values of the distancing intensities, above which an epidemic
can be prevented, increase with the overlap $q$. Also we study the effect of
the social distancing on the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals,
which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system. In addition, we find
that for relatively small values of the overlap $q$, social distancing policies
might not be needed at all to maintain the functionality of the system.

note, under the assumption that $\mathbb{X}$ has at most three weights or is of

$(Q,W)$ shares a $2$-CY tilted algebra with $\mathcal{C}_\mathbb{X}$, then
$\mathcal{C}_{(Q,W)}$ is triangle equivalent to $\mathcal{C}_\mathbb{X}$. As a
byproduct, a $2$-CY tilted algebra of $\mathcal{C}_\mathbb{X}$ is determined by
its quiver provided that $\mathbb{X}$ has at most three weights. To this end,
for any weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ with at most three weights, we

  mmWave MIMO Systems",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Synchronization is a fundamental procedure in cellular systems whereby an UE
acquires the time and frequency information required to decode the data
transmitted by a BS. Due to the necessity of using large antenna arrays to
obtain the beamforming gain required to compensate for small antenna aperture,
synchronization must be performed either jointly with beam training as in 5G
NR, or at the low SNR regime if the high-dimensional mmWave MIMO channel is to
be estimated. To circumvent this problem, this work proposes the first
synchronization framework for mmWave MIMO that is robust to both TO, CFO, and
PN synchronization errors and, unlike prior work, implicitly considers the use
of multiple RF chains at both transmitter and receiver. I provide a theoretical
analysis of the estimation problem and derive the HCRLB for the estimation of
both the CFO, PN, and equivalent beamformed channels seen by the different
receive RF chains. I also propose two novel algorithms to estimate the
different unknown parameters, which rely on approximating the MMSE estimator
for the PN and the ML estimators for both the CFO and the equivalent beamformed
channels. Thereafter, I propose to use the estimates for the equivalent
beamformed channels to perform compressive estimation of the high-dimensional
frequency-selective mmWave MIMO channel and thus undergo data transmission. For
performance evaluation, I consider the QuaDRiGa channel simulator, which
implements the 5G NR channel model, and show that both compressive channel
estimation without prior synchronization is possible, and the proposed
approaches outperform current solutions for joint beam training and
synchronization currently considered in 5G NR.

motion due to the Peierls barrier becomes important, which increases the
complexity of plasticity. Iron-silicon steel is an interesting, model BCC
material since the evolution of the dislocation structure in
specifically-oriented grains and at particular grain boundaries have
far-reaching effects not only on the deformation behaviour but also on the
magnetic properties, which are important in its final application as electrical
steel. In this study, two different orientations of micropillars (1, 2, 4
microns in diameter) and macropillars (2500 microns) and their corresponding bi
crystals are analysed after compression experiments with respect to the effect
of size on strength and dislocation structures. Using different experimental
methods, such as slip trace analysis, plane tilt analysis and cross-sectional
EBSD, we show that direct slip transmission occurs, and different slip systems
are active in the bi-crystals compared to their single-crystal counterparts.
However, in spite of direct transmission and a very high transmission factor,
dislocation pile-up at the grain boundary is also observed at early stages of
deformation. Moreover, an effect of size scaling with the pillar size in single
crystals and the grain size in bi-crystals is found, which is consistent with
investigations elsewhere in FCC metals.

scales strongly impacts radial velocities. This variability is seen as
oscillations, granulation, supergranulation, and meridional flows. The effect
of this latter process is poorly known but could affect exoplanet
detectability. We aim to quantify its amplitude when integrated over the disc
and its temporal variability, first for the Sun, seen with different
inclinations, and then for other solar-type stars. We used long time series of
solar latitudinal meridional circulation to reconstruct its integrated
contribution. We then used scaling laws from HD simulations relating the
amplitude of the meridional flow variability with stellar mass and rotation
rate to estimate the typical amplitude expected for other solar-type stars. We
find typical rms of the order of 0.5-0.7 m/s (edge-on) and 1.2-1.7 m/s
(pole-on) for the Sun, with a minimal jitter for an inclination of 45-55 deg.
This is significant compared to other stellar activity contributions and is
much larger than the radial-velocity signal of the Earth. The variability is
strongly related to the activity cycle. Extension to other solar-type stars
shows that the variability due to meridional flows is dominated by the
amplitude of the cycle of those stars. The meridional flow contribution
sometimes represents a high fraction of the convective blueshift inhibition
signal, especially for quiet, low-mass stars. Our study shows that these
meridional flows could be critical for exoplanet detection. Low inclinations
are more impacted than edge-on configurations, but these latter still exhibit
significant variability. Meridional flows also degrade the correlation between
radial velocities due to convective blueshift inhibition and chromospheric
activity indicators. This will make the correction from this signal challenging
for stars with no multi-cellular patterns.

Hawking evaporation and the associated information loss paradox. Here we
reexamine the underlying dynamics of mirror motion in a graded-density plasma

the direction of laser propagation would in general accelerate the mirror. In

is sensitive to the plasma density gradient but not to the density itself. We
show that without invoking nano-fabricated thin-films, a much lower density gas

near-field of a turbulent wake of a square prism in terms of the KHMH equation
written for a triple decomposition of the velocity field accounting for the
quasi-periodic vortex shedding. Orientation-averaged terms of the KHMH are
computed on the plane of the mean flow and on the geometric centreline. We
consider locations between $2$ and $8$ times the width $d$ of the prism. The
mean flow produces kinetic energy which feeds the vortex shedding coherent
structures. In turn, these structures transfer energy to the stochastic
fluctuations over all length-scales $r$ from the Taylor length $\lambda$ to $d$
and dominate spatial turbulent transport of two-point stochastic turbulent
fluctuations. The orientation-averaged non-linear inter-scale transfer rate
$\Pi^{a}$ which was found to be approximately independent of $r$ by Alves
Portela et. al. (2017) in the range $\lambda\le r \le 0.3d$ at a distance
$x_{1}=2d$ from the square prism requires an inter-scale transfer contribution
of coherent structures for this approximate constancy. However, the
near-constancy of $\Pi^a$ at $x_1=8d$ which was also found by Alves Portela et.
al. (2017) is mostly due to stochastic fluctuations. Even so, the proximity of
$-\Pi^a$ to the turbulence dissipation rate $\varepsilon$ in the range
$\lambda\le r\le d$ at $x_1=8d$ requires contributions of the coherent
structures. Spatial inhomogeneity also makes a direct and distinct contribution
to $\Pi^a$, and the constancy of $-\Pi^a/\varepsilon$ close to 1 would not have
been possible without it either in this near-field flow. Finally, the
pressure-velocity term is also an important contributor to the KHMH,
particularly at scales r larger than about $0.4d$, and appears to correlate
with the purely stochastic non-linear inter-scale transfer rate when the
orientation average is lifted.

equivocation, (ii) double voting, and (iii) losing internal state such as
forgetting 'locks' guarding voted values. To emulate interesting attacks by a
Byzantine node, it instantiates twin copies of the node instead of one, giving
both twins the same identities and network credentials. To the rest of the
system, the twins appear indistinguishable from a single node behaving in a
'questionable' manner. Twins can systematically generate Byzantine attack
scenarios at scale, execute them in a controlled manner, and examine their
behavior. Twins scenarios iterate over protocol rounds and vary the
communication patterns among nodes. Twins runs in a production setting within
DiemBFT where it can execute 44M Twins-generated scenarios daily. Whereas the
system at hand did not manifest errors, subtle safety bugs that were
deliberately injected for the purpose of validating the implementation of Twins
itself were exposed within minutes. Twins can prevent developers from
regressing correctness when updating the codebase, introducing new features, or
performing routine maintenance tasks. Twins only requires a thin wrapper over
DiemBFT, we thus envision other systems using it. Building on this idea, one
new attack and several known attacks against other BFT protocols were
materialized as Twins scenarios. In all cases, the target protocols break
within fewer than a dozen protocol rounds, hence it is realistic for the Twins
approach to expose the problems.

union, succession or repetition, which makes it easier to build complex models

  To formalize this approach, we abstract away the complex models and
operations in the Heard-Of model. This model relies on (possibly asynchronous)
rounds; sequence of digraphs, one for each round, capture which messages sent
at a given round are received before the receiver goes to the next round. A set
of sequences, called a heard-of predicate,defines the legal communication
behaviors -- that is to say, a model of communication. Because the proposed
operations behave well with this transformation of operational models into
heard-of predicates, we can derive bounds, characterizations, and

shared goal among many branches of science. The Bayesian probabilistic
framework offers a principled way to perform model comparison and extract
useful metrics for guiding decisions. However, many interesting models are
intractable with standard Bayesian methods, as they lack a closed-form
likelihood function or the likelihood is computationally too expensive to
evaluate. With this work, we propose a novel method for performing Bayesian
model comparison using specialized deep learning architectures. Our method is
purely simulation-based and circumvents the step of explicitly fitting all
alternative models under consideration to each observed dataset. Moreover, it
requires no hand-crafted summary statistics of the data and is designed to
amortize the cost of simulation over multiple models and observable datasets.
This makes the method particularly effective in scenarios where model fit needs
to be assessed for a large number of datasets, so that per-dataset inference is
practically infeasible.Finally, we propose a novel way to measure epistemic
uncertainty in model comparison problems. We demonstrate the utility of our
method on toy examples and simulated data from non-trivial models from
cognitive science and single-cell neuroscience. We show that our method
achieves excellent results in terms of accuracy, calibration, and efficiency
across the examples considered in this work. We argue that our framework can
enhance and enrich model-based analysis and inference in many fields dealing
with computational models of natural processes. We further argue that the
proposed measure of epistemic uncertainty provides a unique proxy to quantify
absolute evidence even in a framework which assumes that the true
data-generating model is within a finite set of candidate models.

quasi-parallel collision system that allows probing of the sub-eV mass range
was realized by focusing the combined laser fields with an off-axis parabolic
mirror. A 0.10 mJ/34 fs Ti:Sapphire laser pulse and a 0.14 mJ/9 ns Nd:YAG laser
pulse were spatiotemporally synchronized by sharing a common optical axis and
focused into the vacuum system. No significant four-wave mixing signal was
observed at the vacuum pressure of $3.7 \times 10^{-5}$ Pa , thereby providing
upper bounds on the coupling-mass relation by assuming exchanges of scalar and
pseudoscalar fields at a 95 % confidence level in the mass range below 0.21 eV.
For this search, the experimental setup was substantially upgraded so that
optical components are compatible with the requirements of the high-quality
vacuum system, hence enabling the pulse power to be increased. With the
increased pulse power, a new kind of pressure-dependent background photons
emerged in addition to the known atomic four-wave mixing process. This paper
shows the pressure dependence of these background photons and how to handle
them in the search.

behavior. In many real-world scenarios, the examined events can be directly
linked to the actions of an adversary, such as attacks on computer networks or
frauds in financial operations. While the defender wants to discover such
malicious behavior, the attacker seeks to accomplish their goal (e.g.,
exfiltrating data) while avoiding the detection. To this end, anomaly detectors
have been used in a game-theoretic framework that captures these goals of a
two-player competition. We extend the existing models to more realistic
settings by (1) allowing both players to have continuous action spaces and by
assuming that (2) the defender cannot perfectly observe the action of the
attacker. We propose two algorithms for solving such games -- a direct
extension of existing algorithms based on discretizing the feature space and
linear programming and the second algorithm based on constrained learning.
Experiments show that both algorithms are applicable for cases with low feature
space dimensions but the learning-based method produces less exploitable
strategies and it is scalable to higher dimensions. Moreover, we use real-world
data to compare our approaches with existing classifiers in a data-exfiltration
scenario via the DNS channel. The results show that our models are
significantly less exploitable by an informed attacker.

instability can arise in the light of this stable default state. In this work,
we examine two potential scenarios of seizure generation: (i) epileptic
cortical areas might generally operate closer to instability, which would make
epilepsy patients generally more susceptible to seizures, or (ii) epileptic
cortical areas might drift systematically towards instability before seizure
onset. We analyzed single-unit spike recordings from both the epileptogenic
(focal) and the nonfocal cortical hemispheres of 20 epilepsy patients. We
quantified the distance to instability in the framework of criticality, using a
novel estimator, which enables an unbiased inference from a small set of
recorded neurons. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for either scenario:
Neither did focal areas generally operate closer to instability, nor were
seizures preceded by a drift towards instability. In fact, our results from
both pre-seizure and seizure-free intervals suggest that despite epilepsy,
human cortex operates in the stable, slightly subcritical regime, just like

above a few GeV is significantly higher than previous estimates which ignored

brane number, entropy and DE contributions. Computing the chemical potential
conjugated to the number of colors in the absence of DE, we show that a generic

whether the observed phase transition at 240 K could be attributed to the
formation of CDW order. To address the issue, we performed optical spectroscopy
and ultrafast pump-probe measurements on single crystal samples of
Bi$_2$Rh$_3$Se$_2$. Our optical conductivity measurement reveals clearly the
formation of an energy gap with associated spectral change only at low
energies, yielding strong evidence for a CDW phase transition at 240 K. Time
resolved pump-probe measurement provides further support for the CDW phase
transition. The amplitude and relaxation time of quasiparticles extracted from
the photoinduced reflectivity show strong enhancement near transition
temperature, yielding further evidence for the CDW energy gap formation.
Additionally, a collective mode is identified from the oscillations in the
pump-probe time delay at low temperature. This mode, whose frequency decreases
gradually at elevated temperature, could be naturally attributed to the
amplitude mode of CDW state.

attacks, wherein, a model gets fooled by applying slight perturbations on the
input. With the advent of Internet-of-Things and the necessity to enable
intelligence in embedded devices, low-power and secure hardware implementation
of DNNs is vital. In this paper, we investigate the use of quantization to
potentially resist adversarial attacks. Several recent studies have reported
remarkable results in reducing the energy requirement of a DNN through
quantization. However, no prior work has considered the relationship between
adversarial sensitivity of a DNN and its effect on quantization. We propose
QUANOS- a framework that performs layer-specific hybrid quantization based on
Adversarial Noise Sensitivity (ANS). We identify a novel noise stability metric
(ANS) for DNNs, i.e., the sensitivity of each layer's computation to
adversarial noise. ANS allows for a principled way of determining optimal
bit-width per layer that incurs adversarial robustness as well as
energy-efficiency with minimal loss in accuracy. Essentially, QUANOS assigns
layer significance based on its contribution to adversarial perturbation and
accordingly scales the precision of the layers. A key advantage of QUANOS is
that it does not rely on a pre-trained model and can be applied in the initial
stages of training. We evaluate the benefits of QUANOS on precision scalable
Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) hardware architectures with data gating and
subword parallelism capabilities. Our experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 datasets
show that QUANOS outperforms homogenously quantized 8-bit precision baseline in
terms of adversarial robustness (3%-4% higher) while yielding improved
compression (>5x) and energy savings (>2x) at iso-accuracy.

9 are achieved, significant challenges remain ahead. Notably, the research

is equal to the rank of that submatrix. This property is one of the corner
stones of the matrix rank theory. We call this property the
max-full-rank-submatrix property. Tensor ranks play a crucial role in low rank
tensor approximation, tensor completion and tensor recovery. However, their
theory is still not matured yet. Can we set an axiom system for tensor ranks?
Can we extend the max-full-rank-submatrix property to tensors? We explore these
in this paper. We first propose some axioms for tensor rank functions. Then we
introduce proper tensor rank functions. The CP rank is a tensor rank function,
but is not proper. There are two proper tensor rank functions, the max-Tucker
rank and the submax-Tucker rank, which are associated with the Tucker
decomposition. We define a partial order among tensor rank functions and show
that there exists a unique smallest tensor rank function. We introduce the full
rank tensor concept, and define the max-full-rank-subtensor property. We show
the max-Tucker tensor rank function and the smallest tensor rank function have
this property. We define the closure for an arbitrary proper tensor rank
function, and show that it is still a proper tensor rank function and has the
max-full-rank-subtensor property. An application of the submax-Tucker rank is
also presented.

infant mortality and delayed child development, is associated with maternal
educational attainment. Maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy could
contribute to this association. We aimed to quantify the contribution of
maternal smoking during pregnancy to social inequalities in child birthweight
for gestational age (GA). Methods Data come from the French nation-wide ELFE
cohort study, which included 17,155 singletons. Birthweights for GA were
calculated using z-scores. Associations between maternal educational
attainment, tobacco smoking during pregnancy and child birthweight for GA were
ascertained using mediation analysis. Mediation analyses were also stratified
by maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index.Results Low maternal educational
attainment was associated with an increased odd of tobacco smoking during
pregnancy (adjusted OR (ORa)=2.58 [95% CI 2.34, 2.84]) as well as a decrease in
child birthweight for GA (RRa=0.94 [95% 0.91, 0.98]). Tobacco smoking during
pregnancy was associated with a decrease in offspring birthweight for GA
(RRa=0.73 [95% CI 0.70, 0.76]). Mediation analysis suggests that 39% of the
effect of low maternal educational attainment on offspring birthweight for GA
was mediated by smoking during pregnancy. A more important direct effect of
maternal educational attainment on child birthweight for GA was observed among
underweight women (RRa=0.82 [95%CI 0.72, 0.93]).Conclusions The relationship
between maternal educational attainment and child birthweight for GA is
strongly mediated by smoking during pregnancy. Reducing maternal smoking could
lessen the occurrence of infant SGA and decrease socioeconomic inequalities in

result of continued long-term health monitoring of a large number of

new time series representation named ""Shapelet transform"", which is based on
local similarity in the shape of the time series subsequences. In consideration
of the individual attributes distinctive to time series signals in earthquake,
wind and ocean engineering, the application of this transform yields a new
shape-based feature representation. Combining this shape-based representation
with a standard machine learning algorithm, a truly ""white-box"" machine
learning model is proposed with understandable features and a transparent
algorithm. This model automates event detection without the intervention of
domain practitioners, yielding a practical event detection procedure. The
efficacy of this proposed shapelet transform-based autonomous detection
procedure is demonstrated by examples, to identify known and unknown earthquake
events from continuously recorded ground-motion measurements, to detect pulses
in the velocity time history of ground motions to distinguish between
near-field and far-field ground motions, to identify thunderstorms from
continuous wind speed measurements, to detect large-amplitude wind-induced
vibrations from the bridge monitoring data, and to identify plunging breaking

satisfying SSP, making SSP a potential mediator of social inequalities in PPD.
SEP, SSP and PPD are associated with migrant status. The aim of this study was
to quantify the mediating role of SSP in social inequalities in PPD regarding
mother's migrant status. Methods A sub-sample of 15,000 mothers from the French
nationally-representative ELFE cohort study was used for the present analyses.
SEP was constructed as a latent variable measured with educational attainment,
occupational grade, employment, financial difficulties and household income.
SSP was characterized as perceived support from partner (good relation,
satisfying support and paternal leave) and actual support from midwives
(psychosocial risk factors assessment and antenatal education). Mediation
analyses with multiple mediators, stratified by migrant status were conducted.
Results Study population included 76% of non-migrant women, 12% of second and
12% of first generation migrant. SEP was positively associated with support
from partner, regardless of migrant status. Satisfying partner support was
associated with a 8 (non-migrant women) to 11% (first generation migrant women)

in porous media requires significant computational resources to solve within
reasonable timeframes. An integrated method combining predictions of fluid flow
(fast, limited accuracy) with direct flow simulation (slow, high accuracy) is
outlined. In the tortuous flow paths of porous media, Deep Learning techniques
based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are shown to give an accurate
estimate of the steady state velocity fields (in all axes), and by extension,
the macro-scale permeability. This estimate can be used as-is, or as initial
conditions in direct simulation to reach a fully accurate result in a fraction
of the compute time. A Gated U-Net Convolutional Neural Network is trained on a
datasets of 2D and 3D porous media generated by correlated fields, with their
steady state velocity fields calculated from direct LBM simulation. Sensitivity
analysis indicates that network accuracy is dependent on (1) the tortuosity of
the domain, (2) the size of convolution filters, (3) the use of distance maps
as input, (4) the use of mass conservation loss functions. Permeability
estimation from these predicted fields reaches over 90\% accuracy for 80\% of
cases. It is further shown that these velocity fields are error prone when used
for solute transport simulation. Using the predicted velocity fields as initial
conditions is shown to accelerate direct flow simulation to physically true
steady state conditions an order of magnitude less compute time. Using Deep
Learning predictions (or potentially any other approximation method) to

Graph Learning based Recommender Systems (GLRS). GLRS mainly employ the
advanced graph learning approaches to model users' preferences and intentions

Differently from conventional RS, including content based filtering and
collaborative filtering, GLRS are built on simple or complex graphs where
various objects, e.g., users, items, and attributes, are explicitly or
implicitly connected. With the rapid development of graph learning, exploring
and exploiting homogeneous or heterogeneous relations in graphs is a promising
direction for building advanced RS. In this paper, we provide a systematic
review of GLRS, on how they obtain the knowledge from graphs to improve the
accuracy, reliability and explainability for recommendations. First, we
characterize and formalize GLRS, and then summarize and categorize the key
challenges in this new research area. Then, we survey the most recent and
important developments in the area. Finally, we share some new research

partially observed entries. Recent works show that low rank tensor ring
approximation is one of the most powerful tools to solve tensor completion
problem. However, existing algorithms need predefined tensor ring rank which
may be hard to determine in practice. To address the issue, we propose a
hierarchical tensor ring decomposition for more compact representation. We use
the standard tensor ring to decompose a tensor into several 3-order sub-tensors
in the first layer, and each sub-tensor is further factorized by tensor
singular value decomposition (t-SVD) in the second layer. In the low rank
tensor completion based on the proposed decomposition, the zero elements in the
3-order core tensor are pruned in the second layer, which helps to
automatically determinate the tensor ring rank. To further enhance the recovery
performance, we use total variation to exploit the locally piece-wise
smoothness data structure. The alternating direction method of multiplier can
divide the optimization model into several subproblems, and each one can be
solved efficiently. Numerical experiments on color images and hyperspectral
images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts
ones in terms of recovery accuracy.

for many applications such as web advertising or healthcare. In this paper, we
address the problem of learning stochastic policies with continuous actions

framework is appealing and well studied for discrete actions, the continuous
action case raises new challenges about modelization, optimization, and~offline
model selection with real data which turns out to be particularly challenging.
Our paper contributes to these three aspects of the CRM estimation pipeline.
First, we introduce a modelling strategy based on a joint kernel embedding of
contexts and actions, which overcomes the shortcomings of previous
discretization approaches. Second, we empirically show that the optimization
aspect of counterfactual learning is important, and we demonstrate the benefits
of proximal point algorithms and differentiable estimators. Finally, we propose
an evaluation protocol for offline policies in real-world logged systems, which
is challenging since policies cannot be replayed on test data, and we release a
new large-scale dataset along with multiple synthetic, yet realistic,

two reasons: it has a significant runtime constraint since it is a user-facing
application, and there is very little relevant training data containing cell
phone images of sheet music. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel
feature representation called a bootleg score which encodes the position of
noteheads relative to staff lines in sheet music. The MIDI representation can
be converted into a bootleg score using deterministic rules of Western musical
notation, and the sheet music image can be converted into a bootleg score using
classical computer vision techniques for detecting simple geometrical shapes.
Once the MIDI and cell phone image have been converted into bootleg scores, we
can estimate the alignment using dynamic programming. The most notable
characteristic of our system is that it has no trainable weights at all -- only
a set of about 40 hyperparameters. With a training set of just 400 images, we
show that our system generalizes well to a much larger set of 1600 test images

0.89, has an average runtime of 0.90 seconds, and outperforms baseline systems

former requires additional forecasting for the coding variables. The latter
determines the coding variables from the process history. A hybrid approach

significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a

is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when
universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower
filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we
compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected

their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily
case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early

adversaries can only inject new vicious nodes to the graph while having no
control over the original graph. Methodologically, we provide an approximation

topics in which they are matched. Finally, it encodes the token sequences with
the above two matching results into unified memories in the passage encoders
and learns the answer sequence by using an encoder-decoder with a
multiple-pointer-generator mechanism. As a result, GUM-MP can generate answers
by pointing to important tokens present across passages. Evaluations indicate
that GUM-MP generates much more accurate results than the current models do.

  https://github.com/DengPingFan/Inf-Net",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing
the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung
infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to
augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However,
segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including
high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between
infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is
impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep
model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection
Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify
infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial
decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map.
Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized
to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate
the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation
framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only
requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our
semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher
performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes
demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge
segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.

this paper, we are introducing a smart and efficient system for attendance
using face detection and face recognition. This system can be used to take
attendance in colleges or offices using real-time face recognition with the
help of the Convolution Neural Network(CNN). The conventional methods like
Eigenfaces and Fisher faces are sensitive to lighting, noise, posture,
obstruction, illumination etc. Hence, we have used CNN to recognize the face

automatically and stored in an excel sheet as well as in a database. We have
used MongoDB as a backend database for attendance records.

numerous applications, ranging from usability aspects, like reader views for

hand-crafted features for classification. This results in models that are
tailored to a specific distribution of web pages, e.g. from a certain time
frame, but lack in generalization power. We propose a neural sequence labeling
model that does not rely on any hand-crafted features but takes only the HTML
tags and words that appear in a web page as input. This allows us to present a
browser extension which highlights the content of arbitrary web pages directly
within the browser using our model. In addition, we create a new, more current
dataset to show that our model is able to adapt to changes in the structure of
web pages and outperform the state-of-the-art model.

Earth's subsurface from reflection data at the surface, accounting for all
orders of multiple reflections. The method is based on two integral
representations for focusing- and Green's functions. In discretized form, these
integrals are represented by finite summations over the acquisition geometry.
Consequently, the method requires ideal geometries of regularly sampled and
co-located sources and receivers. Recently new representations were derived,
which handle imperfectly sampled data. These new representations use
point-spread functions (PSFs) that reconstruct results as if they were acquired
using a perfect geometry. Here, the iterative Marchenko scheme is adapted,
using these new representations, to account for imperfect sampling. This new
methodology is tested on a 2D numerical example. The results show clear
improvement between the proposed scheme and the standard iterative scheme. By
removing the requirement for perfect geometries, the Marchenko method can be
more widely applied to field data.

the orthorhombic structure with group space Pnma over a wide range of
Ni-substitutions. Moreover, the analysis showed a nearly linear decrease in the
lattice parameters and the unit cell volume (V) causing a gradual increase in
the packing density with increasing Ni concentration. The shielding features
for photons, neutrons, and protons of all ceramic samples were assessed. The
mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) was computed at 0.1, 0.6, 1.25, 5 and 15 MeV
by utilizing (MCNP) (version 5.0); the results were compared with the
corresponding values obtained using Phy-X and XCOM program. The results
obtained showed slight enhancement with increasing Ni contents. The
substitution of Ni leads to progressive enhancement in effective removal
cross-section of fast neutron (${\Sigma}$R) values. Whereas the values of Mass
Stopping Power (MSP) and projected range for the protons showed a gradual
reduction with increasing Ni concentration. These findings suggest that the
current ceramic samples can be useful as radiation shielding materials.

short-range THz communications links that use subwavelength dielectric fibers
for information transmission and define main challenges and tradeoffs in the
link implementation. Particularly, we use air or foam-cladded
polypropylene-core subwavelength dielectric THz fibers of various diameters
(0.57-1.75 mm) to study link performance as a function of the link length of up
to ~10 m, and data bitrates of up to 6 Gbps at the carrier frequency of 128 GHz
(2.34 mm wavelength). We find that depending on the fiber diameter, the quality
of the transmitted signal is mostly limited either by the modal propagation
loss or by the fiber velocity dispersion (GVD). An error-free transmission over
10 meters is achieved for the bit rate of 4 Gbps using the fiber of smaller
0.57 mm diameter. Furthermore, since the fields of subwavelength fibers are
weakly confined and extend deep into the air cladding, we study the modal field
extent outside of the fiber core, as well as fiber bending loss. Finally, the
power budget of the rod-in-air subwavelength THz fiber-based links is compared
to that of free space communication links and we demonstrate that fiber links
offer an excellent solution for various short-range applications.
