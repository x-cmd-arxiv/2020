jeopardizes the privacy of health conditions, location, activities, and social

have already been developed, most of which claim to function in a privacy

""anonymity"", ""pseudonymity"" or other forms of ""privacy"", the authors of these

a first step towards formally defining the privacy notions of proximity tracing
services, especially with regards to the health, (co-)location, and social

protection the most prominent proposals can and cannot achieve. This initial

jets of carbon ablator mix entering the hot-spot, this source term can rapidly
exceed the Biermann fields. In addition, the Biermann fields are enhanced due
to the increased temperature gradients from carbon radiative cooling. With even
stronger self-generated fields, heat loss to the carbon regions will be
reduced, potentially reducing the negative effect of carbon mix.

lines (BALs) in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra, while others display
broad emission lines (BELs). Similar phenomenology is observed in quasars and
accreting white dwarfs, where it can be interpreted as an orientation effect
associated with line formation in an accretion disc wind.We propose and explore
a similar unification scheme for TDEs. We present synthetic UV spectra for disc
and wind-hosting TDEs, produced by a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo ionization
and radiative transfer code. Our models cover a wide range of disc wind
geometries and kinematics. Such winds naturally reproduce both BALs and BELs.
In general, sight lines looking into the wind cone preferentially produce BALs,
while other orientations preferentially produce BELs. We also study the effect
of wind clumping and CNO-processed abundances on the observed spectra. Clumpy
winds tend to produce stronger UV emission and absorption lines, because
clumping increases both the emission measure and the abundances of the relevant
ionic species, the latter by reducing the ionization state of the outflow. The
main effect of adopting CNO-processed abundances is a weakening of C~{\sc
iv}~1550~\AA~ and an enhancement of N \textsc{v}~1240~\AA~ in the spectra. We
conclude that line formation in an accretion disc wind is a promising mechanism
for explaining the diverse UV spectra of TDEs. If this is correct, the relative
number of BAL and BEL TDEs can be used to estimate the covering factor of the
outflow. The models in this work are publicly available online and upon

one patch of grass with another). Here, we develop the first full-reference
image quality model with explicit tolerance to texture resampling. Using a
convolutional neural network, we construct an injective and differentiable
function that transforms images to multi-scale overcomplete representations. We
demonstrate empirically that the spatial averages of the feature maps in this

sufficient statistical constraints to synthesize a wide variety of texture
patterns. We then describe an image quality method that combines correlations
of these spatial averages (""texture similarity"") with correlations of the

are jointly optimized to match human ratings of image quality, while minimizing
the reported distances between subimages cropped from the same texture images.

The measure also offers competitive performance on related tasks such as

timing provide unprecedented access to the equation of state (EoS) of cold
dense matter at densities difficult to realize in terrestrial experiments. At
the same time, predictions for the EoS with reliable uncertainty estimates from
chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) bound our theoretical ignorance. In
this work, we analyze astrophysical data using a nonparametric representation
of the neutron-star EoS conditioned on $\chi$EFT to directly constrain the
underlying physical properties of the compact objects. We discuss how the data
alone constrain the EoS at high densities when we condition on $\chi$EFT at low
densities. We also demonstrate how to exploit astrophysical data to directly
test the predictions of $\chi$EFT for the EoS up to twice nuclear saturation
density, and estimate the density at which these predictions might break down.
We find that the existence of massive pulsars, gravitational waves from
GW170817, and NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451 favor $\chi$EFT predictions
for the EoS up to nuclear saturation density over a more agnostic analysis by
as much as a factor of 7 for the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations used in
this work. While $\chi$EFT predictions using QMC are fully consistent with
gravitational-wave data up to twice nuclear saturation density, NICER
observations suggest that the EoS stiffens relative to these predictions at
nuclear saturation density. Additionally, we marginalize over the uncertainty
in the density at which $\chi$EFT begins to break down, constraining the radius
of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star to $R_{1.4}=11.40^{+1.38}_{-1.04}$

fields of science, giving rise to important applications in spectroscopy,

applications, light is considered in terms of electromagnetic plane waves that
propagate at the speed of light in vacuum. As a result, light-matter
interactions can usually be treated as very weak, and captured at the lowest
order in quantum electrodynamics (QED). However, recent progress in coupling
photons to material quasiparticles (e.g., plasmons, phonons, and excitons)
forces us to generalize the way we picture the photon at the core of every
light-matter interaction. In this new picture, the photon, now of partly
matter-character, can have greatly different polarization and dispersion, and
be confined to the scale of a few nanometers. Such photonic quasiparticles
enable a wealth of light-matter interaction phenomena that could not have been
observed before, both in interactions with bound electrons and with free
electrons. This Review focuses on exciting theoretical and experimental
developments in realizing new light-matter interactions with photonic
quasiparticles. As just a few examples, we discuss how photonic quasiparticles
enable room-temperature strong coupling, ultrafast ""forbidden transitions"" in

Thus, our technique avoids the explicit use of inductive proof rules during
satisfiability proofs. The main extension over previous techniques for ADT
removal is a new transformation rule, called differential replacement, which
allows us to introduce auxiliary predicates corresponding to the lemmas that
are often needed when making inductive proofs. We present an algorithm that
uses the new rule, together with the traditional folding/unfolding
transformation rules, for the automatic removal of ADTs. We prove that if the
set of the transformed clauses is satisfiable, then so is the set of the
original clauses. By an experimental evaluation, we show that the use of the
differential replacement rule significantly improves the effectiveness of ADT
removal, and we show that our transformation-based approach is competitive with
respect to a well-established technique that extends the CVC4 solver with

apparent: Humans can generalize very broadly from sparse data sets because they
are able to recombine and reintegrate data components in compositional manners.
To investigate differences in efficient learning, Joshua B. Tenenbaum and
colleagues developed the character challenge: First an algorithm is trained in
generating handwritten characters. In a next step, one version of a new type of
character is presented. An efficient learning algorithm is expected to be able
to re-generate this new character, to identify similar versions of this
character, to generate new variants of it, and to create completely new
character types. In the past, the character challenge was only met by complex
algorithms that were provided with stochastic primitives. Here, we tackle the
challenge without providing primitives. We apply a minimal recurrent neural
network (RNN) model with one feedforward layer and one LSTM layer and train it
to generate sequential handwritten character trajectories from one-hot encoded
inputs. To manage the re-generation of untrained characters, when presented
with only one example of them, we introduce a one-shot inference mechanism: the
gradient signal is backpropagated to the feedforward layer weights only,
leaving the LSTM layer untouched. We show that our model is able to meet the
character challenge by recombining previously learned dynamic substructures,
which are visible in the hidden LSTM states. Making use of the compositional
abilities of RNNs in this way might be an important step towards bridging the
gap between human and artificial intelligence.

Examples include the discovery of the nucleus, crystallography, and the
discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. Scattering techniques differ by
the type of the particles used, the interaction these particles have with
target materials and the range of wavelengths used. Here, we demonstrate a new
2-dimensional table-top scattering platform for exploring magnetic properties
of materials on mesoscopic length scales. Long lived, coherent magnonic
excitations are generated in a thin film of YIG and scattered off a magnetic
target deposited on its surface. The scattered waves are then recorded using a
scanning NV center magnetometer that allows sub-wavelength imaging and
operation under conditions ranging from cryogenic to ambient environment. While
most scattering platforms measure only the intensity of the scattered waves,
our imaging method allows for spatial determination of both amplitude and phase
of the scattered waves thereby allowing for a systematic reconstruction of the
target scattering potential. Our experimental results are consistent with
theoretical predictions for such a geometry and reveal several unusual features
of the magnetic response of the target, including suppression near the target
edges and gradient in the direction perpendicular to the direction of surface
wave propagation. Our results establish magnon scattering experiments as a new
platform for studying correlated many-body systems.

of discriminant explanations is introduced. These produce heatmaps that
attribute high scores to image regions informative of a classifier prediction

based on a single heat map, to counterfactual explanations, which account for
both predicted class and counter class. The latter are shown to be computable
by combination of two discriminant explanations, with reversed class pairs. It
is argued that self-awareness, namely the ability to produce classification
confidence scores, is important for the computation of discriminant
explanations, which seek to identify regions where it is easy to discriminate
between prediction and counter class. This suggests the computation of
discriminant explanations by the combination of three attribution maps. The
resulting counterfactual explanations are optimization free and thus much
faster than previous methods. To address the difficulty of their evaluation, a

describes the famous Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) and Inverse Zeno Effect (IZE),
that correspond to the slow down and to the increase of the decay rate caused
by measurements (or, more in general, by the interaction of an unstable state
with the detector and the environment). Within this model one can understand
quite general features of the QZE and IZE: by considering an unstable quantum
state, such as an unstable particle, whose decay width as function of energy is
$\Gamma(\omega)=g^{2}\omega^{\alpha},$ then -- under quite general assumptions
-- the QZE occurs for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, while the IZE for $\alpha
\in(-\infty,0)\cup(1,\infty).$ This result is valid also for more realistic
measurement models than the one described in this work. We then apply these
considerations to the decay of the neutron, for which $\alpha=5.$ Hence, the
realization of the IZE for the neutron decay (and for the majority of weak
decays) is in principle possible. Indeed, trap experiments find a lifetime that
is $8.7\pm2.1$ s shorter than beam experiments, suggesting that the IZE could
have taken place.

there is a lower level Jacobian matrix that is much more accurate than the
zeroth order approximation. Applying the approach to the CC3 equations, using
the CCSD approximation of the Jacobian, we show that the time spent to

recovering the values of parameters from the data (i.e., from the input and

identification in practice. In the presence of nonidentifiability, it is
important to find all functions of the parameters that are identifiable. The
existing algorithms check whether a given function of parameters is
identifiable or, under the solvability condition, find all identifiable
functions. However, this solvability condition is not always satisfied, which
presents a challenge. Our first main result is an algorithm that computes all
identifiable functions without any additional assumptions, which is the first
such algorithm as far as we know. Our second main result concerns the
identifiability from multiple experiments (with generically different inputs
and initial conditions among the experiments). For this problem, we prove that
the set of functions identifiable from multiple experiments is what would
actually be computed by input-output equation-based algorithms (whether or not
the solvability condition is fulfilled), which was not known before. We give an
algorithm that not only finds these functions but also provides an upper bound
for the number of experiments to be performed to identify these functions. We

approach relating trajectories to yielding, using a custom built interfacial
stress rheometer, which allows for measurement of shear moduli (G',G'') of a
dense athermal suspension's microstructure while simultaneously tracking
particle trajectories undergoing cyclic shear. We find an increase in total
area traced by particle trajectories as the system is stressed well below to
well above yield. Trajectories may be placed into three categories: reversibly
elastic paths; reversibly plastic paths, associated with smooth limit cycles;
and irreversibly plastic paths, in which particles do not return to their
original position. We find that above yield, reversibly plastic trajectories
are predominantly found near to the shearing surface, whereas reversibly
elastic paths are more prominent near the stationary wall. This spatial
transition between particles acting as solids to those acting as liquids is
characteristic of a 'melting front', which is observed to shift closer to the
wall with increasing strain. We introduce a non-dimensional measure of plastic
dissipation based on particle trajectories that scales linearly with strain
amplitude both above and below yield, and that is unity at the rheological
yield point. Surprisingly, this relation collapses for three systems of varying

(HVGAE) trained end-to-end to jointly embed gene-gene, gene-disease, and
disease-disease networks. Novel attentional pooling is introduced here for
learning disease-representations from associated genes' representations.
Second, targeting diseases in learned representations, we have recast the
drug-combination design problem as graph-set generation and developed a deep
learning-based model with novel rewards. Specifically, besides chemical
validity rewards, we have introduced a novel generative adversarial award,
being generalized sliced Wasserstein, for chemically diverse molecules with
distributions similar to known drugs. We have also designed a network
principle-based reward for drug combinations. Numerical results indicate that,
compared to graph embedding methods, HVGAE learns more informative and
generalizable disease representations. Case studies on four diseases show that
network-principled drug combinations tend to have low toxicity. The generated
drug combinations collectively cover the disease module similar to FDA-approved

The
target, a known eclipsing binary, was observed in sectors 1 through 12 at
30-minute cadence and in sectors 4 through 12 at two-minute cadence. It
consists of two stars with masses of 1.1 MSun and 0.3 MSun on a slightly
eccentric (0.16), 14.6-day orbit, producing prominent primary eclipses and
shallow secondary eclipses. The planet has a radius of ~6.9 REarth and was
observed to make three transits across the primary star of roughly equal depths
(~0.2%) but different durations -- a common signature of transiting
circumbinary planets. Its orbit is nearly circular (e ~ 0.09) with an orbital
period of 95.2 days. The orbital planes of the binary and the planet are
aligned to within ~1 degree. To obtain a complete solution for the system, we
combined the TESS photometry with existing ground-based radial-velocity
observations in a numerical photometric-dynamical model. The system
demonstrates the discovery potential of TESS for circumbinary planets, and
provides further understanding of the formation and evolution of planets
orbiting close binary stars.

due to the difficult nature of obtaining training data, no ground truth dataset

In addition, a lack of 3D animal pose data also makes it difficult to train 3D
pose-prediction methods in a similar manner to the popular field of body-pose
prediction. In our work, we focus on the problem of 3D canine pose estimation
from RGBD images, recording a diverse range of dog breeds with several
Microsoft Kinect v2s, simultaneously obtaining the 3D ground truth skeleton via
a motion capture system. We generate a dataset of synthetic RGBD images from
this data. A stacked hourglass network is trained to predict 3D joint
locations, which is then constrained using prior models of shape and pose. We
evaluate our model on both synthetic and real RGBD images and compare our
results to previously published work fitting canine models to images. Finally,
despite our training set consisting only of dog data, visual inspection implies
that our network can produce good predictions for images of other quadrupeds --
e.g. horses or cats -- when their pose is similar to that contained in our

$k$:$k-1$ among exoplanets become unstable once the dissipative action from the
gas is removed from the system, particularly for large $N$ (the number of
planets) and $k$ (indicating how compact the chain is). We present a novel
dynamical mechanism that can explain the origin of these instabilities and thus
the dearth of resonant systems in the exoplanet sample. It relies on the
emergence of secondary resonances between a fraction of the synodic frequency
$2 \pi (1/P_1-1/P_2)$ and the libration frequencies in the mean motion
resonance. These secondary resonances excite the amplitudes of libration of the
mean motion resonances thus leading to an instability. We detail the emergence
of these secondary resonances by carrying out an explicit perturbative scheme
to second order in the planetary masses and isolating the harmonic terms that
are associated with them. Focusing on the case of three planets in the 3:2 --
3:2 mean motion resonance as an example, a simple but general analytical model
of one of these resonances is obtained which describes the initial phase of the
activation of one such secondary resonance. The dynamics of the excited system
is also briefly described. This scheme shows how one can obtain analytical
insight into the emergence of these resonances, and into the dynamics that they
trigger. Finally, a generalisation of this dynamical mechanism is obtained for
arbitrary $N$ and $k$. This leads to an explanation of previous numerical
experiments on the stability of resonant chains, showing why the critical
planetary mass allowed for stability decreases with increasing $N$ and $k$.

can be reduced in the sentence representations by using an ensemble of

robust NLI models, outperforming previous de-biasing efforts when generalised
to 12 other datasets (Belinkov et al., 2019a; Mahabadi et al., 2020). In

the theory of computing to be used to answer open questions about fractal
geometry in Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$. These are classical questions,
meaning that their statements do not involve computation or related aspects of
logic.
  In this paper we extend the reach of the point-to-set principle from
Euclidean spaces to arbitrary separable metric spaces $X$. We first extend two
fractal dimensions--computability-theoretic versions of classical Hausdorff and
packing dimensions that assign dimensions $\dim(x)$ and $\textrm{Dim}(x)$ to
individual points $x\in X$--to arbitrary separable metric spaces and to
arbitrary gauge families. Our first two main results then extend the
point-to-set principle to arbitrary separable metric spaces and to a large
class of gauge families.
  We demonstrate the power of our extended point-to-set principle by using it
to prove new theorems about classical fractal dimensions in hyperspaces. (For a
concrete computational example, the stages $E_0, E_1, E_2, \ldots$ used to
construct a self-similar fractal $E$ in the plane are elements of the
hyperspace of the plane, and they converge to $E$ in the hyperspace.) Our third
main result, proven via our extended point-to-set principle, states that, under
a wide variety of gauge families, the classical packing dimension agrees with
the classical upper Minkowski dimension on all hyperspaces of compact sets. We
use this theorem to give, for all sets $E$ that are analytic, i.e.,
$\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_1$, a tight bound on the packing dimension of the hyperspace
of $E$ in terms of the packing dimension of $E$ itself.

interest due to its potential for sample efficiency and ability to incorporate

rich function approximators have remained challenging. To help expose the
practical challenges in MBRL and simplify algorithm design from the lens of
abstraction, we develop a new framework that casts MBRL as a game between: (1)
a policy player, which attempts to maximize rewards under the learned model;
(2) a model player, which attempts to fit the real-world data collected by the
policy player. For algorithm development, we construct a Stackelberg game
between the two players, and show that it can be solved with approximate
bi-level optimization. This gives rise to two natural families of algorithms
for MBRL based on which player is chosen as the leader in the Stackelberg game.
Together, they encapsulate, unify, and generalize many previous MBRL
algorithms. Furthermore, our framework is consistent with and provides a clear
basis for heuristics known to be important in practice from prior works.
Finally, through experiments we validate that our proposed algorithms are
highly sample efficient, match the asymptotic performance of model-free policy

contrast agents. These bubbles are modeled by mass densities and bulk moduli
enjoying contrasting scales. These contrasting scales allow them to resonate at
certain incident frequencies. We consider two types of such contrasts. In the
first one, the bubbles are light with small bulk modulus, as compared to the
ones of the background, so that they generate the Minnaert resonance
(corresponding to a local surface wave). In the second one, the bubbles have
moderate mass density but still with small bulk modulus so that they generate a
sequence of resonances (corresponding to local body waves).
  We propose to use as measurements the far-fields collected before and after
injecting a bubble, set at a given location point in the target domain,
generated at a band of incident frequencies and at a fixed single
backscattering direction. Then, we scan the target domain with such bubbles and
collect the corresponding far-fields. The goal is to reconstruct both the,
variable, mass density and bulk modulus of the background in the target region.
  1. We show that, for each fixed used bubble, the contrasted far-fields reach
their maximum value at, incident, frequencies close to the Minneart resonance
(or the body-wave resonances depending on the types of bubbles we use). Hence,
we can reconstruct this resonance from our data. The explicit dependence of the
Minnaert resonance in terms of the background mass density of the background
allows us to recover it, i.e. the mass density, in a straightforward way.
  2. In addition, this measured contrasted far-fields allow us to recover the
total field at the location points of the bubbles (i.e. the total field in the
absence of the bubbles). A numerical differentiation argument, for instance,
allows us to recover the bulk modulus of the targeted region as well.

enlarged domain of attraction and guaranteeing recursive feasibility for any

prediction horizon is not large enough. This paper presents an extension of

Orthogonal Sets of E/B Integrals (COSEBIs). As such they are designed to
minimise the contributions to the observable from the smallest physical scales
where models are highly uncertain. We demonstrate that $\Psi$-statistics carry
the same constraining power as the standard two-point galaxy clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing statistics, but are significantly less sensitive to
scale-dependent galaxy bias. Using two galaxy bias models, motivated by
halo-model fits to data and simulations, we quantify the error in a standard $3
\times 2$pt analysis where constant galaxy bias is assumed. Even when adopting
conservative angular scale cuts, that degrade the overall cosmological
parameter constraints, we find of order $1 \sigma$ biases for Stage III surveys
on the cosmological parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{\alpha}$.
This arises from a leakage of the smallest physical scales to all angular
scales in the standard two-point correlation functions. In contrast, when
analysing $\Psi$-statistics under the same approximation of constant galaxy
bias, we show that the bias on the recovered value for $S_8$ can be decreased
by a factor of $\sim 2$, with less conservative scale cuts. Given the
challenges in determining accurate galaxy bias models in the highly non-linear
regime, we argue that $3 \times 2$pt analyses should move towards new
statistics that are less sensitive to the smallest physical scales.

CGM angular momentum properties are strongly correlated with the stellar
angular momentum of the corresponding galaxy: the CGM surrounding high-angular
momentum galaxies has a systematically higher angular momentum and is better
aligned to the rotational axis of the galaxy itself than the CGM surrounding
low-angular momentum galaxies. Both the hot and cold phases of the CGM show
this dichotomy, though it is stronger for colder gas. The CGM of high-angular
momentum galaxies is characterized by a large wedge of cold gas with rotational
velocities at least $\sim1/2$ of the halo's virial velocity, extending out to
$\sim 1/2$ of the virial radius, and by biconical polar regions dominated by
radial velocities suggestive of galactic fountains; both of these features are
absent from the CGM of low-angular momentum galaxies. These conclusions are
general to halo masses $\lesssim 10^{12} \; M_{\odot}$ and for $z \lesssim 2$,

measurements, the thickness of the FP is often expressed in terms of the
accuracy with which $I_e$ and $\sigma_e$ can be used to estimate sizes $R_e$.
We show that: 1) The thickness of the FP depends strongly on morphology. If the
sample only includes E-SRs, then the observed scatter in $R_e$ is $\sim 16\%$,
of which only $\sim 9\%$ is intrinsic. Removing galaxies with

the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the observables, then the E-SRs
again define an exceptionally thin FP, with intrinsic scatter of only $5\%$
orthogonal to the plane. 2) The structure within the FP is most easily
understood as arising from the fact that $I_e$ and $\sigma_e$ are nearly
independent, whereas the $R_e-I_e$ and $R_e-\sigma_e$ correlations are nearly
equal and opposite. 3) If the coefficients of the FP differ from those
associated with the virial theorem the plane is said to be `tilted'. If we
multiply $I_e$ by the global stellar mass-to-light ratio $M_*/L$ and we account
for non-homology across the population by using S\'ersic photometry, then the
resulting stellar mass FP is less tilted. Accounting self-consistently for
$M_*/L$ gradients will change the tilt. The tilt we currently see suggests that
the efficiency of turning baryons into stars increases and/or the dark matter
fraction decreases as stellar surface brightness increases.

companions. Observations show that these binaries, triples and higher-order
multiples are common. Whereas the evolution of single stars and binaries have
been studied extensively, the same is not true for the evolution of stellar
triples. To fill this gap in our general understanding of stellar lives, we aim
to systematically explore the long-term evolution of triples and to map out the
most common evolutionary pathways that triples go through. We quantitatively
study how triples evolve, which processes are most relevant, and how this
differs from binary evolution. We simulate the evolution of several large
populations of triples with a population synthesis approach. We make use of the
triple evolution code TRES to simulate the evolution of each triple in a
consistent way; including three-body dynamics (based on the secular approach),
stellar evolution and their mutual influences. We simulate the evolution of the
system up until mass transfer starts, the system becomes dynamically unstable,
or a Hubble time has passed. We find that stellar interactions are common in
triples. Compared to a binary population, we find that the fraction of systems
that can undergo mass transfer is about 2 to 3 times larger in triples.
Moreover, whereas in binaries the orbits typically reach circularisation before
Roche-lobe overflow, this is not true anymore in triples. In our simulations,
about 40% of systems retain an eccentric orbit. Additionally, we discuss
various channels of triple evolution in detail such as those where the
secondary or the tertiary is the first star to initiate a mass transfer event.

messaging dialogue between a customer and an agent; together, they exchange
information, solve problems, and collectively co-produce the service. Because
the service progression is shaped by the history of conversation so far, we
propose a bivariate, marked Hawkes process cluster model of the customer-agent
interaction. To evaluate our stochastic model of service, we apply it to an
industry contact center dataset containing nearly 5 million messages. Through
both a novel residual analysis comparison and several Monte Carlo
goodness-of-fit tests, we show that the Hawkes cluster model indeed captures
dynamics at the heart of the service and also surpasses classic models that do
not incorporate the service history. Furthermore, in an entirely data-driven
simulation, we demonstrate how this history dependence can be leveraged
operationally, showing that widely-used and well-studied customer routing
policies can be outperformed with simple modifications according to the Hawkes
model. Through analysis of a stylized model proposed in the contact center
literature, we prove that service heterogeneity can cause this underperformance
and, moreover, that such heterogeneity will occur if service closures are not
carefully managed. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of the Hawkes
service model in designing co-produced services, where synthetic experiments
allow us to explore alternative arrangements of responsiveness and

introduce three right handed neutrinos to cancel the $[U(1)_{\rm B-L}]^3$

these purposes and therefore we can replace one right-handed neutrino by new
chiral fermions to cancel the $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ gauge anomaly. Then, one of the

paper, we demonstrate how this framework produces a dark matter candidate which
can address the so-called ""core-cusp problem"". As one of the small scale
problems that $\Lambda$CDM paradigm encounters, it may imply an important clue
for a nature of dark matter. One of resolutions among many is hypothesizing
that sub-keV fermion dark matter halos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies are in

dark matter candidate can be non-thermally originated in our model and thus can
be consistent with Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observation. Thereby, the small

(SZ) effect, obtained with the NIKA2 camera, towards the cluster of galaxies
XLSSC102, a relatively low-mass system ($M_{500} \sim 2 \times 10^{14}$
M$_{\odot}$) at $z = 0.97$ detected from the XXL survey. We combine NIKA2 SZ
data, XMM-Newton X-ray data, and Megacam optical data to explore, respectively,
the spatial distribution of the gas electron pressure, the gas density, and the
galaxies themselves. We find significant offsets between the X-ray peak, the SZ
peak, the brightest cluster galaxy, and the peak of galaxy density.
Additionally, the galaxy distribution and the gas present elongated
morphologies. This is interpreted as the sign of a recent major merging event,
which induced a local boost of the gas pressure towards the north of XLSSC102
and stripped the gas out of the galaxy group. The NIKA2 data are also combined
with XXL data to construct the thermodynamic profiles of XLSSC102, obtaining
relatively tight constraints up to about $\sim r_{500}$, and revealing
properties that are typical of disturbed systems. We also explore the impact of
the cluster centre definition and the implication of local pressure
substructure on the recovered profiles. Finally, we derive the global
properties of XLSSC102 and compare them to those of high-mass-and-low-redshift
systems, finding no strong evidence for non-standard evolution. We also use
scaling relations to obtain alternative mass estimates from our profiles. The
variation between these different mass estimates reflects the difficulty to
accurately measure the mass of low-mass clusters at z$\sim$1, especially with
low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) data and for a disturbed system. However, it
also highlights the strength of resolved SZ observations alone and in
combination with survey-like X-ray data.

Unfortunately, they require the use of entangled measurements across many

the copy complexity of such algorithms using only independent---but possibly
adaptively chosen---measurements on individual copies.
  We answer this in the negative for arguably the most basic quantum testing

$\epsilon$-far in trace distance from the maximally mixed state. While it is
known how to achieve optimal $O(d/\epsilon^2)$ copy complexity using entangled
measurements, we show that with independent measurements,
$\Omega(d^{4/3}/\epsilon^2)$ is necessary, even if the measurements are chosen

probabilistic characterization of the ill-conditioning of the problem,
comprising the sensitivity of the solution with respect to the starting model
and data noise. This analysis allows to assess the confidence in the candidate
solution and how it is reflected in the tasks that are typically performed
after imaging (e.g., stratigraphic segmentation following reservoir
characterization). Classically, uncertainty comes in the form of a probability
distribution formulated from Bayesian principles, from which we seek to obtain
samples. A popular solution involves Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose
instead an approach characterized by training a deep network that ""pushes
forward"" Gaussian random inputs into the model space (representing, for
example, density or velocity) as if they were sampled from the actual posterior
distribution. Such network is designed to solve a variational optimization
problem based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior and the
network output distributions. This work is fundamentally rooted in recent
developments for invertible networks. Special invertible architectures, besides
being computational advantageous with respect to traditional networks, do also
enable analytic computation of the output density function. Therefore, after
training, these networks can be readily used as a new prior for a related
inversion problem. This stands in stark contrast with Monte-Carlo methods,
which only produce samples. We validate these ideas with an application to
angle-versus-ray parameter analysis for reservoir characterization.

complex mathematical models that are implemented as computer codes which are

experimentation and comparison with data from a real-world process. The problem
is that the data collection may be so expensive that only a handful of

given a simulator, it iteratively discards regions of the input space using an
implausibility measure. When the simulator is computationally expensive, an
emulator is used to explore the input space. In this paper, a Gaussian process
provides a complete probabilistic output that is incorporated into the
implausibility measure. The identification of regions of interest is
accomplished with recently developed annealing sampling techniques. Active
learning functions are incorporated into the history matching procedure to
refocus on the input space and improve the emulator. The efficiency of the

matroid of rank $k\ge d+\frac d\epsilon$, where the rank $k\ge d$ denotes the
desired size of the optimal set. Our main result is a new approximation
algorithm with an approximation guarantee that depends only on the dimension
$d$ of the vectors and not on the size $k$ of the output set. In particular, we
show an $(O(d))^{d}$-estimation and an $(O(d))^{d^3}$-approximation for any
matroid, giving a significant improvement over prior work when $k\gg d$.
  Our result relies on the existence of an optimal solution to a convex
programming relaxation for the problem which has sparse support; in particular,
no more than $O(d^2)$ variables of the solution have fractional values. The
sparsity results rely on the interplay between the first-order optimality
conditions for the convex program and matroid theory. We believe that the
techniques introduced to show sparsity of optimal solutions to convex programs
will be of independent interest. We also give a randomized algorithm that
rounds a sparse fractional solution to a feasible integral solution to the
original problem. To show the approximation guarantee, we utilize recent works
on strongly log-concave polynomials and show new relationships between
different convex programs studied for the problem. Finally, we use the
estimation algorithm and sparsity results to give an efficient deterministic
approximation algorithm with an approximation guarantee that depends solely on
the dimension $d$.

predict solute mean squared displacements (MSDs) and solute flux, and thus
solute selectivity, in macroscopic length pores. First, using anomalous
diffusion theory, we show how solute dynamics can be modeled as a fractional
diffusion process subordinate to a continuous time random walk. From the MD
simulations, we parameterize the distribution of dwell times, hop lengths
between dwells and correlation between hops. We explore two variations of the
anomalous diffusion modeling approach. The first applies a single set of
parameters to the solute displacements and the second applies two sets of

Next, we generalize Markov state models, treating the configurational states of
the system as a Markov process where each state has distinct transport
properties. For each state and transition between states, we parameterize the
distribution and temporal correlation structure of positional fluctuations as a
means of characterization and to allow us to predict solute MSDs. Qualitative
differences between MD and Markov state dependent model-generated trajectories
may limit its usefulness. Finally, we demonstrate how one can use these models
to estimate flux of a solute across a macroscopic-length pore and, based on
those quantities, the membrane's selectivity towards each solute. This work
helps to connect microscopic chemically-dependent solute motions that do not

radar reflectivity fields to make use of existing radar assimilation
techniques. We find that the ability of CNNs to utilize spatial context is
essential for this application and offers breakthrough improvement in skill
compared to traditional pixel-by-pixel based approaches. To understand the
improved performance, we use a novel analysis methodology that combines several
techniques, each providing different insights into the network's reasoning.
Channel withholding experiments and spatial information withholding experiments
are used to show that the CNN achieves skill at high reflectivity values from
the information content in radiance gradients and the presence of lightning.
The attribution method, layer-wise relevance propagation, demonstrates that the
CNN uses radiance and lightning information synergistically, where lightning
helps the CNN focus on which neighboring locations are most important.
Synthetic inputs are used to quantify the sensitivity to radiance gradients,
showing that sharper gradients produce a stronger response in predicted

cosmic ray spectra. We show that large $\gamma_z$ factors of high-energy
particles along the escaping directions occur only in the presence of induced
charge of the black hole that is known as the Wald charge in the case of
uniform magnetic field. It is remarkable that the process neither requires
extended acceleration zone, nor fine-tuning of accreting matter parameters.
Further, this leads to certain verifiable constraints on SMBH's mass and
magnetic field strength as UHECRs sources. This clearly makes ultra-efficient

the continuum flux level and slope by adjusting the accretion rate,
inclination, and disc outer radius. For both systems we find an accretion rate
$\dot{M} \approx 8 \times 10^{-9}M_\odot$/yr in outburst, and $\dot{M} \approx

$a$ is the binary separation), except during late rise (for CY Lyr) where
$R_{\rm disc}=0.3a$. UZ Ser also reveals a 60,000~K white dwarf. These results
show that during a dwarf nova cycle the radius of the disc is the largest just
before the peak of the outburst, in qualitative agreement with the disc
instability model for dwarf nova outbursts. We suspect that an additional
emitting component (e.g. disc wind) is also at work to reduce the slope of the
continuum and size of the Balmer jump and absorption lines. We stress that both
the outer disc radius and disc wind need to be taken into account for more

learning models are being cached in a heterogeneous network. A queue-aware
cache content update scheduling algorithm based on Markov decision process
(MDP) is developed to minimize the average AoI of the NNs delivered to the
users plus the cost related to content updating. By using deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), we propose a low complexity suboptimal scheduling algorithm.
Simulation results show that, under the same update frequency, our proposed
algorithms outperform the periodic cache content update scheme and reduce the
average AoI by up to 35%.

spectroscopy in order to associate actual galaxy clusters to the SZ Planck

richness and velocity dispersions to confirm actual optical counterparts up to
$z<0.85$. At the end of the ITP13 observational programme, we study 256 SZ
sources with $Dec \geq -15^{\circ}$ (212 of them completely unknown), finding
optical counterparts for 152 SZ sources. The ITP13 validation programme has
allowed us to update the PSZ1 purity, which is now more refined, increasing
from 72\% to 83\% in the low SZ S/N regime. Our results are consistent with the
predicted purity curve for the full PSZ1 catalogue and with the expected
fraction of false detections caused by the non-Gaussian noise of foreground
signals. Indeed, we find a strong correlation between the number of unconfirmed

increasing the fraction of false Planck SZ detections at low galactic
latitudes.

Our high-resolution VLA observations have revealed that the majority of the

$<0.2^{\prime \prime}$ ($\leq 1.7$ kpc at $z \sim2$). The radio luminosities,
linear extents, and lobe pressures of our sources are similar to young radio
active galactic nuclei (AGN; e.g., Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum, GPS, and Compact
Steep Spectrum, CSS, sources), but their space density is considerably lower.
Application of a simple adiabatic lobe expansion model suggests relatively
young dynamical ages ($\sim10^{4-7}$ years), relatively high ambient ISM
densities ($\sim1-10^4$ cm$^{-3}$), and modest lobe expansion speeds
($\sim30-10,000$ km s$^{-1}$). Thus, we find our sources to be consistent with
a population of newly triggered, young jets caught in a unique evolutionary
stage in which they still reside within the dense gas reservoirs of their
hosts. Based on their radio luminosity function and dynamical ages, we estimate
only $\sim20\%$ of classical large scale FRI/II radio galaxies could have
evolved directly from these objects. We speculate that the WISE-NVSS sources
might first become GPS or CSS sources, of which some might ultimately evolve

  QCD Scales","PhD thesis, Univ Colorado (2020)",,,,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High energy nuclear collisions manifest a variety of interesting phenomena
over a broad range of energy scales. Many of these phenomena are related to the
formation of a hot and dense state of deconfined quarks and gluons known as the
quark gluon plasma (QGP). Chief among these are the observed near inviscid
hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP, as measured through azimuthal anisotropy
coefficients of low-$p_\mathrm{T}$ final state hadrons $v_\mathrm{n}$, and the
loss of energy of high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ color charges as they traverse the QGP
which is observed as a quenching of strongly-interacting final state objects
like jets. Observations of these phenomena in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at
RHIC and the LHC provide compelling evidence of QGP formation. Small collision
systems, like $p$+Pb, also show evidence for the creation droplets of QGP
through the observation of anisotropic flow; however, these systems show no
signs of the energy loss observed in large collision systems. Thus, small
systems are an ideal venue to explore the relationship between high- and
low-$p_\mathrm{T}$ QGP phenomena. Furthermore, the low ambient energy of $p$+Pb
compared to A+A collisions allow for the precise determination of perturbative
process rates which can be used to understand the nuclear modification of
nucleon parton densities.
  This dissertation explores $p$+Pb data collected with the ATLAS detector at
the LHC. The cross section and nuclear modification factor for prompt, isolated
photons are measured and compared to predictions from perturbative QCD
calculations and a model of initial state energy loss. Additionally, the
charged hadron azimuthal anisotropy coefficients, are measured via two-particle
correlations as a function of particle $p_\mathrm{T}$ and event centrality.
Results are shown from minimum bias events and events selected because of the
presence of a high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ jet.

technologies, including distributed generators (DGs) and remote-controlled

recovery, pose additional complexity to the service restoration problem,
especially under cold load pickup (CLPU) conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel two-stage restoration framework to generate restoration solutions with
a sequence of control actions. The first stage generates a restoration plan
that supports both the traditional service restoration using feeder
reconfiguration and the grid-forming DG-assisted intentional islanding methods.
The second stage generates an optimal sequence of switching operations to bring
the outaged system quickly to the final restored configuration. The problem is
formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates system
connectivity, operating constraints, and CLPU models. It is demonstrated using
a multi-feeder test case that the proposed framework is effective in utilizing
all available resources to quickly restore the service and generates an optimal
sequence of switching actions to be used by the operator to reach the desired
optimal configuration.

initialization. However, this approach requires supervised training of DNN

using the physical forward problem as the cost function during training, and 2)
no-training of DNN (NTD) using physical cost and backpropagation to directly
reconstruct a single dataset. The STD, UTD and NTD methods were compared with

established the pressure($p$)-temperature($T$) phase diagram in which the

transition (QPT) around $p$ = 0.5 GPa, two SC regions, separated by the QPT,
appear and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase emerges above $\sim$3.3 GPa. From the
NMR results up to 2.1 GPa, AFM fluctuations are revealed to be characterized by
the stripe-type wavevector which remains the same for the two SC regions.
Furthermore, the electronic state is found to change in character from
non-Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid around the nematic QPT and persists up to
$\sim$ 2.1 GPa. In addition, although the AFM fluctuations correlate with
$T_{\rm c}$ in both SC states, demonstrating the importance of the AFM
fluctuations for the appearance of SC in the system, we found that, when

root of the code length and whose dimension comes close to a square root of the
code length. When the ingredient is a 3-dimensional Ramanujan complex, we show
that its 2-systole behaves like a square of the log of the complex size, which
results in an overall quantum code of minimum distance $n^{1/2}\log n$, and
sets a new record for quantum LDPC codes. When we use a 2-dimensional Ramanujan

deterministic $\text{poly-log}(n)$-competitive algorithms for Steiner tree,
generalized Steiner tree, node weighted Steiner tree, (non-uniform) facility
location and directed Steiner tree with deadlines or with delay (where $n$ is
the number of nodes). Our deterministic algorithms also give improved

our framework is optimal up to the power of the poly-log. Our algorithms and

over a broad range of energy, from radio up to hard X-rays. In particular, this
object is unique among soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and AXPs in presenting
simultaneously mid-infrared emission and pulsed optical emission. In spite of
the many propositions to explain this wide range of emission, it still lacks
one that reproduces all the observations. Filling this gap, we present a model
to reproduce the quiescent spectral energy distribution of 4U 0142+61 from
mid-infrared up to hard X-rays using plausible physical components and
parameters. We propose that the persistent emission comes from a magnetic
accreting white dwarf (WD) surrounded by a debris disk. This model assumes
that: (i) the hard X-rays are due to the bremsstrahlung emission from the
post-shock region of the accretion column; (ii) the soft X-rays are originated
by hot spots on the WD surface; and (iii) the optical and infrared emissions
are caused by an optically thick dusty disk, the WD photosphere, and the tail
of the postshock region emission. In this scenario, the fitted model parameters
indicate that 4U 0142+61 harbors a fast-rotator magnetic near-Chandrasekhar WD,
which is very hot and hence young. Such a WD can be the recent outcome of a
merger of two less massive WDs. In this case, 4U 0142+61 can evolve to an SN Ia
and hence can give hints of the origin of these important astrophysical events.
Additionally, we also present a new estimate of 4U 0142+61 distance, 3.78

Planned explosions of old ammunition in Finland generate transient infrasound
waves that travel through the atmosphere. These waves are partially reflected
back towards the ground from stratospheric levels, and are detected at a
receiver station located in northern Norway at 178 km almost due North from the
explosion site. The difference between the true horizontal direction towards
the source and the backazimuth direction (the horizontal direction of arrival)
of the incoming infrasound wave-fronts, in combination with the pulse
propagation time, are exploited to provide an estimate of the average
cross-wind component in the penetrated atmosphere. We perform offline
assimilation experiments with an ensemble Kalman filter and these observations,
using the ERA5 ensemble reanalysis atmospheric product as background (prior)
for the wind at different vertical levels. We demonstrate that information from
both sources can be combined to obtain analysis (posterior) estimates of
cross-winds at different vertical levels of the atmospheric slice between the
explosion site and the recording station. The assimilation makes greatest
impact at the 12-60 km levels, with some changes with respect to the prior of
the order of 0.1-1.0 m/s, which is a magnitude larger than the typical standard
deviation of the ERA5 background. The reduction of background variance in the
higher levels often reached 2-5%. This is the first published study
demonstrating techniques to implement assimilation of infrasound data into

This improvement is achieved through various methods, including transfer
learning from simulations where the training set consists of simulations as
well as observations, which reduces the need for training data. The redshift
probability distribution is estimated with a mixture density network (MDN),
which produces accurate redshift distributions. Our code includes an
autoencoder to reduce noise and extract features from the galaxy SEDs. It also
benefits from combining multiple networks, which lowers the photo-$z$ scatter
by 10 percent. Furthermore, training with randomly constructed coadded fluxes
adds information about individual exposures, reducing the impact of photometric
outliers. In addition to opening up the route for higher redshift precision
with narrow bands, these machine learning techniques can also be valuable for
broad-band surveys.

learning and scientific computing. They involve finding a certain kind of
spectral decomposition to obtain basis functions that can capture important
structures for the problem at hand. The most common spectral method is the
principal component analysis (PCA). It utilizes the top eigenvectors of the
data covariance matrix, e.g. to carry out dimensionality reduction. This data
pre-processing step is often effective in separating signal from noise. PCA and
other spectral techniques applied to matrices have several limitations. By
limiting to only pairwise moments, they are effectively making a Gaussian
approximation on the underlying data and fail on data with hidden variables
which lead to non-Gaussianity. However, in most data sets, there are latent
effects that cannot be directly observed, e.g., topics in a document corpus, or
underlying causes of a disease. By extending the spectral decomposition methods
to higher order moments, we demonstrate the ability to learn a wide range of
latent variable models efficiently. Higher-order moments can be represented by
tensors, and intuitively, they can encode more information than just pairwise
moment matrices. More crucially, tensor decomposition can pick up latent
effects that are missed by matrix methods, e.g. uniquely identify
non-orthogonal components. Exploiting these aspects turns out to be fruitful
for provable unsupervised learning of a wide range of latent variable models.
We also outline the computational techniques to design efficient tensor
decomposition methods. We introduce Tensorly, which has a simple python
interface for expressing tensor operations. It has a flexible back-end system
supporting NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow and MXNet amongst others, allowing
multi-GPU and CPU operations and seamless integration with deep-learning

relative order parameter of genomic transcriptions at single cell level during
the cell fate change process, which shows increasing during differentiation,
and decreasing upon reprogramming. Moreover, based on the scEntropy dynamics,
we construct a phenomenological stochastic differential equation model and the
corresponding Fokker-Plank equation for cell state transitions during iPSC
differentiation, which provide insights to infer cell fates changes and stem
cell differentiation. This study is the first to introduce the novel concept of
scEntropy to the biological process of iPSC, and suggests that the scEntropy

dubbed {\it hairons}, which dominate the Cosmological Entropy. We elaborate on
the Cosmological Constant (CC) problem, in both the dynamical and time-constant
possibilities. We show that all dangerous quantum mixings between the CC and
the Planck energy scales are exponentially suppressed as an entropic collective
effect of the hairon environment. As a consequence, the dark energy scale is UV
insensitive to any planckian corrections. On the other hand, the inflation
scale is similarly stabilized from any radiative effects. In the case of the
Dark energy, we show the presence of a holographic entropic attractor, favoring
a time variation of $\Lambda\rightarrow 0$ in future rather than a static CC
case; i.e. $w>-1$ Dynamical DE is favored over a CC or a $w<-1$ phantom
cosmology. In both the inflation and dark energy sectors, we elaborate on the
Trans-Planckian problem, in relation with the recently proposed Trans-Planckian
Censorship Conjecture (TCC). We show that the probability for any sub-planckian
wavelength modes to survive after inflation is completely negligible as a
holographic wash-out mechanism. In other words, the hairons provide for a
holographic decoherence of the transplanckian modes in a holographic scrambling
time. This avoids the TCC strong bounds on the Inflaton and DE potentials.

operator equation is a closed-loop that can be achieved by some causal
controller. Moreover, solutions can be substituted into a simple dynamic
controller structure, which we will refer to as a system level controller, to
obtain an implementation of the unique corresponding feedback controller.
System level controllers could be an attractive approach for robust nonlinear

monocular depth estimation, where the goal is to infer depth from a single
image. An effective strategy that has shown considerable promise in recent
years for tackling this problem is the utilization of deep convolutional neural
networks. Despite these successes, the memory and computational requirements of
such networks have made widespread deployment in embedded scenarios very
challenging. In this study, we introduce DepthNet Nano, a highly compact self
normalizing network for monocular depth estimation designed using a human
machine collaborative design strategy, where principled network design
prototyping based on encoder-decoder design principles are coupled with
machine-driven design exploration. The result is a compact deep neural network
with highly customized macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs, as well
as self-normalizing characteristics, that are highly tailored for the task of
embedded depth estimation. The proposed DepthNet Nano possesses a highly
efficient network architecture (e.g., 24X smaller and 42X fewer MAC operations
than Alhashim et al. on KITTI), while still achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art networks on the NYU-Depth V2 and KITTI datasets.
Furthermore, experiments on inference speed and energy efficiency on a Jetson
AGX Xavier embedded module further illustrate the efficacy of DepthNet Nano at
different resolutions and power budgets (e.g., ~14 FPS and >0.46

dynamic variable-ordering during pattern search for enhancing pruning effect,
and the use of a pointer-based dynamic data structure, called dancing links,

In this paper, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate
the temperature-dependent mechanical properties and failure behavior of
Zinc-Blende (ZB) CdSe nanowire under uniaxial tensile deformation. We employed
Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential to describe the inter-atomic interactions. The
effect of variation of temperatures (100 K-600 K), sizes, and crystal
orientation on the tensile response of the CdSe nanowires is investigated. Our
simulation results suggest that both ultimate tensile strength and Youngs
modulus of CdSe have an inverse relationship with temperature. From 100K to
600K, the ZB CdSe exhibits brittle type failure thus there is no brittle to
ductile transition temperature found. Results also suggest that size has a
significant effect on the mechanical properties of CdSe nanowire. It has been
found that as the cross-sectional area increases both ultimate tensile stress
and Youngs modulus increases as well. The [111] oriented ZB CdSe shows the
largest ultimate tensile strength, Youngs modulus and fracture toughness
whereas the values are lowest for [100] orientation. The [110] orientation
shows the largest failure strain compared to other orientations. Finally,
failure mechanisms of CdSe nanowire are also investigated at 100K and 600K. We
noticed that at 100K temperature [100] oriented ZB CdSe fails along {111}
cleavage plane however in the case of 600 K temperature, both {111} and {100}
planes are activated and cause fracture of CdSe nanowire at lower strain value.
This study can guide to design ZB CdSe based solar cell, optoelectronic and
semiconductor devices by presenting a comprehensive understanding of the
mechanical and fracture characteristics of this nanowire.

platforms to capture the 3D spatial information with high resolution and
frequency; however, these pose unprecedented risks to user privacy. Aside from
objects being detected, spatial information also reveals the location of the
user with high specificity, e.g. in which part of the house the user is. In
this work, we propose to leverage spatial generalizations coupled with
conservative releasing to provide spatial privacy while maintaining data
utility. We designed an adversary that builds up on existing place and shape
recognition methods over 3D data as attackers to which the proposed spatial
privacy approach can be evaluated against. Then, we simulate user movement
within spaces which reveals more of their space as they move around utilizing
3D point clouds collected from Microsoft HoloLens. Results show that revealing
no more than 11 generalized planes--accumulated from successively revealed
spaces with large enough radius, i.e. $r\leq1.0m$--can make an adversary fail
in identifying the spatial location of the user for at least half of the time.
Furthermore, if the accumulated spaces are of smaller radius, i.e. each
successively revealed space is $r\leq 0.5m$, we can release up to 29
generalized planes while enjoying both better data utility and privacy.

promising routes to improving the brightness of electron sources. However, when
emittance growth occurs during beam transport (for example, due to
space-charge), it is possible that this emittance growth overwhelms the
contribution of the photocathode and, thus, in this case source emittance
improvements are not beneficial. Using multi-objective genetic optimization, we
investigate the role intrinsic emittance plays in determining the final
emittance of several space-charge dominated photoinjectors, including those for
high repetition rate free electron lasers and ultrafast electron diffraction.
We introduce a new metric to predict the scale of photocathode emittance
improvements that remain beneficial and explain how additional tuning is
required to take full advantage of new photocathode technologies. Additionally,
we determine the scale of emittance growth due to point-to-point Coulomb
interactions with a fast tree-based space-charge solver. Our results show that
in the realistic high brightness photoinjector applications under study, the
reduction of thermal emittance to values as low as 50 pm/um (1 meV MTE) remains

an operationally interpretable leakage metric designed for side channels. We
present the most useful theoretical properties of maximal leakage from previous

information and channel capacity underestimate the threat posed by side
channels whereas maximal leakage does not. We also study the cost-leakage

  Traffic Forecasting",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Highway traffic modeling and forecasting approaches are critical for
intelligent transportation systems. Recently, deep-learning-based traffic
forecasting methods have emerged as state of the art for a wide range of
traffic forecasting tasks. However, these methods require a large amount of
training data, which needs to be collected over a significant period of time.
This can present a number of challenges for the development and deployment of
data-driven learning methods for highway networks that suffer from lack of
historical data. A promising approach to address this issue is transfer
learning, where a model trained on one part of the highway network can be
adapted for a different part of the highway network. We focus on diffusion
convolutional recurrent neural network (DCRNN), a state-of-the-art graph neural
network for highway network forecasting. It models the complex spatial and
temporal dynamics of the highway network using a graph-based diffusion
convolution operation within a recurrent neural network. DCRNN cannot perform
transfer learning, however, because it learns location-specific traffic
patterns, which cannot be used for unseen regions of the network. To that end,
we develop a new transfer learning approach for DCRNN, where a single model
trained on data-rich regions of the highway network can be used to forecast
traffic on unseen regions of the highway network. We evaluate the ability of
our approach to forecast the traffic on the entire California highway network
with one year of time series data. We show that TL-DCRNN can learn from several
regions of the California highway network and forecast the traffic on the
unseen regions of the network with high accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that
TL-DCRNN can learn from San Francisco region traffic data and can forecast
traffic on the Los Angeles region and vice versa.

communication channel that does not support collision detection. A shared
communication channel is a multiple access channel, which consists of a
sequence of synchronized time slots. Players on the channel may attempt to
broadcast a packet (message) in any time slot. A player's broadcast succeeds if
no other player broadcasts during that slot. If two or more players broadcast
in the same time slot, then the broadcasts collide and both broadcasts fail.
The lack of collision detection means that a player monitoring the channel
cannot differentiate between the case of two or more players broadcasting in
the same slot (a collision) and zero players broadcasting. In the
contention-resolution problem, players arrive on the channel over time, and
each player has one packet to transmit. The goal is to coordinate the players
so that each player is able to successfully transmit its packet within
reasonable time. However, the players can only communicate via the shared
channel by choosing to either broadcast or not. A contention-resolution
protocol is measured in terms of its throughput (channel utilization). Previous
work on contention resolution that achieved constant throughput assumed that
either players could detect collisions, or the players' arrival pattern is
generated by a memoryless (non-adversarial) process. The foundational question
answered by this paper is whether collision detection is a luxury or necessity
when the objective is to achieve constant throughput. We show that even without
collision detection, one can solve contention resolution, achieving constant
throughput, with high probability.

Here, by identifying the most important kind of critical fluctuations dubbed as
phases fluctuations and comparing the consequences of having self-similarity
with those of lacking self-similarity in the phases fluctuations, we show that
self-similarity can indeed be broken with significant consequences at least in
nonequilibrium situations. We find that the breaking of self-similarity results
in new critical exponents which give rise to violation of the well-known
finite-size scaling or the less-known finite-time scaling and different leading
exponents in the ordered and the disordered phases of the paradigmatic Ising
model on two- or three-dimensional finite lattices when it subjects to the
simplest nonequilibrium driving of linear heating or cooling through its

APOGEE-DR16, as well as the stellar age distribution in [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]
from APOKASC-2. The disc grows from the inside out, with a radial gradient in
the star-formation rate during the entire phase. Despite the radial dependence,
the outflow-to-infall ratio of metals in our simulated halo shows a
time-independent profile scaling with the disc growth. The simulated disc
undergoes two modes of gas inflow: (i) an infall of metal-poor and relatively
low-[$\alpha$/Fe] gas, and (ii) a radial flow where already chemically-enriched

that stellar migrations mostly happen outwards, on typical time scales of

observations from APOGEE-DR16, and the main effect of stellar migrations is to
flatten the radial metallicity profiles by 0.05 dex/kpc in the slopes. We also

task. We begin with the self-learning strategy, which generates pseudo-labels
for unlabeled data to retrain the model. However, directly using noisy
pseudo-labels will cause error amplification and accumulation. Considering the
topology structure of human body, we propose a trainable graph reasoning method
that establishes internal structural connections between graph nodes to correct
two typical errors in the pseudo-labels, i.e., the global structural error and
the local consistency error. For the global error, we first transform
category-wise features into a high-level graph model with coarse-grained
structural information, and then decouple the high-level graph to reconstruct
the category features. The reconstructed features have a stronger ability to
represent the topology structure of the human body. Enlarging the receptive
field of features can effectively reducing the local error. We first project
feature pixels into a local graph model to capture pixel-wise relations in a
hierarchical graph manner, then reverse the relation information back to the
pixels. With the global structural and local consistency modules, these errors
are rectified and confident pseudo-labels are generated for retraining.
Extensive experiments on the LIP and the ATR datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our global and local rectification modules. Our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in supervised human parsing tasks.

investigated from a game theoretic perspective. The objective is to minimize
the average response time of an MD that consists of communication time, waiting

Natural Language Processing for the past couple of decades. However, Sanskrit
still lacks a robust purely data-driven dependency parser, probably with an
exception to Krishna (2019). This can primarily be attributed to the lack of
availability of task-specific labelled data and the morphologically rich nature
of the language. In this work, we evaluate four different data-driven machine
learning models, originally proposed for different languages, and compare their
performances on Sanskrit data. We experiment with 2 graph based and 2
transition based parsers. We compare the performance of each of the models in a
low-resource setting, with 1,500 sentences for training. Further, since our
focus is on the learning power of each of the models, we do not incorporate any
Sanskrit specific features explicitly into the models, and rather use the
default settings in each of the paper for obtaining the feature functions. In
this work, we analyse the performance of the parsers using both an in-domain
and an out-of-domain test dataset. We also investigate the impact of word
ordering in which the sentences are provided as input to these systems, by
parsing verses and their corresponding prose order (anvaya) sentences.

memristor is generally a two-terminal electronic element with conductance that
varies nonlinearly with external electric stimuli and can be remembered when
the electric power is turned off. As an alternative, light can be used to tune
the memconductance and endow a memristor with a combination of the advantages
of both photonics and electronics. Both increases and decreases in optically
induced memconductance have been realized in different memristors; however, the
reversible tuning of memconductance with light in the same device remains a
considerable challenge that severely restricts the development of
optoelectronic memristors. Here we describe an all-optically controlled (AOC)
analog memristor with memconductance that is reversibly tunable over a
continuous range by varying only the wavelength of the controlling light. Our
memristor is based on the relatively mature semiconductor material InGaZnO

a cooperative Channel-SLAM framework, which is referred as Team Channel-SLAM.
Different from the previous work, Team Channel-SLAM not only exploits the
stationary nature of reflecting objects around the receiver to characterize the
location of a single vehicle through multi-path signals, but also capitalizes
on the multi-vehicle aspects of road traffic to further improve
positioning.Specifically, Team Channel-SLAM exploits the correlation between

Stimulated by this background, we investigate multipole-fluctuation-mediated

discussed. Based on the obtained results, we discuss unconventional

transition linked to a unit cell volume expansion. Thus, using the strain
exerted by an adjacent piezoelectric layer, the relative amount of
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic regions can be tuned by an electric field
applied to the piezoelectric material. Indeed, large variations in the
saturation magnetization have been observed when straining FeRh films grown on
suitable piezoelectric substrates. In view of its applications, the variations
in the remanent magnetization rather than those of the saturation magnetization
are the most relevant. Here, we show that in the absence of any bias external
magnetic field, permanent and reversible magnetization changes as high as 34%

Bulk and local magnetoelectric characterization reveals that the fundamental

real time with possible hope to apply on COVID-19. In this communication,
molecular docking studies of 18 ligands were carried out with the three
therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike glycoprotein (SGp).
The obtained results revealed that the phytochemicals showed better dock score

limonin and scopadulcic acid B can be further explored for potential use

scattering properties of the individual objects in each array are described by
the T-matrix formalism. Therefore, arbitrarily shaped objects and even
molecules can be the basic constituent of the arrays. Taking the T-matrix of
the individual scatterer as the point of departure allows to explain the
optical properties of the bulk material from the scattering properties of its
constituents. We use solutions of Maxwell's equations with well defined
helicity. Therefore, chiral media are particularly easy to consider as
materials for both scatterers or embedding media. We exemplify the efficiency
of the algorithm with an exhaustive parametric study of anti-reflective
coatings for solar cells made from cylinders with a high degree of helicity

investigate creating ensembles under an additional constraint on the total cost
of the members. This task can be formulated as a knapsack problem, where the
energy is the ensemble accuracy formed by some aggregation rules. However, the
generally applied aggregation rules lead to a nonseparable energy function,
which takes the common solution tools -- such as dynamic programming -- out of
action. We introduce a novel stochastic approach that considers the energy as
the joint probability function of the member accuracies. This type of knowledge
can be efficiently incorporated in a stochastic search process as a stopping

the probability of finding more accurate ensembles. Experimental analyses of
the created ensembles of pattern classifiers and object detectors confirm the

growth by pulsed laser deposition influences not only the cation stoichiometry
(site-occupation) but also the cation valence state. Our XAS results show that
the Ni in the O$_{h}$-site is in the intermediate valence state between +2 and
+3, Ni$^{(2+\delta)+}$ (0<$\delta$<1), whose nominal valence state (the
$\delta$ value) varies depending on P$_{O2}$. On the other hand, the Co in the
octahedral (O$_{h}$) and tetrahedral (T$_{d}$) sites respectively have the
valence state close to +3 and +2. We also find that the XMCD signals originate
mainly from the T$_{d}$-site Co$^{2+}$ (Co$_{Td}$) and O$_{h}$-site
Ni$^{(2+\delta)+}$ (Ni$_{Oh}$), indicating that these cation valence states are
the key in determining the magnetic and transport properties of NCO films.
Interestingly, the valence state of Ni$^{(2+\delta)+}$ that gives rise to the
XMCD signal remains unchanged independent of P$_{O2}$. The electronic structure
of Ni$^{(2+\delta)+}$ that is responsible for the magnetic moment and
electrical conduction differs from those of Ni$^{2+}$ and Ni$^{3+}$. In
addition, the orbital magnetic moment originating from Co$_{Td}$ is as large as
0.14 $\mu_{B}/Co_{Td}$ and parallel to the magnetization while the Ni$_{Oh}$
orbital moment is as small as 0.07 $\mu_{B}/Ni_{Oh}$ and is rather isotropic.
The Co$_{Td}$ therefore plays the key role in the perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy of the films. Our results demonstrate the significance of the
site-dependent cations valence states for the magnetic and transport properties
of NCO films.

improvements, deploying multiple access points (APs) in a given area may
significantly contribute to achieve those performance goals by simply improving
average coverage and data rates. However, it opens a new challenge: to
determine the best AP for each given station (STA).
  This article studies the achievable performance gains of using secondary APs,
also called Extenders, in Home WiFi networks in terms of throughput and delay.
To do that, we introduce a centralized, easily implementable channel load aware
selection mechanism for WiFi networks that takes full advantage of IEEE
802.11k/v capabilities to collect data from STAs, and distribute association
decisions accordingly. These decisions are completely computed in the AP (or,
alternatively, in an external network controller) based on an AP selection
decision metric that, in addition to RSSI, also takes into account the load of
both access and backhaul wireless links for each potential STA-AP/Extender
connection.
  Performance evaluation of the proposed channel load aware AP and Extender
selection mechanism has been first conducted in a purpose-built simulator,
resulting in an overall improvement of the main analyzed metrics (throughput
and delay) and the ability to serve, at least, 35% more traffic while keeping
the network uncongested when compared to the traditional RSSI-based WiFi
association. This trend was confirmed when the channel load aware mechanism was
tested in a real deployment, where STAs were associated to the indicated
AP/Extender and total throughput was increased by 77.12%.

data annotation is expensive. In this paper, to reduce dependence on massive
calculation and labelled samples, we propose a lightweight network architecture
(LiteDenseNet) based on DenseNet for Hyperspectral Image Classification.
Inspired by GoogLeNet and PeleeNet, we design a 3D two-way dense layer to
capture the local and global features of the input. As convolution is a
computationally intensive operation, we introduce group convolution to decrease
calculation cost and parameter size further. Thus, the number of parameters and
the consumptions of calculation are observably less than contrapositive deep
learning methods, which means LiteDenseNet owns simpler architecture and higher
efficiency. A series of quantitative experiences on 6 widely used hyperspectral
datasets show that the proposed LiteDenseNet obtains the state-of-the-art
performance, even though when the absence of labelled samples is severe.

with multiple labels simultaneously. Most of the existing approaches aim to
improve the performance of multi-label learning by exploiting label
correlations. Although the data augmentation technique is widely used in many
machine learning tasks, it is still unclear whether data augmentation is
helpful to multi-label learning. In this article, we propose to leverage the
data augmentation technique to improve the performance of multi-label learning.
Specifically, we first propose a novel data augmentation approach that performs
clustering on the real examples and treats the cluster centers as virtual
examples, and these virtual examples naturally embody the local label
correlations and label importances. Then, motivated by the cluster assumption
that examples in the same cluster should have the same label, we propose a
novel regularization term to bridge the gap between the real examples and
virtual examples, which can promote the local smoothness of the learning
function. Extensive experimental results on a number of real-world multi-label
datasets clearly demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art counterparts.

have been proposed. However, the calculation cost becomes enormous as the size
of the models becomes larger. Various techniques for compressing the size of
the models have been proposed to improve performance while reducing
computational costs. One of the methods to compress the size of the models is
knowledge distillation (KD). Knowledge distillation is a technique for
transferring knowledge of deep or ensemble models with many parameters (teacher
model) to smaller shallow models (student model). Since the purpose of
knowledge distillation is to increase the similarity between the teacher model
and the student model, we propose to introduce the concept of metric learning
into knowledge distillation to make the student model closer to the teacher
model using pairs or triplets of the training samples. In metric learning, the
researchers are developing the methods to build a model that can increase the
similarity of outputs for similar samples. Metric learning aims at reducing the
distance between similar and increasing the distance between dissimilar. The
functionality of the metric learning to reduce the differences between similar
outputs can be used for the knowledge distillation to reduce the differences
between the outputs of the teacher model and the student model. Since the
outputs of the teacher model for different objects are usually different, the
student model needs to distinguish them. We think that metric learning can
clarify the difference between the different outputs, and the performance of
the student model could be improved. We have performed experiments to compare
the proposed method with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods.

different institutes and manufacturers were involved in the study. The first
dataset was used for training (12 patients) and validation (6 patients), while
the second dataset was used as an independent test set (14 patients). In terms
of mean surface distance, our approach achieved $1.06 \pm 0.3$ mm, $0.91 \pm
0.4$ mm, $1.27 \pm 0.4$ mm, and $1.76 \pm 0.8$ mm on the validation set and

demonstrating the capability to leverage the individual strengths of the

utilize cloud computing resources in the form of different virtual machines
(VM). Cloud Data Center (CDC) infrastructures require significant amounts of
energy to deliver large scale computational services. Computing nodes generate
large volumes of heat, requiring cooling units in turn to eliminate the effect
of this heat. Thus, the overall energy consumption of the CDC increases
tremendously for servers as well as for cooling units. However, current
workload allocation policies do not take into account the effect on temperature
and it is challenging to simulate the thermal behavior of CDCs. There is a need
for a thermal-aware framework to simulate and model the behavior of nodes and
measure the important performance parameters which can be affected by its
temperature. In this paper, we propose a lightweight framework, ThermoSim, for
modeling and simulation of thermal-aware resource management for cloud

deep learning temperature predictor for CDCs which is utilized by ThermoSim for
lightweight resource management in constrained cloud environments. ThermoSim
extends the CloudSim toolkit helping to analyze the performance of various key

migrations and temperature during the management of cloud resources for
execution of workloads. Further, different energy-aware and thermal-aware

combinations trained on two datasets, TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8. We find
that the bias induced by the architecture and the inclusion of linguistic

adding contextualized word representations greatly increases performance on
probing tasks with a focus on named entity and part-of-speech information, and
yields better results in RE. In contrast, entity masking improves RE, but
considerably lowers performance on entity type related probing tasks.

varies significantly over the regions of a ground terrain image. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach towards ground-terrain recognition via modeling the
Extent-of-Texture information to establish a balance between the order-less
texture component and ordered-spatial information locally. At first, the
proposed method uses a CNN backbone feature extractor network to capture
meaningful information of a ground terrain image, and model the extent of
texture and shape information locally. Then, the order-less texture information
and ordered shape information are encoded in a patch-wise manner, which is
utilized by intra-domain message passing module to make every patch aware of
each other for rich feature learning. Next, the Extent-of-Texture (EoT) Guided
Inter-domain Message Passing module combines the extent of texture and shape
information with the encoded texture and shape information in a patch-wise
fashion for sharing knowledge to balance out the order-less texture information
with ordered shape information. Further, Bilinear model generates a pairwise
correlation between the order-less texture information and ordered shape
information. Finally, the ground-terrain image classification is performed by a
fully connected layer. The experimental results indicate superior performance
of the proposed model over existing state-of-the-art techniques on publicly

PDE solvers, but it might be slow to train PINNs on particular problems, and
there is no theoretical guarantee of corresponding error bounds. In this
manuscript, we propose a variant called Prior Dictionary based Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PD-PINNs). Equipped with task-dependent dictionaries, PD-PINNs
enjoy enhanced representation power on the tasks, which helps to capture
features provided by dictionaries so that the proposed neural networks can
achieve faster convergence in the process of training. In various numerical
simulations, compared with existing PINN methods, combining prior dictionaries
can significantly enhance convergence speed. In terms of theory, we obtain the
error bounds applicable to PINNs and PD-PINNs for solving elliptic partial
differential equations of second order. It is proved that under certain mild
conditions, the prediction error made by neural networks can be bounded by
expected loss of PDEs and boundary conditions.

three-dimensional skeleton data. Our model employs three novel components.
First, an input layer capable of constructing highly discriminative

compact yet rich representations of the data, and third, a tensor-based neural
network that processes data representations in their original tensor form. Our
model is end-to-end trainable and characterized by a small number of trainable
parameters making it suitable for problems where the annotated data is limited.
Experimental evaluation of the proposed model indicates that it can achieve

  available:https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/DJ-RN",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection lies at the core of action
understanding. Besides 2D information such as human/object appearance and
locations, 3D pose is also usually utilized in HOI learning since its
view-independence. However, rough 3D body joints just carry sparse body
information and are not sufficient to understand complex interactions. Thus, we
need detailed 3D body shape to go further. Meanwhile, the interacted object in
3D is also not fully studied in HOI learning. In light of these, we propose a
detailed 2D-3D joint representation learning method. First, we utilize the
single-view human body capture method to obtain detailed 3D body, face and hand
shapes. Next, we estimate the 3D object location and size with reference to the
2D human-object spatial configuration and object category priors. Finally, a
joint learning framework and cross-modal consistency tasks are proposed to
learn the joint HOI representation. To better evaluate the 2D ambiguity
processing capacity of models, we propose a new benchmark named Ambiguous-HOI
consisting of hard ambiguous images. Extensive experiments in large-scale HOI
benchmark and Ambiguous-HOI show impressive effectiveness of our method. Code

evidence as well as the AIC and BIC information criteria, we compare the PEDE

CMB), (ii) expansion data (including CMB) and (iii) expansion data jointed to

$\Lambda$CDM model is still the best model. In the case of expansion data

observations as well as the concordance $\Lambda$CDM universe. While in the
cases of (i) and (iii), the PEDE models in both of the flat and non-flat

level the PEDE model can not fit the observations as equally as standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. As the ability of the model, we show that the PEDE
models can alleviate the tension of Hubble constant value appearing between the
local observations and Planck inferred estimation in standard cosmology.

proposing new motif discovery algorithms, not much work has been done on the
exploration of the motifs extracted by these algorithms. In this paper, we
argue that visually exploring time-series motifs computed by motif discovery
algorithms can be useful to understand and debug results. To explore the output
of motif discovery algorithms, we propose the use of an adapted Self-Organizing
Map, the DTW-SOM, on the list of motif's centers. In short, DTW-SOM is a
vanilla Self-Organizing Map with three main differences, namely (1) the use the
Dynamic Time Warping distance instead of the Euclidean distance, (2) the
adoption of two new network initialization routines (a random sample
initialization and an anchor initialization) and (3) the adjustment of the
Adaptation phase of the training to work with variable-length time-series
sequences. We test DTW-SOM in a synthetic motif dataset and two real
time-series datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. After an
exploration of results, we conclude that DTW-SOM is capable of extracting
relevant information from a set of motifs and display it in a visualization

  Efficient Scheduling on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)","In the Proceedings of the 20th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on
  Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGRID 2020)",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, are increasingly
adopting GPUs to boost their computing capabilities primarily due to the
heterogeneous nature of AI/ML/deep learning workloads. However, the energy
consumption of GPUs is a critical problem. Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling
(DVFS) is a widely used technique to reduce the dynamic power of GPUs. Yet,
configuring the optimal clock frequency for essential performance requirements
is a non-trivial task due to the complex nonlinear relationship between the
application's runtime performance characteristics, energy, and execution time.
It becomes more challenging when different applications behave distinctively
with similar clock settings. Simple analytical solutions and standard GPU
frequency scaling heuristics fail to capture these intricacies and scale the
frequencies appropriately. In this regard, we propose a data-driven frequency
scaling technique by predicting the power and execution time of a given
application over different clock settings. We collect the data from application
profiling and train the models to predict the outcome accurately. The proposed
solution is generic and can be easily extended to different kinds of workloads
and GPU architectures. Furthermore, using this frequency scaling by prediction
models, we present a deadline-aware application scheduling algorithm to reduce
energy consumption while simultaneously meeting their deadlines. We conduct
real extensive experiments on NVIDIA GPUs using several benchmark applications.

non-equilibrium statistical operator method to address quantum effects induced

investigate the effects of vorticity, this work has been focused on systems
consisting of massless chiral fermions. We recovered the significant quantum
phenomena known in the literature, namely the chiral magnetic effect, the
chiral vortical effect, the axial vortical effect and the chiral separation
effect and we also revealed the presence of additional effects at second-order
on thermal vorticity. This study has also identified and presented the exact
solutions of thermal states for a system at global thermal equilibrium
consisting of chiral massless fermions under the action of an external constant
homogeneous magnetic field. Taking advantage of these exact solutions and
conservation equations, the study also proved that the thermal coefficients
related to first-order effects on thermal vorticity do not receive corrections
from the external electromagnetic field. The same argument revealed existing
relations between those thermal coefficients, even connecting coefficients
related to vorticity to other related to electromagnetic field. For instance,
this analysis has found that the chiral vortical effect and the chiral magnetic
effect conductivities are connected one to the other by a differential
equation. Therefore, this research provides the first steps into deriving the
relations between the effects and the interplay of electromagnetic fields and
vorticity.

  (https://www.discotec.org/2020/forte)",,,,"cs.DC cs.LO cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-volatile memory (NVM), aka persistent memory, is a new paradigm for
memory that preserves its contents even after power loss. The expected ubiquity
of NVM has stimulated interest in the design of novel concepts ensuring
correctness of concurrent programming abstractions in the face of persistency.
So far, this has lead to the design of a number of persistent concurrent data
structures, built to satisfy an associated notion of correctness: durable
linearizability.
  In this paper, we transfer the principle of durable concurrent correctness to
the area of software transactional memory (STM). Software transactional memory
algorithms allow for concurrent access to shared state. Like linearizability
for concurrent data structures, opacity is the established notion of
correctness for STMs. First, we provide a novel definition of durable opacity
extending opacity to handle crashes and recovery in the context of NVM. Second,
we develop a durably opaque version of an existing STM algorithm, namely the
Transactional Mutex Lock (TML). Third, we design a proof technique for durable
opacity based on refinement between TML and an operational characterisation of
durable opacity by adapting the TMS2 specification. Finally, we apply this
proof technique to show that the durable version of TML is indeed durably
opaque. The correctness proof is mechanized within Isabelle.

populations by ejecting strong stellar winds and exploding in energetic
phenomena. It is therefore imperative that their behavior be properly accounted

  We present nine grids of stellar evolutionary model sequences, together with
finely resolved interpolated sequences and synthetic populations, of stars with
9-500 Msun and with metallicities ranging from Galactic metallicity down to
1/250 Zsun. The stellar models were computed with the Bonn evolutionary code
with consistent physical ingredients, and covering core hydrogen- and core
helium-burning phases. The interpolation and population synthesis were
performed with our newly developed routine 'synStars'. Eight of the grids
represent slowly rotating massive stars with a normal or classical evolutionary
path, while one grid represents fast-rotating, chemically homogeneously
evolving models. The grids contain data on stellar wind properties such as
estimated wind velocity and kinetic energy of the wind, as well as common
stellar parameters such as mass, radius, surface temperature, luminosity,
mass-loss rate, and surface abundances of 34 isotopes. We also provide
estimates of the helium and carbon-oxygen core mass for calculating the mass of
stellar remnants.
  The Bonn Optimized Stellar Tracks (BoOST) project is published as simple
tables that include stellar models, interpolated tracks, and synthetic
populations. Covering the broadest mass and metallicity range of any published
massive star evolutionary model sets to date, BoOST is ideal for further
scientific applications such as star formation studies in both low- and
high-redshift galaxies.

fundamental basics of biogeography, tracking range shifts resulting from
climate change, predicting and preventing biological invansions. Many
researchers have modeled animals' dispersal studying their behavior under the
assumptions of some movement strategies pre-determined or affected by some
external factor(s) but none of them have compared the efficiency of different
dispersal strategies in providing population survival and fitness. We
hypothesize that 1) successful expansion could result from some evolutionary
stable strategy (ESS) and 2) such strategy could be based particularly on
deferred gain, when animals invest in travel to reach some high-quality habitat
(""habitat of dream""). Using simulation model we compare the ecological success
of three strategies: i) ""Smart"" - choosing the locally optimal cell; ii)
""Random"" - random movement between cells without taking into account the
quality of the environment; iii) ""Dreamer"" - movements that aims to find ""a
habitat of dream"" with quality much higher than that of the initial and
neighboring cells. The population fitness was measured as survival rate,
dispersal distance, accumulated energy and quality of settled habitat. The most
general conclusion is that while survival and wealth of the population is
affected presumably by overall habitat quality, the dispersal depends mainly on
the behavioral strategy. The ""Dreamer"" strategy or the strategy of deferred
gain belongs to the Pareto frontier in the Fitness$\times$Dispersal space but
only in optimal and suboptimal habitat and in the relatively mild climate.

proposed in order to rectify the issues associated with classification in such
a setting, the classifier in [1], composed of an ensemble of randomly projected
linear discriminants, seems especially promising; it is computationally
efficient and, with the optimal projection dimension parameter setting, is
competitive with the state-of-the-art. In this work, we seek to further
understand the behavior of this classifier through asymptotic analysis. Under
the assumption of a growth regime in which the dataset and projection
dimensions grow at constant rates to each other, we use random matrix theory to
derive asymptotic misclassification probabilities showing the effect of the
ensemble as a regularization of the data sample covariance matrix. The
asymptotic errors further help to identify situations in which the ensemble
offers a performance advantage. We also develop a consistent estimator of the
misclassification probability as an alternative to the computationally-costly
cross-validation estimator, which is conventionally used for parameter tuning.
Finally, we demonstrate the use of our estimator for tuning the projection
dimension on both real and synthetic data.

compartmental model. This control is induced by the aggregation of individuals'
decisions to limit their social interactions: when the epidemic is ongoing, an
individual can diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting
infected, but this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers
his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster, but the effort cost may be
high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed,
resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. We prove
theoretically that equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. However, this
equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the societal
optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning
that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples
and a sensitivity analysis, as well as an extension to a SEIR compartmental
model to account for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease.
In all the scenarii considered, the divergence between the individual and

popular Dual Block-Coordinate Ascent principle. Surprisingly, by making a small
change to the low-performing solver, the Max Product Linear Programming (MPLP)
algorithm, we derive the new solver MPLP++ that significantly outperforms all
existing solvers by a large margin, including the state-of-the-art solver
Tree-Reweighted Sequential (TRWS) message-passing algorithm. Additionally, our
solver is highly parallel, in contrast to TRWS, which gives a further boost in
performance with the proposed GPU and multi-thread CPU implementations. We
verify the superiority of our algorithm on dense problems from publicly
available benchmarks, as well, as a new benchmark for 6D Object Pose
estimation. We also provide an ablation study with respect to graph density.

between normal pulsars and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXP) and soft gamma-ray
repeaters (SGR) with the similar values of periods and magnetic fields. It is
shown that the dependence of period derivatives on periods for pulsars with
long periods is $dP/dt \propto P^{1.67}$. This means that we must search for
another braking mechanism differing from the magnetic dipole one which gives
$dP/dt \propto P^{-1}$ or use some specific distributions of parameters. On the
other hand, radio pulsars with strong magnetic fields and AXP/SGR can be
described by the magnetic dipole model. Radio pulsars with P > 2 sec have ages
on average two orders of magnitude higher than objects with $Bs > 4.4 \times

Here our goal is to identify the origin and quantify the magnitude of the

  A detailed study on the effect of different interaction terms and the nuclear

presented here. The equation of state was inserted to the
Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equation and observable parameters of the neutron

  We identified, that the optimal Landau effective mass is the most relevant
physical parameter modifying the macroscopic observable values. Moreover, the
compressibility and symmetry energy terms just generate one-one order of

relations between the maximal mass of a compact star and these microscopic
nuclear parameter values within the physical relevant parameters range. Based

the excess emission in the OVIII Ly$\gamma$ lines -- can be well explained by
the model. Combined with the Chandra images in the OVIII and the OVII bands, we
find the soft X-ray emission is dominated by the jet-driven outflow and its
interaction with the ambient neutral material. The jet-driven outflow itself is
likely a thermal plasma of $\sim 0.59$ keV, with mostly sub-solar abundances.
It runs into the ambient neutral gas, and produces significant CX emission that
accounts for one-fifth of the diffuse X-ray emission in the 7--28 {\AA} band.
The effective interface area in the CX process is one order of magnitude
greater than the geometrical surface area of the jet-driven outflow. The
tenuous outflow driven by the nuclear star formation may also contribute a
small portion to both the diffuse thermal and CX emission. The photoionization
by the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the resonance scattering by the hot

ruled out.

state-of-the-art sequence to sequence neural networks, attempts to model this
relationship by explicitly aligning the acoustic and visual representations of
speech. This study investigates the inner workings of AV Align and visualises
the audio-visual alignment patterns. Our experiments are performed on two of
the largest publicly available AVSR datasets, TCD-TIMIT and LRS2. We find that
AV Align learns to align acoustic and visual representations of speech at the
frame level on TCD-TIMIT in a generally monotonic pattern. We also determine
the cause of initially seeing no improvement over audio-only speech recognition
on the more challenging LRS2. We propose a regularisation method which involves
predicting lip-related Action Units from visual representations. Our
regularisation method leads to better exploitation of the visual modality, with
performance improvements between 7% and 30% depending on the noise level.
Furthermore, we show that the alternative Watch, Listen, Attend, and Spell

approach can effectively help it learn visual representations. Our findings
validate the suitability of the regularisation method to AVSR and encourage
researchers to rethink the multimodal convergence problem when having one

present a comprehensive analysis of studies on approximate quantile
computation. Both deterministic algorithms and randomized algorithms that
compute approximate quantiles over streaming models or distributed models are
covered. Then, multiple techniques for improving the efficiency and performance
of approximate quantile algorithms in various scenarios, such as skewed data
and high-speed data streams, are presented. Finally, we conclude with coverage
of existing packages in different languages and with a brief discussion of the

and the estimation of the proportion $\pi_{0}$ of true null hypotheses. The
Schweder-Spj\o tvoll estimator $\hat{\pi}_0$ utilizes marginal $p$-values and
only works properly if the $p$-values that correspond to the true null
hypotheses are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$
($\mathrm{Uni}[0,1]$-distributed). In the case of composite null hypotheses,
marginal $p$-values are usually computed under least favorable parameter
configurations (LFCs). Thus, they are stochastically larger than
$\mathrm{Uni}[0,1]$ under non-LFCs in the null hypotheses. When using these
LFC-based $p$-values, $\hat{\pi}_0$ tends to overestimate $\pi_{0}$. We
introduce a new way of randomizing $p$-values that depends on a tuning
parameter $c\in[0,1]$, such that $c=0$ and $c=1$ lead to
$\mathrm{Uni}[0,1]$-distributed $p$-values, which are independent of the data,
and to the original LFC-based $p$-values, respectively. For a certain value
$c=c^{\star}$ the bias of $\hat{\pi}_0$ is minimized when using our randomized
$p$-values. This often also entails a smaller mean squared error of the
estimator as compared to the usage of the LFC-based $p$-values. We analyze
these points theoretically, and we demonstrate them numerically in computer
simulations under various standard statistical models.

problems with convex constraints is described. Various versions of the LM
method have been proposed, their main differences being in the choice of a
damping parameter. In this paper, we propose a new rule for updating the
parameter so as to achieve both global and local convergence even under the
presence of a convex constraint set. The key to our results is a new
perspective of the LM method from majorization-minimization methods.
Specifically, we show that if the damping parameter is set in a specific way,
the objective function of the standard subproblem in LM methods becomes an
upper bound on the original objective function under certain standard
assumptions.
  Our method solves a sequence of the subproblems approximately using an
(accelerated) projected gradient method. It finds an $\epsilon$-stationary

convergence for zero-residual problems under a local error bound condition.
Numerical results on compressed sensing and matrix factorization show that our

  Crime Pattern Theory in Large Cities",,,,,"cs.CY cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crime has been previously explained by social characteristics of the
residential population and, as stipulated by crime pattern theory, might also
be linked to human movements of non-residential visitors. Yet a full empirical
validation of the latter is lacking. The prime reason is that prior studies are
limited to aggregated statistics of human visitors rather than mobility flows
and, because of that, neglect the temporal dynamics of individual human
movements. As a remedy, we provide the first work which studies the ability of
granular human mobility in describing and predicting crime concentrations at an
hourly scale. For this purpose, we propose the use of data from location
technology platforms. This type of data allows us to trace individual
transitions and, therefore, we succeed in distinguishing different mobility
flows that (i) are incoming or outgoing from a neighborhood, (ii) remain within
it, or (iii) refer to transitions where people only pass through the
neighborhood. Our evaluation infers mobility flows by leveraging an anonymized
dataset from Foursquare that includes almost 14.8 million consecutive check-ins
in three major U.S. cities. According to our empirical results, mobility flows
are significantly and positively linked to crime. These findings advance our
theoretical understanding, as they provide confirmatory evidence for crime
pattern theory. Furthermore, our novel use of digital location services data
proves to be an effective tool for crime forecasting. It also offers
unprecedented granularity when studying the connection between human mobility
and crime.

range of applications, from biophotonics and mechanobiology to microscopy and
optomechanics [2, 3, 4, 5]. Simulations of the motion of microscopic particles
held by optical tweezers are often required to explore complex phenomena and to
interpret experimental data [6, 7, 8, 9]. For the sake of computational
efficiency, these simulations usually model the optical tweezers as an harmonic
potential [10, 11]. However, more physically-accurate optical-scattering models
[12, 13, 14, 15] are required to accurately model more onerous systems; this is
especially true for optical traps generated with complex fields [16, 17, 18,
19]. Although accurate, these models tend to be prohibitively slow for problems
with more than one or two degrees of freedom (DoF) [20], which has limited
their broad adoption. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning permits one to
combine the speed of the harmonic model with the accuracy of optical-scattering
models. Specifically, we show that a neural network can be trained to rapidly
and accurately predict the optical forces acting on a microscopic particle. We
demonstrate the utility of this approach on two phenomena that are
prohibitively slow to accurately simulate otherwise: the escape dynamics of
swelling microparticles in an optical trap, and the rotation rates of particles
in a superposition of beams with opposite orbital angular momenta. Thanks to
its high speed and accuracy, this method can greatly enhance the range of
phenomena that can be efficiently simulated and studied.

in multidimensional data sets spanning a range of experimental parameters. As
an example, a common approach to study ferroelectric switching is to observe
effects of applied electric field, but switching can also be enacted by
pressure and is influenced by strain fields, material composition, temperature,
time, etc. Moreover, the parameters are usually interdependent, so that their
decoupling toward univariate measurements or analysis may not be
straightforward. On the other hand, both explicit and hidden parameters provide
an opportunity to gain deeper insight into the measured properties, provided
there exists a well-defined path to capture and analyze such data. Here, we
introduce a new, two-dimensional approach to represent hysteretic response of a
material system to applied electric field. Utilizing ferroelectric polarization
as a model hysteretic property, we demonstrate how explicit consideration of
electromechanical response to two rather than one control voltages enables
significantly more transparent and robust interpretation of observed
hysteresis, such as differentiating between charge trapping and
ferroelectricity. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the new data representation
readily fits into a variety of machinelearning methodologies, from unsupervised
classification of the origins of hysteretic response via linear clustering
algorithms to neural-network-based inference of the sample temperature based on
the specific morphology of hysteresis.

matter, originally conceived for electrons in solids. It has been suggested
that $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Berry phase (Berry phase quantized into $2\pi/N$) is a
useful tool to characterize the symmetry protected topological states, while
the experimental evidence is still elusive. Recently, topolectrical circuits
have emerged as a simple yet very powerful platform for studying topological
physics that are challenging to realize in condensed matter systems. Here, we
present the first experimental observation of second-order corner states
characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Berry phase in topolectrical circuits. We
demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the localized second-order
topological states are protected by a generalized chiral symmetry of tripartite
lattices, and they are pinned to ""zero energy"". By introducing extra capacitors
within sublattices in the circuit, we are able to examine the robustness of the
zero modes against both chiral-symmetry conserving and breaking disturbances.
Our work paves the way for testing exotic topological band theory by
electrical-circuit experiments.

first-principles methods is a challenging task due to the interplay of
vibrational and magnetic degrees of freedom. The most difficult contribution to
include in simulations is represented by the longitudinal magnetic degrees of
freedom (LSF) due to their inherent many-body nature; nonetheless, schemes that
enable to take into account this effect on a semiclassical level have been
proposed and employed in the investigation of magnetic systems. However,
assessment of the effect of vibrations on LSF is lacking in the literature. For
this reason, in this work we develop a supercell approach within the framework
of constrained density functional theory to calculate self-consistently the
size of local-environment-dependent magnetic moments in the paramagnetic,
high-temperature state in presence of lattice vibrations and for liquid Fe in
different conditions. First, we consider the case of bcc Fe at the Curie
temperature and ambient pressure. Then, we perform a similar analysis on bcc Fe
at Earth's inner core conditions, and we find that LSF stabilize non-zero
moments which affect atomic forces and electronic density of states of the
system. Finally, we employ the present scheme on liquid Fe at the melting point
at ambient pressure, and at Earth's outer core conditions ($p \approx 200$ GPa,
$T \approx 6000$ K). In both cases, we obtain local magnetic moments of sizes
comparable to the solid-state counterparts.

Kyle's model, of agents' interplay in the financial markets, are aligned with
the phenomena observed in publicly available trades and quotes data.
Specifically, we confirmed that for small signed order-flows, the price impact
grows linearly with increase in the order-flow imbalance. We have, further,
implemented a machine learning algorithm to forecast market impact given a
signed order-flow. Our findings suggest that machine learning models can be
used in estimation of financial variables; and predictive accuracy of such
learning algorithms can surpass the performance of traditional statistical
approaches.
  Understanding the determinants of price impact is crucial for several
reasons. From a theoretical stance, modelling the impact provides a statistical
measure of liquidity. Practitioners adopt impact models as a pre-trade tool to
estimate expected transaction costs and optimize the execution of their
strategies. This further serves as a post-trade valuation benchmark as
suboptimal execution can significantly deteriorate a portfolio performance.
  More broadly, the price impact reflects the balance of liquidity across
markets. This is of central importance to regulators as it provides an
all-encompassing explanation of the correlation between market design and
systemic risk, enabling regulators to design more stable and efficient markets.

hybrid star. Quarkyonic matter is an approach in which both quarks and nucleons
appear as quasi-particles in a crossover transition, and provides an explicit
realization of early ideas concerning quark matter (e.g., the MIT bag model).
This description has recently been employed by McLerran and Reddy to model
chargeless (pure neutron) matter with an approach that has the virtue that the
speed of sound rises quickly at a neutron-quark transition so as to satisfy
observational constraints on the neutron star maximum mass ($\gtrsim2M_\odot$)
and the radius of a $1.4M_\odot$ star ($R_{1.4}\lesssim 13.5$ km). Traditional
models involving first-order transitions result in softer pressure-energy
density relations that have difficulty satisfying these constraints except with
very narrow choices of parameters. We propose a variation of quarkyonic matter
involving protons and leptons whose energy can be explicitly minimized to
achieve both chemical and beta equilibrium, which cannot be done in the
chargeless formulation. Quarkyonic stellar models are able to satisfy observed
mass and radius constraints with a wide range of model parameters, avoiding the
obligatory fine-tuning of conventional hybrid star models, including requiring
the transition density to be very close to the nuclear saturation density. Our
formulation fits experimental and theoretical properties of the nuclear
symmetry energy and pure neutron matter, and contains as few as three free
parameters. This makes it an ideal tool for the study of high-density matter
that is an efficient alternative to piecewise polytrope or spectral
decomposition methods.

an exact self-dual sector leading to an infinity of exact Skyrmion solutions
with arbitrary topological (baryon) charge. The self-dual sector is made
possible by the introduction, in addition to the usual three SU(2) Skyrme
fields, of six scalar fields assembled in a symmetric and invertible three
dimensional matrix h. The action presents quadratic and quartic terms in
derivatives of the Skyrme fields, but instead of the group indices being
contracted by the SU(2) Killing form, they are contracted with the h-matrix in
the quadratic term, and by its inverse on the quartic term. Due to these extra
fields the static version of the model, as well as its self-duality equations,
are conformally invariant on the three dimensional space R^3. We show that the
static and self-dual sectors of such a theory are equivalent, and so the only
non-self-dual solution must be time dependent. We also show that for any
configuration of the Skyrme SU(2) fields, the h-fields adjust themselves to
satisfy the self-duality equations, and so the theory has plenty of non-trivial
topological solutions. We present explicit exact solutions using a holomorphic
rational ansatz, as well as a toroidal ansatz based on the conformal symmetry.

critical point (AFM-QCP) emerging inside the superconducting dome of the phase
diagram. Fluctuations associated with such an AFM-QCP are expected to promote
unusual temperature dependencies of thermodynamic quantities. Here, we compute
the $T$ dependence of the specific heat $C(T)$ deep inside a fully gapped
$s^{+-}$ superconducting state as the AFM-QCP is approached. We find that, at
the AFM-QCP, the specific heat $C(T)$ vanishes quadratically with temperature,
as opposed to the typical exponential suppression seen in fully-gapped BCS
superconductors. This robust result is due to a non-analytic contribution to
the free-energy arising from the general form of the bosonic (AFM) propagator
in the SC state. Away from the AFM-QCP, as temperature is lowered, $C(T)$ shows
a crossover from a $T^2$ behavior to an exponential behavior, with the
crossover temperature scale set by the value of the superconducting gap and the
distance to the QCP. We argue that these features in the specific heat can be
used to unambiguously determine the existence of AFM-QCPs inside the
superconducting domes of iron-based and other fully gapped unconventional
superconductors.

the same variables. Amenability of $T$ follows from amenability of the
(topological) group $Aut(M)$ for all sufficiently large
$\aleph_{0}$-homogeneous countable models $M$ of $T$ (assuming $T$ to be
countable), but is radically less restrictive.
  First, we study basic properties of amenable theories, giving many equivalent
conditions. Then, applying a version of the stabilizer theorem from
[Amenability, connected components, and definable actions; E. Hrushovski, K.
Krupi\'{n}ski, A. Pillay], we prove that if $T$ is amenable, then $T$ is
G-compact, namely Lascar strong types and Kim-Pillay strong types over
$\emptyset$ coincide. This extends and essentially generalizes a similar result
proved via different methods for $\omega$-categorical theories in [Amenability,
definable groups, and automorphism groups; K. Krupi\'{n}ski, A. Pillay] . In
the special case when amenability is witnessed by $\emptyset$-definable global
Keisler measures (which is for example the case for amenable
$\omega$-categorical theories), we also give a different proof, based on
stability in continuous logic.
  Parallel (but easier) results hold for the notion of extreme amenability.

dominated by the surface passivation, and a post-synthesis ligand exchange with
a quaternary ammonium bromide (QAB) results in a more stable passivation over a
larger temperature range. The PL intensity is highest from 50K-250K, which
indicates that the ligand binding competes with the thermal energy at ambient

QAB ligands (monoexponential PL decay over a large temperature range, increased
PL intensity and stability), the surface passivation still needs improvement
toward increased emission intensity in nanocrystal films.

Logic (DL) entailments. Instead of concentrating on a specific DL and proof
calculus for this DL, we introduce a general framework in which proofs are
represented as labeled, directed hypergraphs, where each hyperedge corresponds
to a single sound derivation step. On the theoretical side, we investigate the
complexity of deciding whether a certain consequence has a proof of size at
most $n$ along the following orthogonal dimensions: (i) the underlying proof
system is polynomial or exponential; (ii) proofs may or may not reuse already
derived consequences; and (iii) the number $n$ is represented in unary or
binary. We have determined the exact worst-case complexity of this decision
problem for all but one of the possible combinations of these options. On the
practical side, we have developed and implemented an approach for generating
proofs for expressive DLs based on a non-standard reasoning task called
forgetting. We have evaluated this approach on a set of realistic ontologies

finding that forgetting-based proofs are often better w.r.t. different measures

for subsequently producing primordial black holes with the abundance to be all

embeddings of inflation in high-energy theories. We study analytically and
numerically how the duration and the strength of the turn impact the primordial

This phenomenon is of particular importance for the mechanical properties of

developed uses the principle of the minimum of dissipation potential and
assumes two internal variables: the deformations due to crystallization and the
regularity of the network. In addition to the dissipation potential necessary
for the derivation of evolution equations, the well-established Arruda-Boyce
model is chosen to depict the elastic behavior of the polymer. Two special
features of the model are the evolution direction depending on the stress state
and the distinction of crystallization during the loading and unloading phase.
The model has been implemented into the finite element method and applied for
numerical simulation of the growth and shrinkage of the crystal regions during
a cyclic tension test for samples with different initial configurations. The
concept enables the visualization of the microstructure evolution, yielding
information that is still inaccessible by experimental techniques.

triggered by quenching the trapping frequency. It is found that the boundaries
of the associated magnetic phases are altered in the presence of interparticle
correlations for both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin-spin
interactions, an effect which becomes more prominent in the few-body scenario.
Most importantly, we unveil a correlation-induced shrinking of the
anti-ferromagnetic and broken-axisymmetry phases implying that ground states
with bosons polarized in a single spin-component are favored. Turning to the
dynamical response of the spinor gas it is shown that its breathing frequency
is independent of the system parameters while correlations lead to the
formation of filamentary patterns in the one-body density of the participating
components. The number of filaments is larger for increasing spin-independent
interaction strengths or for smaller particle numbers. Each filament maintains
its coherence and exhibits an anti-correlated behavior while distinct filaments
show significant losses of coherence and are two-body correlated.
Interestingly, we demonstrate that for an initial broken-axisymmetry phase an
enhanced spin-flip dynamics takes place which can be tuned either via the
linear Zeeman term or the quench amplitude.

and the outbreak of disease epidemics, have a crucial dependence on the
connectivity patterns among the agents. We study cascading dynamics in modular,
degree-heterogeneous networks, and consider the impact of intra-module seeding
strategy on inter-module spread. Specifically, we establish that although
activating the highest-degree nodes is more effective than random selection at
growing a cascade locally, there is a critical level of inter-module
connectivity required for a cascade to cross from one module to another,
irrespective of the seeding strategy. We present an analytical proof of this
statement for the case that each module has the same degree distribution and
all module pairs have the same inter-module connectivity, while our simulation
results suggest its validity for more general situations, including a ring of
modules. Interestingly, we find that on a network comprised of two modules,
this critical level is primarily determined by the degree distribution of the
\emph{alter} module, as opposed to the seed module. Our analytical approach
extends a method developed by Gleeson, but is able to capture different seeding
strategies using only one dynamical variable per module, namely the conditional
exposure probability. Our work shows that the possibility of a global cascade
depends sensitively on inter-module connectivity, and less on the intra-module
seeding strategy. This suggests, for example, that slight changes to
inter-module connectivity can be a feasible intervention strategy to promote or
inhibit global cascades.

eigenfunction of the third component of the operator of angular momentum. This
condition, imposed on a non observable, is often used to derive that the
eigenvalues of angular momentum could be only integer. We reexamine the
arguments based on this requirement and alternate condition imposed by Pauli
and show that they do not follow from the first principles and therefore these
constraints can dropped. Consequently, we arrive to the same conclusion as in
[1]: there exist regular, normalizable eigenfunctions with the non-integer
eigenvalues thus a non-integer angular momentum is perfectly admissible from
the theoretical viewpoint. The issue of the nature of eigenvalues forming the
spectrum of the angular momentum remains open. What can be derived from the
first principles is that to a fixed value of the angular momentum L corresponds
a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues of the third component of the angular
momentum, m, defined by the relation |m|=L-k, k=0,1,...,[L], where [L] is an
integer part of L. As a mathematical byproduct of our analysis of
eigenfunctions, we present an alternate definition of a power of a complex
number allowing to retain initial translational invariance of a base.

descent scheme they used for successive independent actor and critic steps can
simplify the calculation, but it causes serious bias. In this paper, we propose
a flexible fully decentralized actor-critic MARL framework, which can combine

framework is designed to learn individual agents separately for
decentralization. From the perspective of each agent, policy improvement and
value evaluation are jointly optimized, which can stabilize multi-agent policy
learning. Furthermore, our framework can achieve scalability and stability for
large-scale environment and reduce information transmission, by the parameter
sharing mechanism and a novel modeling-other-agents methods based on
theory-of-mind and online supervised learning. Sufficient experiments in

The time is indeed ripe to undertake a realistic view of what migrating systems
to the cloud may offer, an understanding of exceptional situations causing
system quality goal failure, and insights on countermeasures. The cloud
migration body of knowledge, although is useful, is dispersed over the current
literature. It is hard for busy practitioners to digest, synthesize, and
harness this body of knowledge into practice in a scenario of integrating
legacy systems with cloud services. We address this issue by creating an
innovative synergy between the approaches evidence-based software engineering
and goal-oriented modelling. We develop an evidential repository of commonly
occurred obstacles and platform agnostic resolution tactics related to making
systems cloud-enabled. The repository is further utilized during the systematic
goal-obstacle elaboration of given cloud migration scenarios. The applicability
of the proposed framework is also demonstrated.

camera motion can be estimated simultaneously. Because pure sparse 3D points
provide a structureless representation of the environment, generating 3D mesh
from sparse points can further model the environment topology and produce dense
mapping. To improve the accuracy of 3D mesh generation and localization, we
propose a tightly-coupled monocular VIO system, PLP-VIO, which exploits point
features and line features as well as plane regularities. The co-planarity
constraints are used to leverage additional structure information for the more
accurate estimation of 3D points and spatial lines in state estimator. To
detect plane and 3D mesh robustly, we combine both the line features with point
features in the detection method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
verified on both synthetic data and public datasets and is compared with other
state-of-the-art algorithms.

driven pseudoforce system the plasmonic excitations of electron beam with
arbitrary degree of degeneracy are studied. Using the conventional normal-mode
analysis a dual-length-scale wavefunction theory for a monochromatic electron
beam is developed. The beam plasmon excitations are shown to have both wave and
particle character, de Broglie wavenumbers of which depend on various
parameters such as average beam speed, the chemical potential, the charge
screening and the background electrostatic energy. The deterministic single
electron dynamics in the beam is investigated using the dual-wavelength
electrostatic potential energy. It is shown that electrons can be either
trapped or traveling along the beam direction depending on the ambient plasma
parameter values. The problem of monochromatic beam transport through binary as
well as ternary metallic configurations are investigated and some technological
applications of these system are pointed out. The theory is extended to
multistream phenomenon and electron beam transport through multimedia junction.
We believe that current study can have major impact on understanding of the
quantum beam-plasma interactions and instabilities and can further elucidate
the mechanisms involving in the collective quantum wave-particle phenomena.

chit-chat to QA, the conversational recommendation can transform from chit-chat
to recommendation, etc. Therefore, classification according to functions may
not be enough to help us appreciate the current development trend. We classify
the DS based on background knowledge. Specifically, study the latest DS based
on the unstructured document(s). We define Document Grounded Dialogue System
(DGDS) as the DS that the dialogues are centering on the given document(s). The
DGDS can be used in scenarios such as talking over merchandise against product
Manual, commenting on news reports, etc. We believe that extracting
unstructured document(s) information is the future trend of the DS because a
great amount of human knowledge lies in these document(s). The research of the
DGDS not only possesses a broad application prospect but also facilitates AI to
better understand human knowledge and natural language. We analyze the
classification, architecture, datasets, models, and future development trends
of the DGDS, hoping to help researchers in this field.

information would be highly useful for attack diagnosis (i.e., forensics) and
mitigation (i.e., intrusion response) if we can reliably construct technique

observed ones. In this paper, we present our statistical machine learning
analysis on APT and Software attack data reported by MITRE ATT&CK to infer the
technique clustering that represents the significant correlation that can be
used for technique prediction. Due to the complex multidimensional
relationships between techniques, many of the traditional clustering methods
could not obtain usable associations. Our approach, using hierarchical
clustering for inferring attack technique associations with 95% confidence,
provides statistically significant and explainable technique correlations. Our
analysis discovers 98 different technique associations (i.e., clusters) for
both APT and Software attacks. Our evaluation results show that 78% of the
techniques associated by our algorithm exhibit significant mutual information
that indicates reasonably high predictability.

We carried out fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The
optimized MD atomic models were used to generate macro-scale models for
3D-printing (PolyLactic Acid (PLA) polymer filaments) through Fused Deposition
Modelling (FDM). Mechanical properties under uniaxial compression were
investigated for both the atomic models and the 3D-printed ones. Mechanical
testings were performed on the 3D-printed schwarzites where the deformation
mechanisms were found to be similar to those observed in MD simulations. These
results are suggestive of a scale-independent mechanical behavior that is
dominated by structural topology. The structures exhibit high specific energy
absorption and crush force efficiency ~0.8, which suggest that the 3D-printed
diamond schwarzites are good candidates as energy-absorbing materials.
