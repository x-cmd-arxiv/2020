Numerous figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Some properties of physical systems can be characterized from their
correlations. In that framework, subsystems are viewed as abstract devices that
receive measurement settings as inputs and produce measurement outcomes as
outputs. The labeling convention used to describe these inputs and outputs does
not affect the physics; and relabelings are easily implemented by rewiring the
input and output ports of the devices. However, a more general class of
operations can be achieved by using correlated preprocessing and postprocessing
of the inputs and outputs. In contrast to relabelings, some of these operations
irreversibly lose information about the underlying device. Other operations are
reversible, but modify the number of cardinality of inputs and/or outputs. In
this work, we single out the set of deterministic local maps as the one
satisfying two equivalent constructions: an operational definition from
causality, and an axiomatic definition reminiscent of the definition of quantum
completely positive trace-preserving maps. We then study the algebraic
properties of that set. Surprisingly, the study of these fundamental properties
has deep and practical applications. First, the invariant subspaces of these
transformations directly decompose the space of correlations/Bell inequalities
into nonsignaling, signaling and normalization components. This impacts the
classification of Bell and causal inequalities, and the construction of
assemblages/witnesses in steering scenarios. Second, the left and right
invertible deterministic local operations provide an operational generalization
of the liftings introduced by Pironio [J. Math. Phys., 46(6):062112 (2005)].
Not only Bell-local, but also causal inequalities can be lifted; liftings also
apply to correlation boxes in a variety of scenarios.

several analytic tools can help to overcome this human reference point. In the
second case study, we highlight the difference between necessary and sufficient
mechanisms in visual reasoning tasks. Thereby, we show that contrary to
previous suggestions, feedback mechanisms might not be necessary for the tasks

another one is to employ the recurrent neural network (RNN) or 1D-CNN on the

propose a novel spatial graph convolution network (SGCN) to effectively

incorporates the local neighbourhood information via spatial graph convolutions
and further learns the global shape properties with a hierarchical residual

He-enhanced giants ($\Delta$$Y=+$0.15$\pm$0.04), the largest such sample found
spectroscopically to date. The average metallicity of $-$0.79$\pm$0.06 dex and

found for the red giant branch (RGB-a) and subgiant branch (SGB-a) populations

He-enhancement in giants is associated with larger $s$-process elemental
abundances, which correlate with Al and anticorrelate with O. These results

categorical numerical values assigned to each event, e.g., like or dislike.
Other use cases include object recognition from data collected by neuromorphic
cameras, which produce, for each pixel, signed bits at the times of
sufficiently large brightness variations. Existing schemes for training
WTA-SNNs are limited to rate-encoding solutions, and are hence able to detect
only spatial patterns. Developing more general training algorithms for
arbitrary WTA-SNNs inherits the challenges of training (binary) Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs). These amount, most notably, to the non-differentiability of
threshold functions, to the recurrent behavior of spiking neural models, and to
the difficulty of implementing backpropagation in neuromorphic hardware. In
this paper, we develop a variational online local training rule for WTA-SNNs,
referred to as VOWEL, that leverages only local pre- and post-synaptic
information for visible circuits, and an additional common reward signal for
hidden circuits. The method is based on probabilistic generalized linear neural
models, control variates, and variational regularization. Experimental results
on real-world neuromorphic datasets with multi-valued events demonstrate the
advantages of WTA-SNNs over conventional binary SNNs trained with

it is known that if $X$ is an orientable manifold, then (unlike $X^n$) $X(n)$

non-manifold. In studying geometry of $X(n)$, a central research question is
""If $X$ has geometric property $P$, does it follow that $X(n)$ also has
property $P$?"". A related question is ""If $X$ and $Y$ have a geometric relation
$R$, does it follow that $X(n)$ and $Y(n)$ also have the relation $R$?"".

to introduce at least two nucleon resonances in the $s$ channel in constructing

the data on spin density matrix elements for $K^*$ meson reported recently by

representing and matching user intents and items in the semantic space, where
finer-grained matching is totally discarded and the ranking of an item cannot
be explained further than just user/item level similarity. In addition, while
some models in existing studies have created dynamic user representations based
on search context, their representations for items are static across all search
sessions. This makes every piece of information about the item always equally
important in representing the item during matching with various user intents.
Aware of the above limitations, we propose a review-based transformer model
(RTM) for personalized product search, which encodes the sequence of query,
user reviews, and item reviews with a transformer architecture. RTM conducts
review-level matching between the user and item, where each review has a
dynamic effect according to the context in the sequence. This makes it possible
to identify useful reviews to explain the scoring. Experimental results show
that RTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalized product search

control systems with small world and information bottleneck (bow-tie) network
structure. Such systems combine hierarchical perception with hierarchical goal
setting and hierarchical action control. We argue that hierarchical Bayesian
control systems produce deep hierarchies of goal states, from which it follows
that organisms must have some form of 'highest goals'. For all organisms, these
involve internal (self) models, external (social) models and overarching
(normative) models. We show that goal hierarchies tend to decompose in a
top-down manner under severe and prolonged levels of stress. This produces
behavior that favors short-term and self-referential goals over long term,
social and/or normative goals. The collapse of goal hierarchies is universally
accompanied by an increase in entropy (disorder) in control systems that can
serve as an early warning sign for tipping points (disease or death of the
organism). In humans, learning goal hierarchies corresponds to personality
development (maturation). The failure of goal hierarchies to mature properly
corresponds to personality deficits. A top-down collapse of such hierarchies
under stress is identified as a common factor in all forms of episodic mental
disorders (psychopathology). The paper concludes by discussing ways of testing
these hypotheses empirically.

novae. AT2016dah is an almost text book example of a 'very fast' declining, yet
uncommon, Fe II'b' (broad-lined) nova, discovered during the rise to peak
optical luminosity, and decaying with a smooth broken power-law light curve.
AT2017fyp is classed as a 'fast' nova, unusually for M31, its early decline
spectrum simultaneously shows properties of both Fe II and He/N spectral types
- a 'hybrid'. Similarly, the light curve of AT2017fyp has a broken power-law
decline but exhibits an extended flat-topped maximum. Both novae were followed
in the UV and X-ray by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, but no X-ray source
was detected for either nova. The pair were followed photometrically and
spectroscopically into their nebular phases. The progenitor systems were not
visible in archival optical data, implying that the mass donors are main
sequence stars. What makes AT2016dah and AT2017fyp particularly interesting is
their position with respect to M31. The pair are close on the sky but are
located far from the centre of M31, lying almost along the semi-minor axis of
their host. Radial velocity measurements and simulations of the M31 nova
population leads to the conclusion that both novae are members of the Andromeda
Giant Stellar Stream (GSS). We find the probability of at least two M31 novae
appearing coincident with the GSS by chance is ~1%. Therefore, we claim that
these novae arose from the GSS progenitor, not M31 - the first confirmed novae
discovered in a tidal steam.

largely reduced when, rather than the half-mass radius Re, the size at a fixed
surface density is used. Here we address why this happens. We show how a
reduction is to be expected because any two galaxies with the same Mstar have
at least one radius with identical surface density, where the galaxies have
identical size. However, the reason why the scatter is reduced to the observed
level is not trivial, and we pin it down to the galaxy surface density profiles
approximately following Sersic profiles with their Re and Sersic index (n)
anti-correlated (i.e., given Mstar, n increases when Re decreases). Our
analytical results describe very well the behavior of the observed galaxies as
portrayed in the NASA Sloan Atlas (NSA), which contains more than half a
million local objects with 7 < log(Mstar/Msun) < 11.5. The comparison with NSA
galaxies also allows us to find the optimal values for the mass surface density
(2.4m0.9p1.3 Msun/pc2) and surface brightness (r-band 24.7pm0.5 mag/arcsec2)
that minimize the scatter, although the actual values depend somehow on the
subset of NSA galaxies used for optimization. The physical reason for the
existence of optimal values is unknown but, as Trujillo+20 point out, they are
close to the gas surface density threshold to form stars and thus may trace the
physical end of a galaxy. Our NSA-based size--mass relation agrees with theirs
on the slope as well as on the magnitude of the scatter. As a by-product of the
narrowness of the size--mass relation (only 0.06 dex), we propose to use the
size of a galaxy to measure its stellar mass. In terms of observing time, it is
not more demanding than the usual photometric techniques and may present
practical advantages in particular cases.

greater variety of signals emitted by compact binary systems, shedding light on
their astrophysical origin and environment. A key physical effect that can
distinguish among formation scenarios is the misalignment of the spins with the
orbital angular momentum, causing the spins and the binary's orbital plane to
precess. To accurately model such systems, it is crucial to include multipoles
beyond the dominant quadrupole. Here, we develop the first multipolar
precessing waveform model in the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism for the
inspiral, merger and ringdown (IMR) of binary black holes: SEOBNRv4PHM. In the
nonprecessing limit, the model reduces to SEOBNRv4HM, which was calibrated to
numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, and waveforms from perturbation theory.
We validate SEOBNRv4PHM by comparing it to the public catalog of 1405
precessing NR waveforms of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)
collaboration, and also to new 118 precessing NR waveforms, which span mass
ratios 1-4 and spins up to 0.9. We stress that SEOBNRv4PHM is not calibrated to
NR simulations in the precessing sector. We compute the unfaithfulness against
the 1523 SXS precessing NR waveforms, and find that, for $94\%$ ($57\%$) of the
cases, the maximum value, in the total mass range $20-200 M_\odot$, is below
$3\%$ ($1\%$). Those numbers become $83\%$ ($20\%$) when using the IMR,
multipolar, precessing phenomenological model IMRPhenomPv3HM. We investigate
the impact of such unfaithfulness values with two parameter-estimation studies
on synthetic signals. We also compute the unfaithfulness between those waveform
models and identify in which part of the parameter space they differ the most.
We validate them also against the multipolar, precessing NR surrogate model

formulated as a graph optimization problem that is solved by a DCNN model
learning process. The cost function to be optimized consists of a unary term
that is calculated by cross entropy measurement and a pairwise term that is
based on enforcing a local label consistency. The proposed method has been
evaluated based on corneal confocal microscopic (CCM) images for nerve fiber
segmentation, where accurate annotations are extremely difficult to be
obtained. Based on both the quantitative result of a synthetic dataset and
qualitative assessment of a real dataset, the proposed method has achieved
superior performance in producing high quality segmentation results even with
inaccurate labels for training.

along the product life cycle has become an increasingly important
access-to-market requirement. However, these security standards rely on
mandatory immunity assumptions such as the integrity and authenticity of an
initial system configuration typically loaded from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM).
This applies especially to FPGA-based Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC)
architectures, since object codes as well as configuration data easily exceed
the capacity of a secure bootROM. In this context, an attacker could try to
alter the content of the NVM device in order to manipulate the system. The PSoC
therefore relies on the integrity of the NVM particularly at boot-time. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for securely booting from an NVM in a
potentially unsecure environment by exploiting the reconfigurable logic of the
FPGA. Here, the FPGA serves as a secure anchor point by performing required
integrity and authenticity verifications prior to the configuration and
execution of any user application loaded from the NVM on the PSoC. The proposed
secure boot process is based on the following assumptions and steps: 1) The
boot configurationis stored on a fully encrypted Secure Digital memory card (SD
card) or alternatively Flash acting as NVM. 2) At boot time, a hardware design
called Trusted Memory-Interface Unit (TMIU) is loaded to verify first the
authenticity of the deployed NVM and then after decryption the integrity of its
content. To demonstrate the practicability of our approach, we integrated the
methodology into the vendor-specific secure boot process of a Xilinx Zynq PSoC
and evaluated the design objectives performance, power and resource costs.

autoregressive process is stationary if and only if the roots of its
characteristic equation lie outside the unit circle, constraining the
autoregressive coefficient matrices to lie in the stationary region. However,
the stationary region has a highly complex geometry which impedes specification
of a prior distribution. In this work, an unconstrained reparameterization of a
stationary vector autoregression is presented. The new parameters are partial
autocorrelation matrices, which are interpretable, and can be transformed
bijectively to the space of unconstrained square matrices through a simple
mapping of their singular values. This transformation preserves various
structural forms of the partial autocorrelation matrices and readily
facilitates specification of a prior. Properties of this prior are described
along with an important special case which is exchangeable with respect to the
order of the elements in the observation vector. Posterior inference and
computation are described and implemented using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via
Stan. The prior and inferential procedures are illustrated with an application
to a macroeconomic time series which highlights the benefits of enforcing
stationarity and encouraging shrinkage towards a sensible parametric structure.

settings where treatment is determined by whether an observed running variable
crosses a pre-specified threshold. While the resulting sampling design is
sometimes described as akin to a locally randomized experiment in a
neighborhood of the threshold, standard formal analyses do not make reference
to probabilistic treatment assignment and instead identify treatment effects
via continuity arguments. Here we propose a new approach to identification,
estimation, and inference in regression discontinuity designs that exploits
measurement error, or other noise, in the running variable. Under an assumption
that the measurement error is exogenous, we show how to estimate causal effects
using a class of linear estimators that weight treated and control units so as
to balance a latent variable of which the running variable is a noisy measure.
We find this approach to facilitate inference for familiar estimands from the
literature, as well as policy-relevant estimands that correspond to the effects
of realistic changes to the existing treatment assignment rule. We demonstrate
the method with a study of retention of HIV patients, and evaluate its
performance using both simulated data and a regression discontinuity design

orders of magnitude compared with that in the normal state, particularly when
its interface superconducting gap matches the magnon spin accumulation. Through
systematic measurements with varying the current density and SC thickness, we
identify that superconducting coherence peaks and exchange spin-splitting of

modest QP charge-imbalance relaxation, are responsible for the giant QP iSHE.
The latter exchange-field-modified QP relaxation is experimentally proved by
spatially resolved measurements with varying the separation of electrical

certain systematic measurement errors with various sources of uncertainties. In
this paper, to reduce the impact of geometrical uncertainties on the

multi-objective shape optimization of a QPR {in terms of an expectation
measure}. Thereby, variations of geometrical parameters are modeled by the
Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion technique. Then, the resulting Maxwell's
eigenvalue problem with random input data is solved using the PC-based
stochastic collocation method (PC-SCM). Furthermore, to assess the contribution
of the particular geometrical parameters, the variance-based sensitivity
analysis is proposed. This allows for modifying the steepest descent algorithm,
which results in reducing the computational load needed to find optimal
solutions. Finally, optimization results in the form of an efficient
approximation of the Pareto front for a three dimensional (3D) model of the QPR

characterize subgroups of the product stabilizer group on a block of logical
qubits corresponding to dual codes of classical error correcting codes. We
prove conditions on the set of correctable error patterns allowing for
unambiguous decoding based on a lookup table. For a large family of classical
algebraic codes, we show that the qubit overhead required for syndrome
extraction from $L$ logical qubits scales as ${\cal O}(\log_2(L+1)),$
asymptotically. The basic construction is adapted to account for two-qubit and
measurement errors, while still employing a lookup table based decoder.
Moreover, we characterize the set of detectable errors and show how classical
algebraic decoders can unambiguously locate logical qubits with errors even in
the presence of syndrome noise. We argue that quantum error correction is more
aptly viewed as source compression in the sense of Shannon, and that Shannon's
source and channel coding theorems provide bounds on the overhead rates of
quantum post-selection tasks, such as quantum error correction, at the level of
the encoded quantum register.

they record the history of events such as mergers, gas inflow and
star-formation. However, the accuracy with which gradients can be measured is
limited by spatial resolution and noise, and hence measurements need to be
corrected for such effects. We use high resolution (~20 pc) simulation of a
face-on Milky Way mass galaxy, coupled with photoionisation models, to produce
a suite of synthetic high resolution integral field spectroscopy (IFS)
datacubes. We then degrade the datacubes, with a range of realistic models for
spatial resolution (2 to 16 beams per galaxy scale length) and noise, to
investigate and quantify how well the input metallicity gradient can be
recovered as a function of resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with the
intention to compare with modern IFS surveys like MaNGA and SAMI. Given
appropriate propagation of uncertainties and pruning of low SNR pixels, we show
that a resolution of 3-4 telescope beams per galaxy scale length is sufficient
to recover the gradient to ~10-20% uncertainty. The uncertainty escalates to
~60% for lower resolution. Inclusion of the low SNR pixels causes the
uncertainty in the inferred gradient to deteriorate. Our results can
potentially inform future IFS surveys regarding the resolution and SNR required
to achieve a desired accuracy in metallicity gradient measurements.

a deep learning approach. Unlike conventional restoration tasks that can be
solved through supervised learning, the degradation in real photos is complex
and the domain gap between synthetic images and real old photos makes the
network fail to generalize. Therefore, we propose a novel triplet domain
translation network by leveraging real photos along with massive synthetic
image pairs. Specifically, we train two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to
respectively transform old photos and clean photos into two latent spaces. And
the translation between these two latent spaces is learned with synthetic
paired data. This translation generalizes well to real photos because the
domain gap is closed in the compact latent space. Besides, to address multiple
degradations mixed in one old photo, we design a global branch with a partial
nonlocal block targeting to the structured defects, such as scratches and dust
spots, and a local branch targeting to the unstructured defects, such as noises
and blurriness. Two branches are fused in the latent space, leading to improved
capability to restore old photos from multiple defects. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality for old photos

stability of topological edge modes in topological 1D systems of spinless
fermions. Using Floquet theory, we show that all the topological phase
transitions can be mapped to their single-frequency counterparts in terms of
effective driving parameters. This drastic simplification can be explained by
considering the gap closures in the quasienergy dispersion. These gap closures
are pinned to high-symmetry points, where all the effective Floquet
Hamiltonians collapse to the same form. While for all protocols all topological
phase transitions coincide, the gap size and the number of edge modes in the
quasienergy spectra vary considerably depending on the chosen driving pattern.
This gives rise to a full range of edge states with different degrees of
localization, from highly localized to completely delocalized. Switching
between different driving protocols then suggests a dynamical control of the
localization and stability of topological edge modes, with possible
applications in quantum computation. We illustrate our findings on three
paradigmatic fermionic systems -- namely the Kitaev chain, the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and the Creutz ladder, and demonstrate how to

(PLATON), a Python package that calculates model transmission spectra for
exoplanets and retrieves atmospheric characteristics based on observed spectra.
We now expand its capabilities to include the ability to compute secondary
eclipse depths. We have also added the option to calculate models using the
correlated-$k$ method for radiative transfer, which improves accuracy without
sacrificing speed. Additionally, we update the opacities in PLATON--many of
which were generated using old or proprietary line lists--using the most recent
and complete public line lists. These opacities are made available at R=1000
and R=10,000 over the 0.3--30 um range, and at R=375,000 in select near IR
bands, making it possible to utilize PLATON for ground-based high resolution
cross correlation studies. To demonstrate PLATON's new capabilities, we perform
a retrieval on published HST and Spitzer transmission and emission spectra of
the archetypal hot Jupiter HD 189733b. This is the first joint transit and
secondary eclipse retrieval for this planet in the literature, as well as the
most comprehensive set of both transit and eclipse data assembled for a
retrieval to date. We find that these high signal-to-noise data are
well-matched by atmosphere models with a C/O ratio of $0.66_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$
and a metallicity of $12_{-5}^{+8}$ times solar where the terminator is
dominated by extended nanometer-sized haze particles at optical wavelengths.
These are among the smallest uncertainties reported to date for an exoplanet,
demonstrating both the power and the limitations of HST and Spitzer exoplanet
observations.

rich dynamics in the presence of codimension-one conformal defects. The new
structure constants of the extended operator algebra consist of one-point
functions of local operators which are nonvanishing due to the defect insertion
and carry nontrivial coupling dependence. We study an important class of
half-BPS superconformal defects engineered by D5 branes that share three common
directions with the D3 branes and involve Nahm pole configurations for the SYM
fields on the D3 brane worldvolume. In the planar large $N$ limit, we obtain
non-perturbative results in the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ for the defect
one-point functions of both BPS and non-BPS operators, building upon recent
progress in localization and integrability methods. For BPS operator insertions
in the SYM with D5-brane type boundary or interface, we derive an effective two
dimensional defect-Yang-Mills (dYM) theory from supersymmetric localization,
which gives an efficient way to extract defect observables and generates a
novel matrix model for the defect one-point function. By solving the matrix
model in the large $N$ limit, we obtain exact results in $\lambda$ which
interpolate between perturbative Feynman diagram contributions in the weak
coupling limit and IIB string theory predictions on $AdS_5\times S^5$ in the
strong coupling regime, providing a precision test of AdS/CFT with interface
defects. For general non-BPS operators, we develop a non-perturbative
bootstrap-type program for integrable boundary states on the worldsheet of the
IIB string theory, corresponding to the interface defects in the planar SYM.
Such integrable boundary states are constrained by a set of general consistency
conditions for which we present explicit solutions that reproduce and extend
the known results at weak coupling from integrable spin-chain methods.

on the halo model and perturbation theory. This model achieves 1\% accuracy on
all $k-$scales between $k=0.02h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to
$k=1h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our key ansatz is that the number density of halos
depends on the non-linear density contrast filtered on some unknown scale $R$.
Using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to evaluate the
two-halo term, we obtain a model for the power spectrum with only two fitting
parameters: $R$ and the effective `sound speed', which encapsulates small-scale
physics. This is tested with two suites of cosmological simulations across a
broad range of cosmologies and found to be highly accurate. Due to its physical
motivation, the statistics can be easily extended beyond the power spectrum; we
additionally derive the one-loop covariance matrices of cluster counts and
their combination with the matter power spectrum. This yields a significantly
better fit to simulations than previous models, and includes a new model for
super-sample effects, which is rigorously tested with separate universe
simulations. At low redshift, we find a significant ($\sim 10\%$) exclusion
covariance from accounting for the finite size of halos which has not
previously been modeled. Such power spectrum and covariance models will enable
joint analysis of upcoming large-scale structure surveys, gravitational lensing
surveys and cosmic microwave background maps on scales down to the non-linear
scale. We provide a publicly released Python code.

requires an accurate determination of the total reservoir of molecular gas
mass. However, despite being the most abundant molecule in the Universe, H$_2$
is challenging to detect through direct observations and indirect methods have
to be used to estimate the total molecular gas reservoir. These are often based
on scaling relations from tracers such as CO or dust, and are generally
calibrated in the Milky Way. Yet, evidence that these scaling relations are
environmentally dependent is growing. In particular, the commonly used
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor (X$_{\rm CO}$) is expected to be higher in
metal-poor and/or strongly UV-irradiated environments. We use new SOFIA/FIFI-LS
observations of far-infrared fine structure lines from the ionised and neutral
gas and the Meudon photodissociation region model to constrain the physical
properties and the structure of the gas in the massive star-forming region of
30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and determine the spatially resolved
distribution of the total reservoir of molecular gas in the proximity of the
young massive cluster R136. We compare this value with the molecular gas mass
inferred from ground-based CO observations and dust-based estimates to quantify
the impact of this extreme environment on commonly used tracers of the

half-solar metallicity of the surrounding gas are responsible for a large
reservoir of ""CO-dark"" molecular gas, leaving a large fraction of the total
H$_2$ gas (> 75%) undetected when adopting a standard X$_{\rm CO}$ factor in

cosmic web: a distribution of matter into sheets and filaments connecting
massive halos. However, observational evidence has been elusive due to the low
surface brightness of the filaments. Recent deep MUSE/VLT data and upcoming
observations offer a promising avenue for Ly$\alpha$ detection, motivating the
development of modern theoretical predictions. We use hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations run with the AREPO code to investigate the potential
detectability of large-scale filaments, excluding contributions from the halos
embedded in them. We focus on filaments connecting massive
($M_{200c}\sim(1-3)\times10^{12} M_\odot$) halos at z=3, and compare different
simulation resolutions, feedback levels, and mock-image pixel sizes. We find
increasing simulation resolution does not substantially improve detectability
notwithstanding the intrinsic enhancement of internal filament structure. By
contrast, for a MUSE integration of 31 hours, including feedback increases the
detectable area by a factor of $\simeq$5.5 on average compared with simulations
without feedback, implying that even the non-bound components of the filaments
have substantial sensitivity to feedback. Degrading the image resolution from
the native MUSE scale of (0.2"")$^2$ per pixel to (5.3"")$^2$ apertures has the
strongest effect, increasing the detectable area by a median factor of
$\simeq$200 and is most effective when the size of the pixel roughly matches
the width of the filament. Finally, we find the majority of Ly$\alpha$ emission
is due to electron impact collisional excitations, as opposed to radiative
recombination.

width of the inclusive non-leptonic decay of a $B$ meson ($B^+$, $B_d$ or
$B_s$), stemming from the quark flavour-changing transition $b \to q_1 \bar q_2
q_3$, where $q_1,q_2 = u, c$ and $q_3 = d, s$. The key ideas of the computation
are the local expansion of the quark propagator in the external gluon field
including terms with covariant derivative of the gluon field strength tensor
and the standard technique of the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE). We confirm the
previously known expressions of the $1/m_b^3$ contributions to the
semi-leptonic decay $b \to q_1 \ell \bar \nu_\ell$, with $\ell = e, \mu, \tau$
and of the $1/m_b^2$ contributions to the non-leptonic modes. We find that this
new term can give a sizeable correction of about $- 4 \, \%$ to the
non-leptonic decay width of a $B$ meson. For $B_d$ and $B_s$ mesons this turns
out to be the dominant correction to the free b-quark decay, while for the
$B^+$ meson the Darwin term gives the second most important correction -
roughly 1/2 to 1/3 of the phase space enhanced Pauli interference contribution.
Due to the tiny experimental uncertainties in lifetime measurements the
incorporation of the Darwin term contribution is crucial for precision tests of
the Standard Model.

of Reionization (redshift $z>6$). However, the dust temperature, $T_d$, remains
unconstrained, and this introduces large uncertainties, particularly in the
dust mass determinations. Using an analytical and physically-motivated model,
we show that dust in high-$z$, star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMC),
largely dominating the observed far-infrared luminosity, is warmer ($T_d > 60\
\mathrm{K}$) than locally. This is due to the more compact GMC structure
induced by the higher gas pressure and turbulence characterizing early
galaxies. The compactness also delays GMC dispersal by stellar feedback, thus
$\sim 40\%$ of the total UV radiation emitted by newly born stars remains
obscured. A higher $T_d$ has additional implications: it (a) reduces the
tension between local and high-$z$ IRX-$\beta$ relation, (b) alleviates the
problem of the uncomfortably large dust masses deduced from observations of
some EoR galaxies.

data-driven model to estimate the cosmic merger rate density (MRD) evolution of

star clusters (hereafter, dynamical CBs) and in the field (hereafter, isolated
CBs). The local MRD of dynamical BBHs is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BBH}=64^{+34}_{-20}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the 90% credible interval from the first

the local MRD of isolated BBHs ($\mathcal{R}_{\rm BBH}=50^{+71}_{-37}$

neutron star binaries is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BHNS}=41^{+33}_{-23}$ and
$49^{+48}_{-34}$~Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Both values are consistent

for all CB classes grows with redshift, reaching its maximum at $z \in
[1.5,2.5]$, and then decreases. This trend springs from the interplay between
cosmic star formation rate, metallicity evolution and delay time of binary
compact objects.

lenticular luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 4418. NGC 4418 stands out among
nearby LIRGs due to its dense central concentration of molecular gas and the
dusty, bi-polar structures along its minor axis suggestive of a wind driven by
a central starburst and possible nuclear activity. We seek to understand the
consequences of the ongoing minor interaction between VV 655 and NGC 4418 for
the evolution of the LIRG, including the origin of the gas supply responsible
for its unusual nuclear properties. We investigate the structural, kinematic,
and chemical properties of VV 655 and NGC 4418 by analyzing archival imaging
data and optical spectroscopic observations from the SDSS-III and new spectra
from SALT-RSS. We characterize their gas-phase metal abundances and spatially
resolved, ionized gas kinematics, and demonstrate that the gas-phase
metallicity in NGC 4418 significantly exceeds that in VV 655. No kinematic
disturbances in the ionized gas are observed along the minor axis of NGC 4418,
but we see evidence for ionized gas outflows from VV 655 that may increase the
cross-section for gas stripping in grazing collisions. A faint, asymmetric
outer arm is detected in NGC 4418 of the type normally associated with
galaxy-galaxy interactions. The simplest model suggests that the minor
interaction between VV 655 and NGC 4418 produced the unusual nuclear properties
of the LIRG via tidal torquing of the interstellar medium of NGC 4418 rather
than through a significant gas transfer event. In addition to inducing a
central concentration of gas in NGC 4418, this interaction also produced an
enhanced star formation rate and an outer tidal arm in the LIRG. The VV 655-NGC
4418 system offers an example of the potential for minor collisions to alter
the evolutionary pathways of giant galaxies.

increasing discovery of galaxies with a low surface brightness, such as Ultra
Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs). The formation mechanism of these systems is still a
much debated question, and so are their kinematical properties. In this work,
we address this topic by analyzing the stellar kinematics of isolated UDGs
formed in the hydrodynamical simulation suite NIHAO. We construct projected
line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion maps to compute the projected
specific angular momentum, $\lambda_{\rm R}$, to characterize the kinematical
support of the stars in these galaxies. We found that UDGs cover a broad
distribution, ranging from dispersion to rotation supported galaxies, with
similar abundances in both regimes. The degree of rotation support of simulated
UDGs correlates with several properties such as galaxy morphology, higher HI
fractions and larger effective radii with respect to the dispersion supported
group, while the dark matter halo spin and mass accretion history are similar
amongst the two populations. We demonstrate that the alignment of the infalling
baryons into the protogalaxy at early $z$ is the principal driver of the $z$=0
stellar kinematic state: pressure supported isolated UDGs form via mis-aligned
gas accretion while rotation supported ones build-up their baryons in an
ordered manner. Accounting for random inclination effects, we predict that a
comprehensive survey will find nearly half of field UDGs to have rotationally
supported stellar disks.

been achieved. Motivated by these results, in this paper we reconsider Kerr
black holes with synchronised Proca hair. The separability of the Proca
equation on the Kerr background allows us to examine the stationary Proca
clouds in greater detail, in particular their dependence on the different
quantum numbers. These stationary clouds occur at a set of existence lines in
the Kerr parameter space, from which the black holes with synchronised Proca
hair bifurcate. We construct the domain of existence of these black holes,
comparing the fundamental states missed in the original study with the first
excited states and with the cousin scalar model, giving illustrative examples
of Kerr-like and non-Kerr-like BHs. In the vanishing event horizon limit, these
hairy black holes connect to the fundamental states of spinning Proca stars,

COSMOS2015 data set. We present a three-step Dirichlet method of resampling a
given survey-based redshift calibration distribution to enable the propagation
of both shot noise and sample variance uncertainties. The method can
accommodate different levels of prior confidence on different redshift sources.
This method can be applied to any calibration sample with known redshifts and
phenotypes (i.e. cells in a self-organizing map, or some other way of
discretizing photometric space), and provides a simple way of propagating prior
redshift uncertainties into cosmological analyses. As a worked example, we
apply the full scheme to the COSMOS2015 data set, for which we also present a
new, principled SOM algorithm designed to handle noisy photometric data. We
make available a catalog of the resulting resamplings of the COSMOS2015
galaxies.

performance in higher education. Using a field experiment of 458 students from
three different subjects in Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain), we study
the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first
group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The
second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is
the group of students that interrupted their face-to-face activities because of
the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect
of the COVID-19 confinement on students performance. This effect is also
significative in activities that did not change their format when performed
after the confinement. We find that this effect is significative both in
subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that
did not change the workload of students. Additionally, an analysis of students
learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study in a
continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement
changed students learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving
their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students assessment are
expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in
their learning performance.

the locations of the non-zero entries of the message vector. In this paper we
generalize the construction and consider modulated SPARCs, where information in
encoded in both the locations and the values of the non-zero entries of the

from a phase-shift keying (PSK) constellation. We propose a computationally
efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder, and obtain analytical

the decoder. Using these bounds we show that PSK-modulated SPARCs are
asymptotically capacity achieving for the complex AWGN channel, with either
spatial coupling or power allocation. We also provide numerical simulation
results to demonstrate the error performance at finite code lengths. These
results show that introducing modulation to the SPARC design can significantly
reduce decoding complexity without sacrificing error performance.

divided between immune and susceptible. We adopt a space-continuous model that
represents pedestrian dynamics by the forces acting on them, i.e. a microscopic
force-based model. Once discretized, the model results in a high-dimensional
system of second order ordinary differential equations. Before adding the
contact tracing to the pedestrian dynamics model, we calibrate the model
parameters, validate the model against empirical data, and show that pedestrian
self-organization into lanes can be captured. We consider an explicit approach
for contact tracing by introducing a sickness domain around a sick person. A
healthy but susceptible person who remains in the sickness domain for a certain
amount of time may get infected (with a prescribed probability) and become a
so-called secondary contact. As a concrete setting to simulate the onset of
disease spreading, we consider terminals in two US airports: Hobby Airport in
Houston and the Atlanta International Airport. We consider different scenarios
and we quantify the increase in average number of secondary contacts increases
as a given terminal becomes more densely populated, the percentage of immune
people decreases, the number of primary contacts increases, and areas of high

with other data sets. We have identified 709 sources over seven observed fields
selecting some of the most prominent millimeter-bright regions between $0\deg <
\ell < 50\deg$ (total area $\approx 7.5 \deg^2$). The majority of these sources
have counterparts at other wavelengths. By applying flux selection criteria to
these sources, we successfully recovered several known hypercompact HII (HCHII)
regions, but did not confirm any new ones. We identify 126 sources that have
mm-wavelength counterparts but do not have cm-wavelength counterparts and are
therefore candidate HCHII regions; of these, 10 are morphologically compact and
are strong candidates for new HCHII regions. Given the limited number of
candidates in the extended area in this survey compared to the relatively large
numbers seen in protoclusters W51 and W49, it appears that most HCHII regions
exist within dense protoclusters. Comparing the counts of HCHII to ultracompact
HII (UCHII) regions, we infer the HCHII region lifetime is 16-46% that of the
UCHII region lifetime. We additionally separated the 3 mm emission into dust
and free-free emission by comparing with archival 870 $\mu$m and 20 cm data. In
the selected pilot fields, most ($\gtrsim80$%) of the 3 mm emission comes from
plasma, either through free-free or synchrotron emission.

entanglement phase transition (EPT) as a function of the measurement rate. This
transition is generally understood in terms of a competition between the
scrambling effects of unitary dynamics and the disentangling effects of
measurements. We find that, surprisingly, EPTs are possible even in the absence
of scrambling unitary dynamics, where they are best understood as arising from
measurements alone. This motivates us to introduce \emph{measurement-only
models}, in which the ""scrambling"" and ""un-scrambling"" effects driving the EPT
are fundamentally intertwined and cannot be attributed to physically distinct
processes. This represents a novel form of an EPT, conceptually distinct from
that in hybrid unitary-projective circuits. We explore the entanglement phase
diagrams, critical points, and quantum code properties of some of these
measurement-only models. We find that the principle driving the EPTs in these
models is \emph{frustration}, or mutual incompatibility, of the measurements.
Suprisingly, an entangling (volume-law) phase is the generic outcome when
measuring sufficiently long but still local ($\gtrsim 3$-body) operators. We
identify a class of exceptions to this behavior (""bipartite ensembles"") which
cannot sustain an entangling phase, but display dual area-law phases, possibly
with different kinds of quantum order, separated by self-dual critical points.
Finally, we introduce a measure of information spreading in dynamics with

approaches in the literature apply a time transformation, however, which do not
maintain recursive feasibility for piecewise constant control parameterization.
The key idea in this paper is to introduce uniform grids with variable
discretization. A shrinking-horizon grid adaptation scheme ensures convergence
to a specific region around the target state and recursive feasibility. The
size of the region is configurable by design parameters. This facilitates the
systematic dual-mode design for quasi-time-optimal control to restore
asymptotic stability and establish a smooth stabilization. Two nonlinear
program formulations with different sparsity patterns are introduced to realize
and implement the underlying optimal control problem. For a class of numerical
integration schemes, even nominal asymptotic stability and true time-optimality
are achieved without dual-mode. A comparative analysis as well as experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

interface with a pinned contact line. The Reynolds and capillary numbers are
assumed much less than unity, in line with typical micron-scale colloids
involving air- or alkane-aqueous interfaces. For driven colloids, the
leading-order flow is given by the point-force (and/or torque) response of this
system. For active colloids, the force-dipole (stresslet) response occurs at
leading order. At clean (surfactant-free) interfaces, these hydrodynamic modes
are essentially a restricted set of the usual Stokes multipoles in a bulk
fluid. To leading order, driven colloids exert Stokeslets parallel to the
interface, while active colloids drive differently oriented stresslets
depending on the colloid's orientation. We then consider how these modes are
altered by the presence of an incompressible interface, a typical circumstance
for colloidal systems at small capillary numbers in the presence of surfactant.
The leading-order modes for driven and active colloids are restructured
dramatically. For driven colloids, interfacial incompressibility substantially
weakens the far-field flow normal to the interface; the point-force response
drives flow only parallel to the interface. However, Marangoni stresses induce
a new dipolar mode, which lacks an analogue on a clean interface.
Surface-viscous stresses, if present, potentially generate very long-ranged
flow on the interface and the surrounding fluids. Our results have important
implications for colloid assembly and advective mass transport enhancement near
fluid boundaries.

model for multi-messenger astronomy that unifies the thermodynamics of quark
and hadronic degrees of freedom. A Lagrangian approach to the thermodynamic
potential of quark-meson-nucleon (QMN) matter was used. In this approach,
dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking is described by the scalar mean-field
dynamics coupled to quarks and nucleons and their chiral partners, whereby its
restoration occurs in the hadronic phase by parity doubling, as well as in the
quark phase. Quark confinement was achieved by an auxiliary scalar field that
parametrizes a dynamical infrared cutoff in the quark sector, serving as an
ultraviolet cutoff for the nucleonic phase space. The gap equations were solved
for the isospin-symmetric case, as well as for neutron star (NS) conditions. We
also calculated the mass-radius (MR) relation of NSs and their tidal
deformability parameter. The obtained EoS is in accordance with nuclear matter
properties at saturation density and with the flow constraint from heavy ion
collision experiments. For isospin-asymmetric matter, a sequential occurrence
of light quark flavors is obtained, allowing for a mixed phase of
chirally-symmetric nucleonic matter with deconfined down quarks. The MR
relations and TDs for compact stars fulfill the constraints from the latest
astrophysical observations for PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, and the NS
merger GW170817, whereby the tension between the maximum mass and compactness
constraints rather uniquely fixes the model parameters. The model predicts the
existence of stars with a core of chirally restored but purely hadronic
(confined) matter for masses beyond $1.8~M_\odot$. Stars with pure-quark matter
cores are found to be unstable against the gravitational collapse. This
instability is shifted to even higher densities if repulsive interactions
between quarks are included.

convincing evidence for non-$\Lambda$CDM values in any of the redshift bins.
Despite this enlarged parameter space, the sound speed and viscosity are

These results constrain for the first time the level of ""coldness"" required of

recombination to a higher value, while keeping the present day DM abundance
similar to the $\Lambda$CDM value. This shifts the posterior for the present

negative activation values, with skewed positive and negative ranges. Typical
learnable quantization schemes [PACT, LSQ] assume unsigned quantization for
activations and quantize all negative activations to zero which leads to
significant loss in performance. Naively using signed quantization to
accommodate these negative values requires an extra sign bit which is expensive
for low-bit (2-, 3-, 4-bit) quantization. To solve this problem, we propose
LSQ+, a natural extension of LSQ, wherein we introduce a general asymmetric
quantization scheme with trainable scale and offset parameters that can learn
to accommodate the negative activations. Gradient-based learnable quantization
schemes also commonly suffer from high instability or variance in the final
training performance, hence requiring a great deal of hyper-parameter tuning to
reach a satisfactory performance. LSQ+ alleviates this problem by using an
MSE-based initialization scheme for the quantization parameters. We show that
this initialization leads to significantly lower variance in final performance

the operational reliability of power systems. The higher level of uncertainty
that stems from this variability makes it more difficult to determine whether a
given operating condition will be secure or insecure. Data-driven techniques
provide a promising way to identify security rules that can be embedded in
economic dispatch model to keep power system operating states secure. This
paper proposes using a sparse weighted oblique decision tree to learn accurate,
understandable, and embeddable security rules that are linear and can be
extracted as sparse matrices using a recursive algorithm. These matrices can
then be easily embedded as security constraints in power system economic
dispatch calculations using the Big-M method. Tests on several large datasets
with high renewable energy penetration demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. In particular, the sparse weighted oblique decision tree
outperforms the state-of-art weighted oblique decision tree while keeping the
security rules simple. When embedded in the economic dispatch, these rules
significantly increase the percentage of secure states and reduce the average
solution time.

extended model is slower than the original model, but the extended algorithm is
57% more accurate in decisions where the optimal option is more difficult to

fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of both planets. For PDS 70 b, we

studies and inferred the radius of the photosphere to be 2-3~$R_{Jup}$. The SED
of PDS 70 c is less well constrained, with a range of total luminosities
spanning an order of magnitude. With our inferred radii and luminosities, we
used evolutionary models of accreting protoplanets to derive a mass of PDS 70 b

the static case, the order of the equation determining such component can be
reduced twice, giving rise to a second-order differential equation which can be

test a research model hypothesizing why people share unverified COVID-19
information through social media. Our findings suggest a person's trust in
online information and perceived information overload are strong predictors of
unverified information sharing. Furthermore, these factors, along with a

Females were significantly more likely to suffer from cyberchondria, however,

persistent, dedicated forums, create and are in turn driven by underlying
narrative frameworks. In their comments about a novel, readers generally
include only a subset of characters and their relationships, thus offering a
limited perspective on that work. Yet in aggregate, these reviews capture an
underlying narrative framework comprised of different actants (people, places,
things), their roles, and interactions that we label the ""consensus narrative
framework"". We represent this framework in the form of an actant-relationship
story graph. Extracting this graph is a challenging computational problem,
which we pose as a latent graphical model estimation problem. Posts and reviews
are viewed as samples of sub graphs/networks of the hidden narrative framework.
Inspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a
graphical generative Machine Learning (ML) model where nodes represent actants,
and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific
relationships. We develop a pipeline of interlocking automated methods to
extract key actants and their relationships, and apply it to thousands of
reviews and comments posted on Goodreads.com. We manually derive the ground
truth narrative framework from SparkNotes, and then use word embedding tools to
compare relationships in ground truth networks with our extracted networks. We
find that our automated methodology generates highly accurate consensus
narrative frameworks: for our four target novels, with approximately 2900
reviews per novel, we report average coverage/recall of important relationships
of > 80% and an average edge detection rate of >89\%. These extracted narrative
frameworks can generate insight into how people (or classes of people) read and
how they recount what they have read to others.

consumption by comparing Reddit and Facebook. Again, we find support for the

H I clouds which lie $75^{\circ} - 90^{\circ}$ from the Magellanic Clouds.
Through ultraviolet and 21-cm radio spectroscopy, this region, dubbed the
Leading Arm Extension, was found to have chemical and kinematic similarities to
the Leading Arm. Using the Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper, we detect H$\alpha$
emission in four out of seven of our targets. Assuming that this region is
predominantly photoionized, we use a radiation model that incorporates the

operationally they require the solution of a sequence of maximum flow problems
on a (typically implicitly) modified data graph. These cluster improvement
algorithms are powerful, both in theory and in practice, but they have not been
widely adopted for problems such as community detection, local graph
clustering, semi-supervised learning, etc. Possible reasons for this are: the
steep learning curve for these algorithms; the lack of efficient and easy to
use software; and the lack of detailed numerical experiments on real-world data
that demonstrate their usefulness. Our objective here is to address these
issues. To do so, we guide the reader through the whole process of
understanding how to implement and apply these powerful algorithms. We present
a unifying fractional programming optimization framework that permits us to
distill, in a simple way, the crucial components of all these algorithms. It
also makes apparent similarities and differences between related methods.
Viewing these cluster improvement algorithms via a fractional programming

of the mean atomic weight (by a factor of approximately two) also occurs, but
is often overlooked in analytical models for simplicity purposes. In this

engineering, social, biological, and ecological systems. Monitoring the
networked dynamics via the minimum subset of nodes is essential for a variety
of scientific and operational purposes. When there is a lack of a explicit
model and networked signal space, traditional evolution analysis and non-convex
methods are insufficient. An important data-driven state-of-the-art method use
the Koopman operator to generate a linear evolution model for a vector-valued
observable of original state-space. As a result, one can derive a sampling
strategy via the linear evolution property of observable. However, current
polynomial Koopman operators result in a large sampling space due to: (i) the
large size of polynomial based observables ($O(N^2)$, $N$ number of nodes in
network), and (ii) not factoring in the nonlinear dependency between
observables.
  In this work, to achieve linear scaling ($O(N)$) and a small set of sampling
nodes, we propose to combine a novel Log-Koopman operator and nonlinear Graph
Fourier Transform (NL-GFT) scheme. First, the Log-Koopman operator is able to
reduce the size of observables by transforming multiplicative poly-observable
to logarithm summation. Second, a nonlinear GFT concept and sampling theory are
provided to exploit the nonlinear dependence of observables for Koopman
linearized evolution analysis. Combined, the sampling and reconstruction
algorithms are designed and demonstrated on two established application areas.
The results demonstrate that the proposed Log-Koopman NL-GFT scheme can (i)
linearize unknown nonlinear dynamics using $O(N)$ observables, and (ii) achieve
lower number of sampling nodes, compared with the state-of-the art polynomial
Koopman linear evolution analysis.

use system-redundancy in form of page checksums and cross-page parity.
State-of-the-art solutions for maintaining system-redundancy for DAX NVM either
incur a high performance overhead or require specialized hardware. The Vilamb
user-space library maintains system-redundancy with low overhead by delaying
and amortizing the system-redundancy updates over multiple data writes. As a
result, Vilamb provides 3--5x the throughput of the state-of-the-art software
solution at high operation rates. For applications that need system-redundancy
with high performance, and can tolerate some delaying of data redundancy,
Vilamb provides a tunable knob between performance and quicker redundancy. Even
with the delayed coverage, Vilamb increases the mean time to data loss due to
firmware-induced corruptions by up to two orders of magnitude in comparison to
maintaining no system-redundancy.

gaining popularity, it is becoming increasingly important to propose a
community definition that encompasses the multiple features represented by MLNs
and develop algorithms for efficiently computing communities on MLNs.
Currently, communities for MLNs, are based on aggregating the networks into
single graphs using different techniques (type independent, projection-based,
etc.) and applying single graph community detection algorithms, such as Louvain
and Infomap on these graphs. This process results in different types of
information loss (semantics and structure). To the best of our knowledge, in
this paper we propose, for the first time, a definition of community for
heterogeneous MLNs (or HeMLNs) which preserves semantics as well as the
structure. Additionally, our basic definition can be extended to appropriately
match the analysis objectives as needed.
  In this paper, we present a structure and semantics preserving community
definition for HeMLNs that is compatible with and is an extension of the
traditional definition for single graphs. We also present a framework for its
efficient computation using a newly proposed decoupling approach. First, we
define a k-community for connected k layers of a HeMLN. Then we propose a
family of algorithms for its computation using the concept of bipartite graph
pairings. Further, for a broader analysis, we introduce several pairing
algorithms and weight metrics for composing binary HeMLN communities using
participating community characteristics. Essentially, this results in an
extensible family of community computations. We provide extensive experimental
results for showcasing the efficiency and analysis flexibility of the proposed
computation using popular IMDb and DBLP data sets.

upper-bounded by $K_\text{cont}$, we bound the number of affine functions
needed to construct a Continuous Piecewise Affine (CPWA) function that can
approximate the unknown Lipschitz-continuous controller. Second, we utilize the

Lattice (TLL) NN architecture, which was shown to be capable of implementing
any CPWA function just from the knowledge of the number of affine functions
that compromises this CPWA function.

works focus on target re-identification and trajectory association problems to
track the target. However, since camera networks can generate enormous amount
of video data, inefficient schemes for making re-identification or trajectory
association queries can incur prohibitively large computational requirements.
In this paper, we address the problem of intelligent scheduling of
re-identification queries in a multi-camera tracking setting. To this end, we
formulate the target tracking problem in a camera network as an MDP and learn a
reinforcement learning based policy that selects a camera for making a
re-identification query. The proposed approach to camera selection does not
assume the knowledge of the camera network topology but the resulting policy
implicitly learns it. We have also shown that such a policy can be learnt
directly from data. Using the NLPR MCT and the Duke MTMC multi-camera
multi-target tracking benchmarks, we empirically show that the proposed

demonstrated that burn injury induced systemic insulin resistance, resulting
from a significant decrease in insulin-stimulated Rd (33.0 +/- 10.2 vs 68.3 +/-

strategic setting. In this setting, a single supplier allocates
capacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and
arbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act
selfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request. The
supplier charges payment from agents whose requests are satisfied, but incurs a
load-dependent supply cost. The goal is to design an incentive compatible
online mechanism, which determines not only the resource allocation of each
request, but also the payment of each agent, so as to (approximately) maximize
the social welfare (i.e., aggregate valuations minus supply cost). We study
this problem under the framework of competitive analysis. The major
contribution of this paper is the development of a unified approach that
achieves the best-possible competitive ratios for setups with different supply
costs. Specifically, we show that when there is no supply cost or the supply
cost function is linear, our model is essentially a standard 0-1 knapsack
problem, for which our approach achieves logarithmic competitive ratios that
match the state-of-the-art (which is optimal). For the more challenging setup
when the supply cost is strictly-convex, we provide online mechanisms, for the

Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently
spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and
citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States
healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm
the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and
states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social
distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the
curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people
hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given
that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we
model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the
theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates.
With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the
peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how
aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the
capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve
impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time
of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical
evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the
insights from the model.

agents has to persistently visit a finite set of targets. Each of these targets
has an internal state that evolves with linear stochastic dynamics. The agents
can observe these states, and the observation quality is a function of the
distance between the agent and a given target. The goal is then to minimize the
mean squared estimation error of these target states. We approach the problem
from an infinite horizon perspective, where we prove that, under some natural
assumptions, the covariance matrix of each target converges to a limit cycle.
The goal, therefore, becomes to minimize the steady state uncertainty. Assuming
that the trajectory is parameterized, we provide tools for computing the steady
state cost gradient. We show that, in one-dimensional (1D) environments with
bounded control and non-overlapping targets, when an optimal control exists it
can be represented using a finite number of parameters. We also propose an
efficient parameterization of the agent trajectories for multidimensional
settings using Fourier curves. Simulation results show the efficacy of the

its variants have remained until now mostly theoretical as numerical
experiments in simple environments exhibit long burn-in phases before the
learning takes place. In pursuit of practical efficiency, we present UCRL3,
following the lines of UCRL2, but with two key modifications: First, it uses
state-of-the-art time-uniform concentration inequalities to compute confidence
sets on the reward and (component-wise) transition distributions for each
state-action pair. Furthermore, to tighten exploration, it uses an adaptive
computation of the support of each transition distribution, which in turn
enables us to revisit the extended value iteration procedure of UCRL2 to
optimize over distributions with reduced support by disregarding low
probability transitions, while still ensuring near-optimism. We demonstrate,
through numerical experiments in standard environments, that reducing
exploration this way yields a substantial numerical improvement compared to
UCRL2 and its variants. On the theoretical side, these key modifications enable
us to derive a regret bound for UCRL3 improving on UCRL2, that for the first

with the South Fulton Police Department (SFPD), using a predictive data-driven
optimization approach. Due to rapid urban development and population growth,
the existing police beat design done in the 1970s was far from efficient, which
leads to low policing efficiency and long 911 call response time. We balance
the police workload among different city regions, improve operational
efficiency, and reduce 911 call response time by redesigning beat boundaries
for the SFPD. We discretize the city into small geographical atoms, which
correspond to our decision variables; the decision is to map the atoms into
""beats"", the basic unit of the police operation. We first analyze workload and
trend in each atom using the rich dataset, including police incidents reports
and U.S. census data; We then predict future police workload for each atom
using spatial statistical regression models; Lastly, we formulate the optimal
beat design as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) program with continuity and
compactness constraints on the beats' shape. The optimization problem is solved
using simulated annealing due to its large-scale and non-convex nature. The
simulation results suggest that our proposed beat design can reduce workload
variance among beats significantly by over 90\%.

performance on several semi-supervised benchmark datasets. MT maintains a
teacher model's weights as the exponential moving average of a student model's
weights and minimizes the divergence between their probability predictions
under diverse perturbations of the inputs. However, MT is known to suffer from
confirmation bias, that is, reinforcing incorrect teacher model predictions. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective method called Local Clustering
(LC) to mitigate the effect of confirmation bias. In MT, each data point is
considered independent of other points during training; however, data points
are likely to be close to each other in feature space if they share similar
features. Motivated by this, we cluster data points locally by minimizing the
pairwise distance between neighboring data points in feature space. Combined
with a standard classification cross-entropy objective on labeled data points,
the misclassified unlabeled data points are pulled towards high-density regions
of their correct class with the help of their neighbors, thus improving model
performance. We demonstrate on semi-supervised benchmark datasets SVHN and
CIFAR-10 that adding our LC loss to MT yields significant improvements compared
to MT and performance comparable to the state of the art in semi-supervised

learning-based computational pathology approaches either require manual
annotation of gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) in fully-supervised settings
or thousands of WSIs with slide-level labels in a weakly-supervised setting.
Moreover, whole slide level computational pathology methods also suffer from
domain adaptation and interpretability issues. These challenges have prevented
the broad adaptation of computational pathology for clinical and research
purposes. Here we present CLAM - Clustering-constrained attention multiple
instance learning, an easy-to-use, high-throughput, and interpretable WSI-level
processing and learning method that only requires slide-level labels while
being data efficient, adaptable and capable of handling multi-class subtyping
problems. CLAM is a deep-learning-based weakly-supervised method that uses
attention-based learning to automatically identify sub-regions of high
diagnostic value in order to accurately classify the whole slide, while also
utilizing instance-level clustering over the representative regions identified
to constrain and refine the feature space. In three separate analyses, we
demonstrate the data efficiency and adaptability of CLAM and its superior
performance over standard weakly-supervised classification. We demonstrate that
CLAM models are interpretable and can be used to identify well-known and new
morphological features. We further show that models trained using CLAM are
adaptable to independent test cohorts, cell phone microscopy images, and

application-specific properties of the accelerator execution. In particular,
accelerators tend to explicitly manage data movement between on-chip and
off-chip memories. Therefore, the general memory access pattern of an
accelerator can largely be determined for a given application. Exploiting these
characteristics, MGX generates version numbers used in memory encryption and
integrity verification using on-chip accelerator state rather than storing them
in the off-chip memory; it also customizes the granularity of the memory
protection to match the granularity used by the accelerator. To demonstrate the
efficacy of MGX, we present an in-depth study of MGX for DNN and graph
algorithms. Experimental results show that on average, MGX lowers the
performance overhead of memory protection from 28% and 33% to 4% and 5% for DNN

  Learning with Dynamic Graph Convolution","Accepted at AAAI2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The intensity estimation of facial action units (AUs) is challenging due to
subtle changes in the person's facial appearance. Previous approaches mainly
rely on probabilistic models or predefined rules for modeling co-occurrence
relationships among AUs, leading to limited generalization. In contrast, we
present a new learning framework that automatically learns the latent
relationships of AUs via establishing semantic correspondences between feature
maps. In the heatmap regression-based network, feature maps preserve rich
semantic information associated with AU intensities and locations. Moreover,
the AU co-occurring pattern can be reflected by activating a set of feature
channels, where each channel encodes a specific visual pattern of AU. This
motivates us to model the correlation among feature channels, which implicitly
represents the co-occurrence relationship of AU intensity levels. Specifically,
we introduce a semantic correspondence convolution (SCC) module to dynamically
compute the correspondences from deep and low resolution feature maps, and thus
enhancing the discriminability of features. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and the superior performance of our method on two
benchmark datasets.

constraints on identical machines to minimize makespan, in the presence of
communication delays. In this setting, denoted by $\mathsf{P} \mid
\mathsf{prec}, c \mid C_{\mathsf{max}}$, if two dependent jobs are scheduled on
different machines, then at least $c$ units of time must pass between their
executions. Despite its relevance to many applications, this model remains one
of the most poorly understood in scheduling theory. Even for a special case
where an unlimited number of machines is available, the best known
approximation ratio is $2/3 \cdot (c+1)$, whereas Graham's greedy list
scheduling algorithm already gives a $(c+1)$-approximation in that setting. An
outstanding open problem in the top-10 list by Schuurman and Woeginger and its
recent update by Bansal asks whether there exists a constant-factor
approximation algorithm.
  In this work we give a polynomial-time $O(\log c \cdot \log m)$-approximation
algorithm for this problem, where $m$ is the number of machines and $c$ is the
communication delay. Our approach is based on a Sherali-Adams lift of a linear

corrections arising out of gravitational interactions. In this work we have
explicitly demonstrated that there are no such corrections of gravitational
origin to the quadratic divergences in the mass counter terms. This statement
holds true irrespective of the nature of the gravitational interaction, i.e.,
whether gravity is described by general relativity or f(R) theory.
Interestingly, it also turns out that the one loop effective action of
scalar-coupled-gravity system will be well-behaved \emph{if and only if} the
$f(R)$ theory is free from ghosts. In particular, the results derived in the
context of f(R) theory are shown to be in exact agreement with the
corresponding results derived from the equivalent scalar-tensor representation.
Our analysis suggests the tantalizing possibility that the masses of the scalar
fields can be consistently kept smaller than some Ultra Violet (UV) cutoff
scale and is independent of the nature of the gravity theory, which may involve
higher curvature corrections. All these will be true provided the matter fields
and the gravity theory can be embedded consistently into a UV complete theory

categories only contain very few samples, posing great challenges to
conventional machine learning algorithms and even human experts. Inspired by

we propose to apply FSL to skin disease identification to address the extreme
scarcity of training sample problem. However, directly applying FSL to this

largely attributed to the incompatibility between Cross Entropy (CE) and
episode training, which are both commonly used in FSL. Based on a detailed
analysis, we propose the Query-Relative (QR) loss, which proves superior to CE
under episode training and is closely related to recently proposed mutual
information estimation. Moreover, we further strengthen the proposed QR loss
with a novel adaptive hard margin strategy. Comprehensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of the proposed FSL scheme and the possibility to diagnosis

Lawson--Lenz, between \'etale groupoids---which are topological groupoids whose
source map is a local homeomorphisms---and complete pseudogroups---which are
inverse monoids equipped with a particularly nice representation on a

  Our generalisation improves on the existing functorial correspondence in four
ways. Firstly, we enlarge the classes of maps appearing to each side. Secondly,
we generalise on one side from inverse monoids to inverse categories, and on
the other side, from \'etale groupoids to what we call partite \'etale
groupoids. Thirdly, we generalise from \'etale groupoids to source-\'etale
categories, and on the other side, from inverse monoids to restriction monoids.
Fourthly, and most far-reachingly, we generalise from topological \'etale
groupoids to \'etale groupoids internal to any join restriction category C with
local glueings; and on the other side, from complete pseudogroups to ``complete
C-pseudogroups'', i.e., inverse monoids with a nice representation on an object
of C. Taken together, our results yield an equivalence, for a join restriction
category C with local glueings, between join restriction categories with a
well-behaved functor to C, and partite source-\'etale internal categories in C.
In fact, we obtain this by cutting down a larger adjunction between arbitrary
restriction categories over C, and partite internal categories in C.
  Beyond proving this main result, numerous applications are given, which
reconstruct and extend existing correspondences in the literature, and provide
general formulations of completion processes.

algorithms are effective to optimize marketing campaigns which increase user
engagement, and facilitates cross-marketing to related products. By attracting
users with rewards, marketing methods are effective to boost user activity in
the desired products. Rewards incur significant cost that can be off-set by
increase in future revenue. Most methodologies rely on churn predictions to
prevent losing users to make marketing decisions, which cannot capture up-lift
across counterfactual outcomes with business metrics. Other predictive models
are capable of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, but fail to capture
the balance of cost versus benefit. We propose a treatment effect optimization
methodology for user marketing. This algorithm learns from past experiments and
utilizes novel optimization methods to optimize cost efficiency with respect to
user selection. The method optimizes decisions using deep learning optimization
models to treat and reward users, which is effective in producing
cost-effective, impactful marketing campaigns. Our methodology demonstrates
superior algorithmic flexibility with integration with deep learning methods
and dealing with business constraints. The effectiveness of our model surpasses
the quasi-oracle estimation (R-learner) model and causal forests. We also

framework to model a rich space of actions using causal inference. We utilize
deep learning to optimize the desired holistic metric space instead of

cars, scenario-based trainers, exploration robots, and service robots have
brought attention to crucial trust-related challenges associated with the
current generation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. AI systems based on
the connectionist deep learning neural network approach lack capabilities of
explaining their decisions and actions to others, despite their great
successes. Without symbolic interpretation capabilities, they are black boxes,
which renders their decisions or actions opaque, making it difficult to trust
them in safety-critical applications. The recent stance on the explainability
of AI systems has witnessed several approaches on eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI); however, most of the studies have focused on data-driven
XAI systems applied in computational sciences. Studies addressing the
increasingly pervasive goal-driven agents and robots are still missing. This
paper reviews approaches on explainable goal-driven intelligent agents and
robots, focusing on techniques for explaining and communicating agents
perceptual functions (example, senses, and vision) and cognitive reasoning
(example, beliefs, desires, intention, plans, and goals) with humans in the
loop. The review highlights key strategies that emphasize transparency,
understandability, and continual learning for explainability. Finally, the
paper presents requirements for explainability and suggests a roadmap for the
possible realization of effective goal-driven explainable agents and robots.

an observed network. In many applications, especially in the social sciences,
the observed data is the groups formed by individual subjects. In these
applications, the network is itself a parameter of a statistical model. Zhao
and Weko (2019) propose a model-based approach, called the hub model, to infer
implicit networks from grouping behavior. The hub model assumes that each
member of the group is brought together by a member of the group called the
hub. The hub model belongs to the family of Bernoulli mixture models.
Identifiability of parameters is a notoriously difficult problem for Bernoulli
mixture models. This paper proves identifiability of the hub model parameters
and estimation consistency under mild conditions. Furthermore, this paper
generalizes the hub model by introducing a model component that allows hubless
groups in which individual nodes spontaneously appear independent of any other
individual. We refer to this additional component as the null component. The
new model bridges the gap between the hub model and the degenerate case of the
mixture model -- the Bernoulli product. Identifiability and consistency are
also proved for the new model. Numerical studies are provided to demonstrate
the theoretical results.

cryptographic primitives, and weaknesses in protocols using both, can all lead
to exploitable vulnerabilities in software. Manually fixing such issues is
challenging and resource consuming, especially when maintaining legacy software
that contains broken or outdated cryptography, and for which source code may
not be available. While there is existing work on identifying cryptographic
primitives (often in the context of malware analysis), none of this prior work
has focused on replacing such primitives with stronger (or more secure ones)
after they have been identified. This paper explores feasibility of designing
and implementing a toolchain for Augmentation and Legacy-software
Instrumentation of Cryptographic Executables (ALICE). The key features of ALICE
are: (i) automatically detecting and extracting implementations of weak or
broken cryptographic primitives from binaries without requiring source code or
debugging symbols, (ii) identifying the context and scope in which such
primitives are used, and performing program analysis to determine the effects
of replacing such implementations with more secure ones, and (iii) replacing
implementations of weak primitives with those of stronger or more secure ones.
We demonstrate practical feasibility of our approach on cryptographic hash
functions with several popular cryptographic libraries and real-world programs
of various levels of complexity. Our experimental results show that ALICE can
locate and replace insecure hash functions, even in large binaries (we tested
ones of size up to 1.5MB), while preserving existing functionality of the
original binaries, and while incurring minimal execution-time overhead in the
rewritten binaries. We also open source ALICE's code at

(BS) is equipped with a massive number of antennas, we propose a
covariance-based device activity detection and channel estimation strategy in a
massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) aided mMTC system. For this
strategy, a novel approach for the pilot sequence design is first provided,
where the pilot of each device is merely determined by a unique phase
parameter. Then, by estimating the phase parameters of the active pilot
sequences that contribute to the received covariance matrix, an efficient
algorithm is proposed to detect the active devices without the prior
information about the total number of active devices. At last, given the
estimation of active devices, channel estimation is conducted based on the
conventional minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) approach. It is worth noting
that our proposed strategy is able to obtain all the results in closed-forms,
and is thus of much lower complexity compared to the existing strategies that

potential proxy for the star formation rate (SFR) across redshift, but the
exact relationship depends on GRB progenitor models (single versus binary). The
single-progenitor collapsar model accounts for the preference towards
low-metallicity GRB progenitors, but is in apparent tension with some
high-metallicity GRB host galaxy measurements. As a possible solution, we
consider the scenario where high-metallicity GRB hosts harbour low metallicity
regions in which GRB progenitors form. For this, we use the IllustrisTNG
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to investigate the internal metallicity
distribution of GRB hosts, implementing in post-processing different GRB
formation models. Predictions (GRB rate, host metallicities and stellar masses)
are compared to the high-completeness GRB legacy surveys BAT6 and SHOALS and a
sample of high-redshift GRB-DLA metallicities, allowing us to compute their
relative likelihoods. When the internal metallicity distribution of galaxies is
ignored, the best-fitting model requires a metallicity-independent channel, as
previously proposed by Trenti, Perna & Jimenez. However, when the internal
metallicity distribution is considered, a basic metallicity bias model with a
cutoff at $Z_{max}=0.35Z_\odot$ is the best fitting one. Current data are
insufficient to discriminate among more detailed metallicity bias models, such
as weak metallicity dependence of massive binaries vs stronger metallicity bias
of collapsars. An increased sample of objects, and direct measurements of host
stellar masses at redshift $z>2$ would allow to further constrain the origin of
long GRBs.

zones becomes critical to better understand the interactions between social
activities and spatial locations. In this paper, we propose a framework to
discover the real functional zones from the biased and extremely sparse Point
of Interests (POIs). To cope with the bias and sparsity of POIs, the unbiased
inner influences between spatial locations and human activities are introduced
to learn a balanced and dense latent region representation. In addition, a
spatial location based clustering method is also included to enrich the spatial
information for latent region representation and enhance the region
functionality consistency for the fine-grained region segmentation. Moreover,
to properly annotate the various and fine-grained region functionalities, we
estimate the functionality of the regions and rank them by the differences
between the normalized POI distributions to reduce the inconsistency caused by
the fine-grained segmentation. Thus, our whole framework is able to properly
address the biased categories in sparse POI data and explore the true
functional zones with a fine-grained level. To validate the proposed framework,
a case study is evaluated by using very large real-world users GPS and POIs
data from city of Raleigh. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework
can better identify functional zones than the benchmarks, and, therefore,
enhance understanding of urban structures with a finer granularity under
practical conditions.

Recent works propose low-cost and accurate MRV via automatically determining
forest carbon from drone imagery, collected by the landowners. The automation
of MRV, however, opens up the possibility that landowners report untruthful
drone imagery. To be robust against untruthful reporting, we propose
TrueBranch, a metric learning-based algorithm that verifies the truthfulness of
drone imagery from forest conservation projects. TrueBranch aims to detect
untruthfully reported drone imagery by matching it with public satellite

sufficient to reliably detect untruthfully reported imagery. TrueBranch
leverages metric learning to create a feature embedding in which truthfully and

adhesion parameter Adn is constructed to quantify the possibility of occurrence
of sticking, rebound, and breakage events. The collision-induced breakage rate
is then formulated based on the Smoluchowski equation and a breakage fraction.
The breakage fraction, defined as the fraction of collisions that result in
breakage, is then analytically estimated by a convolution of the probability
distribution of collision velocity and a universal transfer function. It is
shown that the breakage rate decreases exponentially as the adhesion parameter
Adn increases for doublets and scales as linear functions of the agglomerate
size, with the slope controlled by Adn. These results allow one to estimate the
breakage rate for early-stage agglomerates of arbitrary size. Moreover, the
role of the flow structure on the collision-induced breakage is also examined.
Violent collisions and breakages are more likely caused by particles ejected
rapidly from strong vortices and happen in straining sheets. Our results extend
the findings of shear-induced fragmentation, forming a more complete picture of

affine versions) with unitary gauge groups. The $A$-type quivers (also known as
linear quivers) and the associated mirror dualities have a particularly simple
realization in terms of a Type IIB system of D3-D5-NS5-branes. In this paper,
we present a systematic field theory prescription for constructing 3d mirror
pairs beyond the $ADE$ quiver gauge theories, starting from a dual pair of
$A$-type quivers with unitary gauge groups. The construction involves a certain
generalization of the $S$ and the $T$ operations, which arise in the context of
the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ action on a 3d CFT with a $U(1)$ 0-form global symmetry.
We implement this construction in terms of two supersymmetric observables --
the round sphere partition function and the superconformal index on $S^2 \times

  Journal",,"10.1016/j.infsof.2020.106294",,"cs.DL cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: When conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), researchers
usually face the challenge of designing a search strategy that appropriately
balances result quality and review effort. Using digital library (or database)
searches or snowballing alone may not be enough to achieve high-quality
results. On the other hand, using both digital library searches and snowballing
together may increase the overall review effort.
  Objective: The goal of this research is to propose and evaluate hybrid search
strategies that selectively combine database searches with snowballing.
  Method: We propose four hybrid search strategies combining database searches
in digital libraries with iterative, parallel, or sequential backward and
forward snowballing. We simulated the strategies over three existing SLRs in SE
that adopted both database searches and snowballing. We compared the outcome of
digital library searches, snowballing, and hybrid strategies using precision,
recall, and F-measure to investigate the performance of each strategy.
  Results: Our results show that, for the analyzed SLRs, combining database
searches from the Scopus digital library with parallel or sequential
snowballing achieved the most appropriate balance of precision and recall.
  Conclusion: We put forward that, depending on the goals of the SLR and the
available resources, using a hybrid search strategy involving a representative
digital library and parallel or sequential snowballing tends to represent an
appropriate alternative to be used when searching for evidence in SLRs.

Unprecedented in the family of the Hall effects, it can survive time-reversal

It is a quantum transport phenomenon that has deep connection with the Berry
curvature. However, a full quantum description is still absent. Here we
construct a quantum theory of the nonlinear Hall effect by using the
diagrammatic technique. Quite different from nonlinear optics, nearly all the
diagrams account for the disorder effects, which play decisive role in the
electronic transport. After including the disorder contributions in terms of
the Feynman diagrams, the total nonlinear Hall conductivity is enhanced but its
sign remains unchanged for the 2D tilted Dirac model, compared to the one with
only the Berry curvature contribution. We discuss the symmetry of the nonlinear
conductivity tensor and predict a pure disorder-induced nonlinear Hall effect

dense full-azimuth sampling. Unfortunately, the costs of acquiring densely
sampled data rapidly become prohibitive and we need to look for ways to
sparsely collect data, e.g. from sparsely distributed ocean bottom nodes, from
which we then derive densely sampled surveys through the method of wavefield
reconstruction. Because of their relatively cheap and simple calculations,
wavefield reconstruction via matrix factorizations has proven to be a viable
and scalable alternative to the more generally used transform-based methods.
While this method is capable of processing all full azimuth data frequency by
frequency slice, its performance degrades at higher frequencies because
monochromatic data at these frequencies is not as well approximated by low-rank
factorizations. We address this problem by proposing a recursive recovery
technique, which involves weighted matrix factorizations where recovered
wavefields at the lower frequencies serve as prior information for the recovery
of the higher frequencies. To limit the adverse effects of potential
overfitting, we propose a limited-subspace recursively weighted matrix
factorization approach where the size of the row and column subspaces to
construct the weight matrices is constrained. We apply our method to data
collected from the Gulf of Suez, and our results show that our limited-subspace

US midterm elections. We first describe the main characteristics of the data
and explore the user attributes including age, region, activity, and more, with
a series of interactive illustrations. Furthermore, an important first step
towards understating of political manipulation via user targeting is to
identify politically related ads, yet manually checking ads is not feasible due
to the scale of social media advertising. Consequently, we address the
challenge of automatically classifying between political and non-political ads,
demonstrating a significant improvement compared to the current text-based
classifier used by ProPublica, and study whether the user targeting attributes
are beneficial for this task. Our evaluation sheds light on questions, such as
how user attributes are being used for political ads targeting and which users
are more prone to be targeted with political ads. Overall, our contribution of

conducting inference on the features of linear models that are adaptively
selected by feature selection methods such as Lasso. The basic idea of SI is to
make inference conditional on the selection event. Unfortunately, the main
limitation of the original SI approach for Lasso is that the inference is
conducted not only conditional on the selected features but also on their signs
-- this leads to loss of power because of over-conditioning. Although this
limitation can be circumvented by considering the union of such selection
events for all possible combinations of signs, this is only feasible when the
number of selected features is sufficiently small. To address this
computational bottleneck, we propose a parametric programming-based method that
can conduct SI without conditioning on signs even when we have thousands of
active features. The main idea is to compute the continuum path of Lasso
solutions in the direction of a test statistic, and identify the subset of the
data space corresponding to the feature selection event by following the
solution path. The proposed parametric programming-based method not only avoids
the aforementioned computational bottleneck but also improves the performance
and practicality of SI for Lasso in various respects. We conduct several
experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
method.

HBV infection behavior. Besides, several kinds of controllers have been
employed to obtain effective solutions from the HBV treatment. In this essay we
consider the nonlinear HBV dynamic model which subjected to both parametric and
non-parametric uncertainties without using any linearization. In previous
control methods three HBV dynamic states should be measured virus safe, and
infected cells. However in most of the biological systems, the amount of virus
is experimentally measured. Accordingly, the necessity to seek a method that
can estimate the amount of required drug by receiving the virus data emerges.
An ANFIS method is developed in this work to provide an intelligent controller
for the drug dosage based on the number of viruses together with an estimator
for the amount of infected and uninfected cells. This controller is trained
first using the data provided from a previous adaptive control strategy. After
that to improve the closed-loop system capabilities two unmeasured state
variables of fundamental dynamics are estimated through the training phase of

thickness fluctuations are chaotic everywhere in space, with the fluctuation

with re st mass $m_{X}$=17 MeV can mediate the nucleon-nucleon interaction at
the low-energy regime of QCD, in particular in the weakly bound cluster state
p+$^{7}$Li,$^{3}$H. We present a possible equations of state of symmetric
nuclear matter corresponding to the vector meson mass $m_{v}$=17 MeV, obtained
using relativistic mean field theory of nuclear force, QHD-I in particular,
with physically relevant incompessibility K$_{0}$=240-260 MeV and the values of
couplings $g_{v}$, $g_{s}$ lower than unity. Based on concepts of chiral
symmetry breaking, we show that reduction of the rest mass of pseudoscalar
particle from physical value $m_{\pi}$=135 MeV to $m_{X}$=17 MeV is equivalent
to reduction of the quark mass from dynamical value around 310 MeV down to
current quark mass around 5 MeV ($\frac{m_{X}^2} {m_{q,curr}} \simeq
\frac{m_{\pi}^2} {m_{q,dyn}}$). Corresponding version of Goldberger-Treiman
relation leads to the value of coupling close to the results from relativistic
mean field theory of nuclear force. Both model approaches thus point towards
apparent restoration of chiral symmetry in nucleon-nucleon interaction at large
distances, possibly via bounce into false instanton vacuum. Observation of
boson with rest mass $m_{X}$=17 MeV in the decay of high lying excited states
of $^{8}$Be and $^{4}$He can possibly resolve one of the longest lasting open
questions in nuclear physics.

the power scaling law analysis. First, with linear minimum mean square error
estimation, we theoretically characterize the relationship between channel
estimation performance and impairment level, number of reflecting elements, and
pilot power. After that, we analyze the power scaling law and reveal that if
the base station (BS) has perfect channel state information, the transmit power
of user can be made inversely proportional to the number of BS antennas and the
square of the number of reflecting elements with no reduction in performance;
If the BS has imperfectly estimated channel state information, to achieve the

generation, however, there are two long-standing problems: information
under-representation and posterior collapse. The former arises from the fact
that only the last hidden state from the encoder is transformed to the latent

the imbalanced scale between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence in
the objective function. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose the
discrete variational attention model with categorical distribution over the

combined with an auto-regressive prior to capture the sequential dependency
from observations, which can enhance the latent space for language generation.
Moreover, thanks to the property of discreteness, the training of our proposed
approach does not suffer from posterior collapse. Furthermore, we carefully
analyze the superiority of discrete latent space over the continuous space with
the common Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on language generation
demonstrate superior advantages of our proposed approach in comparison with the

measurement as an instantaneous collapse. In reality however, no physical
process can occur over a truly infinitesimal time interval. A more subtle
investigation of open quantum systems lead to the theory of continuous
measurement and quantum trajectories, in which wave function collapse occurs
over a finite time scale associated with an interaction. Within this formalism,
it becomes possible to ask many new questions that would be trivial or even
ill-defined in the context of the more basic measurement model. In this thesis,
we investigate both theoretically and experimentally what fundamentally new
capabilities arise when an experimental apparatus can resolve the continuous
dynamics of a measurement. Theoretically, we show that when one can perform
feedback operations on the timescale of the measurement process, the resulting
tools provide significantly more control over entanglement generation, and in
some settings can generate it optimally. We derive these results using a novel
formalism which encompasses most known quantum feedback protocols.
Experimentally, we show that continuous measurement allows one to observe the
dynamics of a system undergoing simultaneous non-commuting measurements, which
provides a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Finally,
we combine the theoretical focus on quantum feedback with the experimental
capabilities of superconducting circuits to implement a feedback controlled
quantum amplifier. The resulting system is capable of adaptive measurement,
which we use to perform the first canonical phase measurement.

twinning the preceding one to minimise the relevant energy contributions
locally. This naturally explains the occurrence of different types of twin

which are all obtained by on-board sensors. We develop distributed cooperative
extended state observers for followers to estimate the acceleration differences
between adjacent vehicles. Based on estimates of the acceleration differences,
distributed cooperative control laws are designed. By using the stability
theory of perturbed linear systems, we show that the control parameters can be
properly designed to ensure the closed-loop and L2 string stabilities for any
given positive time headway. We further show that the proposed control law
based on the ideal vehicle model can guarantee the closed-loop and L2 string
stabilities even if there are small model parameter uncertainties. Also,
simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed control law
against sensing noises, input delays and parameter uncertainties.

the weak solution theory of gas mixtures with their corresponding equations of

showed the possibility to stabilise the hyperbolic component by means of the
Bresch-Desjardins technique and a regularisation of pressure preventing vacuum.
The result by Dreyer, Druet, Gajewski and Guhlke avoids ex machina

uniformly positive on certain subspaces leads, in the dilute limit, to infinite
diffusion velocities which are not compatible with the Maxwell-Stefan form of

overcome this problem, we propose a novel model-free framework for dynamic

  A central open problem in this area concerns subadditive combinatorial
auctions. Here $n$ agents with subadditive valuation functions compete for the
assignment of $m$ items. The goal is to find an allocation of the items that
maximizes the total value of the assignment. The question is whether there
exists a prophet inequality for this problem that significantly beats the best
known approximation factor of $O(\log m)$.
  We make major progress on this question by providing an $O(\log \log m)$
prophet inequality. Our proof goes through a novel primal-dual approach. It is
also constructive, resulting in an online policy that takes the form of static
and anonymous item prices that can be computed in polynomial time given
appropriate query access to the valuations. As an application of our approach,
we construct a simple and incentive compatible mechanism based on posted prices
that achieves an $O(\log \log m)$ approximation to the optimal revenue for
subadditive valuations under an item-independence assumption.

it is challenging to clearly visualize such small nuclei under standard

segmentation is not feasible. Recent advances in 7 Tesla (T) MRI technology and
great potential of deep neural networks facilitate automatic patient-specific

segmentation of deep cerebellar dentate and interposed nuclei on 7T diffusion
MRI. DCN-Net effectively encodes contextual information on the patch images
without consecutive pooling operations and adding complexity via proposed
dilated dense blocks. During the end-to-end training, label probabilities of
dentate and interposed nuclei are independently learned with a hybrid loss,
handling highly imbalanced data. Finally, we utilize self-training strategies
to cope with the problem of limited labeled data. To this end, auxiliary
dentate and interposed nuclei labels are created on unlabeled data by using
DCN-Net trained on manual labels. We validate the proposed framework using 7T
B0 MRIs from 60 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that DCN-Net
provides better segmentation than atlas-based deep cerebellar nuclei
segmentation tools and other state-of-the-art deep neural networks in terms of
accuracy and consistency. We further prove the effectiveness of the proposed

excitations when starting from a state with a finite excitation density. That
is, how hopping can change the state of a lower polariton condensate by
creating upper polaritons, optically inactive excitonic dark states, or by
exciting vibrational sidebands. While the matrix elements for these processes
can be large, for typical materials at room temperature, such excitations are
suppressed by thermal factors, and ground state processes dominate. We thus
study how the ground state hopping rate depends on condensate density,
matter-light coupling, and cavity photon detuning. All these factors change the
vibrational configuration associated with the optically active molecules, which
can enhance or suppress hopping by increasing or decreasing the vibrational
overlap with the state of a charged molecule. We show that hopping rates can be
exponentially sensitive to detuning and condensate density, allowing an
increase or decrease of hopping rate by two orders of magnitude.

DEMs commonly contain no-data gaps (voids), which makes the map less reliable.
To resolve the issue, this paper provides a deep-learning-based framework for
the probabilistic reconstruction of no-data gaps in NAC DEMs. The framework is
built upon a state of the art stochastic process model, attentive neural
processes (ANP), and predicts the conditional distribution of elevation on the
target coordinates (latitude and longitude) conditioned on the observed
elevation data in nearby regions. Furthermore, this paper proposes sparse
attentive neural processes (SANPs) that not only reduces the linear
computational complexity of the ANP O(N) to the constant complexity O(K) but
enhance the reconstruction performance by preventing overfitting and
over-smoothing problems. The proposed method is evaluated on the Apollo 17

discretization is refined and (iii) when the frequency increases along with the
discretization density. While satisfactory remedies to the problems arising in
regimes (i) and (ii), respectively based on Helmholtz decompositions and
Calder\'on-like techniques have been presented, the last regime is still
challenging. In fact, this last regime is plagued by both spurious resonances
and ill-conditioning, the former can be tackled via combined field strategies
and is not the topic of this work. In this contribution new symmetric scalar
and vectorial electric type formulations that remain well-conditioned in all of
the aforementioned regimes and that do not require barycentric discretization
of the dense electromagnetic potential operators are presented along with a
spherical harmonics analysis illustrating their key properties.

cross-entropy loss sometimes assisted with auxiliary loss functions like center

facilitate better discrimination between the different classes of interest.
However, recent studies hint at the fact that these loss functions do not take
into account the intrinsic angular distribution exhibited by the low-level and
high-level feature representations. This results in less compactness between
samples from the same class and unclear boundary separations between data
clusters of different classes. In this paper, we address this issue by
proposing the use of geometric constraints, rooted in Riemannian geometry.
Specifically, we propose Angular Margin Contrastive Loss (AMC-Loss), a new loss
function to be used along with the traditional cross-entropy loss. The AMC-Loss
employs the discriminative angular distance metric that is equivalent to
geodesic distance on a hypersphere manifold such that it can serve a clear
geometric interpretation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMC-Loss by
providing quantitative and qualitative results. We find that although the
proposed geometrically constrained loss-function improves quantitative results

method, the LiDAR point cloud data is first transformed into the intensity map,
which is used as the reference image. Then, we employ the Fast operator to
extract uniformly distributed interest points in the aerial image by a
partition strategy and perform a local geometric correction by using the
collinearity equation to eliminate scale and rotation difference between
images. Subsequently, a robust structural feature descriptor is build based on
dense gradient features, and the 3D phase correlation is used to detect control
points (CPs) between aerial images and LiDAR data in the frequency domain,
where the image matching is accelerated by the 3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
Finally, the obtained CPs are employed to correct the exterior orientation
elements, which is used to achieve co-registration of aerial images and LiDAR
data. Experiments with two datasets of aerial images and LiDAR data show that
the proposed method is much faster and more robust than state of the art

phase transitions arising in the steady state of transverse-field Ising models

condition these transitions separate a phase with nonvanishing magnetization
along the ordering direction from a symmetric phase upon increasing the
transverse field. We consider two paradigmatic cases, a one-dimensional
long-range model with power-law interactions $\propto 1/r^{\alpha}$ decaying
algebraically as a function of distance $r$ and a two-dimensional system with
short-range nearest-neighbour interactions. In the former case we identify
dynamical phase transitions for $\alpha \lesssim 2$ and we extract the critical
exponents from a data collapse of the steady state magnetization for up to 1200
lattice sites. We find identical exponents for $\alpha \lesssim 0.5$,
suggesting that the dynamical transitions in this regime fall into the same
universality class as the nonergodic mean-field limit. The two-dimensional
Ising model is believed to be thermalizing, which we also confirm using exact
diagonalization for small system sizes. Thus, the dynamical transition is
expected to correspond to the thermal phase transition, which is consistent
with our data upon comparing to equilibrium quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. We
further test the accuracy of the discrete truncated Wigner approximation by
comparing against numerically exact methods such as exact diagonalization,
tensor network as well as artificial neural network states and we find good
quantitative agreement on the accessible time scales. Finally, our work

force when the constraint of the current cosmological constant is satisfied.
The interaction potential energy density between the scalar field and matter
has a symmetry-breaking form with two potential wells. The cosmological
constant is proven to be a value of the scalar-field's self-interaction
potential energy density at the minimum of an effective
matter-density-dependent potential energy density. The effective potential is a
sum of the interaction potential and the self-interaction potential of the
scalar field. The scalar field can stably sit at the minimum and then the
time-dependent cosmological `constant' behaves like a constant. The observed
cosmic acceleration can be accounted for the scalar field. The scalar field is
also extrapolated to account for inflation at the inflationary era of the
Universe. In this era matter fluid is relativistic and then the interaction
potential wells vanish. The unconfined quintessence therefore dominates the
evolution of the Universe. It is concluded that `Planck 2018 results' favour
the closed space of the Universe. The reasons are not only the measured value
of the current Hubble constant, but also the observed feature of a concave
potential in the framework of single-field inflationary models. By invoking a
pseudo-potential in the inflationary era, the concave feature can be attributed
to the pseudo-potential although the self-interaction potential is a convex
function. The pseudo-potential is defined by a sum of the self-interaction
potential and the energy density scale of the curvature of the Universe. It is
that the positive curvature leads to the concave feature of the
pseudo-potential.

communication and computation costs are highly dependent on the volume of NN
models, reducing the volume without decreasing model performance can reduce
these costs. The proposed pre-training method leverages unlabeled data, which

proposed method is evaluated using an image classification task. The results
show that the proposed method requires 35\% less traffic and computation time

field S0 galaxy, NGC 3115, out to $\sim6.5$ half-light radii ($R_\mathrm{e}$)
from its stars (integrated starlight), globular clusters (GCs) and planetary
nebulae (PNe). We find evidence of three kinematic regions with an inner
transition at $\sim0.2\ R_\mathrm{e}$ from a dispersion-dominated bulge
($V_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma <1$) to a fast-rotating disk ($V_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma
>1$), and then an additional transition from the disk to a slowly rotating
spheroid at $\sim2-2.5\, R_\mathrm{e}$, as traced by the red GCs and PNe (and
possibly by the blue GCs beyond $\sim5\, R_\mathrm{e}$). From comparison with
simulations, we propose an assembly history in which the original progenitor
spiral galaxy undergoes a gas-rich minor merger that results in the embedded
kinematically cold disk that we see today in NGC 3115. At a later stage, dwarf
galaxies, in mini mergers (mass-ratio $<$ 1:10), were accreted building-up the
outer slowly rotating spheroid, with the central disk kinematics largely
unaltered. Additionally, we report new spectroscopic observations of a sample
of ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) around NGC 3115 with the Keck/KCWI instrument.
We find that five UCDs are inconsistent with the general rotation field of the
GCs, suggesting an \textit{ex-situ} origin for these objects, i.e. perhaps the
remnants of tidally stripped dwarfs. A further seven UCDs follow the GC
rotation pattern, suggesting an \textit{in-situ} origin and, possibly a GC-like
nature.

  Inverse Optimization",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper focuses on the day-ahead forecasting of the aggregate power of a
pool of smart buildings equipped with thermostatically-controlled loads. We
first propose the modeling of the aggregate behavior of its power trajectory by
using a geometric approach. Specifically, we assume that the aggregate power is
a homothet of a prototype building, whose physical and technical parameters are
chosen to be the mean of those in the pool. This allows us to preserve the
building thermal dynamics of the pool. We then apply inverse optimization to
estimate the homothetic parameters with bilevel programming. The lower level
characterizes the price-response of the ensemble by a set of marginal utility
curves and a homothet of the prototype building, which, in turn, are inferred
in the upper-level problem. The upper level minimizes the mean absolute error
over a training sample. This bilevel program is transformed into a regularized
nonlinear problem that is initialized with the solution given by an efficient
heuristic procedure. This heuristic consists in solving two linear programs and
its solution is deemed a suitable proxy for the original bilevel problem. The
results have been compared to state-of-the-art methodologies.

  Training Method for Extremely Imbalanced Data Sets","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning is widely used in many applications, where a
binary classifier is trained on the datasets consisting of only positive and
unlabeled samples. In this paper, we improve PU learning over state-of-the-art
from two aspects. Firstly, existing model evaluation methods for PU learning
requires ground truth of unlabeled samples, which is unlikely to be obtained in
practice. In order to release this restriction, we propose an asymptotic
unbiased practical AUL (area under the lift) estimation method, which makes use
of raw PU data without prior knowledge of unlabeled samples.
  Secondly, we propose ProbTagging, a new training method for extremely
imbalanced data sets, where the number of unlabeled samples is hundreds or
thousands of times that of positive samples. ProbTagging introduces probability
into the aggregation method. Specifically, each unlabeled sample is tagged
positive or negative with the probability calculated based on the similarity to
its positive neighbors. Based on this, multiple data sets are generated to
train different models, which are then combined into an ensemble model.
Compared to state-of-the-art work, the experimental results show that
ProbTagging can increase the AUC by up to 10%, based on three industrial and
two artificial PU data sets.

signs of compositeness. One such state is a pseudo-scalar boson resulting from
the breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry common to most composite setups, and whose
hints are expected to be visible through low-mass resonance searches at present

effects dominantly impact the production cross section and considerably modify
the decay pattern. Moreover, we make a case for targeted low-mass analyses at
future lepton colliders, with an emphasis on high-luminosity machines aiming to
operate at low centre-of-mass energies. We present a simplified outline of a

improve the robustness of motion averaging against outliers. According to the
half-quadratic technique, the correntropy measure based optimization problem
can be solved by the alternating minimization procedure, which includes
operations of weight assignment and weighted motion averaging. Further, we
design a selection strategy of adaptive kernel width to take advantage of
correntropy. Experimental results on benchmark data sets illustrate that the

disk-integrated spectra from the HARPS-N solar telescope. We divide
high-activity spectral echelle orders by low-activity master templates (as
defined using both log R'HK and images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory,
SDO), creating ""relative spectra"". With resolved images of the surface of the
Sun (via SDO), the faculae and spot filling factors can be calculated, giving a

pseudo-emission (and pseudo-absorption) features in the relative spectra that
are similar to those reported in our previous work on alpha Cen B. In alpha Cen
B, the features are shown to correlate better to changes in faculae filling
factor than spot filling factor. In this work we more confidently identify
changes in faculae coverage of the visible hemisphere of the Sun as the source
of features produced in the relative spectra. Finally, we produce trailed
spectra to observe the RV component of the features, which show that the

algorithm independently addresses the RR estimation and apnea detection tasks.
Respiratory information is extracted from multiple sources and fed into an RR

respiratory activity estimation. We evaluated the system retrospectively using
data from 30 healthy adults who performed diverse controlled breathing tasks
while lying supine in a dark room and reproduced central and obstructive apneic

improved the root mean square error (RMSE) accuracy of the RR estimation from

numerical instabilities and severe ill-conditioning at low frequencies. While
this drawback has been the object of numerous solution attempts in the standard
low-frequency breakdown regime for scattering problems, the eddy-current regime
requires a specific treatment. In this contribution, we present an extension of
the recently introduced quasi-Helmholtz projectors based preconditioning of the
PMCHWT to obtain an equation stable at low frequencies and specifically in
three regimes relevant for eddy currents analyses: (i) when the frequency
decreases with a constant conductivity, (ii) when the conductivity increases at
fixed frequency and (iii) when the frequency decreases while keeping the
product of the frequency and the conductivity constant. Being based on
quasi-Helmholtz projectors our new strategy does not further degrade the
conditioning of the original equation and is compatible with existing fast
solvers. The resulting full-wave formulation is capable of smoothly
transitioning from simulations at high frequencies to the different
low-frequency regimes which encompass, in particular, eddy currents
applications. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of our approach in all
the regimes with a special emphasis given to eddy currents.

indicating that the dominant source of the SOTs in the Pt/CoO$_x$/Co film is
the spin-orbit coupling at the Pt/CoO$_x$ interface. In contrast to the
Pt/CoO$_x$/Co film, the SOTs in the Pt/PyO$_x$/Py film are dominated by the

the Pt/Py film suppresses the DL-SOT and reverses the sign of the FL-SOT. The
change of the SOTs can be attributed to the change of the real and imaginary

effective way to manipulate the strength and sign of the SOTs.

  predicts survival in paediatric brain tumours",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background Brain tumours represent the highest cause of mortality in the
paediatric oncological population. Diagnosis is commonly performed with
magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Survival biomarkers are
challenging to identify due to the relatively low numbers of individual tumour
types, especially for rare tumour types such as atypical rhabdoid tumours.
  Methods 69 children with biopsy-confirmed brain tumours were recruited into
this study. All participants had both perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging
performed at diagnosis. Data were processed using conventional methods, and a
Bayesian survival analysis performed. Unsupervised and supervised machine
learning were performed with the survival features, to determine novel
sub-groups related to survival. Sub-group analysis was undertaken to understand
differences in imaging features, which pertain to survival.
  Findings Survival analysis showed that a combination of diffusion and
perfusion imaging were able to determine two novel sub-groups of brain tumours
with different survival characteristics (p <0.01), which were subsequently
classified with high accuracy (98%) by a neural network. Further analysis of
high-grade tumours showed a marked difference in survival (p=0.029) between the
two clusters with high risk and low risk imaging features.
  Interpretation This study has developed a novel model of survival for
paediatric brain tumours, with an implementation ready for integration into
clinical practice. Results show that tumour perfusion plays a key role in
determining survival in brain tumours and should be considered as a high
priority for future imaging protocols.

deformation of the matrix assuming that the fractures are open and filled by
the fluids, as well as small deformations and a linear elastic constitutive
law. The model is discretized using the gradient discretization method [26],
which covers a large class of conforming and non conforming schemes. This

that energy shifts, radiative lifetimes, and emission patterns of excitons and
biexcitons in such rings can be tailored via the orientation of the individual
dipoles. Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring
dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from
superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular
momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport
fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest
that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the
emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative
lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size,
which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9
and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC). The
field distribution in the most superradiant state in a full LHC multi-ring

the interaction free energy between parallel planes. It is typically derived by
considering the direct interaction between the bodies involved, thus treating
the effect of an intervening solvent implicitly by a rescaling of the
corresponding Hamaker constant. Here, we provide a generalization of DA to the
case of a molecular medium between the bodies, as is the case in most
applications. The derivation is based on an explicit statistical-mechanical
treatment of the contribution to the interaction force from a molecular solvent
using a general expression for intermolecular and molecule-surface
interactions. Starting from an exact expression for the force, DA is arrived at
by a series of well-defined approximations. Our results show that DA remains
valid in a molecular solvent as long as (i) the surface-molecule interactions
are of much shorter range than the radius R of the sphere and (ii) the density
correlation length in the solvent is smaller than R. We then extend our
analysis to the case where a phase transition occurs between the surfaces,
which cannot easily be covered using a statistical-mechanical formalism due to
the discontinuous change in the density of the medium. Instead using a
continuum thermodynamic description, we show that this phase transformation
induces an attractive force between the bodies, and that the force between
curved surfaces can be related to the free energy in the corresponding planar
case, in accordance with DA.

adjacent to a turbulent, buoyancy-affected shear flow, in order to improve our
understanding of topography generation by phase changes in the environment. We
use the phase-field method to dynamically couple the heat equation for the
solid with the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid. We investigate the
evolution of an initially-flat and horizontal solid boundary overlying a
pressure-driven turbulent flow. We assume a linear equation of state for the
fluid and change the sign of the thermal expansion coefficient, such that the
background density stratification is either stable, neutral or unstable. We
find that channels aligned with the direction of the mean flow are generated
spontaneously by phase changes at the fluid-solid interface. Streamwise
vortices in the fluid, the interface topography and the temperature field in
the solid influence each other and adjust until a statistical steady state is
obtained. The crest-to-trough amplitude of the channels are larger than about
10$\delta_{\nu}$ in all cases, with $\delta_{\nu}$ the viscous length scale,
but are much larger and more persistent for an unstable stratification than for
a neutral or stable stratification. This happens because a stable
stratification makes the cool melt fluid buoyant such that it shields the
channel from further melting, whereas an unstable stratification makes the cool
melt fluid sink, inducing further melting by rising hot plumes. The statistics
of flow velocities and melt rates are investigated, and we find that channels
and keels emerging in our simulations do not significantly change the mean drag
coefficient.

electromagnetic field, $eB \approx 10^{18}\, Gauss$, that induces a splitting
of the directed flow, $v_1=\left\langle p_x/p_T \right\rangle $, of charged
particles and anti-particles. Such a splitting for charmed meson manifests even
for neutral particle/anti-particles pairs ($D^0, \overline{D}^0$), hence being
also a unique probe of the formation of the quark-gluon plasma phase. For the
first time here we show that electromagnetic field may generate a $v_1(D^0) -
v_1( \overline{D}^0)$ as huge as the one recently observed at LHC against early
expectations.
  Within this new research topic we point out a novel measurement: $v_1$ of
leptons from $Z^0$ decay and its correlation to that of $D$ and $B$ mesons. The
correlation for $\Delta v_1$ of $l^{+} - l^{-}$, $D^0-\overline{D}^0$ and
$B^0-\overline{B}^0$ would provide a strong probe of the electromagnetic origin
of the splitting and hence of the formation of a quark-gluon plasma phase with
heavy quarks as degrees of freedom. The case of the $v_1({l^{\pm}})$ presents
features due to the peculiar form of the $p_T$ spectrum never appreciated
before in the study of heavy ion collisions. We specifically predict a sudden
change of the $\Delta v_1(p_T)$ of leptons at $p_T=45$ GeV$/c$, that can be
traced back to a universal relation of $\Delta v_1$ with the slope of the $p_T$

all maximal induced subgraphs of $G$ that belong to a certain hereditary graph
class. While its optimization version, known as the minimum vertex deletion
problem in literature, has been intensively studied, enumeration algorithms are
known for a few simple graph classes, e.g., independent sets, cliques, and
forests, until very recently [Conte and Uno, STOC 2019]. There is also a
connected variation of this problem, where one is concerned with only those
induced subgraphs that are connected. We introduce two new approaches, which
enable us to develop algorithms that solve both variations for a number of
important graph classes. A general technique that has been proved very powerful
in enumeration algorithms is to build a solution map, i.e., a multiple digraph
on all the solutions of the problem, and the key of this approach is to make
the solution map strongly connected, so that a simple traversal of the solution
map solves the problem. We introduce retaliation-free paths to certificate
strong connectedness of the solution map we build. Generalizing the idea of
Cohen, Kimelfeld, and Sagiv [JCSS 2008], we introduce the $t$-restricted
version, $t$ being a positive integer, of the maximal (connected) induced
subgraphs problem, and show that it is equivalent to the original problem in
terms of solvability in incremental polynomial time. Moreover, we give
reductions between the two variations, so that it suffices to solve one of the

discrepancy is a measure of how well the empirical distribution of any design
matches its target distribution. This chapter addresses the question of whether
a variable transformation of a low discrepancy uniform design yields a low
discrepancy design for the desired target distribution. The answer depends on
the two kernel functions used to define the respective discrepancies. If these
kernels satisfy certain conditions, then the answer is yes. However, these
conditions may be undesirable for practical reasons. In such a case, the
transformation of a low discrepancy uniform design may yield a design with a
large discrepancy. We illustrate how this may occur. We also suggest some
remedies. One remedy is to ensure that the original uniform design has optimal
one-dimensional projection, but this remedy works best if the design is dense,
or in other words, the ratio of sample size divided by the dimension of the
random variable is relatively large. Another remedy is to use the transformed
design as the input to a coordinate-exchange algorithm that optimizes the
desired discrepancy, and this works for both dense or sparse designs. The
effectiveness of these two remedies is illustrated via simulation.

C-band 64-Gbit/s intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM/DD) optical
on-off keying (OOK) system over a 100-km dispersion-uncompensated link. The
proposed ACMD can adaptively compensate most of the link distortions based on
channel and noise characteristics, which includes a polynomial nonlinear
equalizer (PNLE), a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and maximum likelihood
sequence estimation (MLSE). Based on the channel characteristics, PNLE
eliminates the linear and nonlinear distortions, while the followed DFE
compensates the spectral nulls caused by chromatic dispersion. Finally, based
on the noise characteristics, a post filter can whiten the noise for
implementing optimal signal detection using MLSE. To the best of our knowledge,
we present a record C-band 64-Gbit/s IM/DD optical OOK system over a 100 km
dispersion-uncompensated link achieving 7\% hard-decision forward error

instability. Here we report experiments of the dissolution of inclined
rectangular blocks made of salt, caramel or plaster in aqueous solutions of
various concentrations. The solute flows along the block while forming plumes
before they detach and sink. This flow along the block organizes the emission
of plumes within longitudinal parallel stripes with a well-defined millimeter
scale wavelength. The instability of the flow reflects on the concentration
field in the boundary layer, which engraves longitudinal grooves onto the
block. These grooves interact with the flow and turn into a paving of 3
dimensional cup like patterns that grow in size and propagate upstream. These
bedforms are reminiscent of the scallop bedforms observed on the walls of cave
or icebergs. Whereas the block interface is highly dynamical and evolves
through time, it remains flat on the global scale and recedes at a stationary
rate. We derive scaling laws for the receding velocity and the pattern genesis
at the inclined interface that is based on a concentration boundary layer of
constant thickness, which is controlled by the flow instability, but where the

thereby the instants at which emails reach recipients (it is assumed email is
received instantaneously from the send time). However, they do not control the
duration it takes for recipients to open emails, labeled as time-to-open.
Importantly, among emails that are opened, most occur within a short window
from their send times. We posit that emails are likely to be opened sooner when
send times are convenient for recipients, while for other send times, emails
can get ignored. Thus, to compute appropriate send times it is important to
predict times-to-open accurately. We propose a recurrent neural network (RNN)
in a survival model framework to predict times-to-open, for each recipient.
Using that we compute appropriate send times. We experiment on a data set of
emails sent to a million customers over five months. The sequence of emails
received by a person from a sender is a result of interactions with past emails
from the sender, and hence contain useful signal that inform our model. This
sequential dependence affords our proposed RNN-Survival (RNN-S) approach to
outperform survival analysis approaches in predicting times-to-open. We show
that best times to send emails can be computed accurately from predicted
times-to-open. This approach allows a firm to tune send times of emails, which
is in its control, to favorably influence open rates and engagement.

Specifically, we wish to compute $M\geq 2$ sums
$s_m=\sum_{k\in\mathcal{D}m}x_k$ over a shared complex-valued MAC at once with
minimal mean-squared error ($\mathsf{MSE}$). Finding appropriate Tx-Rx scaling
factors balance between a low error in the computation of $s_n$ and the
interference induced by it in the computation of other sums $s_m$, $m\neq n$.
In this paper, we are interested in designing an optimal Tx-Rx scaling policy
that minimizes the mean-squared error $\max_{m\in[1:M]}\mathsf{MSE}_m$ subject
to a Tx power constraint with maximum power $P$. We show that an optimal design
of the Tx-Rx scaling policy $\left(\bar{\mathbf{a}},\bar{\mathbf{b}}\right)$
involves optimizing (a) their phases and (b) their absolute values in order to
(i) decompose the computation of $M$ sums into, respectively, $M_R$ and $M_I$
($M=M_R+M_I$) calculations over real and imaginary part of the Rx signal and
(ii) to minimize the computation over each part -- real and imaginary --
individually. The primary focus of this paper is on (b). We derive conditions
(i) on the feasibility of the optimization problem and (ii) on the Tx-Rx
scaling policy of a local minimum for $M_w=2$ computations over the real

chain for $M_w=2$ show that the level of interference in terms of $\Delta
D=|\mathcal{D}_2|-|\mathcal{D}_1|$ plays an important role on the ergodic
worst-case $\mathsf{MSE}$. At very high $\mathsf{SNR}$, typically only the
sensor with the weakest channel transmits with full power while all remaining
sensors transmit with less to limit the interference. Interestingly, we observe
that due to residual interference, the ergodic worst-case $\mathsf{MSE}$ is not
vanishing; rather, it converges to $\frac{|\mathcal{D}_1||\mathcal{D}_2|}{K}$
as $\mathsf{SNR}\rightarrow\infty$.

nanometric light confinement and waveguiding, and their optical properties are
mostly interpreted in terms of surface plasmon polaritons. Although classic
electromagnetic theory accurately describes their behavior, it often lacks
physical insight, letting some fundamental aspects of light interaction with
these structures unexplored. In this work, we elaborate a quantum mechanical
description of the MIM cavity as a double barrier quantum well. We identify the
square of the imaginary part of the refractive index of the metal as the
optical potential, and find that MIM cavity resonances are suppressed if the
ratio n/\k{appa} exceeds a certain limit, which shows that low n and high
\k{appa} are desired for strong and sharp cavity resonances. Interestingly, the
spectral regions of cavity mode suppression correspond to the interband
transitions of the metals, where the optical processes are intrinsically
non-Hermitian. The quantum treatment allows to describe the tunnel effect for
photons, and reveals that the MIM cavity resonances can be excited by resonant
tunneling via illumination through the metal, without the need of momentum
matching techniques such as prisms or grating couplers. By combining this
analysis with spectroscopic ellipsometry on experimental MIM structures, and by
developing a simple harmonic oscillator model of the MIM for the calculation of
its effective permittivity, we show that the cavity eigenmodes coincide with
low-loss zeros of the effective permittivity.

is challenging because surveillance of COVID-19 has been limited, with tests
generally being prioritized for high-risk or hospitalized cases according to

mobility across U.S. counties with at least 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 led
to reductions in fever incidences, as captured by smart thermometers, after a

saturation and decay of data is comprehensibly modelled by incorporating
lockdown time controlled R0, having a normal error function like behaviour
decaying to zero in some time frame of {\tau}2 . The recovery mean life time
{\tau}1 dictates the peak and decay. The results predicted for coming days are
interesting and optimistic. The introduced time constants based on experimental

applications. Here we study the hybridization of ENZ resonances in MIMIM
nanocavities, obtaining a very large mode splitting reaching 0.477 eV, Q
factors of the order of 40 in the visible spectral range, and fine control on
the resonance wavelength and mode linewidth by tuning the thickness of the
dielectric and metallic layers. A semi-classical approach that analyses the
MIMIM structure as a double quantum well system allows to derive the exact
analytical dispersion relation of the ENZ resonances, achieving perfect
agreement with numerical simulations and experiments. Interestingly, the
asymmetry of the mode splitting in a symmetric MIMIM cavity is not reflected in
the classical model of coupled oscillators, which can be directly related to
quantum mechanical tunneling for the coupling of the two cavities. Interpreting
the cavity resonances as resonant tunneling modes elucidates that can be
excited without momentum matching techniques. The broad tunability of
high-quality ENZ resonances together with their strong coupling efficiency
makes such MIMIM cavities an ideal platform for exploring light-matter
interaction, for example, by integration of quantum emitters in the dielectric
layers.

field gradients parallel to the field, affecting the electron heating

plasma chamber walls and to provide an estimate of the ion density profile at
the extraction slit then used in ion optical simulations demonstrating high

intended to study if the quadrupole field topology could produce high charge

transport them through a low energy beamline, thus paving the way for a
superconducting ARC-ECRIS using the same field topology. Furthermore, the
prospects of the presented ion source design as an injector of a single-ended

Here, we design metasurfaces based on aperiodic arrays of plasmonic Au
nanostructures for tailoring the optical near-field in the visible and
near-infrared spectral range. The basic element of the arrays is a rhomboid

illumination. Finite element method simulations reveal that the near-field
modulation occurs via a combination of the plasmonic resonances of the
rhomboids and field enhancement in the nanoscale gaps in between the elements.
This approach enables optical elements that can switch the near-field
distribution across the metasurface via wavelength and polarization of the
incident far-field light, and provides pathways for light matter interaction in

this unnecessary data movement by using the shared internal bus in the DRAM
chip to directly copy data within the DRAM chip (e.g., between two DRAM banks).
While these methods exhibit superior performance compared to conventional
techniques, data copy across different DRAM banks is still greatly slower than
data copy within the same DRAM bank. Hence, these techniques have limited
benefit for the emerging 3D-stacked memories (e.g., HMC and HBM) that contain
hundreds of DRAM banks across multiple memory controllers. In this paper, we
present Network-on-Memory (NoM), a lightweight inter-bank data communication

done by the memory controller. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, NoM
enables both fast data copy between multiple DRAM banks and concurrent data

$D_1(J_l=\frac{3}{2})$, which is not consistent with the current experimental
data. In this work, a simple scheme is proposed to fix this problem, where we
suppose the strong eigenstates $D_1^{(\prime)}$ do not coincide with the
eigenstate of the weak interaction, since no experimental results show the weak

framework of this tentative scheme, meson $B$ first weakly decays to the weak
eigenstate $D_{\alpha(\beta)}$ and then the latter are detected as the

To leverage the correlations between these two extraction tasks, a confidence

Rydberg atoms lies in the fact that the excitation of one atom to a Rydberg
state blocks the excitation of other atoms due to the shift in the collective
energy levels of interacting Rydberg atoms. It is used to obtain the entangled
qubit states based on single neutral atoms in optical traps. In this paper, we
present our experimental results on the observation of the dipole blockade for
mesoscopic ensembles of 1-5 atoms when they are detected by the selective field

Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap. We have found that for mesoscopic
ensembles this method allows only a partial dipole blockage to be observed.
This is most likely related to the presence of parasitic electric fields
reducing the interaction energy of Rydberg atoms, the decrease in the
probability of detecting high states, and the strong angular dependence of the
interaction energy of Rydberg atoms in a single interaction volume.

increased the retention rate distribution of all recordings from 0.46 to 0.90

computationally efficient. Therefore, CIF could contribute to a more robust RR

annihilation (sTTA) is considered as the most promising upwards
wavelength-shifting technique to enhance the light harvesting capability of
solar devices by recovering the low-energy tail of the solar spectrum.
Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) with conjugated organic ligands have been
proposed as broadband sensitizers for extending the light-harvesting capability
of sTTA-UC molecular absorbers. Key to their functioning is efficient energy
transfer (ET) from the NC to the triplet state of the ligands that sensitizes
the triplet state of free emitters, whose annihilation generates the
upconverted emission. To date, the triplet sensitization efficiency in such
systems is limited by parasitic processes, such as charge transfer (typically
of the photohole) to the organic ligand due to the disadvantageous band
alignment of typical NCs and organic moieties. Available strategies only
partially mitigate such losses and intrinsically limit the ET yield. Here we
demonstrate a new exciton-manipulation approach that enables loss-free ET
without detrimental side-effects. Specifically, we use CdSe NCs doped with gold
atoms featuring a hole-accepting state in the NC bandgap at a higher energy
than the HOMO level of the ligand 9-anthracene acid. Upon photoexcitation, the
NC photoholes are routed to the Au-state faster than their transfer to the
ligand, producing a long-lived bound exciton in perfect resonance with its
triplet state. This hinders hole-transfer losses and results in ~100% efficient
ET, over 50-fold higher than in standard NCs. By combining our hybrid
sensitizers with an annihilator moiety, we achieved an sTTA-UC efficiency of
~12% (~24% in the normalized definition), which is the highest value for hybrid
upconverters based on sTTA reported to date and approaches optimized organic
systems.

in the 4DEGB gravity and obtain the explicit cosmological evolution equations
of the theories. Our result shows that, for one symmetry choice, there is a
correspondence between the 4DEGB gravity and the special Horndeski gravity.
However, for the other symmetry choice, there is no correspondence between the
two theories. Therefore, the 4DEGB gravity is not equivalent to the special
Horndeski gravity for the general case.

the existence of a constant value for $B_\perp$ at the umbra-penumbra boundary
from ground-based data in the near-infrared wavelengths and to determine its
value for GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) data. This is the first
statistical study on the Jurcak criterion with ground-based data, and we
compare it with the results from Hinode and HMI data. Eleven
spectropolarimetric data sets from the GRIS slit-spectograph containing stable
sunspots were selected from the GRIS archive (sdc.leibniz-kis.de). SIR
inversions including a polarimetric straylight correction are used to produce
maps of the magnetic field vector using the Fe 1564.8 and 1566.2 nm lines.
Averages of $B_\perp$ along umbra-penumbra boundaries are analyzed for the 11
data sets. Geometric differences between contours at the resulting
$B_\perp^{\rm const}$ value and contours in intensity, $\Delta P$, are
calculated. Averaged over the 11 sunspots, we find a value of
$B_\perp=1787\pm100$ gauss. Contours at $B_\perp=B_\perp^{\rm const}$ and
contours calculated in intensity maps match from a visual inspection and the
geometric distance $\Delta P$ was found to be on the order of 2 pixels.
Furthermore, the standard deviation between different data sets of averages
along umbra--penumbra contours is smaller for $B_\perp$ than for $B_\parallel$
by a factor of 2.4. Our results provide further support to the Jurcak criterion
with the existence of an invariable value $B_\perp^{\rm const}$ at the
umbra--penumbra boundary. We also found that the geometric difference, $\Delta
P$, between intensity contours and contours at $B_\perp=B_\perp^{\rm const}$
acts as an index of stability for sunspots.

purposes. Those sensors are more expensive than visual (RGB) sensors, and
usually produce images with lower resolution. To this end, Cross-Modality
Super-Resolution methods were introduced, where an RGB image of a
high-resolution assists in increasing the resolution of the low-resolution
modality. However, fusing images from different modalities is not a trivial
task; the output must be artifact-free and remain loyal to the characteristics
of the target modality. Moreover, the input images are never perfectly aligned,
which results in further artifacts during the fusion process.
  We present CMSR, a deep network for Cross-Modality Super-Resolution, which
unlike previous methods, is designed to deal with weakly aligned images. The
network is trained on the two input images only, learns their internal
statistics and correlations, and applies them to up-sample the target modality.
CMSR contains an internal transformer that is trained on-the-fly together with
the up-sampling process itself, without explicit supervision. We show that CMSR
succeeds to increase the resolution of the input image, gaining valuable
information from its RGB counterpart, yet in a conservative way, without
introducing artifacts or irrelevant details.

a news recommender system, which span one and a half months and involve over
1,200 users. In our first study we explore how our news recommender steers
reading behavior in the context of editorial values such as serendipity,
dynamism, diversity, and coverage. Next, we present an intervention study where
we extend our news recommender to steer our readers to more dynamic reading
behavior. We find that (i) our recommender system yields more diverse reading
behavior and yields a higher coverage of articles compared to non-personalized
editorial rankings, and (ii) we can successfully incorporate dynamism in our
recommender system as a re-ranking method, effectively steering our readers to
more dynamic articles without hurting our recommender system's accuracy.

Current successful attack methods for texts usually adopt heuristic replacement

this paper, we propose \textbf{BERT-Attack}, a high-quality and effective

  To help with the Gaia selection function we provide all-sky magnitude limit

compare GeDR3mock to GDR2, which emphasises the importance of adding
observational noise to the mock data. Since the underlying truth, e.g. stellar
parameters, is know in GeDR3mock, it can be used to construct priors as well as
mock data tests for parameter estimation.

recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for structured data

However, 3D shape data are irregular since each node's neighbors are unordered.
Various graph neural networks for 3D shapes have been developed with isotropic
filters or predefined local coordinate systems to overcome the node
inconsistency on graphs. However, isotropic filters or predefined local
coordinate systems limit the representation power. In this paper, we propose a
local structure-aware anisotropic convolutional operation (LSA-Conv) that
learns adaptive weighting matrices for each node according to the local
neighboring structure and performs shared anisotropic filters. In fact, the
learnable weighting matrix is similar to the attention matrix in the random

the amplitude during the late inspiral, merger and ringdown to account for the
NS tidal disruption. We calibrate the amplitude corrections using NSBH
waveforms obtained with the SpEC and the SACRA codes. The model was calibrated
using simulations with NS masses in the range $1.2-1.4 M_\odot$, tidal
deformabilities up to $4200$ (for a 1.2 $M_\odot$ NS), and dimensionless BH
spin magnitude up to 0.9. Based on the simulations used, and on checking that
sensible waveforms are produced, we recommend our model to be employed with NS
mass in the range $1\mbox{--}3 M_\odot$, tidal deformability $0\mbox{--}5000$,
and BH spin magnitude up to $0.9$. We also validate our model against two new,
highly accurate NSBH waveforms with BH spin 0.9 and mass ratios 3 and 4,
characterized by tidal disruption, produced with SpEC, and find very good
agreement. We find that it will be challenging for the advanced
LIGO-Virgo--detector network at design sensitivity to distinguish different
source classes. We perform parameter-estimation on a synthetic
numerical-relativity signal in zero noise to study parameter biases. Finally,
we reanalyze GW170817, with the hypothesis that it is a NSBH. We do not find
evidence to distinguish the BNS and NSBH hypotheses, however the posterior for
the mass ratio is shifted to less equal masses under the NSBH hypothesis.

physical activity and sedentary behavior) and action planning for sedentary

mobility pattern visualization on users' action planning for changing their
sedentary behavior. The secondary aim is to evaluate user engagement with the
visualization and user experience of the app. In a 3-week user study,
participants were allocated to either an active control group (n=8) or an
intervention group (n=8). In the 1-week baseline period, none of the
participants had access to the functions in the app. In the following 2-week
intervention period, only the intervention group was given access to the

visualizations in SedVis had no effect on the participants' action planning

visualizations and action planning in SedVis had a positive effect on reducing
participants' sedentary hours, with weak evidence according to Bayesian
statistics, whereas no change in sedentary time was more likely in the active
control condition. Furthermore, Bayesian analysis weakly suggested that the
more frequently the users checked the app, the more likely they were to reduce
their sedentary behavior.

Adaptive Interaction Fusion Networks (AIFN) to fulfill cross-interaction fusion

adaptively similar semantics and conflicting semantics between posts and

asymmetric field-enhancement produced by a bow-tie antenna resonating at 3 THz.
This produces a strong photo-thermoelectric conversion, which simultaneously
leads to a combination of high sensitivity (NEP $\leq$ 160 $pWHz^{-1/2}$), fast

making our devices the fastest, broadband, low noise, room temperature THz PD

synthetic-to-real domain shift by exploiting the inter-modal relation between
the RGB and depth image. Our method consists of training a convolutional neural
network to solve, in addition to the main recognition task, the pretext task of
predicting the relative rotation between the RGB and depth image. To evaluate
our method and encourage further research in this area, we define two benchmark
datasets for object categorization and instance recognition. With extensive

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is a challenging problem due to
the large number of the channel coefficients to be estimated, which requires
unaffordable and prohibitive pilot overhead. In this paper, firstly we conduct
the analysis about the common sparsity of the basis expansion model (BEM)
coefficients among all the BEM orders and all the transmit-receive antenna
pairs. Then a novel pilot pattern is proposed, which inserts the guard pilots
to deal with the inter carrier interference (ICI) under the superimposed pilot
pattern. Moreover, by exploiting the common sparsity of the BEM coefficients
among different BEM orders and different antennas, we propose a block
distributed compressive sensing (BDCS) based DS channel estimator for the
large-scale MIMO systems. Its structured sparsity leads to the reduction of the
pilot overhead under the premise of guaranteeing the accuracy of the
estimation. Furthermore, taking consideration of the block structure, a pilot
design algorithm referred to as block discrete stochastic optimization (BDSO)
is proposed. It optimizes the pilot positions by reducing the coherence among
different blocks of the measurement matrix. Besides, a linear smoothing method
is extended to large-scale MIMO systems to improve the accuracy of the

generalizes function-free Horn rules by allowing existentially quantified

significant interest in the context of ontology-mediated query answering.
Forward chaining, also known as the chase, is a fundamental tool for computing
universal models of knowledge bases, which consist of existential rules and
facts. Several chase variants have been defined, which differ on the way they
handle redundancies. A set of existential rules is bounded if it ensures the
existence of a bound on the depth of the chase, independently from any set of
facts. Deciding if a set of rules is bounded is an undecidable problem for all
chase variants. Nevertheless, when computing universal models, knowing that a
set of rules is bounded for some chase variant does not help much in practice
if the bound remains unknown or even very large. Hence, we investigate the
decidability of the k-boundedness problem, which asks whether the depth of the
chase for a given set of rules is bounded by an integer k. We identify a
general property which, when satisfied by a chase variant, leads to the
decidability of k-boundedness. We then show that the main chase variants
satisfy this property, namely the oblivious, semi-oblivious (aka Skolem), and
restricted chase, as well as their breadth-first versions. This paper is under

non-thermal radiative model for the wind-collision region. We establish a
conservative upper limit for the fraction of the wind kinetic power that is
converted into relativistic electron acceleration, $f_\mathrm{NT,e} < 0.02$. In
addition, we set a lower limit for the magnetic field in the wind-collision

  HPC:The Global Virtual Time Case",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  High-performance computing on shared-memory/multi-core architectures could
suffer from non-negligible performance bottlenecks due to coordination
algorithms, which are nevertheless necessary to ensure the overall correctness
and/or to support the execution of housekeeping operations, e.g. to recover
computing resources (e.g., memory). Although more complex in
design/development, a paradigm switch from classical coordination algorithms to
wait-free ones could significantly boost the performance of HPC applications.
  In this paper we explore the relevance of this paradigm shift in
shared-memory architectures, by focusing on the context of Parallel Discrete
Event Simulation, where the Global Virtual Time (GVT) represents a fundamental
coordination algorithm. It allows to compute the lower bound on the value of
the logical time passed through by all the entities participating in a
parallel/distributed computation. Hence it can be used to discriminate what
events belong to the past history of the computation---thus being considered as
committed---and allowing for memory recovery (e.g. of obsolete logs that were
taken in order to support state recoverability) and non-revokable operations
(e.g. I/O).
  We compare the reference (blocking) algorithm for shared memory, the one
proposed by by Fujimoto and Hybinette \cite{Fuj97}, with an innovative
wait-free implementation, emphasizing on what design choices must be made to
enforce this paradigm shift, and what are the performance implications of
removing critical sections in coordination algorithms.

simple and scalable to large knowledge graphs. Experimental results on multiple

involves nonlinear coupling across different temporal and spatial scales. There
is growing evidence that impulsive events, such as magnetic reconnection
instabilities, lead to a spatially localized enhancement of energy dissipation,
thus speeding up the energy transfer at small scales. Capturing such a diverse
dynamics is challenging. Here, we employ the Multidimensional Iterative
Filtering (MIF) method, a novel technique for the analysis of nonstationary
multidimensional signals. Unlike other traditional methods (e.g., based on
Fourier or wavelet decomposition), MIF does not require any previous assumption
on the functional form of the signal to be identified. Using MIF, we carry out
a multiscale analysis of Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (HMHD) and hybrid
particle-in-cell (HPIC) numerical simulations of decaying plasma turbulence.
The results assess the ability of MIF to spatially identify and separate the
different scales (the MHD inertial range, the sub-ion kinetic, and the
dissipation scales) of the plasma dynamics. Furthermore, MIF decomposition
allows to detect localized current structures and to characterize their
contribution to the statistical and spectral properties of turbulence. Overall,
MIF arises as a very promising technique for the study of turbulent plasma
environments.

dark matter (DM) that interacts with the standard model particles only by
exchanging the Higgs boson. There are two DM-Higgs couplings, namely
CP-conserving and CP-violating couplings. If the mass of the DM is slightly
below half of the Higgs boson mass, then the couplings are suppressed to obtain
the measured value of the DM energy density by the freeze-out mechanism. In
addition, the scattering processes of DM off particles in the thermal bath are
suppressed by the small momentum transfer if the CP-violating DM-Higgs coupling
is larger than the CP-conserving one. Due to the suppression, the temperature
of the DM can differ from the temperature of the thermal bath. By solving
coupled equations for the number density and temperature of the DM, we
calculate the DM-Higgs couplings that reproduce the right amount of the DM
relic abundance. We find that the couplings have to be larger than the one
obtained without taking into account the difference in the temperatures. A
consequence of the enhancement of the DM-Higgs couplings is the enhancement of
the Higgs invisible decay branching ratio. The enhancement is testable at
current and future collider experiments.

every layer of the system, be it hardware or software. A detailed understanding
of the underlying hardware, and especially the processor, is crucial to
optimize software. One key criterion for the performance of a processor is its
ability to exploit instruction-level parallelism. This ability is determined by
the port mapping of the processor, which describes the execution units of the
processor for each instruction.
  Processor manufacturers usually do not share the port mappings of their
microarchitectures. While approaches to automatically infer port mappings from
experiments exist, they are based on processor-specific hardware performance
counters that are not available on every platform.
  We present PMEvo, a framework to automatically infer port mappings solely
based on the measurement of the execution time of short instruction sequences.
PMEvo uses an evolutionary algorithm that evaluates the fitness of candidate
mappings with an analytical throughput model formulated as a linear program.
Our prototype implementation infers a port mapping for Intel's Skylake
architecture that predicts measured instruction throughput with an accuracy
that is competitive to existing work. Furthermore, it finds port mappings for
AMD's Zen+ architecture and the ARM Cortex-A72 architecture, which are out of

different relations, are critical for distant supervised relation extraction.
Existing approaches model this property by greedily learning local
dependencies. However, they are essentially limited by failing to capture the
global topology structure of relation ties. As a result, they may easily fall
into a locally optimal solution. To solve this problem, in this paper, we
propose a novel force-directed graph based relation extraction model to
comprehensively learn relation ties. Specifically, we first build a graph
according to the global co-occurrence of relations. Then, we borrow the idea of
Coulomb's Law from physics and introduce the concept of attractive force and
repulsive force to this graph to learn correlation and mutual exclusion between
relations. Finally, the obtained relation representations are applied as an
inter-dependent relation classifier. Experimental results on a large scale
benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model is capable of modeling global
relation ties and significantly outperforms other baselines. Furthermore, the
proposed force-directed graph can be used as a module to augment existing
relation extraction systems and improve their performance.

dependencies among random variables to model a rich family of joint probability
distributions. Sophisticated inference algorithms, such as belief propagation
(BP), can effectively compute the marginal posteriors. Nonetheless, it is still
difficult to interpret the inference outcomes for important human decision
making. There is no existing method to rigorously attribute the inference
outcomes to the contributing factors of the graphical models. Shapley values
provide an axiomatic framework, but naively computing or even approximating the
values on general graphical models is challenging and less studied. We propose
GraphShapley to integrate the decomposability of Shapley values, the structure
of MRFs, and the iterative nature of BP inference in a principled way for fast
Shapley value computation, that 1) systematically enumerates the important
contributions to the Shapley values of the explaining variables without
duplicate; 2) incrementally compute the contributions without starting from
scratches. We theoretically characterize GraphShapley regarding independence,
equal contribution, and additivity. On nine graphs, we demonstrate that
GraphShapley provides sensible and practical explanations.

is based on a continuum percolation theory in two dimensions where the number
of strings distributed in the surface of interest is strongly determined by the
size and the energy of the colliding particles. It is also expected that the
surface where the disks are lying be finite, defining a system without periodic
boundary conditions. In this work, we report modifications to the fraction of
the area covered by disks in continuum percolating systems due to a finite
number of disks and bounded by different geometries: circle, ellipse, triangle,
square and pentagon, which correspond to the first Fourier modes of the shape
fluctuation of the initial state after the particle collision. We find that the
deviation of the fraction of area covered by disks from its corresponding value
in the thermodynamic limit satisfies a universal behavior, where the free
parameters depend on the density profile, number of disks and the shape of the
boundary. Consequently, it is also found that the color suppression factor of
the string percolation model is modified by a damping function related to the
small-bounded effects. Corrections to the temperature and the speed of sound
defined in string systems are also shown for small and elliptically bounded

successfully in several image applications. Its performance varies with
different kinds of tensor decompositions, and the tensor singular value

discrete Fourier transform to exploit the residual in the 3rd mode in the

incorporate frequency component analysis into t-SVD to enhance the RTPCA

respect to the corresponding physical meanings, and the frequency-weighted
tensor nuclear norm can be obtained. Accordingly we rigorously deduce the
frequency-weighted tensor singular value threshold operator, and apply it for
low rank approximation subproblem in RTPCA. The newly obtained
frequency-weighted RTPCA can be solved by alternating direction method of

so that radiation damage must be considered as one of the limits to imaging.
Drawing upon earlier work, we describe here a unified approach to estimating
the image contrast (and thus the required exposure and corresponding radiation
dose) in both x-ray and electron microscopy. This approach accounts for factors
such as plural and inelastic scattering, and (in electron microscopy) the use
of energy filters to obtain so-called ""zero loss"" images. As expected, it shows
that electron microscopy offers lower dose for specimens thinner than about 1
micron (such as for studies of macromolecules, viruses, bacteria and
archaebacteria, and thin sectioned material), while x-ray microscopy offers
superior characteristics for imaging thicker specimen such as whole eukaryotic
cells, thick-sectioned tissues, and organs. The required radiation dose scales
strongly as a function of the desired spatial resolution, allowing one to
understand the limits of live and frozen hydrated specimen imaging. Finally, we
consider the factors limiting x-ray microscopy of thicker materials, suggesting
that specimens as thick as a whole mouse brain can be imaged with x-ray
microscopes without significant image degradation should appropriate image

temperature gradient driven plasma instability, which leads to fine scale
tearing of the magnetic flux surfaces thereby resulting in reconnection of
magnetic field lines and formation of magnetic islands. In slab geometry it has
previously been shown that the drive mechanism requires a finite collision
frequency. However, we find in linear gyrokinetic simulations that a
collisionless fine-scale tearing parity instability exists even at low and zero
collision frequency. Detailed studies reveal that these slab modes are also
driven by electron temperature gradient but are sensitive to electron finite
Larmor radius effects, and have a radial wavenumber much smaller than the
binormal wavenumber, which is comparable to the ion Larmor radius. Furthermore,
they exist even in the electrostatic limit and electromagnetic effects actually
have a stabilising influence on this collisionless tearing mode. An analytic
model shows that this collisionless small scale tearing mode is consistent with
a tearing parity slab electron temperature gradient (ETG) mode, which can be
more unstable than the twisting parity ETG mode that is often studied. This
small-scale tearing parity mode can lead to magnetic islands, which, in turn,
can influence turbulent transport in magnetised plasmas.

weighting (IPW) of the propensity scores. Although IPW and ANCOVA are
asymptotically equivalent, the former may demonstrate inferior performance in
finite samples. In this article, we point out that IPW is a special case of the
general class of balancing weights, and advocate to use overlap weighting (OW)
for covariate adjustment. The OW method has a unique advantage of completely
removing chance imbalance when the propensity score is estimated by logistic
regression. We show that the OW estimator attains the same semiparametric
variance lower bound as the most efficient ANCOVA estimator and the IPW
estimator for a continuous outcome, and derive closed-form variance estimators
for OW when estimating additive and ratio estimands. Through extensive
simulations, we demonstrate OW consistently outperforms IPW in finite samples
and improves the efficiency over ANCOVA and augmented IPW when the degree of
treatment effect heterogeneity is moderate or when the outcome model is
incorrectly specified. We apply the proposed OW estimator to the Best Apnea
Interventions for Research (BestAIR) randomized trial to evaluate the effect of
continuous positive airway pressure on patient health outcomes. All the

edge of a cliff-like rollover in the dust disc rather than inside a dark ring.
Here we build time-dependent models of TW Hya disc. We find that the classical

that ALMA-discovered blob hides a Neptune mass planet losing gas and dust. We
show that radial drift of mm-sized dust particles naturally explains why the
blob is located on the edge of the dust disc. Dust particles leaving the planet
perform a characteristic U-turn relative to it, producing an azimuthally
elongated blob-like emission feature. This scenario also explains why a 10 Myr
old disc is so bright in dust continuum. Two scenarios for the dust-losing
planet are presented. In the first, a dusty pre-runaway gas envelope of about
40 Earth mass Core Accretion planet is disrupted, e.g., as a result of a
catastrophic encounter. In the second, a massive dusty pre-collapse gas giant
planet formed by Gravitational Instability is disrupted by the energy released
in its massive core. Future modelling may discriminate between these scenarios
and allow us to study planet formation in an entirely new way -- by analysing
the flows of dust and gas recently belonging to planets, informing us about the

TOI-421 (BD-14 1137, TIC 94986319), a bright (V=9.9) G9 dwarf star in a visual
binary system observed by the TESS space mission in Sectors 5 and 6. We
performed ground-based follow-up observations -- comprised of LCOGT transit
photometry, NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging, and FIES, CORALIE, HARPS, HIRES, and
PFS high-precision Doppler measurements -- and confirmed the planetary nature
of the 16-day transiting candidate announced by the TESS team. We discovered an
additional radial velocity signal with a period of 5 days induced by the
presence of a second planet in the system, which we also found to transit its
host star. We found that the inner mini-Neptune, TOI-421b, has an orbital
period of Pb =5.19672 +- 0.00049 days, a mass of Mb = 7.17 +- 0.66 Mearth and a
radius of Rb = 2.68+0.19-0.18 Rearth, whereas the outer warm Neptune, TOI-421
c, has a period of Pc =16.06819 +- 0.00035 days, a mass of Mc = 16.42+1.06-1.04
Mearth, a radius of Rc = 5.09+0.16-0.15 Rearth and a density of rho_c
=0.685+0.080-0.072 g cm-3 . With its characteristics the inner planet
(rho_b=2.05+0.52-0.41 g cm-3) is placed in the intriguing class of the
super-puffy mini-Neptunes. TOI-421b and TOI-421c are found to be well suitable
for atmospheric characterization. Our atmospheric simulations predict
significant Ly-alpha transit absorption, due to strong hydrogen escape in both
planets, and the presence of detectable CH_4 in the atmosphere of TOI-421c if
equilibrium chemistry is assumed.

the cosmic origin of the first 21cm detections. As some of the widest fields
available, comprising thousands of sources with reasonably known redshifts,
narrow-band Lyman alpha emitter (LAE) surveys are an obvious choice for such
cross-correlation. Here we revisit the 21cm -- LAE cross-correlation, relaxing
the common assumption of reionization occurring in a pre-heated intergalactic
medium (IGM). Using specifications from the Square Kilometre Array and the
Subary Hyper Supreme-Cam, we present new forecasts of the 21cm -- LAE
cross-correlation function at $z\sim7$. We sample a broad parameter space of
the mean IGM neutral fraction and spin temperature, ($\bar{x}_{\rm{HI}}$,
$\bar{T}_{\rm S}$). The sign of the cross-correlation roughly follows the sign
of the 21cm signal: ionized regions which surround LAEs correspond to relative
hot spots in the 21cm signal when the neutral IGM is colder than the CMB, and
relative cold spots when the neutral IGM is hotter than the CMB. The amplitude
of the cross-correlation function generally increases with increasing
$\bar{x}_{\rm{HI}}$, following the increasing bias of the cosmic HII regions.
As is the case for 21cm, the strongest cross signal occurs when the IGM is
colder than the CMB, providing a large contrast between the neutral regions and
the ionized regions which host LAEs. We also vary the topology of reionization
and the epoch of X-ray heating. The cross-correlation during the first half of
reionization is sensitive to these topologies, and could thus be used to
constrain them.

confirm several WSSCI, which demonstrated the basic feasibility of our

was biased after the public announcement of the cluster development. For the

high-resolution N-body simulations. More specifically, we use the weak field
limit of two modified gravity theories, i.e., nonlocal gravity (NLG) and
scalar-tensor-vector gravity known as MOG, and ignore the existence of dark
matter halo. On the other hand, we construct the same models in the standard
dark matter model and compare their dynamics with the galactic models in
modified gravity. It turns out that there are serious differences between
galactic models in these different viewpoints. For example, we explicitly show
that the galactic models in modified gravity, host faster bars compared to the
dark matter case. On the other hand, final stellar bars are weaker in modified
gravity. These facts are not new and have already been reported in our previous
simulations for exponential galactic models. Therefore, our main purpose in
this study is to show that the above-mentioned differences, with emphasis on
the speed of the bars, are independent of the initial density profile of the
adopted disk/halo. To do so, we employ different profiles for the disk and halo
and show that the results remain qualitatively independent of the initial
galactic models. Moreover, a more accurate method has been used to quantify the
kinematic properties of the stellar bar. Our results imply that contrary to the
dark matter models, bars in modified gravity are fast rotators which never
leave the fast-bar region until the end of the simulation.

star (BNS) merger remnant GW170817 established the connection between short
$\gamma$-ray bursts and BNS mergers. It also confirmed the forging of heavy
elements in the ejecta (a so-called kilonova) via the r-process
nucleosynthesis. The appearance of non-thermal radio and X-ray emission, as
well as the brightening, which lasted more than 100 days, were somewhat
unexpected. Current theoretical models attempt to explain this temporal
behavior as either originating from a relativistic off-axis jet or a
kilonova-like outflow. In either scenario, there is some ambiguity regarding
how much energy is transported in the non-thermal electrons versus the magnetic
field of the emission region. Combining the VLA (radio) and Chandra (X-ray)
measurements with observations in the GeV-TeV domain can help break this
ambiguity, almost independently of the assumed origin of the emission. Here we

to elucidate the balance between investments in telescope time versus
scientific yield. We use the supervised machine learning method of the random
forest to perform an information content analysis on a 11-parameter model of
transmission spectra from the various NIRSpec modes. The three bluest
medium-resolution NIRSpec modes (0.7 - 1.27 microns, 0.97 - 1.84 microns, 1.66
- 3.07 microns) are insensitive to the presence of CO. The reddest
medium-resolution mode (2.87 - 5.10 microns) is sensitive to all of the
molecules assumed in our model: CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, H2O, HCN and NH3. It
competes effectively with the three bluest modes on the information encoded on
cloud abundance and particle size. It is also competitive with the
low-resolution prism mode (0.6 - 5.3 microns) on the inference of every
parameter except for the temperature and ammonia abundance. We recommend
astronomers to use the reddest medium-resolution NIRSpec mode for studying the
atmospheric chemistry of 800-1200 K warm Neptunes; its corresponding
high-resolution counterpart offers diminishing returns. We compare our findings
to previous JWST information content analyses that favor the blue orders, and
suggest that the reliance on chemical equilibrium could lead to biased outcomes
if this assumption does not apply. A simple, pressure-independent diagnostic
for identifying chemical disequilibrium is proposed based on measuring the
abundances of H2O, CO and CO2.

transfer rates rely on integrals over wavenumber triads $(\textbf{k,p,q})$
satisfying $\textbf{k+p+q=0}$. As an example $S_E^{uu}(\textbf{k|p,q})$ denotes
the kinetic energy transfer rate to the mode $\textbf{k}$, from the two other
modes in the triad, $\textbf{p}$ and $\textbf{q}$. As noted by Kraichnan
(1958), in $S_E^{uu}(\textbf{k|p,q})$, what fraction of the energy transferred
to the mode $\textbf{k}$ originated from $\textbf{p}$ and which from
$\textbf{q}$ is unknown . Such an expression is thus incongruent with the
customary description of turbulence in terms of two-scale energy exchange.
Notwithstanding this issue, Dar etal. (2001) further decomposed these transfers
into separate contributions from $\textbf{p}$-to-$\textbf{k}$ and
$\textbf{q}$-to-$\textbf{k}$, thus introducing the concept of mode-to-mode
transfers that they applied to MHD turbulence. Doing so, they had to set aside
additional transfers circulating within each triad, but failed to calculate
them.
  In the present paper we explain how to derive the complete expressions of the
mode-to-mode transfers, including the circulating transfers. We do it for
kinetic energy and kinetic helicity in hydrodynamic turbulence, for kinetic
energy, magnetic energy and magnetic helicity in MHD turbulence. Separating the
contribution of magnetic advection from magnetic stretching, the energy
mode-to-mode transfer rates involving the magnetic field become uniquely
defined, in striking contrast to the hydrodynamic case. The magnetic helicity
mode-to-mode transfer rate is also found to be uniquely defined, contrary to
kinetic helicity in hydrodynamics. We find that shell-to-shell transfer rates
have the same properties as mode-to-mode transfer rates. Finally calculating
the fluxes, we show how the circulating transfers cancel in accordance with
conservation laws.

sciences and commercial applications. In this paper, we focus on estimating
Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE), that is, the difference in the
conditional mean outcome between treatments given covariates. Traditionally,
Q-Learning based approaches rely on the estimation of conditional mean outcome
given treatment and covariates. However, they are subject to misspecification
of the main effect model. Recently, simple and flexible one-step methods to
directly learn (D-Learning) the CATE without model specifications have been
proposed. However, these methods are not robust against misspecification of the
propensity score model. We propose a new framework for CATE estimation, robust
direct learning (RD-Learning), leading to doubly robust estimators of the
treatment effect. The consistency for our CATE estimator is guaranteed if
either the main effect model or the propensity score model is correctly
specified. The framework can be used in both the binary and the multi-arm
settings and is general enough to allow different function spaces and
incorporate different generic learning algorithms. As a by-product, we develop
a competitive statistical inference tool for the treatment effect, assuming the
propensity score is known. We provide theoretical insights to the proposed
method using risk bounds under both linear and non-linear settings. The
effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by simulation studies and
a real data example about an AIDS Clinical Trials study.

antisymmetric tensor field, known as Kalb-Ramond (KR) field, on cosmological

field propagating in a four dimensional FRW spacetime evolves through a
symmetric bounce. For this purpose, the scalar field is considered to be
coupled with the KR field and also with the Ricci scalar via the term $\sim \xi
R\Phi^2$ (with $\xi$ be the coupling). The presence of KR field spoils the
conformal symmetry of a massless scalar field even for $\xi = 1/6$ in four
dimensional context, which has interesting consequences on particle production
and consequently on quantum entanglement as we will discuss. In particular, the
presence of KR field in a FRW bouncing universe allows a greater particle
production and consequently the upper bound of the entanglement entropy becomes
larger in comparison to the case when the KR field is absent. This may provide
an interesting testbed for the existence of Kalb-Ramond field in our universe.

  Image Data","Accepted for publication in the International Journal of Computer
  Assisted Radiology and Surgery (IJCARS)",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose. Localizing structures and estimating the motion of a specific target
region are common problems for navigation during surgical interventions.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality with a high spatial
and temporal resolution that has been used for intraoperative imaging and also
for motion estimation, for example, in the context of ophthalmic surgery or
cochleostomy. Recently, motion estimation between a template and a moving OCT
image has been studied with deep learning methods to overcome the shortcomings
of conventional, feature-based methods.
  Methods. We investigate whether using a temporal stream of OCT image volumes
can improve deep learning-based motion estimation performance. For this
purpose, we design and evaluate several 3D and 4D deep learning methods and we
propose a new deep learning approach. Also, we propose a temporal
regularization strategy at the model output.
  Results. Using a tissue dataset without additional markers, our deep learning
methods using 4D data outperform previous approaches. The best performing 4D
architecture achieves an correlation coefficient (aCC) of 98.58% compared to
85.0% of a previous 3D deep learning method. Also, our temporal regularization
strategy at the output further improves 4D model performance to an aCC of
99.06%. In particular, our 4D method works well for larger motion and is robust
towards image rotations and motion distortions.
  Conclusions. We propose 4D spatio-temporal deep learning for OCT-based motion
estimation. On a tissue dataset, we find that using 4D information for the
model input improves performance while maintaining reasonable inference times.
Our regularization strategy demonstrates that additional temporal information
is also beneficial at the model output.

a one size fits all to a set of different slices where each slice is
responsible for specific network requirements. In the same light, the
micro-operator concept is targeted at local deployment of 5G for vertical
specific services. When a network slice instance (NSI) is created across the
access and core networks, it is important to understand how the communication
service from the created slice instance will be distributed to different
tenants and their end-users. In this vein, we propose a network slice
communication service distribution technique for local 5G micro-operator
deployment scenarios. This is achieved by expanding or leveraging the
communication service management function (CSMF) defined by 3GPP into a
multi-tenant manager and a communication services orchestrator. We further
describe how the communication service orchestrator will address all the
possible multitenant-slice situations that can exist during the distribution of
a network slice instance to multiple tenants. The generic technique introduced
in this paper will proffer a researchable solution for not only network slice
communication service distribution across different micro-operator tenants but
pave the way to support future use cases especially when the allocated slice is
responsible for multiple tenants or when a tenant requests multiple NSIs

evaluations of surgical performances concords with the gold standard of expert
surgeon review, and that faster playback speed increases ratings for videos of
higher-skilled surgeons in laparoscopic simulation. The aim of this research is
to extend this investigation to real surgeries that use non-expert crowd
evaluations. We address two questions (1) whether crowds award more favorable
ratings to videos shown at increased playback speeds, and (2) if crowd
evaluations of the first minute of a surgical procedure differ from crowd
evaluations of the entire performance. Methods: A set of 56 videos of
practicing surgeons were used to evaluate the technical skill of the surgeons
at each video playback speed used for the first minute of the previously rated
performance, using the GEARS assessment criteria. Results: Crowds on average
did rate videos higher as playback speed was increased. This effect was
observed for both proficient and expert surgeons. Each increase in the playback
speed by 0.8x was associated with, on average, a 0.16-point increase in the
GEARS score for expert surgeons and a 0.27-point increase in GEARS score for
proficient surgeons, with both groups being perceived as obtaining relatively
equal skill at the fastest playback speed. It was also found that 22 out of the
56 surgeons were perceived to be significantly different in skill when just
viewing the first minute of performance. Conclusion: The observed increase in
skill ratings with video playback speed replicates findings for laparoscopy in
[2], and extends to real robotic surgeries. Furthermore, the large differences
in skill labels when comparing the first minute of surgery to the entire 15
minute video warrants further investigation into how much perceived skill
ratings vary in time (sub-task level) vs. summative metrics (task level).

the irreducible representation of $^3B_{2u}$, which displays intriguing nodal
points and non-zero periodic modulation of Cooper pair spin polarization on the
Fermi surface topologies. These findings not only provide a significant
theoretical insight into the coexistence of superconductivity and
ferromagnetism, but also reveal the exotic spin polarized Cooper pairing driven
by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in a triplet superconductor.

auxiliary curved background in a Lagrangian formalism. A new sketch of how to
include spinor fields is included. Conserved quantities are obtained using
Noether's theorem and expressed as divergences of antisymmetric densities,
connecting local perturbations with quasi-local conserved quantities. The
background's arbitrariness matches the so-called non-localizability of
gravitational energy (infinity of localizations). The formalism has two partly
overlapping uses: practical applications of pure GR (with fictitious
background) and foundational considerations in which background causality
facilitates quantization. The Schwarzschild solution is a primary application.
Various possibilities for calculating the mass using surface integration are
given. A field-theoretic curved spacetime is given from spatial infinity to the
horizon and even to the true singularity. Trajectories of test particles in the
Schwarzschild geometry are gauge-dependent in that even breakdowns at the
horizon can be suppressed (or generated) by naive gauge transformations. This
fact illustrates the auxiliary nature of the background metric and the need for
some notion of maximal extension---much as with coordinate transformations in
geometric GR. A continuous collapse to a point mass in the field-theoretic
framework is given. The field-theoretic method is generalized to arbitrary
metric theories in $D$ dimensions. The results are developed in the framework
of Lovelock gravity and applied to calculate masses of Schwarzschild-like black
holes. The bimetric formalism makes it natural to consider a graviton mass.
Babak and Grishchuk's numerical and hence nonperturbative work sheds light on
questions of a (dis)continuous massless limit for massive pure spin-2 and the
classical (in)stability of spin-2/spin-0 theory.

effort attempted to estimate the specific degree of each vertex from a sampled

dramatically fail for a tiny sampled induced graph and require a specific

system, such as the biomass of species or expression of a gene, which is useful
for degree estimation. We fill this gap by developing a framework to infer
individual vertex degrees using both information of the sampled topology and

to learn vertex degrees. Experimental results on real networks with a variety
of dynamics demonstrate that our framework can produce reliable degree
estimates and dramatically improve existing link prediction methods by
replacing the sampled degrees with our estimated degrees.

the relative variations in per-phase loading and associated voltage unbalance
are expected to increase. High voltage unbalance may increase network losses
and lead to failure of three-phase equipment such as motor loads. However,
solar PV panels are connected to the grid through inverters, which can provide
reactive power support and may mitigate some of these negative effects. In this
paper, we utilize a three-phase AC optimal power flow (OPF) formulation to
minimize voltage unbalance using reactive power from solar PV inverters. When
considering actions to reduce voltage unbalance, it is important to recognize
that various organizations such as IEC, NEMA and IEEE provide different and
partially inconsistent definitions of voltage unbalance in their power quality
standards. This paper analyzes the impact of the different voltage unbalance
metrics using different combinations of voltage unbalance objectives and
constraints. For our analysis, the optimization scheme is tested on two
unbalanced low-voltage distribution networks. We observe that minimizing
voltage unbalance defined by one standard might actually increase voltage
unbalance as defined by another standard, potentially resulting in equipment
damage. We also observe that minimizing voltage unbalance does not always lead
to lower network losses. However, considerable reduction in voltage unbalance
with low network losses can be achieved by minimizing the losses while
simultaneously enforcing limits on multiple definitions of voltage unbalance.

alternatives at Continuous Flow Intersections (CFI). Further, a comparison was
also performed of CFI crossing types against a standard intersection designed
to provide an equivalent volume-to-capacity ratio. Three CFI crossing
alternatives were tested, namely Traditional, Offset, and Midblock crossings.
In total, 12 alternative scenarios were generated by incorporating two bicycle
path types and two right-turn control types. These scenarios were analyzed
through microsimulation on the basis of stopped delay and number of stops.
  Simulation results revealed that the Offset crossing alternative incurred the
least stopped delay for all user classes, including motorized traffic. The
Traditional crossing generated the least number of stops for most route types.
The Midblock crossing can be considered as a supplement to either the Offset or
Traditional crossing depending on the specific origin-destination patterns at
the intersection. The exclusive bicycle path performed better than the
shared-use path in most cases. When compared with an equivalent standard
intersection, aggregated results showed significant improvement for all CFI
crossing types with respect to stopped delay, but the standard intersection had
an equal or fewer number of stops for most routes investigated. Regarding the
effect on vehicular movement, the lowest volume-to-capacity ratio of the main

incorporating pedestrian-bicycle safety, comfort, and the relative effects of
these crossing alternatives on additional vehicular performance measures.

the effort required in utilising large collections of unlabelled data for
machine learning tasks without needing to fully label them. The representation
mechanism used to represent text documents when performing active learning,
however, has a significant influence on how effective the process will be.
While simple vector representations such as bag-of-words and embedding-based
representations based on techniques such as word2vec have been shown to be an
effective way to represent documents during active learning, the emergence of
representation mechanisms based on the pre-trained transformer-based neural
network models popular in natural language processing research (e.g. BERT)
offer a promising, and as yet not fully explored, alternative. This paper
describes a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of representations
based on pre-trained transformer-based language models for active learning.
This evaluation shows that transformer-based models, especially BERT-like
models, that have not yet been widely used in active learning, achieve a
significant improvement over more commonly used vector representations like
bag-of-words or other classical word embeddings like word2vec. This paper also
investigates the effectiveness of representations based on variants of BERT
such as Roberta, Albert as well as comparing the effectiveness of the [CLS]
token representation and the aggregated representation that can be generated
using BERT-like models. Finally, we propose an approach Adaptive Tuning Active

adaptively improve the embeddings generated by the BERT-like language models as
well.

capturing user's dynamic interests and generating high-quality recommendations.
Current state-of-the-art sequential recommender models are typically based on a
sandwich-structured deep neural network, where one or more middle (hidden)
layers are placed between the input embedding layer and output softmax layer.
In general, these models require a large number of parameters (such as using a
large embedding dimension or a deep network architecture) to obtain their
optimal performance. Despite the effectiveness, at some point, further
increasing model size may be harder for model deployment in resource-constraint
devices, resulting in longer responding time and larger memory footprint. To
resolve the issues, we propose a compressed sequential recommendation
framework, termed as CpRec, where two generic model shrinking techniques are
employed. Specifically, we first propose a block-wise adaptive decomposition to
approximate the input and softmax matrices by exploiting the fact that items in
SRS obey a long-tailed distribution. To reduce the parameters of the middle
layers, we introduce three layer-wise parameter sharing schemes. We instantiate
CpRec using deep convolutional neural network with dilated kernels given
consideration to both recommendation accuracy and efficiency. By the extensive
ablation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed CpRec can achieve up to
4$\sim$8 times compression rates in real-world SRS datasets. Meanwhile, CpRec
is faster during training\inference, and in most cases outperforms its
uncompressed counterpart.

rapidly transforming physical objects into an ubiquitous connected ecosystem.
Due to their massive deployment and moderate security levels, those devices
face a lot of security, management, and control challenges. Their classical
centralized architecture is still cloaking vulnerabilities and anomalies that
can be exploited by hackers for spying, eavesdropping, and taking control of
the network. In this paper, we propose to improve the IoT architecture with
additional security features using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain
technology. We propose a novel architecture based on permissioned blockchain
technology in order to build a scalable and decentralized end-to-end secure IoT
system. Furthermore, we enhance the IoT system security with an AI-component at
the gateway level to detect and classify suspected activities, malware, and
cyber-attacks using machine learning techniques. Simulations and practical
implementation show that the proposed architecture delivers high performance
against cyber-attacks.

using a coherent microcomb source. A soliton crystal microcomb, generated by a
49 GHz micro-ring resonator (MRR), is used as a multi-wavelength source. Due to
its ultra-low comb spacing, up to 92 wavelengths are available in the C band,
yielding a broad operation bandwidth. Another high-Q MRR is employed as a
passive optical periodic filter to slice the RF spectrum with a high resolution
of 121.4 MHz. We experimentally achieve an instantaneous RF operation bandwidth
of 8.08 GHz and verify RF channelization up to 17.55 GHz via thermal tuning.
Our approach is a significant step towards the monolithically integrated
photonic RF receivers with reduced complexity, size, and unprecedented
performance, which is important for wide RF applications ranging from broadband
analog signal processing to digital-compatible signal detection.

have been a variety of approaches proposed to adapt back-propagation or
back-propagation-like algorithms appropriate for training. Considering that
these networks often have very different performance characteristics than
traditional neural networks, it is often unclear how to set either the network
topology or the hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance. In this work,
we introduce a Bayesian approach for optimizing the hyperparameters of an
algorithm for training binary communication networks that can be deployed to
neuromorphic hardware. We show that by optimizing the hyperparameters on this
algorithm for each dataset, we can achieve improvements in accuracy over the
previous state-of-the-art for this algorithm on each dataset (by up to 15
percent). This jump in performance continues to emphasize the potential when
converting traditional neural networks to binary communication applicable to
neuromorphic hardware.

physical conditions (like temperature, sound, pressure) of the environment and
organizing the collected data at a central location. These Sensor nodes are
powered by a battery, so energy conservation becomes an important aspect in

specific goal. Tracking applications are very important in WSNs. This study
proposes a method for reducing energy consumption in WSNs, considering target
tracking. A prediction method is also presented with the help of MAC Medium
Access Control layer in which a few number of nodes are in active mode to track
the target while the rest of the nodes are switched into sleeping mode. Energy
consumption was reduced by decreasing the number of nodes involved in target
tracking and activating merely a limited number of necessary nodes. The
conducted experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm has a much better
performance compared to similar algorithms in different conditions, including
energy consumption in different communication ranges, effect of the number of
nodes on energy consumption, the number of nodes involved in tracking in terms
of communication range, and losing the target. This means the proposed method
is superior and more efficient. When the target enters the simulation area,
nodes of the network identify the target node through the proposed method
(which is the optimum method) and track it as long as it is inside the
simulation area. Performance criteria, including energy, other nodes, and
throughput were used in simulation. The results showed that the proposed method
has the optimum performance and reduces energy consumption of the network
during tracking. The results of the simulation showed that the proposed method
reduces energy consumption to an acceptable extent, compared to previous
methods, in addition to increasing the accuracy of target tracking. Keywords:

one generator of the Askey-Wilson (or Racah) algebra becomes diagonal in the
usual representation of the quantum algebras whereas the second one is
tridiagonal. This allows to recover easily the recurrence relations of the
associated orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. These realizations
involve rational functions of the Cartan generator of the quantum algebras,

How to manage substrate resources when performing the mapping will have an
effective role in improving the use of infrastructure resources and
consequently better mapping. By writing a module in the controller for dynamic
resource management, an initial mapping has been attempted until the request
arrives, if sufficient resources are available, but until the arrival of the n
request that their initial mapping is successful, writing the rules in the

pulsating heat pipe (MPHP) and the internal flow characteristics. The MPHP
consists of an eleven-turn closed-loop of a meandering square microchannel with
a hydraulic diameter of $350\ {}{\mu}{\rm m}$ engraved on a silicon substrate.
The MPHP charged with Fluorinert FC-72 tends to exhibit higher effective
thermal conductivities for the coolant temperature of $T_{\rm c} = 40\
{}^\circ\mathrm{C}$ compared to $T_{\rm c} = 20\ {}^\circ\mathrm{C}$, and
provides the highest effective thermal conductivity of about $700\ {}{\rm
W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ for $T_{\rm c} = 40\ {}^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a filling ratio of
48%. Interestingly, we observe two different self-oscillation modes having
different thermal conductivities, even for identical heat input rates. This
tendency indicates a hysteresis of the effective thermal conductivity, which
originates from the difference in the heat input rates at which the MPHP falls
into and recovers from dryout. Subsequently, semantic segmentation-based image
recognition is applied to the recorded flow images to identify the flow
characteristics, successfully extracting four different flow patterns involving
liquid slugs, liquid films, dry walls, and rapid-boiling regions. The image
recognition results indicate that high effective thermal conductivities of the
MPHP relate to stable self-oscillations with large amplitudes and high
frequencies, along with long and thin liquid films beneficial for latent heat
transfer. Finally, we perform numerical simulations of latent/sensible heat
transfer via vapor plugs and of sensible heat transfer via liquid slugs using
the extracted flow patterns as inputs. We find that latent heat transfer via
liquid films accounts for a considerable portion of the overall heat transfer,
while the sensible heat transfer via liquid slugs is much less significant.
