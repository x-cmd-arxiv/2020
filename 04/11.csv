drive and its effect on the surface resistance of superconductors. The vortex
surface resistance is calculated with a Montecarlo approach, where the vortex
motion equation is solved for a collection of vortex flux lines each
oscillating within a random pinning landscape. This approach is capable of
providing a detailed description of the microscopic vortex dynamics and in turn
important insights into the microwave field amplitude dependence of the vortex
surface resistance. The numerical simulations are compared against experimental
data of vortex surface resistance at high microwave amplitude measured by means
of bulk niobium superconducting-radio frequency cavities operating at 1.3 GHz.
The good qualitative agreement of simulations and experiments suggests that the
non-linear dependence of the trapped flux surface resistance with the microwave
field amplitude is generated by progressive microwave depinning and vortex
jumps.

requires the knowledge of the full distribution of the Peak AoI (PAoI), from

be obtained. In this work, we model the communication and computation delay of
such a system as two First Come First Serve (FCFS) queues in tandem,

$\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ envelope-function model combined with a treatment
of intercarrier correlation by many-body perturbation theory. A confined
exciton is described first within the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, and
correlation between the electron and hole is then included in leading order by
computing the first-order vertex correction to the electron-photon interaction.
The vertex correction is found to give an enhancement of the near-threshold
absorption cross section by a factor of up to 4 relative to the HF (mean-field)
value of the cross section, for NCs with an edge length $L=9$-12 nm (regime of
intermediate confinement). The vertex-correction enhancement factors are found
to decrease with increasing exciton energy; the absorption cross section for
photons of energy $\omega=3.1$ eV (about 0.7 eV above threshold) is enhanced by
a factor of only 1.4-1.5 relative to the HF value. The
$\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ corrections to the absorption cross section are
also significant; they are found to increase the cross section at an energy
$\omega=3.1$ eV by about 30% relative to the value found in the effective-mass
approximation. The theoretical absorption cross section at $\omega=3.1$ eV,
assuming a Kane parameter $E_{P}=20$ eV, is found to be intermediate among the
set of measured values (which vary among themselves by nearly an order of
magnitude) and to obey a power-law dependence $\sigma^{(1)}(\omega)\propto
L^{2.9}$ on the NC edge length $L$, in good agreement with experiment. The
dominant contribution to the theoretical exponent 2.9 is shown to be the
density of final-state excitons. The main theoretical uncertainty in these

reliable and efficient wireless links over millimeter-wave and terahertz bands.
These high-rate communication systems use directional antennas and therefore
have to constantly maintain alignment between transmitter and receiver beams.
For terahertz links, envisioned to employ radiation patterns of no more than
few degrees wide, not only the macro-scale user mobility (human walking, car
driving, etc.) but also the micro-scale mobility - spontaneous shakes and
rotations of the device - becomes a severe issue. In this paper, we propose a
mathematical framework for the first-order analysis of the effects caused by
micro-mobility on the capacity and outage in terahertz communications. The
performance of terahertz communications is compared with and without
micro-mobility illustrating the difference of up to 1 Tbit/s or 75%. In
response to this gap, it is finally shown how the negative effects of the

as tutoring systems, conversational agents, healthcare literacy, and
information retrieval. Existing efforts at AQG have been limited to short
answer lengths of up to two or three sentences. However, several real-world
applications require question generation from answers that span several
sentences. Therefore, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark to assess the
performance of existing AQG systems for long-text answers. We leverage the
large-scale open-source Google Natural Questions dataset to create the
aforementioned long-answer AQG benchmark. We empirically demonstrate that the
performance of existing AQG methods significantly degrades as the length of the
answer increases. Transformer-based methods outperform other existing AQG
methods on long answers in terms of automatic as well as human evaluation.
However, we still observe degradation in the performance of our best performing
models with increasing sentence length, suggesting that long answer QA is a
challenging benchmark task for future research.

combined with case isolation and social distancing, as an important tool for
mitigating the spread of a disease [1]. Contact tracing provides a mechanism of
identifying individuals with a high likelihood of previous exposure to a
contagious disease, allowing additional precautions to be put in place to
prevent continued transmission. Here we consider a cryptographic approach to
contact tracing based on secure two-party computation (2PC). We begin by
considering the problem of comparing a set of location histories held by two
parties to determine whether they have come within some threshold distance
while at the same time maintaining the privacy of the location histories. We
propose a solution to this problem using pre-shared keys, adapted from an
equality testing protocol due to Ishai et al [2]. We discuss how this protocol
can be used to maintain privacy within practical contact tracing scenarios,
including both app-based approaches and approaches which leverage location
history held by telecoms and internet service providers. We examine the
efficiency of this approach and show that existing infrastructure is sufficient
to support anonymised contact tracing at a national level.

explicit $U(1)$ symmetry breaking term. The potential of this model is
constructed so that two distinct degenerate vacua in the $\phi$ field exist, in
analogy to the $\phi^{4}$ potential. Therefore, brane solutions appear due to
the vacuum structure of the $\phi$ field. However, the topology and vacuum
structure in the $\psi$ direction depends on the symmetry breaking parameter
$\beta^{2}$, which leads to different types of branes. As a result, one can
interpret the present model as a combination of a $\phi^{4}$ brane with an
auxiliary field, which leads to deviations from the $\phi^{4}$ system with the
brane achieving a richer internal structure. Furthermore, we analyse in detail
the behaviour of the superpotentials, the warp factors, the Ricci and
Kretschmann scalars and the Einstein tensor components. In addition to this, we
explore the stability of the brane in terms of the free parameters of the
model. The analysis presented here complements previous work and is
sufficiently novel to be interesting.

expanded and enhanced the skyrmion phase region from the small range of 55-58.5
K to 5-300 K in single-crystalline Cu2OSeO3 by pressures up to 42.1 GPa through
a series of phase transitions from the cubic P2(_1)3, through orthorhombic

using our newly developed ultrasensitive high-pressure magnetization technique.
The results are in agreement with our Ginzburg-Landau free energy analyses,
showing that pressures tend to stabilize the skyrmion states and at higher
temperatures. The observations also indicate that the skyrmion state can be
achieved at higher temperatures in various crystal symmetries, suggesting the
insensitivity of skyrmions to the underlying crystal lattices and thus the
possible more ubiquitous presence of skyrmions in helimagnets.

allow the calculation of entanglement directly in the gauge theory. Because we
allow for trivial interfaces, this includes a generic construction of the
extended Hilbert space in any (compact) Chern-Simons theory quantized on a
Riemann surface. Additionally, this provides a constructive and principled
definition for the Hilbert space of effective ground states of gapped phases of
matter glued along gapped interfaces. Lastly, we describe a generalized notion

prefer to push toward the head of the dendritic spine to the ratio of motors
that prefer to push in the opposite direction. We perform a numerical
bifurcation analysis in these parameters and find that steady-state vesicle
velocities appear and disappear through several saddle-node bifurcations. This
process allows us to identify the region of parameter space in which multiple
stable velocities exist. We show by direct calculations that there can only be
unidirectional motion for sufficiently close vesicle-to-spine diameter ratios.

different NER architectures, including local models (e.g., BiLSTM) and global

performs on par with a strong marginal CRF baseline, while being more flexible
in the form of required NER resources. MARDI also sets a new state of the art

enable residents to access employment, education, and other services.
Unfortunately, transit services that provide wide coverage tend to suffer from
relatively low utilization, which results in high fuel usage per passenger per
mile, leading to high operating costs and environmental impact. Electric
vehicles (EVs) can reduce energy costs and environmental impact, but most
public transit agencies have to employ them in combination with conventional,
internal-combustion engine vehicles due to the high upfront costs of EVs. To
make the best use of such a mixed fleet of vehicles, transit agencies need to
optimize route assignments and charging schedules, which presents a challenging
problem for large transit networks. We introduce a novel problem formulation to
minimize fuel and electricity use by assigning vehicles to transit trips and
scheduling them for charging, while serving an existing fixed-route transit
schedule. We present an integer program for optimal assignment and scheduling,
and we propose polynomial-time heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms for
larger networks. We evaluate our algorithms on the public transit service of
Chattanooga, TN using operational data collected from transit vehicles. Our

outcomes. This paper proposes Bayesian inference for deep vision SHM models
where uncertainty can be quantified using the Monte Carlo dropout sampling.
Three independent case studies for cracks, local damage identification, and
bridge component detection are investigated using Bayesian inference. Aside
from better prediction results, mean class softmax variance and entropy, the
two uncertainty metrics, are shown to have good correlations with
misclassifications. While the uncertainty metrics can be used to trigger human

uncertainty masks can be challenging. Therefore, surrogate models are
introduced to take the uncertainty as input such that the performance can be
further boosted. The proposed methodology in this paper can be applied to
future deep vision SHM frameworks to incorporate model uncertainty in the

low surface gravity model with disequilibrium chemistry. The spectral
variability of VHS1256b is consistent with predictions from partly cloudy

EAGLE predicts that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains more metals than
the interstellar medium across halo masses. The ions we study here trace the
warm-hot, volume-filling phase of the CGM, but are biased towards temperatures
corresponding to the collisional ionization peak for each ion, and towards high
metallicities. Gas well within the virial radius is mostly collisionally
ionized, but around and beyond this radius, and for O VI, photoionization
becomes significant. When presenting observables we work with column densities,
but quantify their relation with equivalent widths by analysing virtual
spectra. Virial-temperature collisional ionization equilibrium ion fractions
are good predictors of column density trends with halo mass, but underestimate
the diversity of ions in haloes. Halo gas dominates the highest column density
absorption for X-ray lines, but lower density gas contributes to strong UV
absorption lines from O VI and Ne VIII. Of the O VII (O VIII) absorbers
detectable in an Athena X-IFU blind survey, we find that 41 (56) per cent arise
from haloes with $\mathrm{M}_{200c}=10^{12.0}$-$10^{13.5}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.

electron compounds is that the linear in temperature resistivity often extends
down to low temperatures, lower than natural microscopic energy scales. We
consider recently proposed deconfined critical points (or phases) in models of
electrons in large dimension lattices with random nearest-neighbor exchange
interactions. The criticality is in the class of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, and
exhibits a time reparameterization soft mode representing gravity in dual
holographic theories. We compute the low temperature resistivity in a large $M$
limit of models with SU($M$) spin symmetry, and find that the dominant
temperature dependence arises from this soft mode. The resistivity is linear in
temperature down to zero temperature at the critical point, with a co-efficient
universally proportional to the product of the residual resistivity and the
co-efficient of the linear in temperature specific heat. We argue that the time
reparameterization soft mode offers a promising and generic mechanism for
resolving the strange metal puzzle.

allow for super-Eddington accretion. Under our most extreme assumptions, we
find that at most about 2% of all merging binary BH systems contains a BH with

results to predictions from several dynamical pathways to pair-instability mass

classical isolated binary formation scenario will not significantly contribute
to the pollution of the pair-instability mass gap. The robustness of the
predicted mass gap for the isolated binary channel is promising for the
prospective of placing constraints on (i) the relative contribution of

clouds in molecules, and the spatial arrangements of atoms into chiral
molecular structures, play crucial roles in physics, chemistry and biology.
However, these two fundamental concepts - chirality and polarization - have
remained unrelated so far. This work connects them by introducing and exploring
the concept of polarization of chirality. We show that, like charge, chirality,
or handedness, can be polarized, and that such polarization leads to
fundamental consequences, demonstrated here using light. First, we analyze how
chirality dipoles and higher-order chirality multipoles manifest in
experimental observables. Next, we show how to create chirality-polarized
optical fields of alternating handedness in space. Despite being achiral, these
racemic space-time light structures interact differently with chiral matter of
opposite handedness, and the chirality dipole of light controls and quantifies
the strength of the enantio-sensitive response. Using nonlinear interactions,
we can make a medium of randomly oriented chiral molecules emit light to the
left, or to the right, depending on the molecular handedness and on the
chirality dipole of light. The chiral dichroism in emission direction reaches
its highest possible value of 200%. Our work opens the field of chirality

to study the connection between quasi-greediness and democracy of bases in

  2.2",,,,"math.CO math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A graph profile records all possible densities of a fixed finite set of
graphs. Profiles can be extremely complicated; for instance the full profile of
any triple of connected graphs is not known, and little is known about
hypergraph profiles. We introduce the tropicalization of graph and hypergraph
profiles. Tropicalization is a well-studied operation in algebraic geometry,
which replaces a variety (the set of real or complex solutions to a finite set
of algebraic equations) with its ""combinatorial shadow"". We prove that the
tropicalization of a graph profile is a closed convex cone, which still
captures interesting combinatorial information. We explicitly compute these
tropicalizations for arbitrary sets of complete and star hypergraphs. We show
they are rational polyhedral cones even though the corresponding profiles are
not even known to be semialgebraic in some of these cases. We then use
tropicalization to prove strong restrictions on the power of the sums of
squares method, equivalently Cauchy-Schwarz calculus, to test (which is weaker
than certification) the validity of graph density inequalities. In particular,
we show that sums of squares cannot test simple binomial graph density
inequalities, or even their approximations. Small concrete examples of such
inequalities are presented, and include the famous Blakley-Roy inequalities for
paths of odd length. As a consequence, these simple inequalities cannot be
written as a rational sum of squares of graph densities.

exciting multiple image slices simultaneously. Overlapping slices are then

reconstruction impact the quality of final images. Therefore, finding an
optimal set of reconstruction parameters is critical to ensure that SMS
acceleration does not significantly degrade resulting image quality.
  Gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) data were acquired with a range of
SMS acceleration factors from volunteers. Images were collected using two head
coils (a 48-channel array and a smaller 32-channel array). Data from these
coils were reconstructed offline using a range of coil compression factors and
reconstruction kernel parameters. A hybrid space (ky-x), externally-calibrated
coil-by-coil slice unaliasing approach was used for image reconstruction. The
resulting SMS images were compared with identical EPI data acquired without
SMS. A functional MRI (fMRI) experiment was also performed and group analysis
results were compared between data sets reconstructed with different coil
compression levels.
  The 32-channel coil with smaller dimensions outperformed the larger
48-channel coil in our experiments. Generally, a large calibration region and
small kernel sizes in ky direction improved image quality. Use of
regularization in the kernel fitting procedure had a notable impact. With
optimal selection of other hyperparameters in the hybrid space SMS unaliasing
algorithm, coil compression caused small reduction in quality in SMS
accelerated images. Similarly, group analysis of fMRI results did not show a
significant influence of coil compression on resulting image quality.
  Hyperparameters used in SMS reconstruction need to be fine-tuned once the
experimental factors such as the RF receive coil and SMS factor have been
determined.

solution to the deceptive game in which a control agent is to satisfy a Boolean
objective specified by a co-safe temporal logic formula in the presence of an
adversary. The agent intentionally introduces asymmetric information to create
payoff misperception, which manifests as the misperception of the labeling
function in the game model. Thus, the adversary is unable to accurately
determine which logical formula is satisfied by a given outcome of the game. We
introduce a model called hypergame on graph to capture the asymmetrical
information with one-sided payoff misperception. Based on this model, we
present the solution of such a hypergame and use the solution to synthesize
stealthy deceptive strategies. Specifically, deceptive sure winning and
deceptive almost-sure winning strategies are developed by reducing the
hypergame to a two-player game and one-player stochastic game with reachability
objectives. A running example is introduced to demonstrate the game model and
the solution concept used for strategy synthesis.

dependence structure, we adopted the well-known shared frailty model. This
model provides a suitable theoretical basis for generating dependence between
the components failure times in the dependent competing risks model. It is
known that the dependence effect in this scenario influences the estimates of
the model parameters. Hence, under the assumption that the cause-specific
intensities follow a PLP, we propose a frailty-induced dependence approach to
incorporate the dependence among the cause-specific recurrent processes.
Moreover, the misspecification of the frailty distribution may lead to errors
when estimating the parameters of interest. Because of this, we considered a
Bayesian nonparametric approach to model the frailty density in order to offer
more flexibility and to provide consistent estimates for the PLP model, as well
as insights about heterogeneity among the systems. Both simulation studies and
real case studies are provided to illustrate the proposed approaches and
demonstrate their validity.

virus transmission chains and early detection of outbreaks, especially in the
phase 2 of the pandemic, when lockdown and other restriction measures are
progressively withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion resurgence.
For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale
adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the
app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens'
privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the
need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We
advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both
contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens'
""personal data stores"", to be shared separately and selectively, voluntarily,
only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy
preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal
sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed
information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and,
in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak
hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. Our recommendation is
two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light
touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the
device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when
they want, for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance. Second,
we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision,
giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure
they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for
rebuilding society.

buckling under compression, with three possible geometric buckling modes, or
pattern transformations. The individual pattern transformations, and
consequently also spatially distributed patterns, can be induced by controlling
the applied compression along two orthogonal directions. Exploitation of this
property holds great potential in, e.g., soft robotics applications. For fast
and optimal design, efficient numerical tools are required, capable of bridging
the gap between the microstructural and engineering scale, while capturing all
relevant pattern transformations. A micromorphic homogenization framework for
materials exhibiting multiple pattern transformations is therefore presented in
this paper, which extends the micromorphic scheme of Roko\v{s} et al., J. Mech.
Phys. Solids 123, 119-137 (2019), for elastomeric metamaterials exhibiting only
a single pattern transformation. The methodology is based on a suitable
kinematic ansatz consisting of a smooth part, a set of spatially correlated
fluctuating fields, and a remaining, spatially uncorrelated microfluctuation
field. Whereas the latter field is neglected or condensed out at the level of
each macroscopic material point, the magnitudes of the spatially correlated
fluctuating fields emerge at the macroscale as micromorphic fields. We develop
the balance equations which these micromorphic fields must satisfy as well as a
computational homogenization approach to compute the generalized stresses
featuring in these equations. To demonstrate the potential of the methodology,
loading cases resulting in mixed modes in both space and time are studied and
compared against full-scale simulations. It is shown that the proposed
framework is capable of capturing the relevant phenomena, although the inherent
multiplicity of solutions entails sensitivity to the initial guess.

the hybrid difference scheme. The numerical solution of the nonlinear

insects have shown that they rely on the perception of image motion, or optic
flow, to estimate relative motion, equivalent to a ratio of their velocity and
distance to objects in the world. The key open challenge is therefore to
decouple these two states from a single measurement of their ratio. Although
modern SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) methods provide a solution
to this problem for robotic systems, these methods typically rely on
computations that insects likely cannot perform, such as simultaneously
tracking multiple individual visual features, remembering a 3D map of the

presents special challenges. Because cybersecurity issues are often subtle,
where the adversarial model and details matter greatly, it is challenging to
construct MCQs for which there is exactly one best but non-obvious answer. We
hope that our experiences and lessons learned may help others create more

environments (IDEs). Machine learning has become ubiquitous in analogous
natural language writing and search software, surfacing more relevant
autocompletions and search suggestions in fewer keystrokes. Prior research has
reported training high-accuracy, deep neural networks for modeling source code,
but little attention has been given to the practical constraints imposed by
interactive developer tools. In particular, neural language models for source
code modeling like the one described in Maybe Deep Neural Networks are the Best
Choice for Modeling Source Code are framed around code completion, but only
report accuracy of next-token prediction. However, in order for a language
model (LM) to work well within real-world code completion systems, it must also
always make suggestions that produce valid code that typechecks to support code
completion's role in correctness-checking; return instantaneous results to help
programmers code more efficiently in fewer keystrokes; and be small enough to
fit comfortably on disk and in memory on developer workstations, since
virtually all modern IDEs run locally and support offline usage. To meet these
additional requirements, we propose a novel design for predicting top-k next
tokens that combines static analysis' ability to enumerate all valid keywords
and in-scope identifiers with the ability of a language model to place a
probability distribution over them. Our model mixes character-level input
representation with token output to represent out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens
meaningfully and minimize prediction latency. OOV tokens can be predicted
through detection of local repetition common in software. This design achieves
state-of-art accuracy in source code modeling and fits the constraints imposed
by real-world code completion implementations in modern IDEs.

nontrivial upper bounds for the pathwise critical coupling strength. Numerical
simulations suggest that multi- and mono-clusters can emerge asymptotically in
the Kuramoto flow depending on the relative magnitude of the coupling strength

analysis for such phase-locking dynamics of the Kuramoto flow still lacks a

complete synchronization of the Kuramoto model in a sufficiently large coupling

phase-locking of a majority ensemble and the complete phase-locking in terms of
the initial phase configuration, coupling strength and natural frequencies. As
a by-product of our analysis, we obtain nontrivial upper bounds for the
pathwise critical coupling strength in terms of the diameter of natural

Image-based malware classification with deep learning is an attractive approach

However, the impact of differences in deep learning models and the degree of
transfer learning on the classification accuracy of malware variants has not
been fully studied. In this paper, we conducted an exhaustive survey of deep
learning models using 24 ImageNet pre-trained models and five fine-tuning

that the highest classification accuracy was obtained by fine-tuning one of the

and we achieved the highest classification accuracy ever in cross-validation on
the Malimg and Drebin datasets. We also confirmed that this trend holds true

explore optimal deep learning models with the latest models and malware

""combinational"" computation model that views computation as comprising the
iterated transformational and compositional activity of a population of agents
upon each other. Conventional measures of simplicity in terms of algorithmic
information etc. are shown to be special cases of a broader understanding of
the core ""symmetry"" properties constituting what is defined here as a
Compositional Simplicity Measure (CoSM).
  This theory of CoSMs is extended to a theory of CoSMOS (Combinational
Simplicity Measure Operating Sets) which involve multiple simplicity measures
utilized together. Given a vector of simplicity measures, an entity is
associated not with an individual simplicity value but with a ""simplicity
bundles"" of Pareto-optimal simplicity-value vectors.
  CoSMs and CoSMOS are then used as a foundation for a theory of pattern and
multipattern, and a theory of hierarchy and heterarchy in systems of patterns.
A formalization of the cognitive-systems notion of a ""coherent dual network""
interweaving hierarchy and heterarchy in a consistent way is presented.
  The high level end result of this investigation is to re-envision Occam's
Razor as something like: When in doubt, prefer hypotheses whose simplicity
bundles are Pareto optimal, partly because doing so both permits and benefits
from the construction of coherent dual networks comprising coordinated and
consistent multipattern hierarchies and heterarchies.

characterizes the average number of secondary cases generated by each typical
primary case -- is central in the quantification of the potential scope of the
pandemic and the selection of an appropriate course of action. In most models,
$R$ is modeled as a universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters
and individuals -- effectively averaging out the inherent variability of the
transmission process due to varying individual contact rates, population
densities, demographics, or temporal factors amongst many. Yet, due to the
exponential nature of epidemic growth, the error due to this simplification can
be rapidly amplified and lead to inaccurate predictions and/or risk evaluation.
From the statistical modeling perspective, the magnitude of the impact of this
averaging remains an open question: how can this intrinsic variability be
percolated into epidemic models, and how can its impact on uncertainty
quantification and predictive scenarios be better quantified? In this paper, we
propose to study this question through a Bayesian perspective, creating a
bridge between the agent-based and compartmental approaches commonly used in
the literature. After deriving a Bayesian model that captures at scale the
heterogeneity of a population and environmental conditions, we simulate the
spread of the epidemic as well as the impact of different social distancing
strategies, and highlight the strong impact of this added variability on the
reported results. We base our discussion on both synthetic experiments --
thereby quantifying of the reliability and the magnitude of the effects -- and
real COVID-19 data.

is to implement Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) functionalities. With V2G in place, EV
owners can have extra freedom to interact their battery energy with power
grids, namely by selling their energy to the grid when their EVs are not in
use. On the other hand, EV aggregators and utility companies can leverage the
flexibility of the collected energy to implement various ancillary services to
the grids, which may significantly reduce costs of, for instance, running
spinning reserve of traditional power plants on the grid side. However, this
extra freedom also poses practical challenges in terms of how to devise a
discharging strategy for a group of EVs that is fair and in some sense optimal.
In this paper, we present a new design of EV discharging strategy in a typical
V2G energy trading framework whilst leveraging the whale optimization algorithm
in a decentralized manner, a metaheuristic algorithm that has been shown
effective in solving large-scale centralized optimization problems. We
demonstrate that by using simple ideas of data shuffling and aggregation, one
can design an EV discharging strategy in a fair, optimal and privacy-aware
manner, where the privacy refers to the fact that no critical information of
EVs should be exchanged with the EV aggregator, and vice versa. The fairness
implies that a common discharge rate needs to be sought for all EVs so that no
one gets better benefits than others in the same V2G programme. Simulation
results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed system.

correlations associated with partially coherent fields. Combining these two
concepts, here we present Wolf phase tomography (WPT), which is a method for
performing diffraction tomography using partially coherent fields. The WPT
reconstruction works in the direct space-time domain, without the need of
Fourier transformation, and decouples the refractive index distribution from
the thickness of the sample. We demonstrate the WPT principle using data
acquired by spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM). SLIM is a
quantitative phase imaging method that upgrades an existing phase contrast
microscope by introducing controlled phase shifts between the incident and
scattered fields. The illumination field in SLIM is spatially partially
coherent (emerging from a ring-shaped pupil function) and of low temporal
coherence (white light), thus, suitable for the Wolf equations. From three
intensity measurements corresponding to different phase-contrast frames in
SLIM, the 3D refractive index distribution is obtained right away by computing
the Laplacian and second time derivative of the measured complex correlation
function. The high-throughput and simplicity of this method enables the study
of 3D, dynamic events in living cells across entire multi-well plates, with RI
sensitivity on the order of 10-5. We validate WPT with measurements of standard

the problem, the proposed algorithm fuses both object detection and point cloud
data to estimate the quadric parameters. It finishes the quadric initialization
based on a single frame of RGB-D data, which significantly reduces the
requirements for perspective changes. As objects are often observed locally,
the proposed algorithm uses the symmetrical properties of indoor artificial
objects to estimate the occluded parts to obtain more accurate quadric

high dimensional sparse problems due to its computational efficiency. Recent
works show that a polynomially decaying prior leads to satisfactory posterior
asymptotics under regression models. In the literature, statisticians have
investigated how the global shrinkage parameter, i.e., the scale parameter, in
a heavy tail prior affects the posterior contraction. In this work, we explore
how the shape of the prior, or more specifically, the polynomial order of the
prior tail affects the posterior. We discover that, under the sparse normal
means models, the polynomial order does affect the multiplicative constant of
the posterior contraction rate. More importantly, if the polynomial order is
sufficiently close to 1, it will induce the optimal Bayesian posterior
convergence, in the sense that the Bayesian contraction rate is sharply
minimax, i.e., not only the order, but also the multiplicative constant of the
posterior contraction rate are optimal. The above Bayesian sharp minimaxity
holds when the global shrinkage parameter follows a deterministic choice which
depends on the unknown sparsity $s$. Therefore, a Beta-prior modeling is
further proposed, such that our sharply minimax Bayesian procedure is adaptive
to unknown $s$. Our theoretical discoveries are justified by simulation
studies.

systems due to its robustness to adverse weather and various lighting

we propose a deep-learning based algorithm for radar object detection. The
algorithm takes in radar data in its raw tensor representation and places
probabilistic oriented bounding boxes around the detected objects in
bird's-eye-view space. We created a new multimodal dataset with 102544 frames
of raw radar and synchronized LiDAR data. To reduce human annotation effort we
developed a scalable pipeline to automatically annotate ground truth using
LiDAR as reference. Based on this dataset we developed a vehicle detection
pipeline using raw radar data as the only input. Our best performing radar
detection model achieves 77.28\% AP under oriented IoU of 0.3. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate object detection with

particle-laden fluid flow simulations depends on accurate estimation of the
particle force through closure models. Typical force closure models require
computation of the slip velocity at the particle location, which in turn
requires accurate estimation of the undisturbed fluid velocity. However, when
the fluid and particle phases are two-way coupled the fluid velocity field is
disturbed by the presence of the particle. A common practice is to use the
disturbed velocity to compute the particle force which can result in errors as
much as 100% in predicting the particle dynamics. In this work, a general
velocity correction scheme is developed that facilitates accurate estimation of
the undisturbed fluid velocity in particle-laden fluid flows with and without
no-slip walls. The model can handle particles of different size, arbitrary
interpolation functions, anisotropic grids with large aspect ratios, and
wall-bounded flows. The present correction scheme is motivated by the recent
work of Esmaily & Horwitz (JCP, 2018) on unbounded particle-laden flows.
Modifications necessary for wall-bounded flows are developed such that the
undisturbed fluid velocity at any wall distance is accurately recovered,
asymptotically approaching the unbounded scheme for particles far away from
walls. A detailed series of verification tests were conducted on settling
velocity of a particle in parallel and perpendicular motions to a no-slip wall.
A range of flow parameters and grid configurations; involving anisotropic grids
with aspect ratios typically encountered in particle-laden turbulent channel
flows, were considered in detail. When the wall effects are accounted for, the
present correction scheme reduces the errors in predicting the near-wall
particle motion by one order of magnitude smaller values compared to the
unbounded correction schemes.

isospin violation, DM couples to neutron and proton in different strengths.
Even NS is composed of protons roughly one to two percent of the total baryons,

observational data is to use an instrumental variable (IV): a third variable z
that affects y only through x. The more strongly z is associated with x, the
more reliable the estimate is, but such strong IVs are difficult to find.
Instead, practitioners combine more commonly available IV candidates---which
are not necessarily strong, or even valid, IVs---into a single ""summary"" that
is plugged into causal effect estimators in place of an IV. In genetic
epidemiology, such approaches are known as allele scores. Allele scores require
strong assumptions---independence and validity of all IV candidates---for the
resulting estimate to be reliable. To relax these assumptions, we propose Ivy,
a new method to combine IV candidates that can handle correlated and invalid IV
candidates in a robust manner. Theoretically, we characterize this robustness,
its limits, and its impact on the resulting causal estimates. Empirically, Ivy
can correctly identify the directionality of known relationships and is robust
against false discovery (median effect size <= 0.025) on three real-world
datasets with no causal effects, while allele scores return more biased

  Prediction of a Dense Spray",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate prediction of a dense spray using an Euler-Lagrange approach is
challenging because of high volume fraction of the dispersed phase due to
subgrid cluster of droplets. To accurately model dense sprays, one needs to
capture this effect by taking into account the spatio-temporal changes in the
volume fraction of the carrier phase due to the motion and presence of the
dispersed phase. This leads to zero-Mach number, variable density equations
which are commonly neglected in the standard two-way coupling spray
simulations. Using pressure-based solvers, this gives rise to a source term in
the pressure Poisson equation and a non-divergence free velocity field. To
validate the predictive capability of such approach, an atomized
non-evaporating dilute particulate round jet is first examined using Large Eddy
Simulation coupled with Point-Particle approach and then higher volume loadings
up to 38% are investigated with and without taking into account the volumetric
displacement effects. It is shown that for volume loadings above 5%, the
volumetric displacement effects enhance dynamics of the flow resulting in a
higher stream-wise mean and r.m.s. velocities compared to the results of
standard two-way coupling. This is more pronounced for the near field of the
jet where local volume fraction of the dispersed phase is relatively high. This
enhancement is conjectured to be due to the velocity divergence effect due to
the modified continuity equation where spatio-temporal variations in volume
fraction of the carrier phase increases velocity in the regions of high void
fraction.

In our work, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) framework for the image

low-parameter models without a significant drop in performance. We propose a
combination of the attention-based feature distillation method and imitation
loss and demonstrate its effectiveness on the popular MRI reconstruction
architecture, DC-CNN. We conduct extensive experiments using Cardiac, Brain,

student network trained with the assistance of the teacher using our proposed
KD framework provided significant improvement over the student network trained
without assistance across all the datasets and acceleration factors.
Specifically, for the Knee dataset, the student network achieves $65\%$
parameter reduction, 2x faster CPU running time, and 1.5x faster GPU running
time compared to the teacher. Furthermore, we compare our attention-based
feature distillation method with other feature distillation methods. We also
conduct an ablative study to understand the significance of attention-based

Based on the UN Comtrade data from 1988 to 2017, we construct unweighted and

advantages in analyzing global oil trade as a system with numerous economies
and complicated relationships. This paper establishes a trading-based network
model for global oil trade to study the evolving efficiency, criticality and
robustness of economies and the relationships between oil trade partners. The
results show that for unweighted OTNs, the efficiency of oil flows gradually
increases with growing complexity of the OTNs, and the weighted efficiency
indicators are more capable of highlighting the impact of major events on the
OTNs. The identified critical economies and trade relationships have more
important strategic significance in the real market. The simulated deliberate
attacks corresponding to national bankruptcy, trade blockade, and economic
sanctions have a more significant impact on the robustness than random attacks.
When the economies are promoting high-quality economic development, and
continuously enhancing positions in the OTN, more attention needs be paid to
the identified critical economies and trade relationships. To conclude, some
suggestions for application are given according to the results.

electron behaviours during the whole OER process, with the consideration of

electrocatalysts, for example, adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) or lattice
oxygen mechanism (LOM), the underlying rationale is that active sites have to
extract three in four electrons with the same spin direction before the
formation of O=O. This spin-sensitive nature of OER superimposes additional
high requirements on the electrocatalysts, especially on the spin structure, to
compliment the fast electron transfer in the interface with spin selection and
smoothly delivery afterwards. When optimizing the geometric and electronic

not merely suffer from lack of well-annotated Persian sentiment corpus, but
also a novel model to classify the Persian opinions in terms of both multiple

analyze groups of replications. The application of unsuitable techniques to
aggregate replication results may undermine the potential of groups of
replications to provide in-depth insights from experiment results. Objectives:
Provide an analysis procedure with a set of embedded guidelines to aggregate
software engineering (SE) replication results. Method: We compare the
characteristics of groups of replications for SE and other mature experimental
disciplines such as medicine and pharmacology. In view of their differences,
the limitations with regard to the joint data analysis of groups of SE
replications and the guidelines provided in mature experimental disciplines to
analyze groups of replications, we build an analysis procedure with a set of
embedded guidelines specifically tailored to the analysis of groups of SE

contained within the raw data should be leveraged during the aggregation of

of stratified individual participant data and aggregated data in tandem to
analyze groups of SE replications. Conclusion: The aggregation techniques used
to analyze groups of replications should be justified in research articles.

units that perform an atomic operation while communicating the results through
an operand delivery-aggregation logic. Each single unit processes all the bits

only responsible for a slice of the bit-level operations to interleave and
combine the benefits of bit-level parallelism with the abundant data-level
parallelism in deep neural networks. A dynamic collection of these units
cooperate at runtime to generate bits of the results, collectively. Such
cooperation requires extracting new grouping between the bits, which is only
possible if the operands and operations are vectorizable. The abundance of Data
Level Parallelism and mostly repeated execution patterns, provides a unique
opportunity to define and leverage this new dimension of Bit-Parallel Vector
Composability. This design intersperses bit parallelism within data-level
parallelism and dynamically interweaves the two together. As such, the building
block of our neural accelerator is a Composable Vector Unit that is a
collection of Narrower-Bitwidth Vector Engines, which are dynamically composed
or decomposed at the bit granularity. Using six diverse CNN and LSTM deep
networks, we evaluate this design style across four design points: with and
without algorithmic bitwidth heterogeneity and with and without availability of

Vector Composability brings (1.4x to 3.5x) speedup and (1.1x to 2.7x) energy

is closely related to the block length of error correcting codes (ECCs) and
log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs) of the read-voltage thresholds. Driven by this
issue, this paper optimizes the read-voltage thresholds for MLC flash memory to
improve the decoding performance of ECCs with finite block length. First,
through the analysis of channel coding rate (CCR) and decoding error
probability under finite block length, we formulate the optimization problem of
read-voltage thresholds to minimize the maximum decoding error probability.
Second, we develop a cross iterative search (CIS) algorithm to optimize
read-voltage thresholds under the perfect knowledge of flash memory channel.
However, it is challenging to analytically characterize the voltage
distribution under the effect of data retention noise (DRN), since the data
retention time (DRT) is hard to be recorded for flash memory in reality. To
address this problem, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) aided optimization
strategy to optimize the read-voltage thresholds, where a multi-layer
perception (MLP) network is employed to learn the relationship between voltage
distribution and read-voltage thresholds. Simulation results show that,
compared with the existing schemes, the proposed DNN-aided read-voltage
threshold optimization strategy with a well-designed LDPC code can not only
improve the program-and-erase (PE) endurance but also reduce the read latency.

compatibility is based on the functional form of the speed of sound squared,

squared should be between 0 and speed of light squared provides constraints on
model parameters using analytical and numerical methods. It is found that this

Although end-to-end fully convolutional designs have recently advanced the

trade-off is still sub-optimal. Existing approaches achieve a large receptive
field by increasing the number of generic convolution layers and kernel-size,
but this comes at the expense of of the increase in model size and inference
speed. In this work, we propose an efficient pixel adaptive and feature
attentive design for handling large blur variations across different spatial

content-aware global-local filtering module that significantly improves
performance by considering not only global dependencies but also by dynamically
exploiting neighbouring pixel information. We use a patch-hierarchical
attentive architecture composed of the above module that implicitly discovers
the spatial variations in the blur present in the input image and in turn,
performs local and global modulation of intermediate features. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative comparisons with prior art on deblurring
benchmarks demonstrate that our design offers significant improvements over the

particle transfers a part of its energy to neutral excitations. Higher-order
(in screened Coulomb interaction $W$) self-energy diagrams lead to improved
electron spectral functions (SF) by taking more complicated scattering channels
into account and by adding corrections to lower order self-energy terms.
However, they also may lead to unphysical negative spectral function. The
resolution of this difficulty has been demonstrated in our previous works. The

systematically extend the method to 2D including realistic systems such as mono

discuss the applicability of this method for the investigation of a broader set
of epitaxial CuMnAs films having different thicknesses. This work reveals that
the equilibrium magnetic anisotropy can be studied only in samples where this
anisotropy is rather strong. However, in the majority of CuMnAs films, the
impact of a strong pump pulse induces nano-fragmentation of the magnetic
domains and, therefore, the magnetic anisotropy measured by the pump-probe
technique differs substantially from that in the equilibrium conditions. We
also demonstrate that optical pump-probe experiment can be used very
efficiently to study the local heating and heat dissipation in CuMnAs epitaxial
layers. In particular, we determined the electron-phonon relaxation time in
CuMnAs. We also observed that for a local film heating by a focused laser the
thinner films are heated more, but the heat is dissipated considerably faster
than in the case of thicker films. This illustrates that the optical pump-probe
experiment is a valuable characterization tool for the heat management
optimization in the CuMnAs memory devices and can be applied in a similar way
to those used during heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology
development for the latest generation of hard drive disks.

thereby explore what conclusions are still valid when going beyond. While many
statistical features remain unaffected (e.g., consistency and error decay
rates), the key difference becomes manifested in how the complexity of the
hypothesis set is measured. It turns out that the estimation error can be
controlled by means of two complexity parameters that arise naturally from a
generic-chaining-based proof strategy. The output model can be non-realizable,
while the only requirement for the input vector is a generic concentration
inequality of Bernstein-type, which can be implemented for a variety of

constrain its lifetime which is currently a major open question to resolve.
Specifically we show that the ratio between the yield of charged pions and that
of charged rhos is very sensitive to the magnetic field value at freeze-out. By
using a viscous-hydrodynamic framework (iEBE-VISHNU) to simulate heavy ion

their yields and predict the dependence of such ratio on the magnetic field. We

argued that set-oriented operations are more efficient and should be preferred
over iteration; but from real-world use cases, it is clear that loops over

users. Such loops, known as cursor loops, come with huge trade-offs and
overheads w.r.t. performance, resource consumption and concurrency.
  We present Aggify, a technique for optimizing loops over query results that
overcomes all these overheads. It achieves this by automatically generating
custom aggregates that are equivalent in semantics to the loop. Thereby, Aggify
completely eliminates the loop by rewriting the query to use this generated
aggregate. This technique has several advantages such as: (i) pipelining of
entire cursor loop operations instead of materialization, (ii) pushing down
loop computation from the application layer into the DBMS, closer to the data,
(iii) leveraging existing work on optimization of aggregate functions,
resulting in efficient query plans. We describe the technique underlying Aggify

difficult to detect. One promising pathway lies in the detection of type II
radio bursts. Their appearance and distinctive properties are associated with
the development of an outward propagating CME-driven shock. However, dedicated
radio searches have not been able to identify these transient features in other
stars. Large Alfv\'en speeds and the magnetic suppression of CMEs in active
stars have been proposed to render stellar eruptions ""radio-quiet"". Employing
3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study here the distribution of the
coronal Alfv\'en speed, focusing on two cases representative of a young
Sun-like star and a mid-activity M-dwarf (Proxima Centauri). These results are
compared with a standard solar simulation and used to characterize the
shock-prone regions in the stellar corona and wind. Furthermore, using a
flux-rope eruption model, we drive realistic CME events within our M-dwarf
simulation. We consider eruptions with different energies to probe the regimes
of weak and partial CME magnetic confinement. While these CMEs are able to
generate shocks in the corona, those are pushed much farther out compared to
their solar counterparts. This drastically reduces the resulting type II radio
burst frequencies down to the ionospheric cutoff, which impedes their detection
with ground-based instrumentation.

exploit the theory of Bayesian Surprise to robustly model expectation and thus
surprise in the context of building structures. We use Isovist Analysis, which
is a popular space syntax technique, to turn qualitative object attributes into
quantitative environmental information. Since isovists are location-specific
patterns of visibility, a sequence of isovists describes the spatial perception
during a movement along multiple points in space. We then use Bayesian Surprise
in a feature space consisting of these isovist readings. To demonstrate the
suitability of our approach, we take ""snapshots"" of an agent's local
environment to provide a short list of images that characterize a traversed
trajectory through a 2D indoor environment. Those fingerprints represent
surprising regions of a tour, characterize the traversed map and enable indoor
LBS to focus more on important regions. Given this idea, we propose to use
""surprise"" as a new dimension of context in indoor location-based services
(LBS). Agents of LBS, such as mobile robots or non-player characters in
computer games, may use the context surprise to focus more on important regions

data into a small number of interpretable factors without any a priori
knowledge about those factors. In this form of factor analysis, the Varimax
""factor rotation"" is a key step to make the factors interpretable. Charles
Spearman and many others objected to factor rotations because the factors seem
to be rotationally invariant. These objections are still reported in all
contemporary multivariate statistics textbooks. This is an engima because this
vintage form of factor analysis has survived and is widely popular because,
empirically, the factor rotation often makes the factors easier to interpret.
We argue that the rotation makes the factors easier to interpret because, in
fact, the Varimax factor rotation performs statistical inference. We show that
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with the Varimax rotation provides a
unified spectral estimation strategy for a broad class of modern factor models,
including the Stochastic Blockmodel and a natural variation of Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (i.e., ""topic modeling""). In addition, we show that Thurstone's
widely employed sparsity diagnostics implicitly assess a key ""leptokurtic""
condition that makes the rotation statistically identifiable in these models.
Taken together, this shows that the know-how of Vintage Factor Analysis
performs statistical inference, reversing nearly a century of statistical
thinking on the topic. With a sparse eigensolver, PCA with Varimax is both fast
and stable. Combined with Thurstone's straightforward diagnostics, this vintage
approach is suitable for a wide array of modern applications.

some of whose properties are characteristic of topological Dirac or Weyl
metals. One of its most interesting properties is the unsaturated giant
magnetoresistance that it exhibits at low temperatures. An important question
is the degree to which this property can be ascribed to a conventional
semi-metallic model in which a highly compensated, high mobility metal exhibits
large magnetoresistance. Here we show that the longitudinal thermopower
(Seebeck effect) of semi-metallic WTe$_2$ exfoliated flakes exhibits periodic
sign changes about zero with increasing magnetic field that indicates distinct
electron and hole Landau levels and nearly fully compensated electron and hole
carrier densities. However, inconsistent with a conventional semi-metallic

mobility transparent conducting material. This promise arises from its low hole
effective masses. However, BP has a relatively small 2 eV indirect band gap
which will affect its transparency. In this work, we computationally study both
optical absorption across the indirect gap and phonon-limited electronic
transport to quantify the potential of boron phosphide as a \emph{p}-type
transparent conductor. We find that phonon-mediated indirect optical absorption
is weak in the visible spectrum and that the phonon-limited hole mobility is
very high (around 900 cm$^2$/Vs) at room temperature. This exceptional mobility
comes from a combination of low hole effective mass and very weak scattering by
polar phonon modes. We rationalize the weak scattering by the less ionic
bonding in boron phosphide compared to oxides. We suggest this could be a
general advantage of non-oxides for \emph{p}-type transparent conducting
applications. Using our computed properties, we assess the transparent
conductor figure of merit of boron phosphide and shows that it exceeds by one
order of magnitude that of established \emph{p}-type transparent conductors,
confirming the potential of this material.

mortality among cardiac ailments. Early diagnosis is crucial in providing
intervention for patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmia. Traditionally,
diagnosis is performed by examination of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) by a
cardiologist. This method of diagnosis is hampered by the lack of accessibility
to expert cardiologists. For quite some time, signal processing methods had
been used to automate arrhythmia diagnosis. However, these traditional methods
require expert knowledge and are unable to model a wide range of arrhythmia.
Recently, Deep Learning methods have provided solutions to performing
arrhythmia diagnosis at scale. However, the black-box nature of these models
prohibit clinical interpretation of cardiac arrhythmia. There is a dire need to
correlate the obtained model outputs to the corresponding segments of the ECG.
To this end, two methods are proposed to provide interpretability to the
models. The first method is a novel application of Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for visualizing the saliency of the CNN model. In the
second approach, saliency is derived by learning the input deletion mask for
the LSTM model. The visualizations are provided on a model whose competence is
established by comparisons against baselines. The results of model saliency not
only provide insight into the prediction capability of the model but also
aligns with the medical literature for the classification of cardiac

with bounded noise under false-data injection attacks. A malicious attacker is
able to arbitrarily manipulate the observations for a time-varying and unknown
subset of the sensors. We first propose a recursive distributed filter
consisting of two steps at each update. The first step employs a
saturation-like scheme, which gives a small gain if the innovation is large
corresponding to a potential attack. The second step is a consensus operation
of state estimates among neighboring sensors. We prove the estimation error is
upper bounded if the filter parameters satisfy a condition. We further analyze
the feasibility of the condition and connect it to sparse observability in the
centralized case. When the attacked sensor set is known to be time-invariant,
the secured filter is modified by adding an online local attack detector. The
detector is able to identify the attacked sensors whose observation innovations
are larger than the detection thresholds. Also, with more attacked sensors
being detected, the thresholds will adaptively adjust to reduce the space of
the stealthy attack signals. The resilience of the secured filter with
detection is verified by an explicit relationship between the upper bound of
the estimation error and the number of detected attacked sensors. Moreover, for
the noise-free case, we prove that the state estimate of each sensor
asymptotically converges to the system state under certain conditions.

time (FPT) of a diffusive searcher to a target. Typically, this FPT is much
slower than the characteristic diffusion timescale. For example, this is the
case if the target is small (the narrow escape problem) or if the searcher must
escape a potential well. However, many systems depend on the first time a
searcher finds the target out of a large group of searchers, which is the
so-called extreme FPT. Since this extreme FPT vanishes in the limit of many
searchers, the prohibitively slow FPTs of diffusive search can be negated by
deploying enough searchers. However, the notion of ""enough searchers"" is poorly
understood. How can one determine if a system is in the slow regime (dominated
by small targets or a deep potential, for example) or the fast regime
(dominated by many searchers)? How can one estimate the extreme FPT in these
different regimes? In this paper, we answer these questions by deriving
conditions which ensure that a system is in either regime and finding
approximations of the full distribution and all the moments of the extreme FPT
in these regimes. Our analysis reveals the critical effect that initial

magnitude and inter-event time (IET), for three different categories of
earthquakes: regular earthquakes, earthquake swarms, and tectonic tremors.
Following the criterion of visibility graph, earthquake time series are mapped
into a complex network by considering each seismic event as a node and
determining the links. As opposed to the current common belief, it is found
that the magnitude time series are not statistically equivalent to random time
series. The IET series exhibit correlations similar to fractional Brownian
motion for all the categories of earthquakes. Furthermore, we show that the
time series of three different categories of earthquakes can be distinguished
by the topology of the associated visibility graph. Analysis on the
assortativity coefficient also reveals that the swarms are more intermittent
than the tremors.

challenge for agencies since optimizing the assignment of vehicles to transit
routes, scheduling charging, etc. require accurate predictions of electricity

machine learning enable remedying this situation; however, to the best of our
knowledge, there exists no framework that would integrate all relevant data
into a route-level prediction model for public transit. In this paper, we
present a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of route-level energy

construct and analyze a two-dimensional deterministic fluid model that

CNN-based segmentation models trained by a training dataset fail to segment

and adversarial attack concepts. Based on the DATA scheme, the distribution of
the input images can be shifted to that of the target images while turning
images into adversarial examples against a target network. Defending
adversarial examples adapted to the target domain can overcome the performance
degradation due to the domain gap and increase the robustness of the
segmentation model. Cross-dataset experiments and the ablation study are
conducted for the three different datasets: the Inria aerial image labeling

Compared to the performance of the segmentation network without the DATA

Given a collection of preferences (rankings of a set of alternatives), we aim
at determining a connected graph G on which the preferences are single-peaked,
in the sense that all the preferences are traversals of G. Note that a
collection of preferences is always single-peaked on the complete graph. We
propose an Integer Linear Programming formulation (ILP) of the problem of
minimizing the number of edges in G or the maximum degree of a vertex in G. We
prove that both problems are NP-hard in the general case. However, we show that
if the optimal number of edges is m-1 (where m is the number of candidates)
then any optimal solution of the ILP is integer and thus the integrality
constraints can be relaxed. This provides an alternative proof of the
polynomial-time complexity of recognizing single-peaked preferences on a tree.
We prove the same result for the case of a path (an axis), providing here also
an alternative proof of polynomiality of the recognition problem. Furthermore,
we provide a polynomial-time procedure to recognize single-peaked preferences
on a pseudotree (a connected graph that contains at most one cycle). We also
give some experimental results, both on real and synthetic datasets.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In mobile edge computing systems, an edge node may have a high load when a
large number of mobile devices offload their tasks to it. Those offloaded tasks
may experience large processing delay or even be dropped when their deadlines
expire. Due to the uncertain load dynamics at the edge nodes, it is challenging
for each device to determine its offloading decision (i.e., whether to offload
or not, and which edge node it should offload its task to) in a decentralized
manner. In this work, we consider non-divisible and delay-sensitive tasks as
well as edge load dynamics, and formulate a task offloading problem to minimize
the expected long-term cost. We propose a model-free deep reinforcement
learning-based distributed algorithm, where each device can determine its
offloading decision without knowing the task models and offloading decision of
other devices. To improve the estimation of the long-term cost in the
algorithm, we incorporate the long short-term memory (LSTM), dueling deep
Q-network (DQN), and double-DQN techniques. Simulation results with 50 mobile
devices and five edge nodes show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the
ratio of dropped tasks and average task delay by 86.4%-95.4% and 18.0%-30.1%,
respectively, when compared with several existing algorithms.

  Things Devices with Energy Harvesting Capabilities",,,"10.1016/j.compag.2020.105338",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Technological advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) have lead the way for
technology to be used in ways that were never possible before. Through the
development of devices with low-power radios, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
can be configured for almost any type of application. Agricultural has been one
example where IoT and WSN have been able to increase productivity, efficiency,
and output yield. Systems that previously required manual operation can be
easily replaced with sensors and actuators to automate the process such as
irrigation and disease management. Powering these devices is a concern as
batteries are often required due to devices being located where electricity is
not readily available. In this paper, a comparison is performed between three
wireless technologies: IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), Long Range Wireless Area Network
(LoRaWAN), and IEEE 802.11g (WiFi 2.4~GHz) for agricultural monitoring with
energy harvesting capabilities. According to experimental results, LoRaWAN is
the optimal technology to use in an agricultural monitoring system where power
consumption and network lifetime are a priority. The experimental results can
be used for the selection of wireless technology for agricultural monitoring
following application requirements.

  Streaming",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  360-degree video streaming provides users with immersive experience by
letting users determine their field-of-views (FoVs) in real time. To enhance
the users' quality of experience (QoE) given their limited bandwidth, recent
works have proposed a viewport adaptive 360-degree video streaming model by
exploiting the bitrate adaptation in spatial and temporal domains. Under this
video streaming model, in this paper, we consider a scenario with a newly
generated 360-degree video without viewing history from other users. To
maximize the user's QoE, we propose an online bitrate selection algorithm,
called OBS360. The proposed online algorithm can adapt to the unknown and
heterogeneous users' FoVs and downloading capacities. We prove that the
proposed algorithm achieves sublinear dynamic regret under a convex decision
set. This suggests that as the number of video segments increases, the
performance of the online algorithm approaches the performance of the offline
algorithm, where the users' FoVs and downloading capacities are known. We
perform simulations with real-world dataset to evaluate the performance of the
proposed algorithm. Results show that compared with several existing methods,
our proposed algorithm can enhance the users' QoE significantly by improving
the viewing bitrate and reducing the inter-segment and intra-segment
degradation losses of the users.

ReS2 has stood out due to its nearly layer-independent optoelectronic and
physicochemical properties. These are related to its 1T distorted octahedral
structure, which leads to strong in-plane anisotropy and the presence of active
sites at its surface, which makes ReS2 interesting for applications such as gas
sensors and catalysts for H2 production. However, the current fabrication
methods for ReS2 use chemical or physical vapor deposition (CVD or PVD)
processes that are costly and involve complex and lengthy fabrication
procedures, therefore limiting their large-scale production and exploitation.
To address this issue, we developed a colloidal synthesis approach, which
allows the production of ReS2 to be attained at temperatures below 360 Celsius
degrees and with reaction times < 2 h, resulting in a more cost-efficient
strategy than the CVD and PVD methods. By combining the solution-based
synthesis with surface functionalization strategies, we demonstrate the
feasibility of colloidal ReS2 nanosheet films for gas sensing of different
toxic gases, moisture and other volatile compounds with highly competitive
performance in comparison with devices built with CVD-grown ReS2 and MoS2. In
addition, the integration of the ReS2 nanosheet films in assemblies, in which
they are deposited on top of networks of carbon nanotubes, allowed us to
fabricate electrodes for electrocatalysis for H2 production in both acid and
alkaline conditions. Results from proof-of-principle devices show an
electrocatalytic overpotential that is competitive with devices based on ReS2
produced by CVD, and even with MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2 electrocatalysts.

inequities when pursuing an education, especially in STEM disciplines with
little diversity. In order to make STEM education equitable and inclusive,
evidence for how students from different racial/ethnic demographics are faring
is necessary. We use 10 years of institutional data at a large public
university to investigate trends in the majors that Asian, URM, and White
students declare, drop after declaring, and earn degrees in as well as the GPA
of the students who drop or earn a degree. We find that higher percentages of
the URM students drop most majors compared to other students and these trends
are particularly pronounced in physics and economics. Moreover, we find
alarming GPA trends in that the URM students consistently earn lower grades
than their Asian and White peers. Furthermore, in some STEM disciplines, the
URM students who earn a degree are earning the same grades as the Asian and
White students who dropped the major. This troubling trend may signify lack of
sufficient support, mentoring, and guidance to ensure excellence of the URM
students who are already severely disadvantaged. These quantitative findings
call for making learning environments equitable and inclusive so that many URM
students who come to college with severe disadvantages are appropriately
supported and can excel similar to other students.
