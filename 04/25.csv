  Approach",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Internet forums and public social media, such as online healthcare forums,
provide a convenient channel for users (people/patients) concerned about health
issues to discuss and share information with each other. In late December 2019,
an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (infection from which results in the disease
named COVID-19) was reported, and, due to the rapid spread of the virus in
other parts of the world, the World Health Organization declared a state of
emergency. In this paper, we used automated extraction of COVID-19 related
discussions from social media and a natural language process (NLP) method based
on topic modeling to uncover various issues related to COVID-19 from public
opinions. Moreover, we also investigate how to use LSTM recurrent neural
network for sentiment classification of COVID-19 comments. Our findings shed
light on the importance of using public opinions and suitable computational
techniques to understand issues surrounding COVID-19 and to guide related
decision-making.

off-the-shelf deep neural network architecture that is able to detect and
recognize types of unsigned (non-placarded, such as traffic signs), physical
(visible in images) road incidents. We develop a taxonomy for unsigned physical
incidents to provide a means of organizing and grouping related incidents.
After selecting eight target types of incidents, we collect a dataset of twelve
thousand images gathered from publicly-available web sources. We subsequently
fine-tune a convolutional neural network to recognize the eight types of road
incidents. The proposed model is able to recognize incidents with a high level
of accuracy (higher than 90%). We further show that while our system
generalizes well across spatial context by training a classifier on
geostratified data in the United Kingdom (with an accuracy of over 90%), the
translation to visually less similar environments requires spatially
distributed data collection.

given in a functional analytic setting and the efficient numerical construction
of the reduced order models as well as of their application for the numerical

high efficiency. The theoretical results are illustrated by application to a

performance. In both transmission protocols, the users use the minimum
mean-squared error-based successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) scheme
to detect the desired signals. For the analysis, we first derive a general
spectral efficiency formula with arbitrary side information at the users. Then
analytical expressions for the spectral efficiency of different transmission

max-min fairness power control (PC) is applied for the first protocol by using
the closed-form expression of its SE. Due to the computation complexity of
deriving the closed-form performance expression of SE for the second protocol,
we apply the optimal power coefficients of the first protocol to the second

the so-called instant preheating which is used for a very smooth phase

show that, at large on-site disorder and for short-range interactions, a
transition from a delocalized phase to a quasi many-body localized (MBL) phase
exists as the hopping range is decreased. This quasi-MBL phase is characterized
by intriguing properties such as a set of emergent conserved quantities which
decay algebraically with distance. Surprisingly we find that a crossover

time delays in gravitational lensing. In the original paper of Shapiro (1964),
it is stated that there is a time delay in the radar signals between Earth and
Venus that pass near a massive object (the Sun), compared to the path taken in
the absence of any mass. The reason for this delay is connected with the
influence of gravity on the coordinate velocity of a light ray in a
gravitational potential. The contribution from the change of the path length,
which happens to be of second order, is considered as negligible. Nevertheless,
in the gravitational lens theory the geometrical delay, related to the change
of path length, is routinely taken into account along with the potential term.
In this work we explain this apparent discrepancy. We address the contribution
of the geometric part of the time delay in different situations, and introduce
a unified treatment with two limiting regimes of lensing. One of these limits
corresponds to the time delay experiments near the Sun where the geometrical
delay is shown to be negligible. The second corresponds to the typical
gravitational lens scenario with multiple imaging where the geometrical delay
is shown to be significant. We introduce a compact, analytical, and
quantitative criteria based on relation between the angular position of source
and the Einstein radius. This criterion allows one to find out easily when it
is necessary to take the geometrical delay into account. In particular, it is
shown that the geometrical delay is non-negligible in the case of good
alignment between source, lens and observer, because in such a case it becomes
a first order quantity (the same order as the potential term).

types of properties to capture relevant aspects of the system's run-time

static aspects like stability, as well as dynamic properties that capture the

self-adaptive systems consider mostly non-functional properties that capture
concerns such as performance, reliability, and cost. In general, it is not easy
to reconcile these two types of properties or identify under which conditions
they constitute a good fit to provide run-time guarantees. There is a need of
identifying the key properties in the areas of control and self-adaptation, as
well as of characterizing and mapping them to better understand how they relate

tackle this problem by: (1) identifying a set of key properties in control
theory, (2) illustrating the formalization of some of these properties
employing temporal logic languages commonly used to engineer self-adaptive
software systems, and (3) illustrating how to map key properties that
characterize self-adaptive software systems into control properties, leveraging

approach to decomposing and characterizing the sensor noise sources involved in
imaging with digital cameras. A Bayesian probabilistic model based on the
(theoretical) model for noise sources in image sensing is fitted to a set of a
time-series of images with different reflectance and wavelengths under
controlled lighting conditions. The image sensing model is a complex model,
with several interacting components dependent on reflectance and wavelength.
The properties of the Bayesian approach of defining conditional dependencies
among parameters in a fully probabilistic model, propagating all sources of
uncertainty in inference, makes the Bayesian modeling framework more attractive
and powerful than classical methods for approaching the image sensing model. A
feasible correspondence of noise parameters to their expected theoretical
behaviors and well calibrated posterior predictive distributions with a small
root mean square error for model predictions have been achieved in this study,
thus showing that the proposed model accurately approximates the image sensing

prevent continued viral spread and excess morbidity and mortality. This study
aimed to determine whether alternative testing strategies based on sample
pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2.
  Methods: A mathematical modelling approach was chosen to simulate six
different testing strategies based on key input parameters (infection rate,
test characteristics, population size, testing capacity etc.). The situations
in five countries (US, DE, UK, IT and SG) currently experiencing COVID-19
outbreaks were simulated to reflect a broad variety of population sizes and
testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements that were finalised
prior to any data collection were time and number of tests required; number of
cases identified; and number of false positives.
  Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input
parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen
one tenth of each country's population at an infection rate of 1% - e.g. when
prioritising frontline medical staff and public workers -, realistic optimised
testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the
US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany (ca. eight
times faster compared to individual testing). When infection rates are
considerably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically more complex
pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also
reduces the number of false positive diagnoses by 50%.
  Interpretation: The results of this study provide a clear rationale for
adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of
testing for SARS-CoV-2. The current individual testing approach unnecessarily
wastes valuable time and resources.

decoder for generation. In this work, by contrast, we hypothesize that these
encoder outputs can be compressed to shorten the sequence delivered for
decoding. We take Transformer as the testbed and introduce a layer of
stochastic gates in-between the encoder and the decoder. The gates are
regularized using the expected value of the sparsity-inducing L0penalty,
resulting in completely masking-out a subset of encoder outputs. In other
words, via joint training, the L0DROP layer forces Transformer to route
information through a subset of its encoder states. We investigate the effects
of this sparsification on two machine translation and two summarization tasks.
Experiments show that, depending on the task, around 40-70% of source encodings
can be pruned without significantly compromising quality. The decrease of the
output length endows L0DROP with the potential of improving decoding
efficiency, where it yields a speedup of up to 1.65x on document summarization
tasks against the standard Transformer. We analyze the L0DROP behaviour and
observe that it exhibits systematic preferences for pruning certain word types,
e.g., function words and punctuation get pruned most. Inspired by these
observations, we explore the feasibility of specifying rule-based patterns that
mask out encoder outputs based on information such as part-of-speech tags, word
frequency and word position.

of minor agents is considered. The major agent affects the minor agents, but
not vice versa. The state of the major agent is observed by all agents. In
addition, the minor agents have a noisy observation of their local state. The
noise processes is \emph{not} assumed to be Gaussian. The structures of the
optimal strategy and the best linear strategy are characterized. It is shown
that major agent's optimal control action is a linear function of the major
agent's MMSE (minimum mean squared error) estimate of the system state while
the minor agent's optimal control action is a linear function of the major
agent's MMSE estimate of the system state and a ""correction term"" which depends
on the difference of the minor agent's MMSE estimate of its local state and the
major agent's MMSE estimate of the minor agent's local state. Since the noise
is non-Gaussian, the minor agent's MMSE estimate is a non-linear function of
its observation. It is shown that replacing the minor agent's MMSE estimate by
its LLMS (linear least mean square) estimate gives the best linear control
strategy. The results are proved using a direct method based on conditional
independence, common-information-based splitting of state and control actions,
and simplifying the per-step cost based on conditional independence,
orthogonality principle, and completion of squares.

and continuous) Fr\'echet distance between uncertain curves. We define an
uncertain curve as a sequence of uncertainty regions, where each region is a
disk, a line segment, or a set of points. A realisation of a curve is a
polyline connecting one point from each region. Given an uncertain curve and a
second (certain or uncertain) curve, we seek to compute the lower and upper
bound Fr\'echet distance, which are the minimum and maximum Fr\'echet distance
for any realisations of the curves.
  We prove that both the upper and lower bound problems are NP-hard for the
continuous Fr\'echet distance in several uncertainty models, and that the upper
bound problem remains hard for the discrete Fr\'echet distance. In contrast,
the lower bound (discrete and continuous) Fr\'echet distance can be computed in
polynomial time. Furthermore, we show that computing the expected discrete
Fr\'echet distance is #P-hard when the uncertainty regions are modelled as
point sets or line segments. The construction also extends to show #P-hardness
for computing the continuous Fr\'echet distance when regions are modelled as
point sets.
  On the positive side, we argue that in any constant dimension there is a
FPTAS for the lower bound problem when $\Delta / \delta$ is polynomially
bounded, where $\delta$ is the Fr\'echet distance and $\Delta$ bounds the
diameter of the regions. We then argue there is a near-linear-time
3-approximation for the decision problem when the regions are convex and
roughly $\delta$-separated. Finally, we also study the setting with
Sakoe--Chiba time bands, where we restrict the alignment between the two
curves, and give polynomial-time algorithms for upper bound and expected
discrete and continuous Fr\'echet distance for uncertainty regions modelled as

convection of vortical structures across a grid refinement interface is likely
to generate spurious noise that may impact the whole computation domain. This
issue becomes critical in the case of aeroacoustic simulations, where accurate
pressure estimations are of paramount importance. The purpose of this article
is to identify the issues occurring at the interface and to propose possible
solutions yielding significant improvements for aeroacoustic simulations. More
specifically, this study highlights the critical involvement of non-physical
modes in the generation of spurious vorticity and acoustics. The identification
of these modes is made possible thanks to linear stability analyses performed
in the fluid core, and non-hydrodynamic sensors specifically developed to
systematically emphasize them during a simulation. Investigations seeking pure
acoustic waves and sheared flows allow for isolating the contribution of each
mode. An important result is that spurious wave generation is intrinsically due
to the change in the grid resolution (i.e. aliasing) independently of the
details of the grid transition algorithm. Finally, the solution proposed to
minimize spurious wave amplitude consists of choosing an appropriate collision
model in the fluid core so as to cancel the non-hydrodynamic mode contribution
regardless the grid coupling algorithm. Results are validated on a convected
vortex and on a turbulent flow around a cylinder where a huge reduction of both
spurious noise and vorticity are obtained.

(masses and spins). For this particular model of the input physics the overall

with information on the identity of the antigen, this method should provide a
source of effective new antibodies. We also introduce a method for a related

little is known about the spectral energy distribution (SED) between the Lyman
limit, where intervening absorption becomes a problem, and 0.3 keV, where soft
x-ray observations become possible. The emission lines themselves can, to some
degree, be used to probe the SED, but only in the broadest terms. This paper
employs a new generation of theoretical SEDs which are internally
self-consistent, energy-conserving, and tested against observations, to infer
properties of the emission-line regions. The SEDs are given as a function of
the Eddington ratio, allowing emission-line correlations to be investigated on
a fundamental basis. We apply the simplest possible tests, based on the
foundations of photoionization theory, to investigate the implications for the
geometry of the emission-line region. The SEDs become more far-ultraviolet
bright as the Eddington ratio increases, so the equivalent widths of
recombination lines should also become larger, an effect which we quantify. The
observed lack of correlation between Eddington ratio and equivalent width shows
that the cloud covering factor must decrease as Eddington ratio increases. This
would be consistent with recent models proposing that the broad-line region is
a failed dusty wind off the accretion disc.

the power consumption by operating the system closer to the lower acceptable
voltage limits; this technique is called conservation voltage reduction (CVR).
The different modes of operation for system's legacy devices (with binary
control) and new devices (e.g. smart inverters with continuous control) coupled
with variable photovoltaic (PV) generation results in voltage fluctuations
which makes it challenging to achieve CVR objective. This paper presents a
two-timescale control of feeder's voltage control devices to achieve CVR that
includes (1) a centralized controller operating in a slower time-scale to
coordinate voltage control devices across the feeder and (2) local controllers
operating in a faster timescale to mitigate voltage fluctuations due to PV
variability. The centralized controller utilizes a three-phase optimal power
flow model to obtain the decision variables for both legacy devices and smart
inverters. The local controllers operate smart inverters to minimize voltage
fluctuations and restore nodal voltages to their reference values by adjusting
the reactive power support. The proposed approach is validated using the

demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective in achieving the CVR

condensate (GGC) model. This model is an extension of the cubic covariant
Galileon (G3) which includes a field derivative of type
$(\nabla_\mu\phi\nabla^\mu\phi)^2$ in the Lagrangian. We find that the cubic
term activates the modifications in the main physical quantities whose time
evolution is then strongly affected by the additional term. Indeed, the GGC
model shows largely mitigated effects in the linearised critical density
contrast, non-linear effective gravitational coupling and the virial
overdensity with respect to G3 but still preserves peculiar features with
respect to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, e.g. both the linear
critical density contrast and the virial overdensity are larger than those in
$\Lambda$CDM. The results of the spherical collapse model are then used to
predict the evolution of the halo mass function, non-linear matter and lensing
power spectra. While at low masses the GGC model presents about 10% fewer
objects with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, at higher masses for $z>0$ it predicts
10% ($z=0.5$)-20% ($z=1$) more objects per comoving volume. Using a
phenomenological approach to include the screening effect in the matter power
spectrum, we show that the difference induced by the modifications of gravity
are strongly dependent on the screening scale and that differences can be up to
20% with respect to $\Lambda$CDM. These differences translate to the lensing
power spectrum where qualitatively the largest differences with respect to the
standard cosmological model are for $\ell<10^3$. Depending on the screening
scale, they can be up to 25% on larger angular scales and then decrease for
growing $\ell$. These results are obtained for the best fit parameters from
linear cosmological data for each model.

correlations according to two scenarios based on level-repulsion (conventional
blockade) or interferences (unconventional blockade). Here we show how these
two approaches relate to the admixing of a coherent state with a quantum state

from a variety of systems, such as resonance fluorescence, the Jaynes-Cummings

further be doctored-up externally by adding an amplitude- and phase-controlled
coherent field with the effect of tuning the photon statistics from exactly
zero to infinity. We show how such an understanding also allows to classify
photon statistics throughout platforms according to conventional and

closed-loop double V-type quantum system, the linear and nonlinear
susceptibility of the nonvortex probe beam depends on the azimuthal angle and
orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the vortex probe beam. This feature is
missing in open four-level double V-type quantum system interacting with
free-space vacuum, as no quantum interference occurs in this case. We use the
azimuthal dependence of optical susceptibility of the quantum system to
determine the regions of spatially-structured transmittance.

emission in the He II 1640 Angstrom emission line and continuum colour in the

timely problems in the wake of the LIGO/Virgo discoveries. In active galactic
nuclei (AGN), binaries form and evolve efficiently by dynamical interactions
and gaseous dissipation. Previous studies have suggested that binary black hole
(BBH) mergers in AGN disks can contribute significantly to BBH mergers observed
by GW interferometers. Here we examine the distribution of the effective spin
parameter $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ of this GW source population. We extend our
semi-analytical model of binary formation and evolution in AGN disks by
following the evolution of the binary orbital angular momenta and black hole
(BH) spins. BH spins change due to gas accretion and BH mergers, while the
binary orbital angular momenta evolve due to gas accretion and binary-single
interactions. We find that the distribution of $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ predicted by
our AGN model is similar to the distribution observed during LIGO/Virgo O1 and
O2. On the other hand, if radial migration of BHs is inefficient,
$\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ is skewed toward higher values compared with the observed
distribution, because of the paucity of scattering events that would randomize
spin directions relative to the orbital plane. We suggest that high binary
masses and the positive correlation between binary mass and the standard
deviation of $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ for chirp masses up to $\approx 20$
$\mathrm{M}_\odot$, can be possible signatures for mergers originating in AGN
disks. Finally, hierarchical mergers in AGN disks naturally produce properties
of the recent GW event GW190412, including a low mass ratio, a high primary BH
spin, and a significant spin component in the orbital plane.

including gapped and gapless spin liquids and valence bond crystals. Here we
revisit the crossover from this quantum RVB phase to a semiclassical regime
brought about by anisotropic Kitaev interactions, and focus on the precise
mechanisms underpinning this crossover. To this end, we introduce a simple
parametrization of the classical ground states (GSs) in terms of emergent
Ising-like variables, and use this parametrizaton: i) to construct an effective
low-energy description of the order-by-disorder mechanism operating in a large
part of the phase diagram, and ii) to contrast, side by side, exact
diagonalization data obtained from the full basis with that obtained from the
restricted (orthonormalized) basis of classical GSs. The results reveal that
fluctuation corrections from states outside the restricted basis are strongly
quenched inside the semiclassical regime (due to the large anisotropy spin
gaps), and that the RVB phase survives up to a relatively large value of Kitaev
anisotropy $K$. We further find that the pure Kitaev model admits a
subextensive number of one-dimensional symmetries, which explains naturally the
absence of classical and quantum order by disorder reported previously.

the stellar mass range $10^{9.25}\le M_\star \le 10^{11.5}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ with
a scatter of 0.12 dex. At any given mass, reference cluster and stripping
galaxies have similar metallicities, while the field galaxies with $M_\star <

in clusters. Our results indicate that at the effective radius the chemical
properties of the stripping galaxies are independent of the ram-pressure
stripping mechanism. Nonetheless, at the lowest masses we detect 4 stripping
galaxies well above the common MZR that suggest a more complex scenario.
Overall, we find signs of an anti-correlation between the metallicity and both
the star formation rate and the galaxy size, in agreement with previous
studies. No significant trends are instead found with the halo mass,
clustercentric distance and local galaxy density in clusters. In conclusion, we

transmitter has access to a different channel estimate, possibly with different
precision. It has been recently shown that, for some regimes, this setting
attains the same Degrees-of-Freedom as the ideal centralized setting with
perfect CSI sharing, in which all the transmitters are endowed with the best
estimate available at any transmitter. This result is restricted by the
limitations of the DoF metric, as it only provides information about the slope
of growth of the capacity as a function of the SNR, without any insight about
the possible performance at a given SNR. To overcome this limitation, we
analyze the affine approximation of the rate on the high-SNR regime for this
decentralized Network MISO setting for the antenna configurations in which it
achieves the DoF of the centralized setting. We show that, for a regime of
antenna configurations, it is possible to asymptotically attain the same
achievable rate as in the ideal centralized scenario. Consequently, it is
possible to achieve the beamforming gain of the ideal perfect-CSI-sharing
setting even if only a subset of transmitters is endowed with precise CSI,
which can be exploited in scenarios such as distributed massive MIMO where the
number of transmit antennas is much bigger than the number of served users.
This outcome is a consequence of the synergistic compromise between CSI
precision at the transmitters and consistency between the locally-computed
precoders, which is an inherent trade-off of decentralized settings that does
not exist in a centralized CSI configuration. We propose a precoding scheme
achieving the previous result, which is built on an uneven structure in which
some transmitters reduce the precision of their own precoding for the sake of
using transmission parameters that can be more easily predicted by the other
transmitters.

model. A likelihood analysis for smooth components of the model yields a scale
height $z_0=1.57^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$ kpc and a mid-plane density $n_0=0.015 \pm
0.001$ cm$^{-3}$. The scatter in the DM-distance distribution is dominated by
clumps and voids but receives significant contributions from a broad spectrum
of density fluctuations, such as a Kolmogorov spectrum. The model is used to
identify lines of sight with outlier values of DM. Three of these pulsars,
J1614$-$2230, J1623$-$0908, and J1643$-$1224, lie behind known HII regions, and
the electron density model is combined with H$\alpha$ intensity data to
constrain the filling factors and other substructure properties of the HII
regions (Sh 2-7 and Sh 2-27). Several pulsars also exhibit enhanced DM
fluctuations that are likely caused by their lines of sight intersecting the
superbubble GSH 238+00+09.

the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The recent emerging Graph Signal
Processing field can also contribute to enabling the IoT by providing key
tools, such as graph filters, for processing the data associated with the
sensor devices. Graph filters can be performed over WSNs in a distributed
manner by means of a certain number of communication exchanges among the nodes.
But, WSNs are often affected by interferences and noise, which leads to view
these networks as directed, random and time-varying graph topologies. Most of
existing works neglect this problem by considering an unrealistic assumption
that claims the same probability of link activation in both directions when
sending a packet between two neighboring nodes. This work focuses on the
problem of operating graph filtering in random asymmetric WSNs. We show first
that graph filtering with finite impulse response graph filters (node-invariant
and node-variant) requires having equal connectivity probabilities for all the
links in order to have an unbiased filtering, which can not be achieved in
practice in random WSNs. After this, we characterize the graph filtering error
and present an efficient strategy to conduct graph filtering tasks over random
WSNs with node-variant graph filters by maximizing accuracy, that is, ensuring
a small bias-variance trade-off. In order to enforce the desired accuracy, we
optimize the filter coefficients and design a cross-layer distributed
scheduling algorithm at the MAC layer. Extensive numerical experiments are
presented to show the efficiency of the proposed solution as well as the
cross-layer distributed scheduling algorithm for the denoising application.

the diffusion coefficient of the first chemical species $d_u$ tends to $0$ and
the diffusion coefficient of the second chemical species ${d_v}$ tends to $+
\infty$. The strategy of the proof consists in two main steps. First, we
establish the local-controllability of the reaction-diffusion ODE-PDE derived
from the Gray-Scott model taking $d_u=0$, and uniformly with respect to the
diffusion parameter ${d_v} \in (1, +\infty)$. In order to do this, we prove the

aim is to introduce a numerical tool that allows us to address complex problems

ionization equilibrium are important or high resolution is needed. The primary
application of this tool is for solar atmosphere calculations, but the methods
and results presented here may also have a potential impact on other

atmosphere Bifrost code that improves its computational capabilities of the
ambipolar diffusion term in the Generalized Ohm's Law. This module includes,
among other things, collision terms adequate to processes in the coolest
regions in the solar chromosphere. As a key feature of the module, we have
implemented the Super Time-Stepping (STS) technique, that allows an important
acceleration of the calculations. We have also introduced hyperdiffusion terms
to guarantee the stability of the code. We show that to have an accurate value

information from complex input data, which involves making a decision about
which input features are relevant. The information bottleneck method formalizes
this as an information-theoretic optimization problem by maintaining an optimal
tradeoff between compression (throwing away irrelevant input information), and
predicting the target. In many problem settings, including the reinforcement
learning problems we consider in this work, we might prefer to compress only
part of the input. This is typically the case when we have a standard
conditioning input, such as a state observation, and a ""privileged"" input,
which might correspond to the goal of a task, the output of a costly planning
algorithm, or communication with another agent. In such cases, we might prefer
to compress the privileged input, either to achieve better generalization
(e.g., with respect to goals) or to minimize access to costly information
(e.g., in the case of communication). Practical implementations of the
information bottleneck based on variational inference require access to the
privileged input in order to compute the bottleneck variable, so although they
perform compression, this compression operation itself needs unrestricted,
lossless access. In this work, we propose the variational bandwidth bottleneck,
which decides for each example on the estimated value of the privileged
information before seeing it, i.e., only based on the standard input, and then
accordingly chooses stochastically, whether to access the privileged input or
not. We formulate a tractable approximation to this framework and demonstrate
in a series of reinforcement learning experiments that it can improve

a promising additional merger channel, because of the powerful influence of the
gas that drives orbital evolution, makes encounters dissipative, and leads to
migration. Previous work showed that stellar mass black holes (sBHs) in an AGN
disk migrate to regions of the disk, known as migration traps, where positive
and negative gas torques cancel out, leading to frequent BBH formation. Here we
build on that work by simulating the evolution of additional sBHs that enter
the inner disk by either migration or inclination reduction. We also examine
whether the BBHs formed in our models have retrograde or prograde orbits around
their centers of mass with respect to the disk, determining the orientation,
relative to the disk, of the spin of the merged BBHs. Orbiters entering the
inner disk form BBHs with sBHs on resonant orbits near the migration trap. When
these sBHs reach ~80 Msun, they form BBHs with sBHs in the migration trap,
which over 10 Myr reach ~1000 Msun. We find 68% of the BBHs in our simulation
orbit in the retrograde direction, which implies BBHs in our merger channel
will have small dimensionless aligned spins, \chi_eff. Overall, our models
produce BBHs that resemble both the majority of BBH mergers detected thus far

resemblance of a graph to a path. A popular definition of pathwidth is given in
terms of node search where we are given a system of tunnels that is

strategy that, at each step, either places a searcher on a vertex or removes a
searcher from a vertex and where an edge is cleaned when both endpoints are
simultaneously occupied by searchers. It was proved that the minimum number of
searchers required for a successful cleaning strategy is equal to the pathwidth
of the graph plus one. Two desired characteristics for a cleaning strategy is
to be monotone (no recontamination occurs) and connected (clean territories
always remain connected). Under these two demands, the number of searchers is
equivalent to a variant of pathwidth called {\em connected pathwidth}. We prove
that connected pathwidth is fixed parameter tractable, in particular we design

of data, enabling new possibilities for sociological urban field studies.
Sensor data such as those related to the location or the movements of the user
can be used to investigate and have insights on the time diaries' answers and
assess their overall quality. The key idea is that the users' answers are used
to train machine-learning algorithms, allowing the system to learn from the

map-germs which is the unimodular version of Bruce's $\mathcal{G}$-equivalence.
The key concept to deduce unimodular classification out of classification
relative to $\mathcal{G}$-equivalence is symmetrical quasi-homogeneity, which
is a generalization of the condition for a $2 \times 2$ symmetric matrix-valued
map-germ in Corollary~2.1 (ii) by Bruce, Goryunov and Zakalyukin. If a
$\mathcal{G}$-equivalence class contains a symmetrically quasi-homogeneous
representative, the class coincides with that relative to the volume-preserving
equivalence (up to orientation reversing diffeomorphism in case if the ground
field is real). By using that we show that all the simple classes relative to
$\mathcal{G}$-equivalence in Bruce's list coincides with those relative to the
volume preserving equivalence. Then, we classify map-germs from the plane to
the set of $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ real symmetric matrices of corank at
most $1$ and of $\mathcal{G}_e$-codimension less than $9$ and we show some of
the normal forms split into two different unimodular singularities. We provide
several examples to illustrate that non simplicity does not imply non
symmetrical quasi-homogeneity and the condition that a map-germ is
symmetrically quasi-homogeneous is stronger than one that each component of the
map-germ is quasi-homogeneous. We also present an example of non symmetrically
quasi-homogeneous normal form relative to $\mathcal{G}$ and its corresponding
formal unimodular normal form.

electrically induced out-of-equilibrium spin and orbital polarizations in pure
Pt films and in Pt/3d-metal (Co, Ni, Cu) bilayer films using ab initio
electronic structure methods and linear-response theory. We compute
atom-resolved response quantities that allow us to identify the induced
spin-polarization contributions that lead to fieldlike SOTs, mostly associated
with the SREE, and dampinglike (DL) SOTs, mostly associated with the SHE, and
compare their relative magnitude, dependence on the magnetization direction, as
well as their Pt-layer thickness dependence. We find that both the FL and DL
components contribute to the resulting SOT at the Pt/Co and Pt/Ni interfaces,
with the former contributions being larger at the Pt interface layer and the
latter larger in the Co or Ni layers. Our calculations show that the
electrically-induced transverse orbital polarization is exceedingly larger than
the induced spin polarization and present even without spin-orbit coupling, in

that aim to reduce the computation complexity, identifying the zero values in
the model weights and in the activations to avoid computing them is a promising
direction.
  In this paper, we summarize the current status of the research on the

that the search for the sparse structure can be a general methodology for
high-quality model explorations, in addition to a strategy for high-efficiency
model execution. We discuss the model accuracy influenced by the number of
weight parameters and the structure of the model. The corresponding models are
called to be located in the weight dominated and structure dominated regions,
respectively. We show that for practically complicated problems, it is more
beneficial to search large and sparse models in the weight dominated region. In
order to achieve the goal, new approaches are required to search for proper
sparse structures, and new sparse training hardware needs to be developed to
facilitate fast iterations of sparse models.

for instance, in terms of their steady-state characteristics or local behavior.
If these properties were considered already during the search process, more

symbolic regression approach that is driven by both the training data and the
prior knowledge of the properties the desired model should manifest. The
properties given in the form of formal constraints are internally represented
by a set of discrete data samples on which candidate models are exactly
checked. The proposed approach was experimentally evaluated on three test
problems with results clearly demonstrating its capability to evolve realistic

However, there is a lack of research effort in studying materials design

produce an optimal microstructure that is statistically equivalent to the
target microstructure. The proposed framework is formulated as a noisy
multi-objective optimization problem, where each objective function measures a
deterministic or statistical difference of the same microstructure descriptor
between a candidate microstructure and a target microstructure. Furthermore, to
significantly reduce the physical waiting wall-time, we enable the
high-throughput feature of the microstructure calibration framework by adopting
an asynchronously parallel Bayesian optimization by exploiting high-performance

are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, where
kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation is used as a forward predictive model,
such that for a given target microstructure, the target processing parameters

2D-PC-MS to the analysis of intact protein ions in a standard linear ion trap

scales logarithmically and various physical quantities scale algebraically,
implying emergent conformal criticality, for both integrable and nonintegrable

unique to steady-state regimes of the conditional dynamics at the

costs, environmental, and health impacts. We have manually captured 3,651
high-quality, real-life symptom images of multiple apple foliar diseases, with
variable illumination, angles, surfaces, and noise. A subset, expert-annotated
to create a pilot dataset for apple scab, cedar apple rust, and healthy leaves,
was made available to the Kaggle community for 'Plant Pathology Challenge';
part of the Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) workshop at CVPR 2020
(Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). We also trained an off-the-shelf
convolutional neural network (CNN) on this data for disease classification and
achieved 97% accuracy on a held-out test set. This dataset will contribute
towards development and deployment of machine learning-based automated plant
disease classification algorithms to ultimately realize fast and accurate
disease detection. We will continue to add images to the pilot dataset for a
larger, more comprehensive expert-annotated dataset for future Kaggle
competitions and to explore more advanced methods for disease classification
and quantification.

significant challenges for analysis and parameter estimations due to the large
number of equations used to track the dynamics of all distinct configurations
in which each involved biochemical species can be found. Model reduction can
help tame such complexity by providing a lower-dimensional model in which each
macro-variable can be directly related to the original variables.
  Results: We present CLUE, an algorithm for exact model reduction of systems
of polynomial differential equations by constrained linear lumping. It computes
the smallest dimensional reduction as a linear mapping of the state space such
that the reduced model preserves the dynamics of user-specified linear
combinations of the original variables. Even though CLUE works with nonlinear
differential equations, it is based on linear algebra tools, which makes it
applicable to high-dimensional models. Using case studies from the literature,
we show how CLUE can substantially lower model dimensionality and help extract
biologically intelligible insights from the reduction.

confidence bounds compared to the ones constructed with standard UCB methods.
We apply CO to a novel budgeted variant of the Influence Maximization (IM)

Thus, monopoles can be considered as random walkers under the effect of

subsume the evolution of the spin vacuum. Via this conceptualization, we
conjecture relations between the color of the noise and other observables, such

Furthermore, we study the overall expansion properties given by the number of

has a significant impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in districts or cities
over long distances. However, this impact is only observed after approximately
two weeks of lockdown. We speculate that this happened due to the insufficient
number of tests for COVID-19 before the lockdown which could not stop the

exchanging military maps or surveillance video in hostile

bit-stream to deal with the various conflicting requirements on embedding
capacity, stego-image quality, and un-detectibility. This paper is concerned
with the development of innovative image procedures and data hiding schemes
that exploit, as well as increase, similarities between secret image bit-stream
and the cover image LSB plane. This will be achieved in two novel steps
involving manipulating both the secret and the cover images,prior to embedding,
to achieve higher 0:1 ratio in both the secret image bit-stream and the cover
image LSB plane. The above two steps strategy has been exploited to use a
bit-plane(s) mapping technique, instead of bit-plane(s) replacement to make
each cover pixel usable for secret embedding. This paper will demonstrate that
this strategy produces stego-images that have minimal distortion, high
embedding efficiency, reasonably good stego-image quality and robustness
against 3 well-known targeted steganalysis tools.

offers better stego quality. In general, the new decomposition technique has

model black holes as punctures in the fabric of spacetime. The location and the
properties of the black hole punctures are tracked with apparent horizons,
namely outermost marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs). As the holes
approach each other, a common apparent horizon suddenly appears, engulfing the
two black holes and signaling the merger. The evolution of common apparent
horizons and their connection with gravitational wave emission have been
studied in detail with the framework of dynamical horizons. We present a study
of the dynamics of the MOTSs and their punctures in the interior of the final
black hole. The study focuses on head-on mergers for various initial
separations and mass ratios. We find that MOTSs intersect for most of the
parameter space. We show that for those situations in which they do not, it is
because of the singularity avoidance property of the moving puncture gauge
condition used in the study. Although we are unable to carry out evolutions
that last long enough to show the ultimate fate of the punctures, our results
suggest that MOTSs always intersect and that at late times their overlap is
only partial. As a consequence, the punctures inside the MOTSs, although close
enough to each other to act effectively as a single puncture, do not merge.

One mathematical justification would be to prove that ground subspaces or
ground state manifolds of topological phases of matter behave as error
correction codes with macroscopic distance. While this is widely assumed and
used as a definition of topological phases of matter in the physics literature,
besides the doubled abelian anyon models in Kitaev's seminal paper, no
non-abelian models are proven to be so mathematically until recently. Cui et al
extended the theorem from doubled abelian anyon models to all Kitaev models
based on any finite group. Those proofs are very explicit using detailed
knowledge of the Hamiltonians, so it seems to be hard to further extend the
proof to cover other models such as the Levin-Wen. We pursue a totally
different approach based on topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), and
prove that a lattice implementation of the disk axiom and annulus axiom in
TQFTs as essentially the equivalence of TQO1 and TQO2 conditions. We confirm
the error correcting properties of ground subspaces for topological lattice
Hamiltonian schemas of the Levin-Wen model and Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFTs by
providing a lattice version of the disk axiom and annulus of the underlying
TQFTs. The error correcting property of ground subspaces is also shared by
gapped fracton models such as the Haah codes. We propose to characterize
topological phases of matter via error correcting properties, and refer to
gapped fracton models as lax-topological.

the points of this variety. A process can be constructed both by considering
jumps from one point to another (velocity changes discontinuously) and by
continuous velocity trajectories on the surface. We followed this second new

isotropic only in the 'rest frame') on the surface of the sphere. Using both

Fibonacci-like steganography by bit-plane(s) mapping instead of bit-plane(s)
replacement. Our proposed algorithm increases embedding capacity using
bit-plane mapping to embed two bits of the secret message in three bits of a
pixel of the cover, at the expense of a marginal loss in stego quality. While
existing Fibonacci embedding algorithms do not use certain intensities of the
cover for embedding due to the limitation imposed by the Zeckendorf theorem,
our proposal solve this problem and make all intensity values candidates for
embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique double
the embedding capacity when compared to existing Fibonacci methods, and it is
secure against statistical attacks such as RS, POV, and difference image
histogram (DIH).

near-optimal performance by rerouting as many flows as possible. However, they
do not usually consider the negative impact, such as packet out of order, when
frequently rerouting flows in the network. To mitigate the impact of network
disturbance, one promising TE solution is forwarding the majority of traffic
flows using Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and selectively rerouting a few
critical flows using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to balance link
utilization of the network. However, critical flow rerouting is not trivial
because the solution space for critical flow selection is enormous. Moreover,
it is impossible to design a heuristic algorithm for this problem based on
fixed and simple rules, since rule-based heuristics are unable to adapt to the
changes of the traffic matrix and network dynamics. In this paper, we propose
CFR-RL (Critical Flow Rerouting-Reinforcement Learning), a Reinforcement
Learning-based scheme that learns a policy to select critical flows for each
given traffic matrix automatically. CFR-RL then reroutes these selected
critical flows to balance link utilization of the network by formulating and
solving a simple Linear Programming (LP) problem. Extensive evaluations show
that CFR-RL achieves near-optimal performance by rerouting only 10%-21.3% of

divides into two very distinctive regions. In the first, located around the
Dirac point, the quasi-spectrum is significantly distorted by the field as the
electronic parameters are renormalized by electronic-dressing. In the second,
all the characteristics of the free carrier spectrum are retained. Linearly
polarized light anisotropically deforms the spectrum according to the field
polarization direction. Dirac-like points form around the original Dirac point.
The quasi spectrum of circularly polarized light, instead, exhibits a gap
formation in the Dirac point and has elliptical symmetry. We show that, in

an Erdos-Renyi graph G(n,1/2) and one is interested in recovering this planted

when computational efficiency is equated with the existence of polynomial time
algorithms. We study this problem under a more fine-grained computational lens
and consider the following two questions.
  1. Do there exist sublinear time algorithms for recovering the planted
clique?
  2. What is the smallest running time any algorithm can hope to have?
  We show that because of a well known clique-completion property, very
elementary sublinear time recovery algorithms do indeed exist for clique sizes
k = {\omega}(\sqrt{n}). This points to a qualitatively stronger
statistical-computational gap. The planted clique recovery problem can be
solved without even looking at most of the input above the {\Theta}(\sqrt{n})
threshold and cannot be solved by any efficient algorithm below it.
  A running time lower bound for the recovery problem follows easily from the
results of [RS19], and this implies our recovery algorithms are optimal
whenever k = {\Omega}(n^{2/3}). However, for k = o(n^{2/3}) there is a gap
between our algorithmic upper bound and the information-theoretic lower bound
implied by [RS19].
  With some caveats, we show stronger detection lower bounds based on the
Planted Clique Conjecture for a natural but restricted class of algorithms. The
key idea is to relate very fast sublinear time algorithms for detecting large
planted cliques to polynomial time algorithms for detecting small planted
cliques.

estimated from $G_i$, which is at least three times larger than $G_r$ below the

  data",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Binary regression models are commonly used in disciplines such as
epidemiology and ecology to determine how spatial covariates influence
individuals. In many studies, binary data are shared in a spatially aggregated
form to protect privacy. For example, rather than reporting the location and
result for each individual that was tested for a disease, researchers may
report that a disease was detected or not detected within geopolitical units.
Often, the spatial aggregation process obscures the values of response
variables, spatial covariates, and locations of each individual, which makes
recovering individual-level inference difficult. We show that applying a series
of transformations, including a change of support, to a bivariate point process
model allows researchers to recover individual-level inference for spatial
covariates from spatially aggregated binary data. The series of transformations
preserves the convenient interpretation of desirable binary regression models
that are commonly applied to individual-level data. Using a simulation
experiment, we compare the performance of our proposed method under varying
types of spatial aggregation against the performance of standard approaches
using the original individual-level data. We illustrate our method by modeling
individual-level probability of infection using a data set that has been
aggregated to protect an at-risk and endangered species of bats. Our simulation
experiment and data illustration demonstrate the utility of the proposed method
when access to original non-aggregated data is impractical or prohibited.

behavior, can provide insights about these reading conditions. In this paper,
we focus on understanding the different reading conditions of mobile readers,
as such an understanding can facilitate the design of effective personalized
features for supporting mobile reading. With this motivation in mind, we
analyzed the reading behaviors of 285 Mechanical Turk participants who read
articles on mobile devices with different familiarity and reading goal
conditions. The data was collected non-invasively, only including behavioral
interactions recorded from a mobile phone in a non-laboratory setting. Our
findings suggest that features based on touch locations can be used to
distinguish among familiarity conditions, while scroll-based features and
reading time features can be used to differentiate between reading goal
conditions. Using the collected data, we built a model that can predict the
reading goal condition (67.5%) significantly more accurately than a baseline
model. Our model also predicted the familiarity level (56.2%) marginally more
accurately than the baseline. These findings can contribute to developing an
evidence-based design of reading support features for mobile reading
applications. Furthermore, our study methodology can be easily expanded to
different real-world reading environments, leaving much potential for future
investigations.

bilinear in the coordinates and momenta of the nucleons and, when expressed in

disordered media, the present work puts random Schr\""odinger operators into a
new spectral perspective. Based on a stationary random version of a Floquet
type fibration, we reduce the description of the quantum dynamics to a fibered
family of abstract spectral perturbation problems on the underlying probability
space. We state a natural resonance conjecture for these fibered operators: in
contrast with periodic and quasiperiodic settings, this would entail that Bloch
waves do not exist as extended states, but rather as resonant modes, and this
would justify the expected exponential decay of time correlations. Although
this resonance conjecture remains open, we develop new tools for spectral
analysis on the probability space, and in particular we show how ideas from
Malliavin calculus lead to rigorous Mourre type results: we obtain an
approximate dynamical resonance result and the first spectral proof of the
decay of time correlations on the kinetic timescale. This spectral approach
suggests a whole new way of circumventing perturbative expansions and
renormalization techniques.

galaxies being stripped shortly after infall onto the Coma cluster. Finally,
the stripping candidates show enhanced star formation rates, both relative to

pressure is likely driving an enhancement in star formation during the

e-recruitment and human resources management. These methods aim to
systematically address the limitations of conventional recruitment procedures
through incorporating natural language processing tools and semantics-based
methods. In this context, for a given job post, applicant resumes (usually
uploaded as free-text unstructured documents in different formats such as .pdf,
.doc, or .rtf) are matched/screened out using the conventional keyword-based
model enriched by additional resources such as occupational categories and
semantics-based techniques. Employing these techniques has proved to be
effective in reducing the cost, time, and efforts required in traditional
recruitment and candidate selection methods. However, the skill gap, i.e. the
propensity to precisely detect and extract relevant skills in applicant resumes
and job posts, and the hidden semantic dimensions encoded in applicant resumes
still form a major obstacle for e-recruitment systems. This is due to the fact
that resources exploited by current e-recruitment systems are obtained from
generic domain-independent sources, therefore resulting in knowledge
incompleteness and the lack of domain coverage. In this paper, we review
state-of-the-art e-recruitment approaches and highlight recent advancements in
this domain. An e-recruitment framework addressing current shortcomings through
the use of multiple cooperative semantic resources, feature extraction
techniques and skill relatedness measures is detailed. An instantiation of the
proposed framework is proposed and an experimental validation using a
real-world recruitment dataset from two employment portals demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

compute its electrical and thermal conductivity by first-principles methods
including electron-phonon and electron-electron scattering. We find that the
measured resistivity of hcp-iron increases almost linearly with increasing
temperature, and is consistent with current first-principles computations. The
proportionality coefficient between resistivity and thermal conductivity (the
Lorenz number) in hcp-iron differs from the ideal value (2.44*10^-8 W Omega

convert the experimental resistivity to the thermal conductivity of hcp-Fe at
high P-T. The results constrain the resistivity and thermal conductivity of
hcp-iron to ~80(5) u Omega cm and ~100(10) W/mK, respectively, at conditions

~10(1) TW through the core-mantle boundary for a liquid Fe alloy outer core,
supporting a present-day geodynamo driven by thermal convection through the
core's secular cooling and by compositional convection through the latent heat

graph Laplacian regularization with sound event co-occurrence taken into
account. In the proposed method, the occurrences of sound events are expressed
as a graph whose nodes indicate the frequencies of event occurrence and whose
edges indicate the sound event co-occurrences. This graph representation is
then utilized for the model training of sound event detection, which is
optimized under an objective function with a regularization term considering
the graph structure of sound event occurrence and co-occurrence. Evaluation
experiments using the TUT Sound Events 2016 and 2017 detasets, and the TUT
Acoustic Scenes 2016 dataset show that the proposed method improves the
performance of sound event detection by 7.9 percentage points compared with the
conventional CNN-BiGRU-based detection method in terms of the segment-based F1
score. In particular, the experimental results indicate that the proposed
method enables the detection of co-occurring sound events more accurately than
the conventional method.

properties in topological phases of matter and can be regarded as mathematical
characterization of topological order in two spacial dimensions. It is
conjectured that every anyon model, or mathematically unitary modular tensor
category, can be realized as the representation category of some chiral
conformal field theory, or mathematically vertex operator algebra/local
conformal net. This conjecture is known to be true for abelian anyon models
providing support for the conjecture. We reexamine abelian anyon models from
several different angles. First anyon models are algebraic data for both
topological quantum field theories and chiral conformal field theories. While
it is known that each abelian anyon model can be realized by a quantum abelian
Chern-Simons theory and chiral conformal field theory, the construction is not
algorithmic. Our goal is to provide such an explicit algorithm for a $K$-matrix
in Chern-Simons theory and a positive definite even one for a lattice conformal
field theory. Secondly anyon models and chiral conformal field theories
underlie the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases of matter. But
there are interesting subtleties in this correspondence when stability of the
edge theory and topological symmetry are taken into consideration. Therefore,
our focus is on the algorithmic reconstruction of extremal chiral conformal
field theories with small central charges. Finally we conjecture that a much
stronger reconstruction holds for abelian anyon models: every abelian anyon
model can be realized as the representation category of some non-lattice
extremal vertex operator algebra generalizing the moonshine realization of the
trivial anyon model.

theorem that is in direct contrast to the single type (p = 1) setting: No

Moreover, LexiPS satisfies sd-weak-strategyproofness when agents are not

The following families of algorithms are considered: (a) low-degree polynomials
of the input; (b) low-depth Boolean circuits; (c) the Langevin dynamics
algorithm. We show that these families of algorithms fail to produce nearly
optimal solutions with high probability. For the case of Boolean circuits, our
results improve the state-of-the-art bounds known in circuit complexity theory
(although we consider the search problem as opposed to the decision problem).
  Our proof uses the fact that these models are known to exhibit a variant of
the overlap gap property (OGP) of near-optimal solutions. Specifically, for
both models, every two solutions whose objectives are above a certain threshold
are either close or far from each other. The crux of our proof is that the
classes of algorithms we consider exhibit a form of stability. We show by an
interpolation argument that stable algorithms cannot overcome the OGP barrier.
  The stability of Langevin dynamics is an immediate consequence of the
well-posedness of stochastic differential equations. The stability of
low-degree polynomials and Boolean circuits is established using tools from
Gaussian and Boolean analysis -- namely hypercontractivity and total influence,
as well as a novel lower bound for random walks avoiding certain subsets. In
the case of Boolean circuits, the result also makes use of

low influence functions and may apply more generally.

combining the results of multiple classifiers via fusion approaches shows to be
more effective and robust. Since the skin lesion datasets are usually limited
and statistically biased, while designing an effective fusion approach, it is
important to consider not only the performance of each classifier on the
training/validation dataset, but also the relative discriminative power (e.g.,
confidence) of each classifier regarding an individual sample in the testing
phase, which calls for an active fusion approach. Furthermore, in skin lesion
analysis, the data of certain classes (e.g., the benign lesions) is usually
abundant making them an over-represented majority, while the data of some other
classes (e.g., the cancerous lesions) is deficient, making them an
underrepresented minority. It is more crucial to precisely identify the samples
from an underrepresented (i.e., in terms of the amount of data) but more
important minority class (e.g., certain cancerous lesion). In other words,
misclassifying a more severe lesion to a benign or less severe lesion should
have relative more cost (e.g., money, time and even lives). To address such
challenges, we present CS-AF, a cost-sensitive multi-classifier active fusion

themselves composed of quarks and gluons. Understanding how the quark-gluon
structure of a nucleon bound in an atomic nucleus is modified by the
surrounding nucleons is an outstanding challenge. Although evidence for such
modification, known as the EMC effect, was first observed over 35 years ago,
there is still no generally accepted explanation of its cause. Recent
observations suggest that the EMC effect is related to close-proximity Short
Range Correlated (SRC) nucleon pairs in nuclei. Here we report the first
simultaneous, high-precision, measurements of the EMC effect and SRC
abundances. We show that the EMC data can be explained by a universal
modification of the structure of nucleons in neutron-proton (np) SRC pairs and
present the first data-driven extraction of this universal modification
function. This implies that, in heavier nuclei with many more neutrons than
protons, each proton is more likely than each neutron to belong to an SRC pair
and hence to have its quark structure distorted.

evolution of the safety factor profile during normal sawteeth, the stationary
state, and the incomplete reconnection. It is found that the safety factor
profiles from the old definition are sometimes inconsistent with the Poincare
plots of the magnetic field during sawteeth. The old safety factor always
indicates that the safety factor around the magnetic axis is flattened and
equal to 1.0 with the development of the kink instability. However, the
Poincare plots of the magnetic field lines indicate that the topology of the
magnetic field around the magnetic axis has not been changed. To solve the
inconsistency, we propose a new definition of the safety factor, in which the
poloidal angle relative to the new twisted magnetic axis is used instead of the
poloidal angle to the original axis. With the new definition, the safety factor
profiles are consistent with Poincare plots of the magnetic field. We also find
that the safety factor profiles are significantly different from the two
different q definitions. With the new q definition, the safety factor at the
magnetic axis q0 remains unchanged in almost the entire period of a sawtooth
and jumps up to 1.0 near the end during normal sawteeth; in the
non-axisymmetric equilibrium, q0 is still far below 1.0; q0 remains its initial
value throughout the incomplete reconnection.

used renormalization schemes in perturbative QCD (pQCD) theory. In the paper,
we make a detailed discussion on the gauge dependence of the pQCD prediction
under the MOM scheme. Conventionally, there is renormalization scale ambiguity
for the fixed-order pQCD predictions, which assigns an arbitrary range and an
arbitrary error for the fixed-order pQCD prediction. The principle of maximum
conformality (PMC) adopts the renormalization group equation to determine the
magnitude of the coupling constant and hence determines an effective momentum
flow of the process, which is independent to the choice of renormalization
scale. There is thus no renormalization scale ambiguity in PMC predictions. To
concentrate our attention on the MOM gauge dependence, we first apply the PMC
to deal with the pQCD series. We adopt the Higgs boson decay width,
$\Gamma(H\to gg)$, up to five-loop QCD contributions as an example to show how
the gauge dependence behaves before and after applying the PMC. It is found
that the Higgs decay width $\Gamma (H\to gg)$ depends very weakly on the
choices of the MOM schemes, being consistent with the renormalization group
invariance. It is found that the gauge dependence of $\Gamma(H\to gg)$ under
the $\rm{MOMgg}$ scheme is less than $\pm1\%$, which is the smallest gauge
dependence among all the mentioned MOM schemes.

However, photon mapping requires very large numbers of traced photons to

photon density estimation, the core of all particle-based methods. We train a
novel deep neural network to predict a kernel function to aggregate photon
contributions at shading points. Our network encodes individual photons into
per-photon features, aggregates them in the neighborhood of a shading point to
construct a photon local context vector, and infers a kernel function from the
per-photon and photon local context features. This network is easy to
incorporate in many previous photon mapping methods (by simply swapping the
kernel density estimator) and can produce high-quality reconstructions of
complex global illumination effects like caustics with an order of magnitude
fewer photons compared to previous photon mapping methods.

ever more urgent need for cheap, fast and reliable tools that can assist
physicians in diagnosing COVID-19. Medical imaging such as CT can take a key
role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from molecular biology,
and, using deep learning techniques, several automatic systems were
demonstrated promising performances using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate a
more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging to guide COVID-19
detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities
around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung
ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277
bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. This
dataset was assembled from various online sources, processed specifically for
deep learning models and is intended to serve as a starting point for an
open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network
(POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a
majority vote, a video accuracy of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular,
the model performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and
F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide an open-access
web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https://pocovidscreen.org.
The website deploys the predictive model, allowing to perform predictions on
ultrasound lung images. In addition, it grants medical staff the option to
(bulk) upload their own screenings in order to contribute to the growing public
database of pathological lung ultrasound images.

flow over a curved wall, with a view to understanding the relationship between
the reduction of friction and changes to the total aerodynamic drag. Direct
numerical simulations (DNS) are carried out for an incompressible turbulent
flow in a channel where one wall has a small bump; two bump geometries are
considered, that produce mildly separated and attached flows. Friction drag
reduction is achieved by applying streamwise-travelling waves of spanwise
velocity (StTW).
  The local friction reduction produced by the StTW is found to vary along the
curved wall, leading to a global friction reduction that, for the cases
studied, is up to 10\% larger than that obtained in the plane-wall case.
Moreover, the modified skin friction induces non-negligible changes of pressure
drag, which is favorably affected by StTW and globally reduces by up to 10\%.
The net power saving, accounting for the power required to create the StTW, is
positive and, for the cases studied, is one half larger than the net saving of
the planar case. The study suggests that reducing friction at the surface of a
body of complex shape induces further effects, a simplistic evaluation of which
might lead to underestimating the total drag reduction.

machine learning approaches. Both follow a model-to-data scenario; clients
train and test machine learning models without sharing raw data. SL provides
better model privacy than FL due to the machine learning model architecture
split between clients and the server. Moreover, the split model makes SL a
better option for resource-constrained environments. However, SL performs
slower than FL due to the relay-based training across multiple clients. In this
regard, this paper presents a novel approach, named splitfed learning (SFL),
that amalgamates the two approaches eliminating their inherent drawbacks, along
with a refined architectural configuration incorporating differential privacy
and PixelDP to enhance data privacy and model robustness. Our analysis and
empirical results demonstrate that (pure) SFL provides similar test accuracy
and communication efficiency as SL while significantly decreasing its
computation time per global epoch than in SL for multiple clients. Furthermore,
as in SL, its communication efficiency over FL improves with the number of
clients. Besides, the performance of SFL with privacy and robustness measures
is further evaluated under extended experimental settings.

for many government authorities, and EMS demand is often an early indicator for
stress in communities, a warning sign of emerging problems. In this paper, we
introduce Deep Planning and Policy Making Net (DeepPPMNet), a Long Short-Term
Memory network based, global forecasting and inference framework to forecast
the EMS demand, analyse causal relationships, and perform `what-if' analyses
for policy-making across multiple local government areas. Unless traditional
univariate forecasting techniques, the proposed method follows the global
forecasting methodology, where a model is trained across all the available EMS
demand time series to exploit the potential cross-series information available.
DeepPPMNet also uses seasonal decomposition techniques, incorporated in two
different training paradigms into the framework, to suit various
characteristics of the EMS related time series data. We then explore causal
relationships using the notion of Granger Causality, where the global
forecasting framework enables us to perform `what-if' analyses that could be
used for the national policy-making process. We empirically evaluate our
method, using a set of EMS datasets related to alcohol, drug use and self-harm
in Australia. The proposed framework is able to outperform many
state-of-the-art techniques and achieve competitive results in terms of
forecasting accuracy. We finally illustrate its use for policy-making in an
example regarding alcohol outlet licenses.

and enhance the sum-rate of the whole network. Conventional power control
techniques first collect instantaneous global channel state information (CSI)
and then calculate sub-optimal solutions. Nevertheless, it is challenging to
collect instantaneous global CSI in the HetNet, in which global CSI typically
changes fast. In this paper, we exploit deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
design a multi-agent power control algorithm in the HetNet. To be specific, by
treating each AP as an agent with a local deep neural network (DNN), we propose
a multiple-actor-shared-critic (MASC) method to train the local DNNs separately

optimization problem which includes the rebalancing~frequency as an additional
parameter in the maximization. The so-called Kelly Criterion is used as the
performance metric; i.e., maximizing the expected logarithmic growth of a
trader's account, and the portfolio obtained is called the frequency-based
Kelly optimal portfolio. The focal point of this paper is to extend upon the
results of our previous work to obtain various optimality characterizations on
the portfolio. To be more specific, using Kelly's criterion in our
frequency-based formulation, we first prove necessary and sufficient conditions
for the frequency-based Kelly optimal portfolio. With the aid of these
conditions, we then show several new optimality characterizations such as
expected ratio optimality and asymptotic relative optimality, and a result
which we call the Extended Dominant Asset Theorem. That is, we prove that the
$i$th asset is dominant in the portfolio if and only if the Kelly optimal
portfolio consists of that asset only. The word ""extended"" on the theorem comes
from the fact that it was only a sufficiency result that was proved in our
previous work. Hence, in this paper, we improve it to involve a proof of the
necessity part. In addition, the trader's survivability issue (no bankruptcy
consideration) is also studied in detail in our frequency-based trading
framework. Finally, to bridge the theory and practice, we propose a simple
trading algorithm using the notion called dominant asset condition to decide
when should one triggers a trade. The corresponding trading performance using
historical price data is reported as supporting evidence.

in galaxies, three edge-on spirals, NGC 891, NGC 3628, and IC 5052 observed by
the Spitzer Space Telescope InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) were examined for
compact 8 micron cores using an unsharp mask technique; 173, 267, and 60 cores
were distinguished, respectively. Color-color distributions suggest a mixture
of PAHs and highly-extincted photospheric emission from young stars. The
average V-band extinction is ~20 mag, equally divided between foreground and
core. IRAC magnitudes for the clumps are converted to stellar masses assuming
an age of 1 Myr, which is about equal to the ratio of the total core mass to
the star formation rate in each galaxy. The extinction and stellar mass suggest
an intrinsic core diameter of ~18 pc for 5% star formation efficiency. The
half-thickness of the disk of 8 micron cores is 105 pc for NGC 891 and 74 pc
for IC 5052, varying with radius by a factor of ~2. For NGC 3628, which is
interacting, the half-thickness is 438 pc, but even with this interaction, the
8 micron disk is remarkably flat, suggesting vertical stability. Small scale
structures like shingles or spirals are seen in the core positions. Very few of
the 8 micron cores have optical counterparts.

can revolutionize a particular organization. Distributed devices such as the
Internet of Things (IoT) often produce a large amount of data, eventually
resulting in big data that can be vital in uncovering hidden patterns, and
other insights in numerous fields such as healthcare, banking, and policing.
Data related to areas such as healthcare and banking can contain potentially
sensitive data that can become public if they are not appropriately sanitized.
Federated learning (FedML) is a recently developed distributed machine learning
(DML) approach that tries to preserve privacy by bringing the learning of an ML
model to data owners'. However, literature shows different attack methods such
as membership inference that exploit the vulnerabilities of ML models as well
as the coordinating servers to retrieve private data. Hence, FedML needs
additional measures to guarantee data privacy. Furthermore, big data often
requires more resources than available in a standard computer. This paper
addresses these issues by proposing a distributed perturbation algorithm named
as DISTPAB, for privacy preservation of horizontally partitioned data. DISTPAB
alleviates computational bottlenecks by distributing the task of privacy
preservation utilizing the asymmetry of resources of a distributed environment,
which can have resource-constrained devices as well as high-performance
computers. Experiments show that DISTPAB provides high accuracy, high
efficiency, high scalability, and high attack resistance. Further experiments
on privacy-preserving FedML show that DISTPAB is an excellent solution to stop
privacy leaks in DML while preserving high data utility.

these manifolds in the context of algebraic geometry, in order to determine
whether Stein fillings can be realized as Milnor fibers of hypersurfce

systems to translate source text to text in target language. Recent progress in
the sequence-sequence architectures have reduced the performance gap between
the pipeline based SLT systems (cascaded ASR-MT) and End-to-End approaches.
Though End-to-End and cascaded ASR-MT systems are reaching to the comparable
levels of performances, we can see a large performance gap using the ASR
hypothesis and oracle text w.r.t MT models. This performance gap indicates that
the MT systems are prone to large performance degradation due to noisy ASR
hypothesis as opposed to oracle text transcript. In this work this degradation
in the performance is reduced by creating an end to-end differentiable pipeline
between the ASR and MT systems. In this work, we train SLT systems with ASR
objective as an auxiliary loss and both the networks are connected through the
neural hidden representations. This train ing would have an End-to-End
differentiable path w.r.t to the final objective function as well as utilize
the ASR objective for better performance of the SLT systems. This architecture
has improved from BLEU from 36.8 to 44.5. Due to the Multi-task training the
model also generates the ASR hypothesis which are used by a pre-trained MT
model. Combining the proposed systems with the MT model has increased the BLEU
score by 1. All the experiments are reported on English-Portuguese speech
translation task using How2 corpus. The final BLEU score is on-par with the
best speech translation system on How2 dataset with no additional training data

how the saturation magnetization, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, anomalous
Hall resistance, and SOT are systematically affected by the degree of oxidation
of both the Pt/Co and Co/Al interfaces. Oxidation of the Co/Al interface
results in a 21% and 42% variation of the dampinglike and fieldlike SOT
efficiencies, which peak at 0.14 and 0.07, respectively. The insertion of a
paramagnetic CoOx layer between Pt and Co maintains a very strong perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy and improves the dampinglike and fieldlike SOT
efficiencies, up to 0.26 and 0.20, respectively. In contrast with recent
reports, we do not find that the oxidation of Pt leads to a significant
enhancement of the torques. Rather, we find that oxygen migrates from Pt to the
Co and Al layers, leading to a time-dependent oxidation profile and an
effective spin Hall conductivity that decreases with increasing oxygen
concentration. Finally, we study current-induced switching in Pt/Co/AlOx with
different degrees of oxidation and find a linear relationship between the
critical switching current and the effective magnetic anisotropy controlled by
the oxidation of Al. These results highlight the importance of interfaces and
oxidation effects on the SOT and magnetotransport properties of heavy

using alternative energy sources challenging. Many published gas-cooled reactor
designs for space applications deliver outputs in the 100 kWe regime, with
typical power densities of around 4 MW/m$^3$. Here we present a gas-cooled
reactor design - referred to as JANUS - employing He-Xe coolant and operating
on a direct Brayton cycle, that can achieve a high power output (around 0.8
MWe) and higher power density (24 MW/m$^3$) than previously published designs.
The core employs a coated particle fuel form with uranium nitride kernels in a
graphite matrix and with a high packing fraction (45%).
  Starting from the CEA's published OPUS space reactor design, a variety of
approaches were considered for achieving high power densities in a gas-cooled
reactor, including changing the core aspect ratio. Our JANUS design uses a
decreased coolant channel diameter and fuel element pitch, whilst increasing
the number of fuel elements and employing radial enrichment zoning. The design
achieves a significant increase in power density whilst obeying core-life
limits of 2000 Effective Full Power Days and a peak fuel operating temperature
of 1900 K. The core has been modelled neutronically with the ERANOS and SERPENT
codes, with a simple yet robust thermal dimensioning tool developed by us to
study peak fuel temperatures, to ensure the fuel operates within its design
limitations and to aid optimisation.

Gaussian distributed elements is intuitively expected to be driven by many
parameters. Contrary to intuition, however, our theoretical analysis reveals
the existence of a single parameter, a function of all ensemble parameters,
which governs the dynamics of spectral statistics. The analysis not only
extends the similar formulation (known as complexity parameter formulation) for
the Hermitian ensembles without chirality to those with it but also reveals the
underlying connection between chiral complex systems with seemingly different
system conditions as well as to other complex systems e.g. multi-parametric
Wishart ensembles as well as generalized Calogero Sutherland Hamiltonian (CSH).

NER benchmarks. Generally, these benchmarks are blessed with strong name
regularity, high mention coverage and sufficient context diversity.
Unfortunately, when scaling NER to open situations, these advantages may no
longer exist. And therefore it raises a critical question of whether previous
creditable approaches can still work well when facing these challenges. As
there is no currently available dataset to investigate this problem, this paper
proposes to conduct randomization test on standard benchmarks. Specifically, we
erase name regularity, mention coverage and context diversity respectively from
the benchmarks, in order to explore their impact on the generalization ability
of models. To further verify our conclusions, we also construct a new open NER
dataset that focuses on entity types with weaker name regularity and lower
mention coverage to verify our conclusion. From both randomization test and
empirical experiments, we draw the conclusions that 1) name regularity is
critical for the models to generalize to unseen mentions; 2) high mention
coverage may undermine the model generalization ability and 3) context patterns
may not require enormous data to capture when using pretrained encoders.

specifications, whether Eve as a strategy to enforce the specification no
matter what Adam does, is a decidable problem. We study the extension of Church
synthesis games to the linearly ordered data domains (Q,<) and (N,<). In this
setting, the infinite interaction between Adam and Eve results in a data
omega-word, i.e., an infinite sequence of elements in the domain.
  We study this problem when specifications are given as register automata.
They extend finite automata with a finite set of registers in which they can
store data and with which they can compare incoming data with respect to the
linear order. Church games over (N,<) are however undecidable, even for
deterministic register automata. Thus, we introduce one-sided Church games,
where Eve instead operates over a finite alphabet, while Adam still manipulates
data. We show they are determined, and deciding the existence of a winning
strategy is in ExpTime, both for Q and N. This follows from a study of
constraint sequences, which abstract the behaviour of register automata, and
allow us to reduce Church games to omega-regular games. We show an application
of one-sided Church games to some transducer synthesis problem. In this
application, a transducer models a reactive system (Eve) which outputs data

0.2 considering the experimental constraints. Under this benchmark point, we
find that the future bounds from $h\rightarrow\gamma Z$ decay can limit the
real parts of $y_{L,~R}^{tT}$ in the positive direction to be O(1) because of
the double enhancement. For the real parts of $y_{L,~R}^{tT}$ in the negative
direction, it is always surpassed by the perturbative unitarity. Moreover, we
find that the top quark electric dipole moment can give stronger bounds
(especially the imaginary parts of $y_{L,~R}^{tT}$) than the perturbative
unitarity and $h\rightarrow\gamma Z$ decay in the off-axis regions for some
scenarios.

first author gender comparison of 30 million articles from all 27 Scopus broad
fields within the 31 countries with the most Scopus-indexed articles 2014-18.
The results show overall and geocultural patterns as well as individual
national differences. Almost half of the subjects were always more male (7;
e.g., Mathematics) or always more female (6; e.g., Immunology & Microbiology)
than the national average. A strong overall trend (Spearman correlation 0.546)
is for countries with a higher proportion of female first-authored research to
also have larger differences in gender disparities between fields (correlation
0.314 for gender ratios). This confirms the international gender equality
paradox previously found for degree subject choices: increased gender equality
overall associates with moderately greater gender differentiation between
subjects. This is consistent with previous USA-based claims that gender
differences in academic careers are partly due to (socially constrained) gender
differences in personal preferences. Radical solutions may therefore be needed

present a deep attentive network for social-aware next POI recommendation

sequential influence and social influence in a unified manner. Moreover, we
design and implement two parallel channels to capture short-term user

long-range dependencies between any two historical check-ins efficiently and
weigh their contributions to the next destination adaptively. Also, we carried

  Experiments",,,,,"stat.AP econ.EM stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In an A/B test, the typical objective is to measure the total average
treatment effect (TATE), which measures the difference between the average
outcome if all users were treated and the average outcome if all users were
untreated. However, a simple difference-in-means estimator will give a biased
estimate of the TATE when outcomes of control units depend on the outcomes of
treatment units, an issue we refer to as test-control interference. Using a
simulation built on top of data from Airbnb, this paper considers the use of
methods from the network interference literature for online marketplace
experimentation. We model the marketplace as a network in which an edge exists
between two sellers if their goods substitute for one another. We then simulate
seller outcomes, specifically considering a ""status quo"" context and
""treatment"" context that forces all sellers to lower their prices. We use the
same simulation framework to approximate TATE distributions produced by using
blocked graph cluster randomization, exposure modeling, and the Hajek estimator
for the difference in means. We find that while blocked graph cluster
randomization reduces the bias of the naive difference-in-means estimator by as
much as 62%, it also significantly increases the variance of the estimator. On
the other hand, the use of more sophisticated estimators produces mixed
results. While some provide (small) additional reductions in bias and small
reductions in variance, others lead to increased bias and variance. Overall,
our results suggest that experiment design and analysis techniques from the
network experimentation literature are promising tools for reducing bias due to
test-control interference in marketplace experiments.

been theoretical attempts to describe his measurements by collapsing the data
into single-variable functions. However, this approach, which is common in
other areas of physics and in other fields, is limited by the lack of rigorous
quantitative methods to compare alternative data collapses. Here, we address
this limitation by using an unsupervised method to find analytic functions that
optimally describe each of the data collapses for the Nikuradse dataset. By
descaling these analytic functions, we show that a low dispersion of the scaled
data does not guarantee that a data collapse is a good description of the
original data. In fact, we find that, out of all the proposed data collapses,
the original one proposed by Prandtl and Nikuradse over 80 years ago provides
the best description of the data so far, and that it also agrees well with
recent experimental data, provided that some model parameters are allowed to
vary across experiments.

computational challenges to it. In this paper, we leverage sketching techniques
and derive two randomized spectral co-clustering algorithms, one
\emph{random-projection-based} and the other \emph{random-sampling-based}, to
accelerate the co-clustering of large-scale directed networks. We theoretically
analyze the resulting algorithms under two generative models -- the stochastic
co-block model and the degree-corrected stochastic co-block model, and
establish their approximation error rates and misclustering error rates,
indicating better bounds than the state-of-the-art results of co-clustering

$H$-free graphs (that is, graphs which do not admit $H$ as an induced

fixed graph $H$, there exists a constant $\delta > 0$ such that MIS can be
$n^{1 - \delta}$-approximated in $H$-free graphs, where $n$ denotes the number
of vertices of the input graph. We first prove that a constructive version of
the celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture implies ours. We then prove that the
set of graphs $H$ satisfying our conjecture is closed under the so-called graph
substitution. This, together with the known polynomial-time algorithms for MIS
in $H$-free graphs (e.g. $P_6$-free and fork-free graphs), implies that our
conjecture holds for many graphs $H$ for which the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture
is still open. We then focus on improving the constant $\delta$ for some graph
classes: we prove that the classical Local Search algorithm provides an
$OPT^{1-\frac{1}{t}}$-approximation in $K_{t,t}$-free graphs (hence a
$\sqrt{OPT}$-approximation in $C_4$-free graphs), and, while there is a simple
$\sqrt{n}$-approximation in triangle-free graphs, it cannot be improved to
$n^{\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$ unless $NP \subseteq
BPP$. More generally, we show that there is a constant $c$ such that MIS in
graphs of girth $\gamma$ cannot be $n^{\frac{c}{\gamma}}$-approximated. Up to a
constant factor in the exponent, this matches the ratio of a known
approximation algorithm by Monien and Speckenmeyer, and by Murphy. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first strong (i.e., $\Omega(n^\delta)$ for some
$\delta > 0$) inapproximability result for Maximum Independent Set in a proper

truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can
simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown
based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various
communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is
the presence of another `flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19,
that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be
tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using
census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data
to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework
to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic
Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location Based Testing policy
(LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come
out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with
very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases.
Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT,
gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare
the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe
that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and
significantly better than RST.

broadly applicable approach that is based on minimal data requirements:
COVID-19 related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As
many countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific IFRs, we scale IFRs
between countries using remaining life expectancy as a marker to account for
differences in age structures, health conditions, and medical services. Across
10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, the number of
infections is estimated to be four [95% prediction interval: 2-11] times higher
than the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The
estimated number of infections is 1.4 million (six times the number of
confirmed cases) for Italy; 3.1 million (2.2 times the number of confirmed
cases) for the U.S.; and 1.8 times the number of confirmed cases for Germany,
where testing has been comparatively extensive. Our prevalence estimates,
however, are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence
studies. We introduce formulas for quantifying the bias that is required in our
data on deaths in order to reproduce estimates published elsewhere. This bias
analysis shows that either COVID-19 deaths are severely underestimated, by a
factor of two or more; or alternatively, the seroprevalence based results are
overestimates and not representative for the total population.

posterior distributions. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that
Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers have the potential to outperform MCMC in
a number of ways. SMC samplers are better suited to highly parallel computing
architectures and also feature various tuning parameters that are not available
to MCMC. One such parameter - the `L-kernel' - is a user-defined probability
distribution that can be used to influence the efficiency of the sampler. In
the current paper, the authors explain how to derive an expression for the
L-kernel that minimises the variance of the estimates realised by an SMC
sampler. Various approximation methods are then proposed to aid implementation
of the proposed L-kernel. The improved performance of the resulting algorithm
is demonstrated in multiple scenarios. For the examples shown in the current
paper, the use of an approximately optimum L-kernel has reduced the variance of
the SMC estimates by up to 99 % while also reducing the number of times that
resampling was required by between 65 % and 70 %. Python code and code tests

real-world applications. Universal perturbations applicable across multiple
images are gaining popularity due to their innate generalizability. There have
also been efforts to restrict the perturbations to a few pixels in the image.
This helps to retain visual similarity with the original images making such
attacks hard to detect. This paper marks an important step which combines all
these directions of research. We propose the DEceit algorithm for constructing
effective universal pixel-restricted perturbations using only black-box
feedback from the target network. We conduct empirical investigations using the
ImageNet validation set on the state-of-the-art deep neural classifiers by
varying the number of pixels to be perturbed from a meagre 10 pixels to as high
as all pixels in the image. We find that perturbing only about 10% of the
pixels in an image using DEceit achieves a commendable and highly transferable
Fooling Rate while retaining the visual quality. We further demonstrate that
DEceit can be successfully applied to image dependent attacks as well. In both
sets of experiments, we outperformed several state-of-the-art methods.

deployment and public adoption. However, security attacks that violate safety
constraints and cause accidents are a significant deterrent to achieving public
trust in AVs, and that hinders a vendor's ability to deploy AVs. Creating a
security hazard that results in a severe safety compromise (for example, an
accident) is compelling from an attacker's perspective. In this paper, we
introduce an attack model, a method to deploy the attack in the form of smart
malware, and an experimental evaluation of its impact on production-grade
autonomous driving software. We find that determining the time interval during
which to launch the attack is{ critically} important for causing safety hazards
(such as collisions) with a high degree of success. For example, the smart
malware caused 33X more forced emergency braking than random attacks did, and
accidents in 52.6% of the driving simulations.

trained with available simulation data, while being simultaneously guided by

number of fine-tuning steps is typically five orders of magnitude lower than
the total parameter count. Does this mean that fine-tuning only introduces
small differences from the pre-trained model in the parameter space? If so, can
one avoid storing and computing an entire model for each task? In this work, we
address these questions by using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from

varying from layer to layer. We show that it suffices to fine-tune only the

symmetric quantum fluctuations of the background metric, Kazakov and Solodukhin
removed the singularity of the Schwarzschild black hole. This regular
Schwarzschild black hole has a spherical central region with a radius of the
order of the Planck length. On the other hand, due to the positively
accelerating expansion of the Universe, it seems that there exists a universal
repulsive force known as dark energy. In the framework of quantum field
theories, the quintessence field is a candidate model for investigating and
modeling dark energy. Accordingly, by taking into account the quintessential
matter field in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole, Kiselev gained
the metric of this black hole surrounded by quintessence. By combining these
two above ideas, in the present study we consider the quantum-corrected
Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence to investigate null and
time-like geodesics structure. Generally, this study points out that black
holes are quantum-gravitational objects. We will show that the accelerated
expansion of the Universe, instead of dark energy, happens because of the
presence of quantum effects in this setup. Also, due to the presence of the
central Planck-size sphere, the regular black hole has been possessed a
shifting over radial coordinate in its inner structure.

Since transferability of knowledge heavily depends on the similarity of the

much knowledge is transferable? Is the transferred information equally
contributed by pre-trained layers? To answer these questions, this paper
proposes a framework to quantify knowledge gain by a particular layer, conducts

off-the-shelf representations from deep layers heavily depend on specific

screening high volumes of baggage for threats and contraband in the minimum
time possible. Automation and semi-automation of this procedure offers the
potential to increase security by detecting more threats and improve the
customer experience by speeding up the process. Traditional 2D x-ray images are
often extremely difficult to examine due to the fact that they are tightly
packed and contain a wide variety of cluttered and occluded objects. Because of
these limitations, major airports are introducing 3D x-ray Computed Tomography
(CT) baggage scanning. We investigate whether we can automate the process of
detecting electric devices in these 3D images of luggage. Detecting electrical
devices is of particular concern as they can be used to conceal explosives.
Given the massive volume of luggage that needs to be screened for this threat,
the best way to automate the detection is to first filter whether a bag
contains an electric device or not, and if it does, to identify the number of
devices and their location. We present an algorithm, Unpack, Predict, eXtract,
Repack (UXPR), which involves unpacking through segmenting the data at a range
of scales using an algorithm known as the Sieve, predicting whether a segment
is electrical or not based on the histogram of voxel intensities, then
repacking the bag by ensembling the segments and predictions to identify the
devices in bags. Through a range of experiments using data provided by ALERT

system can find a high proportion of devices with unsupervised segmentation if
a similar device has been seen before, and shows promising results for
detecting devices not seen at all based on the properties of its constituent

number of classes involved in the target task. Next, the pre-trained CNN is
tuned automatically by observing the classification performance on the

achieved exceptional success. However, many of these deep face recognition
models perform relatively poorly in handling profile faces compared to frontal
faces. The major reason for this poor performance is that it is inherently
difficult to learn large pose invariant deep representations that are useful
for profile face recognition. In this paper, we hypothesize that the profile
face domain possesses a gradual connection with the frontal face domain in the
deep feature space. We look to exploit this connection by projecting the
profile faces and frontal faces into a common latent space and perform
verification or retrieval in the latent domain. We leverage a coupled
generative adversarial network (cpGAN) structure to find the hidden
relationship between the profile and frontal images in a latent common
embedding subspace. Specifically, the cpGAN framework consists of two GAN-based
sub-networks, one dedicated to the frontal domain and the other dedicated to
the profile domain. Each sub-network tends to find a projection that maximizes
the pair-wise correlation between two feature domains in a common embedding
feature subspace. The efficacy of our approach compared with the

(SCA3/MJD). Objective: Explore the method of scale equating and demonstrate its
application through NESSCA and SARA scales, using the Item Response Theory
(IRT) approach in assessing SCA3/MJD commitment. Methods: Data came from 227
patients from the Hospital de Cl\'inicas de Porto Alegre with SCA3/MJD who have
complete measures for NESSCA and/or SARA scales. The equating design used is
that of non-equivalent groups with common items, with separate calibration. The
IRT model used in the estimation of the parameters was the generalized partial
credit, for NESSCA and SARA. The linear transformation was performed using the
Mean/Mean, Mean/Sigma, Haebara and StokingLord methods and the equation of the
true score was applied to obtain an estimated relationship between the scores
of the scales. Results: Difference between NESSCA score estimated by SARA and
observed NESSCA score has shown median of 0.82 points, by Mean/Sigma method.
This was the best method of linear transformation among the tested.
Conclusions: This study extended the use of scale equating under IRT approach
to health outcomes and established an equivalence relationship between NESSCA
and SARA scores, making the comparison between patients and scientific results
feasible.

Poul","Burr, Lomax, Pareto, and Logistic Distributions from Ultrasound Speckle","26 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph eess.IV eess.SP physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  After 100 years of theoretical treatment of speckle patterns from coherent
illumination, there remain some open questions about the nature of ultrasound
speckle from soft vascularized tissues. A recent hypothesis is that the fractal
branching vasculature is responsible for the dominant echo pattern from organs
such as the liver. In that case an analysis of cylindrical scattering
structures arranged across a power law distribution of sizes is warranted.
Using a simple model of echo strength and basic transformation rules from
probability, we derive the first order statistics of speckle considering the
amplitude, the intensity, and the natural log of amplitude. The results are
given by long tailed distributions that have been studied in the statistics
literature for other fields. Examples are given from simulations and animal
studies, and the theoretical fit to these preliminary data support the overall
framework as a plausible model for characterizing ultrasound speckle
statistics.

has not formed for many years. But companies and consumer organizations
complain about the failure to add new features to their networks and according
to their need, like much of the works to be done automatically and they also
like to develop and expand their networks on the software side so they do not
need new expensive hardware for many of the activities and needs of their
network. Analysis of the control layers and writing data in Software-Defined
Network facilitate network management and accelerate innovation in network. In
order to develop broad networks of SDN, often a large number controller is
needed and located position of controllers in the SDN networks and can be
raised as an important and basic issue in the field of SDN network and have
impact on reliability of SDN networks. This paper focused on latency and
reliability in SDN networks. The latency here means the delay in response to
the request of data path that has a significant impact on network latency. In
this paper it is shown that the number of controllers and their position can be
effective on two measures; reliability and latency in SDN networks.

  Representations in $\beta$-VAE from the Perspective of Core Object
  Recognition","65 Pages, 6 Figures, Thesis",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The ability to recognize objects despite there being differences in
appearance, known as Core Object Recognition, forms a critical part of human
perception. While it is understood that the brain accomplishes Core Object
Recognition through feedforward, hierarchical computations through the visual
stream, the underlying algorithms that allow for invariant representations to
form downstream is still not well understood. (DiCarlo et al., 2012) Various
computational perceptual models have been built to attempt and tackle the
object identification task in an artificial perceptual setting. Artificial
Neural Networks, computational graphs consisting of weighted edges and
mathematical operations at vertices, are loosely inspired by neural networks in
the brain and have proven effective at various visual perceptual tasks,
including object characterization and identification. (Pinto et al., 2008)
(DiCarlo et al., 2012) For many data analysis tasks, learning representations
where each dimension is statistically independent and thus disentangled from
the others is useful. If the underlying generative factors of the data are also
statistically independent, Bayesian inference of latent variables can form
disentangled representations. This thesis constitutes a research project
exploring a generalization of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), $\beta$-VAE,
that aims to learn disentangled representations using variational inference.
$\beta$-VAE incorporates the hyperparameter $\beta$, and enforces conditional
independence of its bottleneck neurons, which is in general not compatible with
the statistical independence of latent variables. This text examines this
architecture, and provides analytical and numerical arguments, with the goal of
demonstrating that this incompatibility leads to a non-monotonic inference
performance in $\beta$-VAE with a finite optimal $\beta$.
