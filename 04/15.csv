  Mobile Networks","Accepted for publication at ICDCS 2020",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  LoRaWAN is one of the leading Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
architectures. It was originally designed for systems consisting of static
sensor or Internet of Things (IoT) devices and static gateways. It was recently
updated to introduce new features such as nano-second timestamps which open up
applications to enable LoRaWAN to be adopted for mobile device tracking and
localisation. In such mobile scenarios, devices could temporarily lose
communication with the gateways because of interference from obstacles or deep
fading, causing throughput reduction and delays in data transmission. To
overcome this problem, we propose a new data forwarding scheme. Instead of
holding the data until the next contact with gateways, devices can forward
their data to nearby devices that have a higher probability of being in contact
with gateways. We propose a new network metric called Real-Time Contact-Aware
Expected Transmission Count (RCA-ETX) to model this contact probability in
real-time. Without making any assumption on mobility models, this metric
exploits data transmission delays to model complex device mobility. We also
extend RCA-ETX with a throughput-optimal stochastic backpressure routing scheme
and propose Real-Time Opportunistic Backpressure Collection (ROBC), a protocol
to counter the stochastic behaviours resulting from the dynamics associated
with mobility. To apply our approaches seamlessly to LoRaWAN-enabled devices,
we further propose two new LaRaWAN classes, namely Modified Class-C and
Queue-based Class-A. Both of them are compatible with LoRaWAN Class-A devices.
Our data-driven experiments, based on the London bus network, show that our
approaches can reduce data transmission delays up to $25\%$ and provide a
$53\%$ throughput improvement in data transfer performance.

nonparametric network inference. However, there has been little investigation
on accurate descriptions of the sampling distributions of network moment
statistics. In this paper, we present the first higher-order accurate
approximation to the sampling CDF of a studentized network moment by Edgeworth
expansion. In sharp contrast to classical literature on noiseless U-statistics,
we show that the Edgeworth expansion of a network moment statistic as a noisy
U-statistic can achieve higher-order accuracy without non-lattice or smoothness
assumptions but just requiring weak regularity conditions. Behind this result
is our surprising discovery that the two typically-hated factors in network
analysis, namely, sparsity and edge-wise observational errors, jointly play a
blessing role, contributing a crucial self-smoothing effect in the network
moment statistic and making it analytically tractable. Our assumptions match
the minimum requirements in related literature. For sparse networks, our theory
shows a simple normal approximation achieves a gradually depreciating
Berry-Esseen bound as the network becomes sparser. This result also refines the
best previous theoretical result.
  For practitioners, our empirical Edgeworth expansion is highly accurate, fast
and easy to implement. We demonstrate the clear advantage of our method by
comprehensive simulation studies.
  We showcase three applications of our results in network inference. We prove,
to our knowledge, the first theoretical guarantee of higher-order accuracy for
some network bootstrap schemes, and moreover, the first theoretical guidance
for selecting the sub-sample size for network sub-sampling. We also derive
one-sample test and Cornish-Fisher confidence interval for a given moment with
higher-order accurate controls of confidence level and type I error,
respectively.

of the angular power spectrum of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect is
not possible with simple scaling relations between the amplitude of the
spectrum and global parameters, such as the reionisation midpoint and its
duration. We introduce a new parameterisation of this spectrum, based on a
novel description of the power spectrum of the free electrons density contrast
Pee (k,z) in terms of the reionisation global history and morphology. We
directly relate features of the spectrum to the typical ionised bubble size at
different stages in the process and, subsequently, to the angular scale at
which the patchy kSZ power spectrum reaches its maximum. We successfully
calibrated our results on a custom set of advanced radiative hydrodynamical
simulations and later found our parameterisation to be a valid description of a
wide range of other simulations and, therefore, reionisation physics. In the
end, and as long as the global reionisation history is known, two parameters
are sufficient to derive the angular power spectrum. Such an innovative
framework applied to cosmic microwave background data and combined with 21cm
intensity mapping will allow a first consistent detection of the amplitude and
shape of the patchy kSZ signal, giving in turn access to the physics of early
light sources.

reconstruction algorithms in computerized tomography (CT). The ill-posedness of
this inverse problem allows only an approximate reconstruction for given noisy
data. Studying the resulting reconstruction error has been a most active field
of research in the 1990s and has recently been revived in terms of optimal
filter design and estimating the FBP approximation errors in general Sobolev
spaces.
  However, the choice of Sobolev spaces is suboptimal for characterizing
typical CT reconstructions. A widely used model are sums of characteristic
functions, which are better modelled in terms of Besov spaces
$\mathrm{B}^{\alpha,p}_q(\mathbb{R}^2)$. In particular
$\mathrm{B}^{\alpha,1}_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $\alpha \approx 1$ is a preferred
model in image analysis for describing natural images.
  In case of noisy Radon data the total FBP reconstruction error
$$\|f-f_L^\delta\| \le \|f-f_L\|+ \|f_L - f_L^\delta\|$$ splits into an
approximation error and a data error, where $L$ serves as regularization
parameter. In this paper, we study the approximation error of FBP
reconstructions for target functions $f \in \mathrm{L}^1(\mathbb{R}^2) \cap
\mathrm{B}^{\alpha,p}_q(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with positive $\alpha \not\in
\mathbb{N}$ and $1 \leq p,q \leq \infty$. We prove that the $\mathrm{L}^p$-norm
of the inherent FBP approximation error $f-f_L$ can be bounded above by
\begin{equation*} \|f - f_L\|_{\mathrm{L}^p(\mathbb{R}^2)} \leq c_{\alpha,q,W}

amount of rainfall can cause severe droughts or floods, affecting Indian food
production and security. Despite the development of sophisticated statistical
and dynamical climate models, a long-term and reliable prediction of the ISMR
has remained a challenging problem. Towards achieving this goal, here we
construct a series of dynamical and physical climate networks based on the
global near surface air temperature field. We uncover that some characteristics
of the directed and weighted climate networks can serve as efficient long-term
predictors for ISMR forecasting. The developed prediction method produces a
forecast skill of 0.5 with a 5-month lead-time in advance by using the previous
calendar year's data. The skill of our ISMR forecast, is comparable to the
current state-of-the-art models, however, with quite a short (i.e., within one
month) lead-time. We discuss the underlying mechanism of our predictor and
associate it with network-delayed-ENSO and ENSO-monsoon connections. Moreover,
our approach allows predicting the all India rainfall, as well as forecasting
the different Indian homogeneous regions' rainfall, which is crucial for
agriculture in India. We reveal that global warming affects the climate network
by enhancing cross-equatorial teleconnections between Southwest Atlantic,
Western part of the Indian Ocean, and North Asia-Pacific with significant
impacts on the precipitation in India. We find a hotspots area in the
mid-latitude South Atlantic, which is the basis for our predictor. Remarkably,
the significant warming trend in this area yields an improvement of the
prediction skill.

  Study Design and Setting: We illustrate random hot deck multiple imputation
using The Childhood Health, Activity, and Motor Performance School Study

participation for 1700 Danish schoolchildren. We matched records with missing
data to several observed records, generated probabilities for matched records
using observed data, and sampled from these records based on the probability of
each occurring. Because imputed values are generated randomly, multiple

from 13CO, as tracers of dense gas in molecular clouds. The fraction of the
line luminosity from each tracer that comes from the dense gas, as measured by
AV > 8 mag, varies substantially from cloud to cloud. In all cases, a
substantial fraction (in most cases, the majority) of the total luminosity
arises in gas below the AV > 8 mag threshold and outside the region of strong

spacetime. The two transverse-traceless components of the metric perturbation
are the true physical degrees of freedom. They appear in the quantum theory as
free quantum fields. Like the full Einstein action, the Euclidean action for
linearised gravity is unbounded below. It is therefore not possible to use that
action to represent the ground state wave function as a Euclidian functional
integral over exp{[-(action) /\hbar]}. However, it is possible to represent the
ground state as a Euclidian integral over the (deparametrised) action involving
only the true physical degrees of freedom. Starting from this integral
representation of the ground state and using the techniques of Faddeev and
Popov we show how to construct a Euclidean functional integral for the ground

symmetry, locality, and O(4) invariance. The conformal factor appears naturally
rotated into the complex plane. Other representations of the ground state are

classical static methods such as fault trees, event trees, or reliability block

model checking on various probabilistic state-based models. However, such
methods have to tackle the well-known state-space explosion problem. To compete
with this problem, reduction methods such as symmetry reduction and
partial-order reduction have been successfully applied to probabilistic models
by means of discrete Markov chains or Markov decision processes. Such models
are usually specified using probabilistic programs provided in guarded command
language. In this paper, we propose two automated reduction methods for
probabilistic programs that operate on a purely syntactic level: reset value
optimization and register allocation optimization. The presented techniques
rely on concepts well known from compiler construction such as live range
analysis and register allocation through interference graph coloring. Applied
on a redundancy system model for an aircraft velocity control loop modeled in
SIMULINK, we show effectiveness of our implementation of the reduction methods.
We demonstrate that model-size reductions in three orders of magnitude are

  Array Using One-Bit Measurements",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sparse array arrangement has been widely used in vector-sensor arrays because
of increased degree-of-freedoms for identifying more sources than sensors. For
large-size sparse vector-sensor arrays, one-bit measurements can further reduce
the receiver system complexity by using low-resolution ADCs. In this paper, we
present a sparse cross-dipole array with one-bit measurements to estimate
Direction of Arrivals (DOA) of electromagnetic sources. Based on the
independence assumption of sources, we establish the relation between the
covariance matrix of one-bit measurements and that of unquantized measurements
by Bussgang Theorem. Then we develop a Spatial-Smooth MUSIC (SS-MUSIC) based
method, One-Bit MUSIC (OB-MUSIC), to estimate the DOAs. By jointly utilizing
the covariance matrices of two dipole arrays, we find that OB-MUSIC is robust
against polarization states. We also derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of DOA
estimation for the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the
applicability of the independence assumption of sources, which is the
fundamental of the proposed and other typical methods, and verify the
assumption in typical communication applications. Numerical results show that,
with the same number of sensors, one-bit sparse cross-dipole arrays have
comparable performance with unquantized uniform linear arrays and thus provide
a compromise between the DOA estimation performance and the system complexity.

  Diversified Ensemble Classification","to appear in Machine Learning, Springer",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time series classification (TSC) is a challenging task that attracted many
researchers in the last few years. One main challenge in TSC is the diversity
of domains where time series data come from. Thus, there is no ""one model that
fits all"" in TSC. Some algorithms are very accurate in classifying a specific
type of time series when the whole series is considered, while some only target
the existence/non-existence of specific patterns/shapelets. Yet other
techniques focus on the frequency of occurrences of discriminating
patterns/features. This paper presents a new classification technique that
addresses the inherent diversity problem in TSC using a nature-inspired method.
The technique is stimulated by how flies look at the world through ""compound
eyes"" that are made up of thousands of lenses, called ommatidia. Each
ommatidium is an eye with its own lens, and thousands of them together create a
broad field of vision. The developed technique similarly uses different lenses
and representations to look at the time series, and then combines them for
broader visibility. These lenses have been created through
hyper-parameterisation of symbolic representations (Piecewise Aggregate and
Fourier approximations). The algorithm builds a random forest for each lens,
then performs soft dynamic voting for classifying new instances using the most
confident eyes, i.e, forests. We evaluate the new technique, coined Co-eye,
using the recently released extended version of UCR archive, containing more
than 100 datasets across a wide range of domains. The results show the benefits
of bringing together different perspectives reflecting on the accuracy and
robustness of Co-eye in comparison to other state-of-the-art techniques.

streamers emerging from a high-voltage electrode in a long (14 cm) air gap for
standard pressure and temperature. The applied voltage varies from 100 to 500
kV. To reveal the influence of photoionization, the calculations are made for
various rates of seed electron generation in front of the streamer head. The
difference between the properties of positive and negative streamers is
associated with the different directions of the electron drift ahead of the
streamer head. As a result, the peak electric field at the streamer head and
the streamer velocity are higher for positive voltage polarity. The average
electric field in the negative streamer channel is approximately twice that in
the positive streamer channel, in agreement with available measurements in long
air gaps. It is shown that photoionization in front of the streamer head is
important not only for the development of strong positive discharges, but for
the development of strong negative discharges as well. An increase in the
photoionization rate increases the propagation velocity of the positive
streamer and retards the propagation of the negative streamer.

quasi-particles with a very large mean free path $\ell$. Upon increasing the

intermediate diffusive range, and, eventually, the crossover to the anomalous

$M_s=0.640\pm 0.016$ M$_{\odot}$). We confirm the TESS planet discovery using
reconnaissance spectroscopy, ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging,
and a set of 38 precise radial-velocities from HARPS-N and HIRES. We measure a
planet mass of $6.91^{+0.75}_{-0.85}$ M$_{\oplus}$, which implies an iron core
mass fraction of $20^{+15}_{-12}$% in the absence of a gaseous envelope. The
bulk composition of TOI-1235 b is therefore consistent with being Earth-like
and we constrain a H/He envelope mass fraction to be $<0.5$% at 90% confidence.
Our results are consistent with model predictions from thermally-driven
atmospheric mass loss but not with gas-poor formation, suggesting that the
former class of processes remain efficient at sculpting close-in planets around
early M dwarfs. Our RV analysis also reveals a strong periodicity close to the
first harmonic of the photometrically-determined stellar rotation period that
we treat as stellar activity, despite other lines of evidence favoring a
planetary origin ($P=21.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ days, $m_p\sin{i}=13.0^{+3.8}_{-5.3}$
M$_{\oplus}$) that cannot be firmly ruled out by our data.

spectrometry was well suited for the analysis of specific high mass species
such as viruses. Still, the exclusive use of one-dimensional devices such as
vibrating beams forces a trade-off between analysis time (related to capture
area) and mass resolution (inversely proportional to device mass). Such devices
also require complex readout schemes to simultaneously monitor multiple
resonance modes, in particular when stiffness or shape come into play, which
degrades mass resolution. These issues restrict nanomechanical MS to the
analysis of species with specific properties. We report here the first
demonstration of single-particle mass spectrometry with nano-optomechanical
resonators fabricated with a Very Large Scale Integration process. The unique
motion sensitivity of optomechanical techniques allows the use of resonators
with new topologies. The device introduced here is designed to be impervious to
particle position, stiffness or shape, opening the way to the analysis of large
aspect ratio biological objects of great significance such as viruses with a
tail or fibrils. Compared to top-down beam resonators with electrical read-out
and state-of-the-art mass resolution, we show a three-fold improvement in
capture area with no resolution degradation, despite the use of a single
resonance mode. Short analysis time is in reach thanks to the sensitivity and
bandwidth of optomechanical read-out and its compliance with telecom

planning on discretized spaces. The performance of these algorithms is heavily
affected by the resolution at which the search space is discretized. Typically
a fixed resolution is chosen for a given domain. While a finer resolution

resolution gives a fast exploratory behavior but compromises on maneuverability

both high and low resolution discretizations, we propose Multi-Resolution A*

very recently a second candidate planet was proposed based on radial
velocities. At quadrature, the expected projected separation of this new
candidate is larger than 1 arcsec, making it a potentially interesting target
for direct imaging. While difficult, identification of the optical counterpart
of this planet would allow detailed characterization of the closest planetary
system. We searched for a counterpart in SPHERE images acquired during four
years through the SHINE survey. In order to account for the large orbital
motion of the planet, we used a method that assumes the circular orbit obtained
from radial velocities and exploits the sequence of observations acquired close
to quadrature in the orbit. We checked this with a more general approach that
considers keplerian motion, K-stacker. We did not obtain a clear detection. The
best candidate has S/N=6.1 in the combined image. A statistical test suggests
that the probability that this detection is due to random fluctuation of noise
is < 1% but this result depends on the assumption that distribution of noise is
uniform over the image. The position of this candidate and the orientation of
its orbital plane fit well with observations in the ALMA 12m array image.
However, the astrometric signal expected from the orbit of the candidate we
detected is 3-sigma away from the astrometric motion of Proxima as measured
from early Gaia data. This, together with the unexpectedly high flux associated
with our direct imaging detection, means we cannot confirm that our candidate
is indeed Proxima c. On the other hand, if confirmed, this would be the first
observation in imaging of a planet discovered from radial velocities and the
second one (after Fomalhaut b) of reflecting circumplanetary material. Further
confirmation observations should be done as soon as possible.

Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources

(WSNs) to solve distributed tasks such as consensus, signal denoising, and
reconstruction. However, when employed over WSN, the graph filters should deal
with the network limited energy, processing, and communication capabilities.
Quantization plays a fundamental role to improve the latter but its effects on
distributed graph filtering are little understood. WSNs are also prone to
random link losses due to noise and interference. The filter output is affected
by both the quantization error and the topological randomness error, which, if
it is not properly accounted in the filter design phase, may lead to an
accumulated error through the filtering iterations and significantly degrade
the performance. In this paper, we analyze how quantization affects distributed
graph filtering over both time-invariant and time-varying graphs. We bring
insights on the quantization effects for the two most common graph filters: the
finite impulse response (FIR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) graph
filter. We devise theoretical performance guarantees on the filter performance
when the quantization stepsize is fixed or changes dynamically over the
filtering iterations. For FIR filters, we show that a dynamic quantization
stepsize leads to more control on the quantization noise than the
fixed-stepsize quantization. For ARMA graph filters, we show that decreasing
the quantization stepsize over the iterations reduces the quantization noise to
zero at the steady-state. In addition, we propose robust filter design
strategies that minimize the quantization noise for both time-invariant and
time-varying networks. Numerical experiments on synthetic and two real data
sets corroborate our findings and show the different trade-offs between
quantization bits, filter order, and robustness to topological randomness.

subjected to a thermal phase transition remain to be elucidated. Here, we
create a hexagonally close-packed monodisperse emulsion in 2D and show that
during a cool-heat cycle, the emulsion fully destabilizes akin to phase
separation. The mechanism for this catastrophic destabilization is found to be
spontaneous coalescence initiation that synchronously occurs between every
solidified droplet and its neighbors. This synchronous coalescence initiation
establishes system-wide network connectivity in the emulsion causing
large-scale destabilization. This system-wide coalescence initiation is found
to be insensitive to droplet size and surfactant type, but dependent on network
connectivity and crystal content of individual droplets.

right parameters, the \ollga optimizes any jump function with jump size $2 \le

significantly and already for constant~$k$ outperforms standard mutation-based
algorithms with their $\Theta(n^k)$ runtime and standard crossover-based
algorithms with their $\tilde{O}(n^{k-1})$ runtime guarantee.
  For the isolated problem of leaving the local optimum of jump functions, we
determine provably optimal parameters that lead to a runtime of $(n/k)^{k/2}

serve as starting point for the matter forward model. We show that this cutoff,
which was not employed in any previous related work, is important to regularize
loop integrals that otherwise involve small-scale, non-perturbative modes. We
then present results on the inferred value of the linear power spectrum
normalization $\sigma_{8}$ from rest-frame halo catalogs using both second- and
third-order bias expansions, imposing uniform priors on all bias parameters.
Due to the perfect bias-$\sigma_{8}$ degeneracy at linear order, constraints on
$\sigma_{8}$ rely entirely on nonlinear information. The results show the
expected convergence behavior when lowering the cutoff in wavenumber,
$\Lambda$. When including modes up to $k \leq \Lambda = 0.1\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
in the second-order case, $\sigma_{8}$ is recovered to within $\lesssim 6\,\%$
for a range of halo masses and redshifts. The systematic bias shrinks to
$4\,\%$ or less for the third-order bias expansion on the same range of scales.
Together with additional evidence we provide, this shows that the residual
mismatch in $\sigma_{8}$ can be attributed to higher-order bias contributions.
We conclude that the EFT likelihood is able to infer unbiased cosmological
constraints, within expected theoretical systematic errors, from physical
biased tracers on quasilinear scales

of the interstellar medium at sub-parsec resolution while also capturing the
interaction between the CMZ and the bar-driven large-scale flow out to $R\sim
5\kpc$. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The distinction between inner
($R\lesssim120$~pc) and outer ($120\lesssim R\lesssim450$~pc) CMZ that is
sometimes proposed in the literature is unnecessary. Instead, the CMZ is best
described as single structure, namely a star-forming ring with outer radius
$R\simeq 200$~pc which includes the 1.3$^\circ$ complex and which is directly
interacting with the dust lanes that mediate the bar-driven inflow. (2) This
accretion can induce a significant tilt of the CMZ out of the plane. A tilted
CMZ might provide an alternative explanation to the $\infty$-shaped structure
identified in Herschel data by Molinari et al. 2011. (3) The bar in our
simulation efficiently drives an inflow from the Galactic disc ($R\simeq
3$~kpc) down to the CMZ ($R\simeq200$~pc) of the order of
$1\rm\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$, consistent with observational determinations. (4)
Supernova feedback can drive an inflow from the CMZ inwards towards the
circumnuclear disc of the order of $\sim0.03\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$. (5) We
give a new interpretation for the 3D placement of the 20 and 50 km s$^{-1}$
clouds, according to which they are close ($R\lesssim30$~pc) to the Galactic
centre, but are also connected to the larger-scale streams at $R\gtrsim100$~pc.

low-mass star called Kepler-1649. The planet, Kepler-1649 c, is
1.06$^{+0.15}_{-0.10}$ times the size of Earth and transits its 0.1977 +/-
0.0051 Msun mid M-dwarf host star every 19.5 days. It receives 74 +/- 3 % the
incident flux of Earth, giving it an equilibrium temperature of 234 +/- 20K and
placing it firmly inside the circumstellar habitable zone. Kepler-1649 also
hosts a previously-known inner planet that orbits every 8.7 days and is roughly
equivalent to Venus in size and incident flux. Kepler-1649 c was originally
classified as a false positive by the Kepler pipeline, but was rescued as part
of a systematic visual inspection of all automatically dispositioned Kepler
false positives. This discovery highlights the value of human inspection of
planet candidates even as automated techniques improve, and hints that
terrestrial planets around mid to late M-dwarfs may be more common than those
around more massive stars.

preferred by the current measurements. The data exhibit a clear preference for
new-physics contributions, and good fits to the data are obtained in several
cases. However, the current measurement of the longitudinal $D^*$ polarization
in $B\to D^*\tau \bar\nu$ cannot be easily accommodated within its experimental
$1\sigma$ range. A general analysis of the three-body $B\to D \tau \bar\nu$ and

clusters. However, the verification of the ionized intracluster medium,
indicative of a collapsed and nearly virialized system, is made challenging by
the high redshifts of the sample members. The main goal of this work is to test
the capabilities of the Atacama Compact Array (ACA; also known as the Morita
Array) Band 3 observations, centered at about 97.5 GHz, to provide robust
validation of cluster detections via the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect.
Using a pilot sample that comprises ten MaDCoWS galaxy clusters, accessible to
ACA and representative of the median sample richness, we infer the masses of
the selected galaxy clusters and respective detection significance by means of
a Bayesian analysis of the interferometric data. Our test of the ""Verification
with the ACA - Localization and Cluster Analysis"" (VACA LoCA) program
demonstrates that the ACA can robustly confirm the presence of the virialized
intracluster medium in galaxy clusters previously identified in full-sky
surveys. In particular, we obtain a significant detection of the SZ effect for
seven out of the ten VACA LoCA clusters. We note that this result is
independent of the assumed pressure profile. However, the limited angular
dynamic range of the ACA in Band 3 alone, short observational integration
times, and possible contamination from unresolved sources limit the detailed
characterization of the cluster properties and the inference of the cluster
masses within scales appropriate for the robust calibration of mass-richness
scaling relations.

binary signals from noisy data, matched-filtering techniques are typically
required. This is especially true for low-mass systems, with total mass $M

bands for thousands of cycles. In this paper, we focus on the detectability of
low-mass binary systems whose individual components can have large spin-induced
quadrupole moments and small compactness. The quadrupole contributes to the
phase evolution of the waveform whereas the compactness affects the merger
frequency of the binary. We find that binary black hole templates (with
dimensionless quadrupole $\kappa=1$) cannot be reliably used to search for
objects with large quadrupoles ($\kappa\gtrsim 20$) over a wide range of
parameter space. This is especially true if the general object is highly
spinning and has a larger mass than its binary companion. A binary that
consists of objects with small compactness could merge in the LIGO and Virgo
frequency bands, thereby reducing its accumulated signal-to-noise ratio during
the inspiraling regime. Template banks which include these more general
waveforms must therefore be constructed. These extended banks would allow us to
realistically search for the existence of new astrophysical and beyond the
Standard Model compact objects.

is vital for a robust physical interpretation of polarization data, requiring
tests of and validations against potential instrumental systematics. We
illustrate this with ALMA Band 3 (97.5 GHz) observations of GRB 171205A taken
$\approx5.19$ days after the burst, where a detection of linear polarization
was recently claimed. We describe a series of tests for evaluating the

re-analyze and evaluate the archival ALMA data, we uncover systematics in the
polarization calibration at the $\approx0.09\%$ level. We derive a 3$\sigma$
upper limit on the linearly polarized intensity of $P<97.2~\mu$Jy,
corresponding to an upper limit on the linear fractional polarization of
$\Pi_{\rm L}<0.30\%$, in contrast to the previously claimed detection. Our
upper limit improves upon existing constraints on the intrinsic polarization of
GRB radio afterglows by a factor of 3. We discuss this measurement in the

eventually detecting signals polarized at the $\approx0.1\%$ level from typical

simulations resolve the structure of the interstellar medium at sub-parsec
resolution while also including the large-scale flow in which the CMZ is
embedded. Our main findings are as follows. (1) While most of the star
formation happens in the CMZ ring at $R\gtrsim100 {\, \rm pc}$, a significant
amount also occurs closer to SgrA* at $R \lesssim 10{\, \rm pc}$. (2) Most of
the star formation in the CMZ happens downstream of the apocentres, consistent
with the ""pearls-on-a-string"" scenario, and in contrast to the notion that an
absolute evolutionary timeline of star formation is triggered by pericentre
passage. (3) Within the timescale of our simulations ($\sim100$ Myr), the
depletion time of the CMZ is constant within a factor of $\sim2$. This suggests
that variations in the star formation rate are primarily driven by variations
in the mass of the CMZ, caused for example by AGN feedback or
externally-induced changes in the bar-driven inflow rate, and not by variations
in the depletion time. (4) We study the trajectories of newly born stars in our
simulations. We find several examples that have age and 3D velocity compatible
with those of the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. Our simulations suggest that
these prominent clusters originated near the collision sites where the
bar-driven inflow accretes onto the CMZ, at symmetrical locations with respect
to the Galactic centre, and that they have already decoupled from the gas in
which they were born.

subshift obtained as the projection of orbits staying in a given region. It
generates a new type of (essentially) coded shift. The fiber maps have
expanding and contracting regions which dynamically interact. The dynamics also
exhibits pairs of horseshoes of different type of hyperbolicity which, in some
cases, are cyclically related.
  The space of ergodic measures on the base is an entropy-dense Poulsen
simplex. Those measures lift canonically to ergodic measures for the
skew-product. We explain when and how the spaces of (fiber) contracting and
expanding ergodic measures glue along the nonhyperbolic ones. A key step is the
approximation (in the weak$\ast$ topology and in entropy) of nonhyperbolic
measures by ergodic ones, obtained only by means of concavity. Concavity is not
merely a technical artificial hypothesis, but it prevents the presence of
additional independent subsystems. The description of homoclinic relations is
also a key instrument.
  These skew-products are embedded in non-decreasing entropy one-parameter
family of diffeomorphisms stretching from a heterodimensional cycle to a
collision of homoclinic classes. Associated bifurcation phenomena involve a
jump of the space of ergodic measures and, in some cases, of entropy.

Recent word embedding approaches offer a continuous alternative to discrete

a user's information need represented by short queries. In particular for the

interactions as well as forecast network evolution. Network embedding is a
methodology to assign coordinates to nodes in a low dimensional vector space.
By embedding nodes into vectors, the link prediction problem can be converted
into a similarity comparison task. Nodes with similar embedding vectors are
more likely to be connected. Classic network embedding algorithms are
random-walk-based. They sample trajectory paths via random walks and generate
node pairs from the trajectory paths. The node pair set is further used as the
input for a Skip-Gram model, a representative language model that embeds nodes
(which are regarded as words) into vectors. In the present study, we propose to
replace random walk processes by a spreading process, namely the
susceptible-infected (SI) model, to sample paths. Specifically, we propose two
SI-spreading-based algorithms, SINE and TSINE, to embed static and temporal
networks, respectively. The performance of our algorithms is evaluated by the
missing link prediction task in comparison with state-of-the-art static and
temporal network embedding algorithms. Results show that SINE and TSINE
outperform the baselines across all six empirical datasets. We further find
that the performance of SINE is mostly better than TSINE, suggesting that
temporal information does not necessarily improve the embedding for missing
link prediction. Moreover, we study the effect of the sampling size, quantified
as the total length of the trajectory paths, on the performance of the
embedding algorithms. The better performance of SINE and TSINE requires a
smaller sampling size in comparison with the baseline algorithms. Hence,
SI-spreading-based embedding tends to be more applicable to large-scale
networks.

  supplementary tables",,,,"physics.med-ph eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fMRI community has made great strides in decoupling neuronal activity
from other physiologically induced T2* changes, using sensors that provide a
ground-truth with respect to cardiac, respiratory, and head movement dynamics.
However, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) time-series dynamics are
confounded by scanner artifacts, in complex ways that can vary not only between
scanners but even, for the same scanner, between sessions. The lack of
equivalent ground truth has thus far stymied the development of reliable
methods for identification and removal of scanner-induced noise. To address
this problem, we first designed and built a phantom capable of providing
dynamic signals equivalent to that of the resting-state brain. Using the
dynamic phantom, we quantified voxel-wise noise by comparing the ground-truth
time-series with its measured fMRI data. We derived the following data-quality
metrics: Standardized Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ST-SNR) and Dynamic Fidelity that
can be directly compared across scanners. Dynamic phantom data acquired from
four scanners showed scanner-instability multiplicative noise contributions of
about 6-18% of the total noise. We further measured strong non-linearity in the
fMRI response for all scanners, ranging between 8-19% of total voxels. To
correct scanner distortion of fMRI time-series dynamics at a single-subject
level, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on paired sets of
measured vs. ground-truth data. Tests on dynamic phantom time-series showed a
4- to 7-fold increase in ST-SNR and about 40-70% increase in Dynamic Fidelity
after denoising. Critically, we observed that the CNN temporal denoising pushes
ST-SNR > 1. Denoising human-data with ground-truth-trained CNN showed markedly
increased detection sensitivity of resting-state networks.

the robotics field as a robust localization method in recent years. UWB enables
high accuracy distance estimation from time-of-flight measurements of wireless
signals, even in non-line-of-sight measurements. UWB-based localization systems
have been utilized in various types of GNSS-denied environments for ground or
aerial autonomous robots. However, most of the existing solutions rely on a
fixed and well-calibrated set of UWB nodes, or anchors, to estimate accurately
the position of other mobile nodes, or tags, through multilateration. This
limits the applicability of such systems for dynamic and ad-hoc deployments,
such as post-disaster scenarios where the UWB anchors could be mounted on
mobile robots to aid the navigation of UAVs or other robots. We introduce a
collaborative algorithm for online autocalibration of anchor positions,
enabling not only ad-hoc deployments but also movable anchors, based on
Decawave's DWM1001 UWB module. Compared to the built-in autocalibration process
from Decawave, we drastically reduce the amount of calibration time and
increase the accuracy at the same time. We provide both experimental
measurements and simulation results to demonstrate the usability of this

phase-insensitive target detection protocol based on intensity detection that

as a total probe photon transmission estimation problem and obtain an
analytical expression of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We
carry out experiments using a semiconductor waveguide source, which we

with the theoretical prediction. In particular, we find that in a high-level
environment noise and loss, the QTC detection protocol can achieve performance
comparable to that of the classical protocol (that is practical in the optical

metric. The performance of the QTC detection protocol experiment setup could be
further improved with a higher transmission of the reference photon and better
detector time uncertainty. Furthermore, the probe photons in the QTC detection

gain decrease in both the time- and frequency domain. Our analysis of channel
hardening is based on a joint comparison of theory, measurements and

new measurements obtained with the HIRES/Keck-I instrument between 2012 and

planetary tidal potential can be distilled for the host star. Its amplitude is
in agreement with both theoretical predictions of the equilibrium tide
approximation and an ellipsoidal modulation observed in an orbital phase curve.
Assuming a circular orbit, we refine system parameters using photometric time
series from TESS. With a new ground-based photometric observation, we extend
the span of transit timing observations to 28 years in order to probe the rate
of the orbital period shortening. Since we found no departure from a
constant-period model, we conclude that the modified tidal quality parameter of
the host star must be greater than 3.9x10^6 with 95% confidence. This result is
in line with conclusions drawn from studies of the population of hot Jupiters,
predicting that the efficiency of tidal dissipation is 1 or 2 orders of
magnitude weaker. As the WASP-18 system is one of the prime candidates for
detection of orbital decay, further timing observations are expected to push

uncertainty in Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of scalar
transport. This paper presents an approach to quantify this uncertainty in
simulations of complex engineering flows. The approach addresses the
uncertainty in modeling the pressure scrambling (PS) effect, which is the
primary mechanism balancing the productions in scalar flux dynamics. Inspired
by the two classical phenomenological theories of return-to-isotropy (RI) and
isotropization-of-production (IP), we assume that the most likely directions of
the PS term are around a fan-shaped region bounded by the RI and IP directions.
Subsequently, we propose a strategy that requires two additional simulations,
defining perturbations of the PS directions towards the RI and IP limits. The
approach is applied to simulations of forced heat convection in a complex
pin-fin array configuration, and shows favorable monotonic properties and
bounding behaviors for various quantities of interest (QoIs) relevant to heat
transfer. To conclude, the results are analyzed from the perspective of
transverse scalar transport in a shear flow; the analysis indicates that the
proposed approach is likely to exhibit monotonic behaviors in a wide range of

problems that are constrained by different types of partial differential
equations. We consider linear as well as nonlinear problems and also problems

wave testing, are efficient and cost effective methods for inferring Vs
profile, one should acknowledge that site characterization using inverse
analyses can yield erroneous results associated with the inverse problem
non-uniqueness. One viable solution to alleviate the inverse problem
ill-posedness is to enrich the prior knowledge and/or the data space with
complementary observations. In the case of non-invasive methods, the pertinent
data are the dispersion curve of surface waves, typically resolved by means of
active source methods at high frequencies and passive methods at low
frequencies. To improve the inverse problem well-posedness, horizontal to
vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) data are commonly used jointly with the
dispersion data in the inversion. In this paper, we show that the joint
inversion of dispersion and strong motion downhole array data can also reduce
the margins of uncertainty in the Vs profile estimation. This is because
acceleration time-series recorded at downhole arrays include both body and
surface waves and therefore can enrich the observational data space in the
inverse problem setting. We also show how the proposed algorithm can be
modified to systematically incorporate physical constraints that further
enhance its well-posedness. We use both synthetic and real data to examine the
performance of the proposed framework in estimation of Vs profile and damping

how well models trained in simulation generalize to reality has remained
largely unanswered. The creation of a comparable ecosystem for

paired with physical counterparts to systematically explore and overcome the
challenges of simulation-to-real transfer, and a platform where researchers
across the globe can remotely test their embodied models in the physical world.
As a first benchmark, our experiments show there exists a significant gap

transfer is increased compared to the non-rotating case. We find that the
regime of increased heat transfer is subdivided into a low and a high $Ra$
number regime. For $Ra\lesssim 5\times10^8$ the heat transfer at a given $Ra$
and $Pr$ is highest at an optimal rotation rate, at which the thickness of the
viscous and thermal boundary layer is about equal. From the scaling relations
of the thermal and viscous boundary layer thicknesses, we derive that the
optimal rotation rate scales as $1/Ro_\mathrm{opt} \approx 0.12
Pr^{1/2}Ra^{1/6}$. In the low $Ra$ regime the heat transfer is similar in a
periodic domain and cylindrical cells with different aspect ratios, i.e.\ the
ratio of diameter to height. This is consistent with the view that the
vertically aligned vortices are the dominant flow structure. For $Ra\gtrsim
5\times10^8$ the above scaling for the optimal rotation rate does not hold
anymore. It turns out that in the high $Ra$ regime, the flow structures at the
optimal rotation rate are very different than for lower $Ra$. Surprisingly, the
heat transfer in the high $Ra$ regime differs significantly for a periodic
domain and cylindrical cells with different aspect ratios, which originates
from the sidewall boundary layer dynamics and the corresponding secondary

autoencoder is proposed for real time denoising of industrial sensor data. The
term \textit{blind} stresses that no prior knowledge about the noise is
required for denoising, in contrast to typical denoising autoencoders where
prior knowledge about the noise is required. Blind denoising is achieved by
using a noise contrastive estimation (NCE) regularization on the latent space
of the autoencoder, which not only helps to denoise but also induces a
meaningful and smooth latent space. Experimental evaluation in both a simulated
system and a real industrial process shows that the proposed technique
outperforms classical denoising methods.

the fact that, in the presence of an external magnetic field, the ISCO radius

down/up loops), as reported first in previous DEMT studies. We also estimate
the heating energy flux required at the coronal base to keep these structures

global constraints derived from box annotations. Particularly, we leverage a
classical tightness prior to a deep learning setting via imposing a set of
constraints on the network outputs. Such a powerful topological prior prevents
solutions from excessive shrinking by enforcing any horizontal or vertical line
within the bounding box to contain, at least, one pixel of the foreground
region. Furthermore, we integrate our deep tightness prior with a global
background emptiness constraint, guiding training with information outside the
bounding box. We demonstrate experimentally that such a global constraint is
much more powerful than standard cross-entropy for the background class. Our
optimization problem is challenging as it takes the form of a large set of
inequality constraints on the outputs of deep networks. We solve it with
sequence of unconstrained losses based on a recent powerful extension of the
log-barrier method, which is well-known in the context of interior-point
methods. This accommodates standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for
training deep networks, while avoiding computationally expensive and unstable
Lagrangian dual steps and projections. Extensive experiments over two different
public data sets and applications (prostate and brain lesions) demonstrate that
the synergy between our global tightness and emptiness priors yield very
competitive performances, approaching full supervision and outperforming
significantly DeepCut. Furthermore, our approach removes the need for
computationally expensive proposal generation. Our code is shared anonymously.

environments that lead to and/or reinforce the persistence of abusive drinking
behaviors. Our earlier results were obtained via a deterministic model that
ignored differences between individuals, that is, in a rather simple ""social""

use models that incorporate the role of ""chance"", or a high degree of ""social""

rates are high. We first use a Markov chain model to simulate the effect of
relapse on drinking dynamics. These simulations reinforce the conclusions
obtained before, with the usual caveats that arise when the outcomes of
deterministic and stochastic models are compared. However, the simulation
results generated from stochastic realizations of an ""equivalent"" drinking

operate under both incident polarizations, and require very low input

passive silicon-based metasurfaces exhibiting Fano and Lorentzian resonances

is achieved with the proposed design that leads to strong nonreciprocity at low

cascade designs are presented to further improve the insertion loss, broaden

singly exponential. Therefore, we are able to learn large mixtures of strings:

progenitor phase of many high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Although 3D
global hydrodynamic CE simulations have become more common in recent years,
those involving an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) primary are scarce, due to the
high computational cost from the larger dynamical range compared to red giant
branch (RGB) primaries. But CE evolution with AGB progenitors is desirable to
simulate because such events are the likely progenitors of most bi-polar
planetary nebulae (PNe), and prominent observational testing grounds for CE
physics. Here we present a high resolution global simulation of CE evolution
involving an AGB primary and $1\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ secondary, evolved for $20$
orbital revolutions. During the last $16$ of these orbits, the envelope unbinds
at an almost constant rate of about
$0.1$-$0.2\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. If this rate were maintained,
the envelope would be unbound in less than $10\,\mathrm{yr}$. The dominant
source of this unbinding is consistent with inspiral; we assess the influence
of the ambient medium to be subdominant. We compare this run with a previous
run that used an RGB phase primary evolved from the same $2\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$
main sequence star to assess the influence of the evolutionary state of the
primary. When scaled appropriately, the two runs are quite similar, but with
some important differences.

of our universe in order to achieve large improvements in certain information
processing tasks. In deep-space optical communications, current receivers for
the pure-state classical-quantum channel first measure each qubit channel
output and then classically post-process the measurements. This approach is
sub-optimal. In this dissertation we investigate a recently proposed quantum
algorithm for this task, which is inspired by classical belief-propagation
algorithms, and analyze its performance on a simple $5$-bit code. We show that
the algorithm is optimal for each bit and it appears to achieve optimal
performance when deciding the full transmitted message. We also provide
explicit circuits for the algorithm in terms of standard gates. This suggests a
near-term quantum communication advantage over the aforementioned sub-optimal
scheme.
  Quantum error correction is vital to building a universal fault-tolerant
quantum computer. We propose an efficient algorithm that can translate a given
logical Clifford operation on a stabilizer code into all (equivalence classes
of) physical Clifford circuits that realize that operation. In order to achieve
universality, one also needs to implement at least one non-Clifford logical
operation. So, we develop a mathematical framework for a large subset of
diagonal operations in the Clifford hierarchy, which we call Quadratic Form
Diagonal (QFD) gates. Then we use the QFD formalism to characterize all
stabilizer codes whose code spaces are preserved under the transversal action
of the non-Clifford $T$ gates on the physical qubits. We also discuss a few
purely-classical coding problems motivated by transversal $T$ gates. A
conscious effort has been made to keep this dissertation self-contained, by

dealing with ill-posed inverse problems due to the nonuniqueness of the
solution and data noise. Unfortunately, it is not trivial to fully describe our
priors in a convenient and analytical way. Parameterizing the unknowns with a
convolutional neural network (CNN), and assuming an uninformative Gaussian
prior on its weights, leads to a variational prior on the output space that
favors ""natural"" images and excludes noisy artifacts, as long as overfitting is
prevented. This is the so-called deep-prior approach. In seismic imaging,
however, evaluating the forward operator is computationally expensive, and
training a randomly initialized CNN becomes infeasible. We propose, instead, a
weak version of deep priors, which consists of relaxing the requirement that
reflectivity models must lie in the network range, and letting the unknowns
deviate from the network output according to a Gaussian distribution. Finally,
we jointly solve for the reflectivity model and CNN weights. The chief
advantage of this approach is that the updates for the CNN weights do not
involve the modeling operator, and become relatively cheap. Our synthetic
numerical experiments demonstrate that the weak deep prior is more robust with
respect to noise than conventional least-squares imaging approaches, with
roughly twice the computational cost of reverse-time migration, which is the
affordable computational budget in large-scale imaging problems.

full-duplex (FD) mode. The MUs, on the other hand, have single antennas and
works in the half-duplex (HD) mode. Each MU communicating with the FD-AP is
assigned to one of two groups, based on the time allocation and channel access
for either uplink (UL) or downlink (DL) communication. The channel assignment,
time resource, and power resource allocations are optimized to maximize the UL
weighted sum-rate. The sum-rate optimization problem is found to be non-convex.
Therefore, an iterative algorithm is investigated to optimize the UL weighted
sum-rate of the propose FD-WPCN system. Next, the proposed FD-WPCN algorithm is
modified for a HD-WPCN enabled communication between the AP and multiple MUs.
Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the proposed algorithm for

been investigated. The degradation and disappearance of ribbons have rarely
been explored. In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of a
C5.5 circular-ribbon flare associated with two jets (jet1 and jet2) on 2014
August 24, focusing on the fast degradation of the outer circular ribbon (CR).
The flare, consisting of a short inner ribbon (IR) and outer CR, was triggered
by the eruption of a minifilament. The brightness of IR and outer CR reached
their maxima simultaneously at $\sim$04:58 UT in all AIA wavelengths.
Subsequently, the short eastern part of CR faded out quickly in 1600 {\AA} but
gradually in EUV wavelengths. The long western part of CR degraded in the
counterclockwise direction and experienced a deceleration. The degradation was
distinctly divided into two phases: phase I with faster apparent speeds
(58$-$69 km s$^{-1}$) and phase II with slower apparent speeds (29$-$35 km
s$^{-1}$). The second phase stopped at $\sim$05:10 UT when the western CR
totally disappeared. Besides the outward propagation of jet1, the jet spire
experienced untwisting motion in the counterclockwise direction during
04:55$-$05:00 UT. We conclude that the event can be explained by the breakout
jet model. The coherent brightenings of the IR and CR at $\sim$04:58 UT may
result from the impulsive interchange reconnection near the null point, whereas
sub-Alfv\'{e}nic slipping motion of the western CR in the counterclockwise
direction indicates the occurrence of slipping magnetic reconnection. Another
possible explanation of the quick disappearance of the hot loops connecting to
the western CR is that they are simply reconnected sequentially without the
need for significant slippage after the null point reconnection.

the need for a discrete convergence analysis. More specifically, we show that a
generalization of symplectic integrators to nonconservative and in particular
dissipative Hamiltonian systems is able to preserve rates of convergence up to
a controlled error. Moreover, such methods preserve a shadow Hamiltonian
despite the absence of a conservation law, extending key results of symplectic
integrators to nonconservative cases. Our arguments rely on a combination of
backward error analysis with fundamental results from symplectic geometry. We
stress that although the original motivation for this work was the application
to optimization, where dissipative systems play a natural role, they are fully
general and not only provide a differential geometric framework for dissipative
Hamiltonian systems but also substantially extend the theory of

the cooling flow problem in the intracluster medium (ICM), while the detailed
mechanism is still in debate. Here we present a systematic study on the energy
coupling efficiency $\eta_{\rm cp}$, the fraction of AGN jet energy transferred
to the ICM. We first estimate the values of $\eta_{\rm cp}$ analytically in two
extreme cases, which are further confirmed and extended with a parameter study
of spherical outbursts in a uniform medium using hydrodynamic simulations. We
find that $\eta_{\rm cp}$ increases from $\sim 0.4$ for a weak isobaric
injection to $\gtrsim 0.8$ for a powerful point injection. For any given
outburst energy, we find two characteristic outburst powers that separate these
two extreme cases. We then investigate the energy coupling efficiency of AGN
jet outbursts in a realistic ICM with hydrodynamic simulations, finding that
jet outbursts are intrinsically different from spherical outbursts. For both
powerful and weak jet outbursts, $\eta_{\rm cp}$ is typically around $0.7-0.9$,
partly due to the non-spherical nature of jet outbursts, which produce
backflows emanating from the hotspots, significantly enhancing the ejecta-ICM
interaction. While for powerful outbursts a dominant fraction of the energy
transferred from the jet to the ICM is dissipated by shocks, shock dissipation
only accounts for $\lesssim 30\%$ of the injected jet energy for weak
outbursts. While both powerful and weak outbursts could efficiently heat
cooling flows, powerful thermal-energy-dominated jets are most effective in
delaying the onset of the central cooling catastrophe.

If most of the $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ decay into $\nu_3$ en route to Earth, no

attracted considerable research attention in the past few years. Regarding
graph classification tasks, the graphs to be classified may have various graph
sizes (i.e., different number of nodes and edges) and have various graph
properties (e.g., average node degree, diameter, and clustering coefficient).
The diverse property of graphs has imposed significant challenges on existing
graph learning techniques since diverse graphs have different best-fit
hyperparameters. It is difficult to learn graph features from a set of diverse
graphs by a unified graph neural network. This motivates us to use a multiplex
structure in a diverse way and utilize a priori properties of graphs to guide
the learning. In this paper, we propose MxPool, which concurrently uses
multiple graph convolution/pooling networks to build a hierarchical learning
structure for graph representation learning tasks. Our experiments on numerous
graph classification benchmarks show that our MxPool has superiority over other
state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods.

controlling the limits of detonations subject to lateral strain rates.
Experiments were conducted in hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures with varying levels
of cellular instability. These detonations were propagated in channels with
exponentially enlarging cross-sections, following the recent works of Radulescu
\& Borzou (2018) and Xiao \& Radulescu (2020). Steady detonation waves were
obtained at the macro-scale, with the near-limit reaction zone structures
characterized by significant unreacted gas pockets. The turbulent flame burning
velocity of these pockets was evaluated to be 30 m/s to 70 m/s, which is larger
than the theoretical laminar value by a factor of 2 to 7. For all the mixtures
tested, the characteristic $D-K$ relationships, relating the detonation mean
propagation speed with lateral flow divergence, were obtained directly from
experiments and as well from the generalized ZND model with lateral strain
rates using detailed chemical kinetics. The results showed that the degree of
departure between experiments and the theoretical predictions increases
significantly with the detonation instability level. As compared to the laminar
ZND wave, the more unstable detonations are much more detonable than the more
stable detonations, with substantially larger limiting divergence rates and
maximum velocity deficits. Such enhanced detonability with detonation
instability can be manifested in the significantly enhanced global rates of
energy release with the notably suppressed thermal character of ignition for
the more unstable detonations. This globally enhanced burning mechanism is
found to be realized by the intensified auto-ignition assisted by the turbulent
diffusive burning of the unreacted gas pockets, substantially shortening the
characteristic reaction zone lengths.

  for clustering multivariate count data","31 Pages",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multivariate count data are commonly encountered through high-throughput
sequencing technologies in bioinformatics, text mining, or in sports analytics.
Although the Poisson distribution seems a natural fit to these count data, its
multivariate extension is computationally expensive.In most cases mutual
independence among the variables is assumed, however this fails to take into
account the correlation among the variables usually observed in the data.
Recently, mixtures of multivariate Poisson-lognormal (MPLN) models have been
used to analyze such multivariate count measurements with a dependence
structure. In the MPLN model, each count is modeled using an independent
Poisson distribution conditional on a latent multivariate Gaussian variable.
Due to this hierarchical structure, the MPLN model can account for
over-dispersion as opposed to the traditional Poisson distribution and allows
for correlation between the variables. Rather than relying on a Monte
Carlo-based estimation framework which is computationally inefficient, a fast
variational-EM based framework is used here for parameter estimation. Further,
a parsimonious family of mixtures of Poisson-lognormal distributions are
proposed by decomposing the covariance matrix and imposing constraints on these
decompositions. Utility of such models is shown using simulated and benchmark
datasets.

the reduced-order model under the event-based MPC approach is investigated. It
is shown that the event-based nature of the proposed MPC approach can
significantly reduce the computational burden associated with the real-time

authentication. Image authentication focuses on investigating and maintaining
the integrity of images. As a blockchain system can be useful for maintaining
data integrity, image authentication has the potential to be enhanced by
blockchain. There are many techniques that can be used to authenticate images;
the technique investigated by this work is image hashing. Image hashing is a
technique used to calculate how similar two different images are. This is done
by converting the images into hashes and then comparing them using a distance
formula. To investigate the topic, an experiment involving a simulated
blockchain was created. The blockchain acted as a database for images. This
blockchain was made up of devices which contained their own unique image
hashing algorithms. The blockchain was tested by creating modified copies of
the images contained in the database, and then submitting them to the
blockchain to see if it will return the original image. Through this experiment
it was discovered that it is plausible to create an image authentication system
using blockchain and image hashing. However, the design proposed by this work
requires refinement, as it appears to struggle in some situations. This work
shows that blockchain can be a suitable approach for authenticating images,
particularly via image hashing. Other observations include that using multiple
image hash algorithms at the same time can increase performance in some cases,
as well as that each type of test done to the blockchain has its own unique
pattern to its data.

of diffusive transport theory inevitably involve dealing with more complicated
geometries as well as dealing with heterogeneous media. One of the most
fundamental properties of diffusive transport is the concept of mean particle
lifetime or mean exit time, which are particular applications of the concept of
first passage time, and provide the mean time required for a diffusing particle
to reach an absorbing boundary. Most formal analysis of mean particle lifetime
applies to relatively simple geometries, often with homogeneous
(spatially-invariant) material properties. In this work, we present a general
framework that provides exact mathematical insight into the mean particle
lifetime, and higher moments of particle lifetime, for point particles
diffusing in heterogeneous discs and spheres with radial symmetry. Our analysis
applies to geometries with an arbitrary number and arrangement of distinct
layers, where transport in each layer is characterised by a distinct
diffusivity. We obtain exact closed-form expressions for the mean particle
lifetime for a diffusing particle released at an arbitrary location and we
generalise these results to give exact, closed-form expressions for any
higher-order moment of particle lifetime for a range of different boundary

wave functions and energy of the first three examples are provided. A condition
is obtained to determine whether the BICs can be readily found in systems.
Using the condition, we find that although the BICs are universal phenomena,
they are often hardly found in many ordinary environments since the bound
continuous states perturbed by the effect of the minimal length are too weak to
observe. The results are consistent with the current experimental results on
BICs. In addition, we reveal a mechanism of the BICs. The mechanism explains
why current research shows the bound discrete states are typical, whereas BICs
are always found in certain particular environments when the minimal length is
not considered.

language processing (NLP): recent work suggests some strong-performing
recurrent neural networks utilize their memory as counters. Thus, one potential
way to understand the success of these networks is to revisit the theory of
counter computation. Therefore, we study the abilities of real-time counter
machines as formal grammars, focusing on formal properties that are relevant
for NLP models. We first show that several variants of the counter machine
converge to express the same class of formal languages. We also prove that
counter languages are closed under complement, union, intersection, and many
other common set operations. Next, we show that counter machines cannot
evaluate boolean expressions, even though they can weakly validate their
syntax. This has implications for the interpretability and evaluation of neural
network systems: successfully matching syntactic patterns does not guarantee
that counter memory accurately encodes compositional semantics. Finally, we
consider whether counter languages are semilinear. This work makes general
contributions to the theory of formal languages that are of potential interest
for understanding recurrent neural networks.

capacity of any binary-input discrete memoryless channel under low-complexity
successive cancellation decoding. In this thesis, we construct cyclic polar
codes based on a mixed-radix Cooley-Tukey decomposition of the Galois field
Fourier transform. The main results are: we can, for the first time, construct,
encode and decode polar codes that are cyclic, with their blocklength being
arbitrary; for a given target block erasure rate, we can achieve significantly
higher code rates on the erasure channel than the original polar codes, at
comparable blocklengths; on the symmetric channel with only errors, we can
perform much better than equivalent rate Reed-Solomon codes with the same
blocklength, by using soft-decision decoding; and, since the codes are subcodes
of higher rate RS codes, a RS decoder can be used if suboptimal performance
suffices for the application as a trade-off for higher decoding speed.
  In 2010, it was shown that spatially-coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes approach the capacity of binary memoryless channels, asymptotically, with
belief-propagation (BP) decoding. In this thesis, we are interested in the
finite length average performance of randomly coupled LDPC ensembles on binary
erasure channels with memory. The significant contributions of this work are:
tight lower bounds for the block erasure probability ($P_B$) under various
scenarios for the burst pattern; bounds focused on practical scenarios where a
burst affects exactly one of the coupled codes; expected error floor for the
bit erasure probability ($P_b$) on the binary erasure channel; and,
characterization of the performance of random regular ensembles, on erasure
channels, with a single vector describing distinct types of size-$2$ stopping

screw dislocations (TSDs) indeed attract Mg impurities, and that the electronic
levels in the energy gap induced by the dislocations are elevated towards the
conduction band as the Mg impurity approaches the dislocation line, indicating
that the Mg-TSD complex is a donor. The formation of the Mg-TSD complex is
unequivocally evidenced by our atom probe tomography in which Mg condensation
and diffusion through [0001] screw dislocations is observed in p-n diodes.
These findings provide a novel picture that the Mg being a p-type impurity in

  We aim to quantitatively and qualitatively study the effect of the dimension
of the input noise on the performance of GANs. For quantitative measures,
typically \emph{Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID)} and \emph{Inception Score

each consisting of different levels of complexity. Through our experiments, we
show that the right dimension of input noise for optimal results depends on the
data-set and architecture used. We also observe that the state of the art
performance measures does not provide enough useful insights. Hence we conclude
that we need further theoretical analysis for understanding the relationship

quantum processors can be programmed to efficiently simulate dynamics that are
not native to the hardware. Moreover, on noisy devices without error
correction, we show that simulation results are significantly improved when the
quantum program is compiled using modular gates instead of a restricted set of
standard gates. We demonstrate the general methodology by solving a cubic
interaction problem, which appears in nonlinear optics, gauge theories, as well
as plasma and fluid dynamics. To encode the nonnative Hamiltonian evolution, we
decompose the Hilbert space into a direct sum of invariant subspaces in which
the nonlinear problem is mapped to a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian simulation
problem. In a three-states example, the resultant unitary evolution is realized
by a product of ~20 standard gates, using which ~10 simulation steps can be
carried out on state-of-the-art quantum hardware before results are corrupted
by decoherence. In comparison, the simulation depth is improved by more than an
order of magnitude when the unitary evolution is realized as a single cubic
gate, which is compiled directly using optimal control. Alternatively,
parametric gates may also be compiled by interpolating control pulses. Modular
gates thus obtained provide high-fidelity building blocks for quantum
Hamiltonian simulations.

normal shape. Measurement of scoliosis requires labeling and identification of
vertebrae in the spine. Spine radiographs are the most cost-effective and
accessible modality for imaging the spine. Reliable and accurate vertebrae
segmentation in spine radiographs is crucial in image-guided spinal assessment,
disease diagnosis, and treatment planning. Conventional assessments rely on
tedious and time-consuming manual measurement, which is subject to
inter-observer variability. A fully automatic method that can accurately
identify and segment the associated vertebrae is unavailable in the literature.
Leveraging a carefully-adjusted U-Net model with progressive side outputs, we
propose an end-to-end segmentation model that provides a fully automatic and
reliable segmentation of the vertebrae associated with scoliosis measurement.
Our experimental results from a set of anterior-posterior spine X-Ray images
indicate that our model, which achieves an average Dice score of 0.993,
promises to be an effective tool in the identification and labeling of spinal
vertebrae, eventually helping doctors in the reliable estimation of scoliosis.
Moreover, estimation of Cobb angles from the segmented vertebrae further
demonstrates the effectiveness of our model.

as a contextual bandit problem characterized by a single-step Markov decision
process, and is solved using a reinforcement learning policy network. We build
an HEC testbed, implement our proposed approach, and evaluate it using real IoT
datasets. The demo shows that our proposed approach significantly reduces
detection delay (e.g., by 71.4% for univariate dataset) without sacrificing
accuracy, as compared to offloading detection tasks to the cloud. We also
compare it with other baseline schemes and demonstrate that it achieves the

extend substantially the unitary renormalization group (URG) scheme introduced
in Refs.\cite{anirbanmotti,anirbanmott2,mukherjee2020}. We recast the RG as a
discrete flow of the Hamiltonian tensor network, i.e., the collection of
various $2n$-point scattering vertex tensors comprising the Hamiltonian. The
renormalisation progresses via unitary transformations that block diagonalizes
the Hamiltonian iteratively via the disentanglement of single-particle
eigenstates. This procedure incorporates naturally the role of quantum
fluctuations. The RG flow equations possess a non-trivial structure, displaying
a feedback mechanism through frequency-dependent dynamical self-energies and
correlation energies. The interplay between various UV energy scales enables
the coupled RG equations to flow towards a stable fixed point in the IR. The
effective Hamiltonian at the IR fixed point generically has a reduced parameter
space, as well as number of degrees of freedom, compared to the microscopic
Hamiltonian. Importantly, the vertex tensor network is observed to govern the
RG flow of the tensor network that denotes the coefficients of the
many-particle eigenstates. The RG evolution of various many-particle
entanglement features of the eigenbasis are, in turn, quantified through the
coefficient tensor network. In this way, we show that the URG framework
provides a microscopic understanding of holographic renormalisation: the RG
flow of the vertex tensor network generates a eigenstate coefficient tensor
network possessing a many-particle entanglement metric. We find that the
eigenstate tensor network accommodates sign factors arising from fermion
exchange.

Hamiltonians as well as entanglement signatures through their respective tensor

significant extension of our previous result, where this problem was solved for
the simpler third order model, for which it is possible to recover
algebraically part of the unknown state. Unfortunately, this property is lost
in the more accurate fourth order model, significantly complicating the state
observation task. The design of the observer relies on two recent developments
proposed by the authors, a parameter estimation based approach to the problem
of state estimation and the use of the Dynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing
(DREM) technique to estimate these parameters. The use of DREM allows us to
overcome the problem of lack of persistent excitation that stymies the
application of standard parameter estimation designs. Simulation results
illustrate the latter fact and show the improved performance of the proposed
observer with respect to a locally stable gradient-descent based observer.

face attribute synthesis task. However, existing methods have very limited
effects on the expansion of new attributes. To overcome the limitations of a
single network in new attribute synthesis, a continuous learning method for
face attribute synthesis is proposed in this work. First, the feature vector of
the input image is extracted and attribute direction regression is performed in
the feature space to obtain the axes of different attributes. The feature
vector is then linearly guided along the axis so that images with target
attributes can be synthesized by the decoder. Finally, to make the network
capable of continuous learning, the orthogonal direction modification module is
used to extend the newly-added attributes. Experimental results show that the
proposed method can endow a single network with the ability to learn attributes
continuously, and, as compared to those produced by the current
state-of-the-art methods, the synthetic attributes have higher accuracy.

plainification by an in-built vertical interface on randomly dispersed
short-cut microwire composites allowing the adjustment of electromagnetic
properties to a large extent. Such interface was modified through arranging
wires of different structures in two separated regions and by enlarging or
reducing these regions through wire concentration variations leading to
polarization differences across the interface and hence microwave tunability.
When the wire concentration was equal in both regions, two well-defined
transmission windows with varied amplitude and bandwidth were generated. Wire
concentration fluctuations resulted in strong scattering changes ranging from
broad passbands to stopbands with pronounced transmission dips, demonstrating
the intimate relationship between wire content and space charge variations at
the interface. Overall, this study provides a novel method to rationally
exploit interfacial effects in microwire composites. Moreover, the advantages
of enabling significantly tunable scattering spectra by merely 0.053 vol. %

the entropy regularization makes the otherwise computationally demanding
optimal transport problem feasible even for large scale settings. This has lead
to an accelerated development of optimal transport based methods in a broad
range of fields. Many of these applications have a underlying graph structure,
for instance information fusion and tracking problems can be described by
trees. In this work we consider multi-marginal optimal transport problems with
a cost function that decouples according to a tree structure. The entropy
regularized multi-marginal optimal transport problem can be viewed as a
generalization of the Schr\""odinger bridge problem with the same
tree-structure, and by utilizing these connections we extend the computational
methods for the classical optimal transport problem in order to solve
structured multi-marginal optimal transport problems in an efficient manner. In
particular, the algorithm requires only matrix-vector multiplications of
relatively small dimensions. We show that the multi-marginal regularization
introduces less diffusion, compared to the commonly used pairwise
regularization, and is therefore more suitable for many applications. Numerical
examples illustrate this, and we finally apply the proposed framework for
tracking of an ensemble of indistinguishable agents.

one important feature of COVID-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by
viral infections. During the epidemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce

through analysis of the respiratory characteristics. The device mainly consists
of a FLIR one thermal camera and an Android phone. This may help identify those
potential patients of COVID-19 under practical scenarios such as pre-inspection
in schools and hospitals. In this work, we perform the health screening through
the combination of the RGB and thermal videos obtained from the dual-mode
camera and deep learning architecture.We first accomplish a respiratory data
capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a
bidirectional GRU neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the
respiratory data to obtain the health screening result. The results of
validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status on
respiratory with the accuracy of 83.7\% on the real-world dataset. The abnormal
respiratory data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from Ruijin
Hospital Affiliated to The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School. Other
normal respiratory data are obtained from healthy people around our

unveiled anomalous orbital structures. This has led to the hypothesis that an
additional $\sim5-10~m_{\oplus}$ planet exists. This planet, known as Planet 9,
occupies an eccentric and inclined orbit at hundreds of astronomical units.
However, the KBOs under consideration have the largest known semimajor axes at
$a>250$ AU; thus they are very difficult to detect.//
  Aims. In the context of the proposed Planet 9, we aim to measure the mean
plane of the Kuiper belt at $a>50$ AU. In a comparison of the expected and
observed mean planes, some constraints would be put on the mass and orbit of
this undiscovered planet.
  Methods. We adopted and developed the theoretical approach of Volk & Malhotra
(2017) to the relative angle $\delta$ between the expected mean plane of the
Kuiper belt and the invariable plane determined by the eight known planets.
Numerical simulations were constructed to validate our theoretical approach.
Then similar to Volk & Malhotra (2017), we derived the angle $\delta$ for the
real observed KBOs with $100<a<200$ AU, and the measurement uncertainties were
also estimated. Finally, for comparison, maps of the theoretically expected
$\delta$ were created for different combinations of possible Planet 9
parameters.
  Results. The expected mean plane of the Kuiper belt nearly coincides with the
said invariable plane interior to $a=90$ AU. But these two planes deviate
noticeably from each other at $a>100$ AU owing to the presence of Planet 9
because the relative angle $\delta$ could be as large as $\sim10^{\circ}$.
Using the $1\sigma$ upper limit of $\delta<5^{\circ}$ deduced from real KBO
samples as a constraint, we present the most probable parameters of Planet 9.

metasurfaces 5$\lambda\times$5$\lambda$ or larger with unit cells of

it is demonstrated that performance degrades significantly for angles larger

substrate. If the fluid in the droplet is a pure liquid and its contact line
remains pinned during the process, the mechanism behind such ring-shaped
deposition is the well-known coffee-stain effect. However, adding small amounts
of salt to such a droplet can change the internal flow dramatically and
consequently change the deposition mechanism. Due to an increase of surface
tension in the contact line region, a Marangoni flow arises which is directed
from the apex of the droplet towards the contact line. As a result, particles
arrive at the contact line following the liquid-air interface of the droplet.
Interestingly, the deposit is also ring-shaped, as in the classical
coffee-stain effect, but with a radically different morphology: particles form
a monolayer along the liquid-air interface of the droplet, instead of a compact
three-dimensional deposit. Using confocal microscopy, we study
particle-per-particle how the assembly of the colloidal monolayer occurs during
the evaporation of droplets for different initial concentration of sodium
chloride and initial particle dilution. Our results are compared with classical
diffusion-limited deposition models and open up an interesting scenario of
deposits via interfacial particle assembly, which can easily yield homogeneous
depositions by manipulating the initial salt and particle concentration in the
droplet.

our knowledge, the results for Dirac fermions and for strips are new. It is
remarkable that, unlike the scalars and holographic BCFT, the anomalous
currents of Dirac fields are independent of boundary conditions in general

multipole moments (diagonal order parameter) and multiplet pair amplitudes

propose to unify, strenghten, and refine the several swampland conjectures into
a single statement: the structural criterion, modelled on the structure theorem
in Hodge theory. In its most abstract form the new swampland criterion applies
to all 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ effective theories (having a quantum-consistent UV
completion) whether supersymmetry is \emph{local} or rigid: indeed it may be
regarded as the more general version of Seiberg-Witten geometry which holds
both in the rigid and local cases.
  As a first application of the new swampland criterion we show that a
quantum-consistent $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity with a cubic pre-potential is
necessarily a truncation of a higher-$\mathcal{N}$ \textsc{sugra}. More
precisely: its moduli space is a Shimura variety of `magic' type. In all other
cases a quantum-consistent special K\""ahler geometry is either an arithmetic
quotient of the complex hyperbolic space $SU(1,m)/U(m)$ or has no \emph{local}
Killing vector.
  Applied to Calabi-Yau 3-folds this result implies (assuming mirror symmetry)
the validity of the Oguiso-Sakurai conjecture in Algebraic Geometry: all
Calabi-Yau 3-folds $X$ without rational curves have Picard number $\rho=2,3$;
in facts they are finite quotients of Abelian varieties. More generally: the
K\""ahler moduli of $X$ do not receive quantum corrections if and only if $X$
has infinite fundamental group. In all other cases the K\""ahler moduli have
instanton corrections in (essentially) all possible degrees.

bandgap, and without ISB, the system achieves a gapless state before it
produces a non-trivial bandgap with inverted characters. The ISB field does not
stabilize the gapless state, and therefore, the discontinuity in the bandgap

points can be found by random, isotropic mutations. As a remedy to stagnation
of search in many objective optimization, in this paper, we suggest to enhance
the Pareto dominance order by involving an obtuse convex dominance cone in the
convergence phase of an evolutionary optimization algorithm. We propose
edge-rotated cones as generalizations of Pareto dominance cones for which the
opening angle can be controlled by a single parameter only. The approach is
integrated in several state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms
(MOEAs) and tested on benchmark problems with four, five, six and eight
objectives. Computational experiments demonstrate the ability of these
edge-rotated cones to improve the performance of MOEAs on many-objective
optimization problems.

and existing benchmark data contains outliers with various and unknown
characteristics. Fully synthetic data usually consists of outliers and regular
instance with clear characteristics and thus allows for a more meaningful
evaluation of detection methods in principle. Nonetheless, there have only been
few attempts to include synthetic data in benchmarks for outlier detection.
This might be due to the imprecise notion of outliers or to the difficulty to
arrive at a good coverage of different domains with synthetic data. In this
work we propose a generic process for the generation of data sets for such
benchmarking. The core idea is to reconstruct regular instances from existing
real-world benchmark data while generating outliers so that they exhibit
insightful characteristics. This allows both for a good coverage of domains and
for helpful interpretations of results. We also describe three instantiations
of the generic process that generate outliers with specific characteristics,
like local outliers. A benchmark with state-of-the-art detection methods
confirms that our generic process is indeed practical.

By the asymptotic analysis as the diffusion coefficient tends to 0, one can
expect that the solutions of the surface diffusion problem converge to the
solution of the problem without the surface diffusion. This is actually the
case, but the solution of the limiting problem naturally looses some
regularity. Indeed, the system we investigate is rather complicate due to the
presence of nonlinear terms including general maximal monotone graphs both in
the bulk and on the boundary. The two graphs are related each to the other by a
growth condition, with the boundary graph that dominates the other one. In
general, at the asymptotic limit a weaker form of the boundary condition is
obtained, but in the case when the two graphs exhibit the same growth the
boundary condition still holds almost everywhere.

  Website Classifiers",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning (ML) based approaches have been the mainstream solution for
anti-phishing detection. When they are deployed on the client-side, ML-based
classifiers are vulnerable to evasion attacks. However, such potential threats
have received relatively little attention because existing attacks destruct the
functionalities or appearance of webpages and are conducted in the white-box
scenario, making it less practical. Consequently, it becomes imperative to
understand whether it is possible to launch evasion attacks with limited
knowledge of the classifier, while preserving the functionalities and
appearance.
  In this work, we show that even in the grey-, and black-box scenarios,
evasion attacks are not only effective on practical ML-based classifiers, but
can also be efficiently launched without destructing the functionalities and
appearance. For this purpose, we propose three mutation-based attacks,
differing in the knowledge of the target classifier, addressing a key technical
challenge: automatically crafting an adversarial sample from a known phishing
website in a way that can mislead classifiers. To launch attacks in the white-
and grey-box scenarios, we also propose a sample-based collision attack to gain
the knowledge of the target classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our evasion attacks on the state-of-the-art, Google's phishing
page filter, achieved 100% attack success rate in less than one second per
website. Moreover, the transferability attack on BitDefender's industrial
phishing page classifier, TrafficLight, achieved up to 81.25% attack success
rate. We further propose a similarity-based method to mitigate such evasion
attacks, Pelican. We demonstrate that Pelican can effectively detect evasion
attacks. Our findings contribute to design more robust phishing website
classifiers in practice.

global in time existence for arbitrary large in $H^1$ initial data of a strong

subdividing the time interval of existence into smaller sub-intervals carefully
chosen. These sub-intervals are chosen based on the hypothesis that for any
wavenumber $m$, one can find an interval of time on which the energy quantized
in low-frequency components (up to $m$) of the solution $u$ is lesser than the
energy quantized in high-frequency components (down to $m$) or otherwise the
opposite. We associate then a suitable number $m$ to each one of the intervals
and we prove that the norm $\|u(t)\|_{H^1}$ is bounded in both mentioned cases.
The process can be continued until reaching the maximal time of existence
$T_{max}$ which yields the global in time existence of strong solution.

Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Despite considering only a single
degradation, recent studies also include multiple degrading effects to better
reflect real-world cases. However, most of the works assume a fixed combination
of degrading effects, or even train an individual network for different
combinations. Instead, a more practical approach is to train a single network
for wide-ranging and variational degradations. To fulfill this requirement,
this paper proposes a unified network to accommodate the variations from
inter-image (cross-image variations) and intra-image (spatial variations).
Different from the existing works, we incorporate dynamic convolution which is
a far more flexible alternative to handle different variations. In SISR with
non-blind setting, our Unified Dynamic Convolutional Network for Variational
Degradations (UDVD) is evaluated on both synthetic and real images with an
extensive set of variations. The qualitative results demonstrate the
effectiveness of UDVD over various existing works. Extensive experiments show
that our UDVD achieves favorable or comparable performance on both synthetic

the layout of an environment starting from a partial grid map and that predicts
the shape of partially observed rooms on the basis of geometric features

employ the predicted layout to estimate the amount of new area the robot would
observe from candidate locations in order to inform the selection of the next
best location and to early stop the exploration when no further relevant area
is expected to be discovered. Experimental activities show that our approach is
able to effectively predict the layout of partially observed rooms and to use
such knowledge to speed up the exploration.

difference in spectral passbands used in observations as well as by the

the filter systems used by the CoRoT, $Kepler$, TESS, and $Gaia$ space
missions. We also quantify the effect of the inclination of the rotation axis

Irradiance REconstructions (SATIRE) model to calculate solar brightness
variations in different filter systems as observed from the ecliptic plane. We
then combine the simulations of the surface distribution of the magnetic
features at different inclinations using a surface flux transport model (SFTM)
with the SATIRE calculations to compute the dependence of the variability on
the inclination. For an ecliptic-bound observer, the amplitude of the solar
rotational variability, as observed in the total solar irradiance (TSI) is 0.68
mmag (averaged over solar cycles 21-24). We obtained corresponding amplitudes
in the $Kepler$ (0.74 mmag), CoRoT (0.73 mmag), TESS (0.62 mmag), $Gaia~ $

rotational variability. For a sample of randomly inclined stars, the
variability is on average 15% lower in all filter systems considered in this
work. This almost compensates for the difference in the amplitudes of the
variability in TSI and $Kepler$ passbands, making the amplitudes derived from
the TSI records an ideal representation of the solar rotational variability for
comparison to $Kepler$ stars with unknown inclinations.

training of neural networks and, more broadly, in stochastic (nonconvex)
optimization. Accordingly, there are numerous effective, but poorly understood,
techniques for tuning the learning rate, including learning rate decay, which
starts with a large initial learning rate that is gradually decreased. In this
paper, we present a general theoretical analysis of the effect of the learning
rate in stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our analysis is based on the use of
a learning-rate-dependent stochastic differential equation (lr-dependent SDE)
that serves as a surrogate for SGD. For a broad class of objective functions,
we establish a linear rate of convergence for this continuous-time formulation
of SGD, highlighting the fundamental importance of the learning rate in SGD,
and contrasting to gradient descent and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.
Moreover, we obtain an explicit expression for the optimal linear rate by
analyzing the spectrum of the Witten-Laplacian, a special case of the
Schr\""odinger operator associated with the lr-dependent SDE. Strikingly, this
expression clearly reveals the dependence of the linear convergence rate on the
learning rate -- the linear rate decreases rapidly to zero as the learning rate
tends to zero for a broad class of nonconvex functions, whereas it stays
constant for strongly convex functions. Based on this sharp distinction between
nonconvex and convex problems, we provide a mathematical interpretation of the
benefits of using learning rate decay for nonconvex optimization.

interact with a DC magnetic B-field the resulting electrical action will
produce an AC electromotive force which oscillates at the Compton frequency of
the axion, and may be modeled as an oscillating effective impressed magnetic
current boundary source. We use this result to calculate the sensitivity of new
experiments to low-mass axions using the quasi-static technique. First, we
calculate the current induced in an electric dipole antenna (straight
conducting wire) when the DC B-field is spatially constant and show that it has
a sensitivity proportional to the axion mass. Following this we extend the
topology by making use of the full extent of the spatially varying DC B-field.
This extension is achieved by transforming the 1D conducting wire to a 2D
winding, to fully link the effective magnetic current boundary source and thus
couple to the full axion induced electrical action. In this case the conductor
becomes a coil winding where the voltage induced across the winding increases
proportionally to the number of windings. We investigate two different
topologies: The 1st uses a single winding, and couples to the effective short
circuit current generated in the winding, which is read out using a sensitive
low impedance SQUID amplifier: The 2nd uses multiple windings, with every turn
effectively increasing the the voltage output proportional to the winding
number. The read out of this configuration is optimised by implementing a
cryogenic low-noise high input impedance voltage amplifier. The end result is a
new Broadband Electrical Action Sensing Techniques with orders of magnitude
improved sensitivity, which is linearly proportional to the axion photon
coupling and capable of detecting QCD dark matter axions.

a new invisible enemy: Covid-19. Cities are locked down and civilians are

terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and
diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of
war-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also
in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present
an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets
posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first
analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show
that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus
treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the
population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to
three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal
frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal
frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR
is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one.
However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around
many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line
with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu,
may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the
Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in
the expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current

simulation of one-dimensional incompressible multiphase flow in pipelines and
channels. The model is obtained by simultaneously eliminating the volume
constraint and the pressure from the widely used two-fluid model (TFM). The
resulting `pressure-free two-fluid model' (PF-TFM) has a number of attractive
features: (i) it features four evolution equations (without additional
constraints) that can be solved very quickly with explicit time integration
methods; (ii) it keeps the conservation properties of the original two-fluid
model, and therefore the correct shock relations in case of discontinuities;
(iii) its solutions satisfy the two TFM constraints exactly: the volume
constraint and the volumetric flow constraint; (iv) it offers a convenient form
to analytically analyse the equation system, since the constraint has been
removed. A staggered-grid spatial discretization and an explicit Runge-Kutta
time integration method are proposed, which keep the constraints exactly
satisfied when numerically solving the PF-TFM. Furthermore, for the case of
strongly imposed boundary conditions, a novel adapted Runge-Kutta formulation
is proposed that keeps the volumetric flow exact in time while retaining high
order accuracy. Several test cases confirm the theoretical properties and show
the efficiency of the new pressure-free model.

exponential temperature dependence of the relaxation rate $\sigma$ at low
temperatures suggests a fully gapped superconducting state. We evaluated the
zero-temperature penetration depth $\lambda(0)\propto1/\sqrt{\sigma(0)}$ to be
around 320-1020 nm. Such a large value is consistent with the picture of a
doped Dirac semimetal. Moreover, we revealed that the ratio

the hydrodynamic analysis are the speed of sound in the broken phase and a
linear combination of the energy and pressure differences between the two
phases which we call pseudotrace (normalized to the enthalpy in the broken

yields the conventional trace of the energy-momentum tensor for a relativistic
plasma (with speed of sound squared of one third). We study this approach in
several realistic models of the phase transition and also provide a code
snippet that can be used to determine the efficiency coefficient for a given

accurate to the percent level for moderately strong phase transitions, while

Specifically, the proposed scheme offloads the Ultra-Reliable Low Latency

stringent latency requirement. However, it offloads the enhanced Mobile

  DISTINCT, AND, OR and NOT",,,,,"cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  SQL queries, with the AND, OR, and NOT operators, constitute a broad class of
highly used queries. Thus, their cardinality estimation is important for query
optimization. In addition, a query planner requires the set-theoretic
cardinality (i.e., without duplicates) for queries with DISTINCT as well as in
planning; for example, when considering sorting options. Yet, despite the
importance of estimating query cardinalities in the presence of DISTINCT, AND,
OR, and NOT, many cardinality estimation methods are limited to estimating
cardinalities of only conjunctive queries with duplicates counted.
  The focus of this work is on two methods for handling this deficiency that
can be applied to any limited cardinality estimation model. First, we describe
a specialized deep learning scheme, PUNQ, which is tailored to representing
conjunctive SQL queries and predicting the percentage of unique rows in the
query's result with duplicate rows. Using the predicted percentages obtained
via PUNQ, we are able to transform any cardinality estimation method that only
estimates for conjunctive queries, and which estimates cardinalities with
duplicates (e.g., MSCN), to a method that estimates queries cardinalities
without duplicates. This enables estimating cardinalities of queries with the
DISTINCT keyword. In addition, we describe a recursive algorithm, GenCrd, for
extending any cardinality estimation method M that only handles conjunctive
queries to one that estimates cardinalities for more general queries (that
include AND, OR, and NOT), without changing the method M itself.
  Our evaluation is carried out on a challenging, real-world database with
general queries that include either the DISTINCT keyword or the AND, OR, and
NOT operators. Experimentally, we show that the proposed methods obtain
accurate cardinality estimates with the same level of accuracy as that of the
original transformed methods.

an approach to multimodal change detection in bitemporal satellite images. A
main challenge is the alignment of the code spaces by reducing the contribution

approaches train the networks by exploiting supervised information of the
change areas, which, however, is not always available. We propose to extract
relational pixel information captured by domain-specific affinity matrices at
the input and use this to enforce alignment of the code spaces and reduce the
impact of change pixels on the learning objective. A change prior is derived in
an unsupervised fashion from pixel pair affinities that are comparable across
domains. To achieve code space alignment we enforce that pixel with similar
affinity relations in the input domains should be correlated also in code
space. We demonstrate the utility of this procedure in combination with cycle
consistency. The proposed approach are compared with state-of-the-art deep

configuration space approach with an external time parameter. This is in stark
contrast with the relativistic paradigm, where time is but a coordinate chosen
by an observer. Here we show, however, that the two attitudes toward modelling
$N$-particle dynamics can be conciliated within a generally covariant
framework. To this end we construct an '$N$-particle configuration spacetime'
$\mathcal{M}_{\scriptscriptstyle (N)}$, starting from a globally hyperbolic
spacetime $\mathcal{M}$ with a chosen smooth splitting into time and space
components. The dynamics of multi-particle systems is modelled at the level of
Borel probability measures over $\mathcal{M}_{\scriptscriptstyle (N)}$ with the
help of the global time parameter. We prove that with any time-evolution of
measures, which respects the $N$-particle causal structure of
$\mathcal{M}_{\scriptscriptstyle (N)}$, one can associate a single measure on
the Polish space of '$N$-particle wordlines'. The latter is a
splitting-independent object, from which one can extract the evolution of
measures for any other global observer on $\mathcal{M}$. An additional asset of
the adopted measure-theoretic framework is the possibility to model the
dynamics of indistinguishable entities, such as quantum particles. As an
application we show that the multi-photon and multi-fermion Schr\""odinger
equations, although explicitly dependent on the choice of an external
time-parameter, are in fact fully compatible with the causal structure of the

to contribute to the higher performance of flying and swimming animals compared
with their engineered peers. Flexibility seems to follow a universal design
rule that induces bending patterns at about one-third from the distal tip of
the propulsor's span. However, the aerodynamic mechanisms that shaped this
convergent design and the potential improvement in performance are not well
understood. Here we analyze the effect of heterogenous flexibility on the
flight performance of tumbling wings. Using experiments, numerical simulations,
and scaling analysis, we demonstrate that spanwise tip flexibility that follows
this empirical rule leads to improved flight performance. Our findings
attribute this improvement to flutter-induced drag reduction. This mechanism is
independent of the wing's auto-rotation and represents a more general trait of
wings with non-uniform tip flexibility. We conclude by analyzing the effects of
both spanwise and chordwise non-uniformity on the flight performance of
tumbling seedpods.

evaluate them in a DHT-based distributed online social networks called

of mobile services. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the
usability of Mobile Health applications in Bangladesh.
  Method: We followed a 3-stage approach in our research. First, we conducted a
keyword-based application search in the popular app stores. We followed the
affinity diagram approach and clustered the found applications into nine
groups. Second, we randomly selected four apps from each group (36 apps in
total) and conducted a heuristic evaluation. Finally, we selected the highest
downloaded app from each group and conducted user studies with 30 participants.
  Results: We found 61% usability problems are catastrophe or major in nature
from heuristic inspection. The most (21%) violated heuristic is aesthetic and
minimalist design. The user studies revealed low System Usability Scale (SUS)
scores for those apps that had a high number of usability problems based on the
heuristic evaluation. Thus, the results of heuristic evaluation and user
studies complement each other.
  Conclusion: Overall, the findings suggest that the usability of the mobile
health apps in Bangladesh is not satisfactory in general and could be a
potential barrier for wider adoption of mobile health services.

evaluate the effectiveness of three targeted distancing strategies designed to

limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts, seeking similarity across

stochastic infection curves that incorporate core elements from infection

increase the efficiency of social distancing measures, introducing the

excluded on the basis of a numerical solution of the linearised governing
equations. This result extends to the annular geometry the well-known Gill's
theorem regarding the impossibility of convective instability in a vertical
porous plane slab whose boundaries are impermeable and isothermal with
different temperatures. The extension of Gill's theorem to the annular domain
is approached numerically by evaluating the growth rate of normal mode
perturbations and showing that its sign is negative, which means asymptotic
stability of the basic flow. A concurring argument supporting the absence of

impermeability condition at the vertical boundaries is relaxed and a partial
permeability is modelled through Robin boundary conditions for the pressure.
With partially permeable boundaries, an instability emerges which takes the

disease in over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the
infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial
step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high
enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a
valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the
patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan
test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This
paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to
perform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS
system, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation
(COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and
350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with
fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased
attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts,
opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is
very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an
average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification
test set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS
dataset. The COVID-CS dataset and code are available at

critical for both performance and consistency. Broadcast is handled by a gossip

current implementation of gossip in Fabric leads to heavy tail distributions of
block propagation latencies, impacting performance, consistency, and fairness.
We contribute a novel design for gossip in Fabric that simultaneously optimizes
propagation time, tail latency and bandwidth consumption. Using a 100-node
cluster, we show that our enhanced gossip allows the dissemination of blocks to
all peers more than 10 times faster than with the original implementation,

temperature evolution of the NBN frequency suggests that the steady flow
entails thermally activated processes, which are most likely due to skyrmion
creation and annihilation at the sample edges. This scenario is qualitatively
supported by our numerical simulations considering boundary effects, which
reveals that the edges limit the steady flow of skyrmions, especially at low
temperatures. We discuss a mechanism that dramatically slows the skyrmion

deep learning framework to estimate myocardial strain from short-axis cardiac
magnetic resonance tagged images. Methods and Materials: In this retrospective
cross-sectional study, 4508 cases from the UK Biobank were split randomly into
3244 training and 812 validation cases, and 452 test cases. Ground truth
myocardial landmarks were defined and tracked by manual initialization and
correction of deformable image registration using previously validated software
with five readers. The fully automatic framework consisted of 1) a
convolutional neural network (CNN) for localization, and 2) a combination of a
recurrent neural network (RNN) and a CNN to detect and track the myocardial
landmarks through the image sequence for each slice. Radial and circumferential
strain were then calculated from the motion of the landmarks and averaged on a
slice basis. Results: Within the test set, myocardial end-systolic
circumferential Green strain errors were -0.001 +/- 0.025, -0.001 +/- 0.021,
and 0.004 +/- 0.035 in basal, mid, and apical slices respectively (mean +/-
std. dev. of differences between predicted and manual strain). The framework
reproduced significant reductions in circumferential strain in diabetics,
hypertensives, and participants with previous heart attack. Typical processing
time was ~260 frames (~13 slices) per second on an NVIDIA Tesla K40 with 12GB
RAM, compared with 6-8 minutes per slice for the manual analysis. Conclusions:
The fully automated RNNCNN framework for analysis of myocardial strain enabled
unbiased strain evaluation in a high-throughput workflow, with similar ability
to distinguish impairment due to diabetes, hypertension, and previous heart
attack.

Differential Harnack Inequality tells us for each nonnegative $f:M\to
\mathbb{R}^+$, with $f_t$ its heat flow, that $\frac{\Delta
f_t}{f_t}-\frac{|\nabla f_t|^2}{f_t^2} +\frac{n}{2t}\geq 0.$ Our main result
will be to generalize this to path space $P_xM$ of the manifold.
  A key point is that instead of considering infinite dimensional gradients and
Laplacians on $P_xM$ we will consider a family of finite dimensional gradients
and Laplace operators. Namely, for each $H^1_0$-function
$\varphi:\mathbb{R}^+\to \mathbb{R}$ we will define the $\varphi$-gradient
$\nabla_\varphi F: P_xM\to T_xM$ and the $\varphi$-Laplacian $\Delta_\varphi F
=\text{tr}_\varphi\mathrm{Hess} F:P_xM\to \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathrm{Hess} F$
is the Markovian Hessian and both the gradient and the $\varphi$-trace are
induced by $n$ vector fields naturally associated to $\varphi$ under stochastic
parallel translation.
  Now let $(M^n,g)$ satisfy $\mathrm{Ric}=0$, then for each nonnegative
$F:P_xM\to \mathbb{R}^+$ we will show the inequality $$\frac{E_x
[\Delta_\varphi F]}{E_x [F]}-\frac{E_x [\nabla_\varphi F]^2}{E_x [F]^2}
+\frac{n}{2}|| \varphi ||^2\geq 0$$ for each $\varphi$, where $E_x$ denotes the
expectation with respect to the Wiener measure on $P_xM$. By applying this to
the simplest functions on path space, namely cylinder functions of one variable
$F(\gamma) \equiv f(\gamma(t))$, we will see we recover the classical Li-Yau
Harnack inequality exactly. We have similar estimates for Einstein manifolds,
with errors depending only on the Einstein constant, as well as for general
manifolds, with errors depending on the curvature. Finally, we derive
generalizations of Hamilton's Matrix Harnack inequality on path space $P_xM$.
It is our understanding that these estimates are new even on the path space of
$\mathbb{R}^n$.

units with parts of constraints were reported without presenting how they were
derived. In this paper, a sys-tematic approach is developed to formulate the
tight formulations. The idea is using more new variables in high dimension
space to capture all the states for single units within three periods, and
then, using these state variables systematic derive three-periods locally ideal
expressions for a subset of the constraints in UC. Meanwhile, the linear
dependence relations of those new state variables are leveraged to keep the
compactness of the obtained formulations. Based on this approach, we propose
two tighter models, namely 3P-HD and 3P-HD-Pr. The proposed models and other
four state-of-the-art models were tested on 51 instances, including 42
realistic instances and 9 8-unit-based instances, over a scheduling period of
24 h for systems ranging from 10 to 1080 generating units. The simulation
results show that our proposed MIQP UC formulations are the tightest and can be
solved most efficiently. After using piecewise technique to approxi-mate the
quadratic operational cost function, the six UC MIQP formulations can be
approximated by six corre-sponding mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
formulations. Our experiments show that the proposed 3P-HD and 3P-HD-Pr MILP
formulations also perform the best in terms of tightness and solution times.

reading the output of the calculation, but also to perform error correction.
Most proposed scalable silicon architectures utilize Pauli blockade of triplet
states for spin-to-charge conversion. In recent experiments, there have been
instances when instead of conventional triplet blockade readout, Pauli blockade
is sustained only between parallel spin configurations, with $|T_0\rangle$
relaxing quickly to the singlet state and leaving $|T_+\rangle$ and
$|T_-\rangle$ states blockaded -- which we call \textit{parity readout}. Both
types of blockade can be used for readout in quantum computing, but it is
crucial to maximize the fidelity and understand in which regime the system
operates. We devise and perform an experiment in which the crossover between
parity and singlet-triplet readout can be identified by investigating the
underlying physics of the $|T_0\rangle$ relaxation rate. This rate is tunable
over four orders of magnitude by controlling the Zeeman energy difference
between the dots induced by spin-orbit coupling, which in turn depends on the
direction of the applied magnetic field. We suggest a theoretical model
incorporating charge noise and relaxation effects that explains quantitatively
our results. Investigating the model both analytically and numerically, we
identify strategies to obtain on-demand either singlet-triplet or parity
readout consistently across large arrays of dots. We also discuss how parity
readout can be used to perform full two-qubit state tomography and its impact
on quantum error detection schemes in large-scale silicon quantum computers.

very rich variety of models is found once one allows for arbitrary

least some, sub-loci of the conformal manifolds preserving more symmetry than
the generic locus. Several examples of applications of the classification are

traceless antisymmetric representation. We discuss an IR dual of a conformal
$Spin(5)$ gauge theory with two chiral superfields in the vector representation

valuable tool. While there exists a number of hardware-based solutions, recent
deep learning-based approaches, coupled with the availability of large-scale
databases, have allowed to provide a precise gaze estimate using only consumer
sensors. However, there remains a number of questions, regarding the problem
formulation, architectural choices and learning paradigms for designing gaze
estimation systems in order to bridge the gap between geometry-based systems
involving specific hardware and approaches using consumer sensors only. In this
paper, we introduce a deep, end-to-end trainable ensemble of heatmap-based weak
predictors for 2D/3D gaze estimation. We show that, through heterogeneous
architectural design of these weak predictors, we can improve the decorrelation
between the latter predictors to design more robust deep ensemble models.
Furthermore, we propose a stochastic combinatory loss that consists in randomly
sampling combinations of weak predictors at train time. This allows to train
better individual weak predictors, with lower correlation between them. This,
in turns, allows to significantly enhance the performance of the deep ensemble.
We show that our Deep heterogeneous ensemble with Stochastic Combinatory loss
(DeeSCo) outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for 2D/3D gaze estimation on

currents during its sinking journey. This lateral transport can be far from
negligible for small sinking velocities. To estimate its magnitude and
direction, the material is often modelled as a set of Lagrangian particles
advected by current velocities that are obtained from Ocean General Circulation
Models (OGCMs). State-of-the-art OGCMs are strongly eddying, similar to the
real ocean, providing results with a spatial resolution on the order of 10 km
on a daily frequency. While the importance of eddies in OGCMs is
well-appreciated in the physical oceanographic community, other marine research
communities may not. To demonstrate how much the absence of mesoscale features
in low-resolution models influences the Lagrangian particle transport, we
simulate the transport of sinking Lagrangian particles using low- and
high-resolution global OGCMs, and assess the lateral transport differences
resulting from the difference in spatial and temporal model resolution. We find
major differences between the transport in the non-eddying OGCM and in the
eddying OGCM. Addition of stochastic noise to the particle trajectories in the
non-eddying OGCM parameterises the effect of eddies well in some cases. The
effect of a coarser temporal resolution (5-daily) is smaller compared to a
coarser spatial resolution (0.1$^{\circ}$ versus 1$^{\circ}$ horizontally). We
recommend to use sinking Lagrangian particles, representing e.g. marine snow,
microplankton or sinking plastic, only with velocity fields from eddying OGCMs,
requiring high-resolution models in e.g. paleoceanographic studies. To increase
the accessibility of our particle trace simulations, we launch

to intense X-ray beams in the cavity are subjects to thermal deformations that
shift and distort the Bragg reflection. Therefore, the stability of the XFELO
operation relies on the abilities of mirrors to preserve the Bragg reflection
under such heat load. A new approach was used to analyze the heat load of
mirrors and the XFELO operation. The essential light-matter interaction is
simulated by the GEANT4 with a dedicated Bragg-reflection physical process to
obtain the precise absorption information of the XFELO pulse in the crystals.
The transient thermal conduction is analyzed by the finite-element analysis

black hole physics, both at a quantum level and from an observational point of
view.
  On the one hand, regarding their fundamental constitutive characteristics, we
have followed ideas proposing a bridge between black holes physics and quantum
information. In this approach, these objects can be understood as Bose-Einstein
condensates of weakly interacting gravitons. We have studied the existence of
such solutions considered as bound systems of many constituents, providing well
established metrics (Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\""om). It should be
noted that all solutions found can be interpreted as mean field wave functions
of the condensate and are strongly related to the classical structure of the
metric that supports them.
  On the other hand, it is well known that the acceleration of very massive
bodies produces wave-like disturbances in spacetime itself. We focus on the
low-frequency range which is expected to be measured by arrays of pulsars
employed as galactic clocks (Pulsar Timing Arrays). When waves passes, the very
stable ticks are disturbed. However the existence of a dynamical background,
mainly composed by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, may affect the
gravitational wave propagation and would modify the expected signal over the
PTA. We have studied the influence of different backgrounds composed by
relativistic and non-relativistic matter, together with the cosmological
constant. We present a detailed characterization of this effect which at first
order depends only on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (at higher orders different
contributions can be disentangled). We also discuss how and where this effect
can be found. We hope that our results contribute to a definitive detection by
PTA. Needless to say, an independent local determination of $H_0$ would be of
enormous interest.

compare the tunnelling of the Universe from the classically forbidden region to
the allowed one, showing that considering a time evolution deeply influences
the nature of the model. In fact, we show that in the presence of the
Lagrangian fluid, the cosmological singularity is restored both in the
classical and the quantum regime. However, in the quantum regime the
singularity is probabilistically suppressed for some energy eigenvalues and in
the case the latter is equal to zero, one recovers the standard WDW case.
Finally, we introduce a cut-off physics feature in the Minisuperspace by
considering a Polymer quantum mechanical approach, mainly limiting our
attention to the semi-classical dynamics (the quantum treatment is inhibited by
the non-local nature of the Hamiltonian operator). We show that the singularity

emerges so that the present model could mimic a cyclic cosmology.

Particle-hole symmetries then arise for gapful or gapless free-fermion systems
at half filling, as the concatenation of particle-hole conjugation with one or
another involution that reverses the sign of the first-quantized Hamiltonian.
We illustrate that construction principle with a series of examples including
the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev-Majorana chain. For an enhanced
perspective, we contrast particle-hole symmetries with the charge-conjugation
symmetry of relativistic Dirac fermions. We go on to present two major
applications in the realm of interacting electrons. For one, we argue that the
celebrated Haldane phase of antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains is
adiabatically connected to a free-fermion topological phase protected by a
particle-hole symmetry. For another, we review the recent proposal by Son for a

unit elements from which no element can be removed from the assembly without
disassembly of the entire system. Consequently, such tile assemblies are able
to carry transverse mechanical loads. Archimedean and Laves tilings are
investigated as templates for the material system architecture. It is
demonstrated under point loads that the architecture significantly affects the
force-deflection response. Stiffness, load carrying capacity and toughness
varied by a factor of at least three from the system with the poorest
performance to the system with the best performance. Across all architectures
stiffness, strength and toughness are found to be strongly and linearly
correlated. Architecture characterizing parameters and their relationship to
the mechanical behavior are investigated. It is shown that the measure of the
smallest tile area in an assembly provides the best predictor of mechanical
behavior. With small tiles present in the assembly the contact force network
structure is well developed and the internal load path is channeled through
these stiffest components of the assembly.

images is still challenging. Even the state-of-the-art convolutional neural

accurately locate the ships in diverse orientations, some recent methods
conduct the detection via the rotated bounding box. However, it further
increases the difficulty of detection, because an additional variable of ship
orientation must be accurately predicted in the algorithm. In this paper, a
novel CNN-based ship detection method is proposed, by overcoming some common
deficiencies of current CNN-based methods in ship detection. Specifically, to
generate rotated region proposals, current methods have to predefine
multi-oriented anchors, and predict all unknown variables together in one
regression process, limiting the quality of overall prediction. By contrast, we
are able to predict the orientation and other variables independently, and yet
more effectively, with a novel dual-branch regression network, based on the
observation that the ship targets are nearly rotation-invariant in remote
sensing images. Next, a shape-adaptive pooling method is proposed, to overcome
the limitation of typical regular ROI-pooling in extracting the features of the
ships with various aspect ratios. Furthermore, we propose to incorporate
multilevel features via the spatially-variant adaptive pooling. This novel
approach, called multilevel adaptive pooling, leads to a compact feature
representation more qualified for the simultaneous ship classification and
localization. Finally, detailed ablation study performed on the proposed
approaches is provided, along with some useful insights. Experimental results
demonstrate the great superiority of the proposed method in ship detection.

parameters setting does impact energy consumption, so proper configuration is

standard operational modes map into real current consumption patterns of NB-IoT
devices. Further, we investigate which device reported metadata metrics better
reflect performance and implement an algorithm to automatically identify device
state in current time series logs. Then, we provide a measurement-driven
analysis of the energy consumption and network performance of two popular
NB-IoT boards under different parameter configurations and with two major
western European operators. We observed that energy consumption is mostly
affected by the paging interval in Connected state, set by the base station.
However, not all operators correctly implement such settings. Furthermore,
under the default configuration, energy consumption in not strongly affected by

synchronous rotation by tidal forces. In this particular configuration, the
planet exhibits permanent dayside and nightside, which may induce strong
day-night temperature gradients. The nightside temperature depends on the
efficiency of the day-night heat redistribution and determines the stability of
the atmosphere against collapse. To better constrain the atmospheric stability,
climate, and surface conditions of rocky planets located in the habitable zone
of their host star, it is thus crucial to understand the complex mechanism of
heat redistribution. Building on early works and assuming dry thermodynamics,
we developed a hierarchy of analytic models taking into account the coupling
between radiative transfer, dayside convection, and large-scale atmospheric
circulation in the case of slowly rotating planets. There are two types of
these models: a zero-dimensional two-layer approach and a two-column
radiative-convective-subsiding-upwelling (RCSU) model. They yield analytical
solutions and scaling laws characterising the dependence of the collapse
pressure on physical features, which are compared to the results obtained by
early works using 3D global climate models (GCMs). The analytical theory
captures (i) the dependence of temperatures on atmospheric opacities and
scattering in the shortwave and in the longwave, (ii) the behaviour of the
collapse pressure observed in GCM simulations at low stellar fluxes that are
due to the non-linear dependence of the atmospheric opacity on the longwave
optical depth at the planet's surface, (iii) the increase of stability

devices is a challenging problem which has attracted rapidly increasing
interests from both quantum and classical computing communities. This paper
proposes an efficient method by (i) selecting an initial mapping that takes
into consideration the similarity between the architecture graph of the given
NISQ device and a graph induced by the input logical circuit; and (ii)
searching, in a filtered and depth-limited way, a most useful SWAP combination
that makes executable as many as possible two-qubit gates in the logical
circuit. The proposed circuit transformation algorithm can significantly
decrease the number of auxiliary two-qubit gates required to be added to the
logical circuit, especially when it has a large number of two-qubit gates. For
an extensive benchmark set of 131 circuits and IBM's current premium Q system,
viz., IBM Q Tokyo, our algorithm needs, in average, 0.4346 extra two-qubit
gates per input two-qubit gate, while the corresponding figures for three
state-of-the-art algorithms are 0.6047, 0.8154, and 1.0067 respectively.

  Compact Genetic Algorithm","4 figures. Extended version of a paper appearing at GECCO 2020",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the key difficulties in using estimation-of-distribution algorithms is
choosing the population size(s) appropriately: Too small values lead to genetic
drift, which can cause enormous difficulties. In the regime with no genetic
drift, however, often the runtime is roughly proportional to the population
size, which renders large population sizes inefficient.
  Based on a recent quantitative analysis which population sizes lead to
genetic drift, we propose a parameter-less version of the compact genetic
algorithm that automatically finds a suitable population size without spending
too much time in situations unfavorable due to genetic drift.
  We prove a mathematical runtime guarantee for this algorithm and conduct an
extensive experimental analysis on four classic benchmark problems both without
and with additive centered Gaussian posterior noise. The former shows that
under a natural assumption, our algorithm has a performance very similar to the
one obtainable from the best problem-specific population size. The latter
confirms that missing the right population size in the original cGA can be
detrimental and that previous theory-based suggestions for the population size
can be far away from the right values; it also shows that our algorithm as well
as a previously proposed parameter-less variant of the cGA based on parallel
runs avoid such pitfalls. Comparing the two parameter-less approaches, ours
profits from its ability to abort runs which are likely to be stuck in a
genetic drift situation.

characteristics for impinging droplets on heated bi-phobic surfaces
(superhydrophobic matrix with hydrophobic spots). A non-patterned
superhydrophobic and a sticky hydrophobic surface acted as control wettability
surfaces. As expected, differences in wetting and heat transfer dynamics were
noticeable for all surfaces, with the most pronounced variation during the
receding phase. During spreading, inertia from the impact dominated the droplet
dynamics and heat transfer was dominated by convection at the contact line and
internal flow. As contact line velocities decreased over time, evaporative
cooling at the contact line gained importance, especially for the bi-phobic
surfaces, where liquid remained trapped on the hydrophobic spots during
receding. These satellite droplets increased the contact area and contact line
length, and assisted heat transfer and substrate cooling after lift-off of the
main droplet. Compared with the hydrophobic surface, the contribution of the
contact line heat transfer increased by 17 to 27% on the bi-phobic surfaces,
depending on the location of impact relative to the hydrophobic spots.
Nonetheless, the bi-phobic surfaces had a lower total thermal energy transfer.
However, compared with the plain superhydrophobic surface, heat transfer was
enhanced by 33% to 46% by patterning the surface. Depending on the application,
a trade-off exists between the different surfaces: the sticky hydrophobic
surface provides the best cooling efficiency, yet is prone to flooding, whereas
the superhydrophobic surface repels the liquid, but has poor cooling
efficiency. The bi-phobic surfaces provide a middle path with reasonable
cooling effectiveness and low flooding probability.

optimizes grid operations to maximize the amount of power that can be

  overlap with arXiv:1811.03492",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses a major flaw of the cycle consistency loss when used to
preserve the input appearance in the face-to-face synthesis domain. In
particular, we show that the images generated by a network trained using this
loss conceal a noise that hinders their use for further tasks. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a ''recurrent cycle consistency loss"" which for
different sequences of target attributes minimises the distance between the
output images, independent of any intermediate step. We empirically validate
not only that our loss enables the re-use of generated images, but that it also
improves their quality. In addition, we propose the very first network that
covers the task of unconstrained landmark-guided face-to-face synthesis.
Contrary to previous works, our proposed approach enables the transfer of a
particular set of input features to a large span of poses and expressions,
whereby the target landmarks become the ground-truth points. We then evaluate
the consistency of our proposed approach to synthesise faces at the target
landmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a loss to
overcome the limitation of the cycle consistency loss, and the first to propose
an ''in-the-wild'' landmark guided synthesis approach. Code and models for this

order Markov chains, turn out to be an essential tool to modelize random
sequences in many domains, as well as an interesting object in contemporary
probability theory. The question of the existence of stationary probability
measures leads us to introduce a key combinatorial structure for words produced
by a VLMC: the Longest Internal Suffix. This notion allows us to state a
necessary and sufficient condition for a general VLMC to admit a unique
invariant probability measure. This condition turns out to get a much simpler
form for a subclass of VLMC: the stable VLMC. This natural subclass, unlike the
general case, enjoys a renewal property. Namely, a stable VLMC induces a
semi-Markov chain on an at most countable state space. Unfortunately, this
discrete time renewal process does not contain the whole information of the
VLMC, preventing the study of a stable VLMC to be reduced to the study of its
induced semi-Markov chain. For a subclass of stable VLMC, the convergence in
distribution of a VLMC towards its stationary probability measure is
established. Finally, finite state space semi-Markov chains turn out to be very
special stable VLMC, shedding some new light on their limit distributions.

investigated for rigid spacecraft. First, a novel switching function is
constructed by a hyperbolic sine function. It is shown that the spacecraft
system possesses the unwinding-free performance when the system states are on
the sliding surface. Based on the designed switching function, a sliding mode
controller is developed to ensure the robustness of the attitude maneuver
control system. Another essential feature of the presented attitude control law
is that a dynamic parameter is introduced to guarantee the unwinding-free
performance when the system states are outside the sliding surface. The
simulation results demonstrate that the unwinding phenomenon is avoided during
the attitude maneuver of a rigid spacecraft by adopting the constructed
switching function and the proposed attitude control scheme.

without computational overhead. In the frequency domain, wave modeling is a
Helmholtz-type boundary-value problem which requires to solve a large and
sparse system of linear equations per frequency with multiple right-hand sides

the former are suitable for FWI application on 3D dense OBC acquisitions
covering spatial domains of moderate size, the later should be the approach of
choice for sparse node acquisitions covering large domains (more than 50
millions of unknowns). Fast convergence of iterative solvers for Helmholtz
problems remains however challenging in high frequency regime due to the non
definiteness of the Helmholtz operator, on one side and on the discretization
constraints in order to minimize the dispersion error for a given frequency, on
the other side, hence requiring efficient preconditioners. In this study, we
use the Krylov subspace GMRES iterative solver combined with a two-level
domain-decomposition preconditioner. Discretization relies on continuous
Lagrange finite elements of order 3 on unstructured tetrahedral meshes to
comply with complex geometries and adapt the size of the elements to the local

linear least-square problem, which can be done by finding the eigenvector
corresponding to the smallest, or zero, eigenvalue of a matrix representing a
linear system. Incorporating this in deep learning frameworks would allow us to
explicitly encode known notions of geometry, instead of having the network
implicitly learn them from data. However, performing eigendecomposition within
a network requires the ability to differentiate this operation. While
theoretically doable, this introduces numerical instability in the optimization
process in practice. In this paper, we introduce an eigendecomposition-free
approach to training a deep network whose loss depends on the eigenvector
corresponding to a zero eigenvalue of a matrix predicted by the network. We
demonstrate that our approach is much more robust than explicit differentiation
of the eigendecomposition using two general tasks, outlier rejection and
denoising, with several practical examples including wide-baseline stereo, the
perspective-n-point problem, and ellipse fitting. Empirically, our method has
better convergence properties and yields state-of-the-art results.

used, and in order to keep the ENO property and robustness, the constant 1 used

discontinuity, then the function approaches to a small value, otherwise, it
approaches to a large value. Analysis and numerical results show that the

knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners throughout
the life course, both students and professionals. It is increasingly important
that the knowledge of quantum technologies is accessible to those who work with

We introduce a specific puzzle visualization learning tool through which to
achieve these pedagogic ends with respect to quantum computation. Visualization
through puzzles can enable non-specialists to develop an intuitive, but still
rigorous, understanding of universal quantum computation and provide a facility
for non-specialists to discover increasingly complex and new quantum
algorithms. Using the Hong-Ou-Mandel optical effect from quantum mechanics, we
demonstrate how visual methods such as those made possible through the puzzle

constrained with a $\chi^{2}$ test from 57 data points of Hubble data set in
the redshift range $0.07<z<2.36$, to obtain the expressions of pressure,
density and EoS parameter for both the teleparallel gravity models and study
their temporal evolution. We find the deceleration parameter to experience a
signature flipping for the $\chi^{2}$ value of the free parameter at
$z_{tr}\simeq0.6$ which is consistent with latest Planck measurements. Next, we
present few geometric diagnostics of this parametrization to understand the
nature of dark energy and its deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Finally, we study the energy conditions to check the consistency of the
parameter spaces for both the teleparallel gravity models. We find the SEC to
violate for both the models which is an essential recipe to obtain an
accelerating universe.

potentiate recovery by engaging endogenous neuroplasticity. In preclinical
models of stroke, high doses of rehabilitation training are required to restore
functional movement to the affected limbs of animals. In humans, however, the
necessary dose of training to potentiate recovery is not known. This ignorance
stems from the lack of objective, pragmatic approaches for measuring training
doses in rehabilitation activities. Here, to develop a measurement approach, we
took the critical first step of automatically identifying functional
primitives, the basic building block of activities. Forty-eight individuals
with chronic stroke performed a variety of rehabilitation activities while
wearing inertial measurement units (IMUs) to capture upper body motion.
Primitives were identified by human labelers, who labeled and segmented the
associated IMU data. We performed automatic classification of these primitives
using machine learning. We designed a convolutional neural network model that
outperformed existing methods. The model includes an initial module to compute
separate embeddings of different physical quantities in the sensor data. In
addition, it replaces batch normalization (which performs normalization based
on statistics computed from the training data) with instance normalization
(which uses statistics computed from the test data). This increases robustness
to possible distributional shifts when applying the method to new patients.
With this approach, we attained an average classification accuracy of 70%.
Thus, using a combination of IMU-based motion capture and deep learning, we
were able to identify primitives automatically. This approach builds towards
objectively-measured rehabilitation training, enabling the identification and
counting of functional primitives that accrues to a training dose.

is called natural vector potential of the null electromagnetic field. An
attempt is made to make the most of knowing the general solution. The

out that the natural potential is a substantially complex vector, which is
equivalent to two real potentials. A modification of the coupling term in the

canonical ensemble of the state vectors subject to a constraint imposed on the
bulk loss function by a Lagrange multiplier (or an inverse temperature
parameter). We show that in an equilibrium the canonical partition function
must be a product of two factors: a function of the temperature and a function
of the bias vector and weight matrix. Consequently, the total Shannon entropy
consists of two terms which represent respectively a thermodynamic entropy and
a complexity of the neural network. We derive the first and second laws of
learning: during learning the total entropy must decrease until the system
reaches an equilibrium (i.e. the second law), and the increment in the loss
function must be proportional to the increment in the thermodynamic entropy
plus the increment in the complexity (i.e. the first law). We calculate the

what fundamental properties constitute data. In the first section of the paper,
we work from the fundamental properties necessary for statistical computation
to a definition of statistical data. We define a statistical datum as the
coming together of substantive and numerical properties and differentiate
between qualitative and quantitative data. Subsequently, we qualify our
definition by arguing that for data to be practically useful, it needs to be
commensurable in a manner that reveals meaningful differences that allow for
the generation of relevant insights through statistical methodologies. In the
second section, we focus on what our conception of data can contribute to the
discourse on data ethics and beyond. First, we hold that the need for useful
data to be commensurable rules out an understanding of properties as
fundamentally unique or equal. Second, we argue that practical concerns lead us
to increasingly standardize how we operationalize a substantive property; in
other words, how we formalize the relationship between the substantive and
numerical properties of data. Thereby, we also standardize the interpretation
of a property. With our increasing reliance on data and data technologies,
these two characteristics of data affect our collective conception of reality.
Statistical data's exclusion of the fundamentally unique and equal influences
our perspective on the world, and the standardization of substantive properties
can be viewed as profound ontological practice, entrenching ever more pervasive

challenging task. The consumption can be reduced by the ways the vessels are
operated, to achieve both improved cost efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions.
Mathematical models for predicting ships' consumption are in a central role in
both of these tasks. Nowadays, many ships are equipped with data collection
systems, which enable data-based calibration of the consumption models.
Typically this calibration procedure is carried out independently for each
particular ship, using only data collected from the ship in question. In this
paper, we demonstrate a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach, where we fit a
single model over many vessels, with the assumption that the parameters of
vessels of same type and similar characteristics (e.g. vessel size) are likely
close to each other. The benefits of such an approach are two-fold; 1) we can
borrow information about parameters that are not well informed by the
vessel-specific data using data from similar ships, and 2) we can use the final
hierarchical model to predict the behavior of a vessel from which we don't have
any data, based only on its characteristics. In this paper, we discuss the
basic concept and present a first simple version of the model. We apply the
Stan statistical modeling tool for the model fitting and use real data from 64
cruise ships collected via the widely used commercial Eniram platform. By using
Bayesian statistical methods we obtain uncertainties for the model predictions,
too. The prediction accuracy of the model is compared to an existing data-free

enhanced visible light absorption. In this work, we systematically investigate
the effect of different defects in the TiO$_{2-x}$ lattice on photocatalytic
H$_2$ evolution. To introduce different types of defects, thermal annealing in
air (oxidative), Ar (inert), Ar/H$_2$ (reducing), and H$_2$ (reducing)
atmospheres were performed on commercially available anatase nanopowder. Then,
the powders were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM)
to clarify the effect of treatment on material properties. Furthermore, the
defect types were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy. We show that thermal annealing in different atmospheres can form
different amounts of different defect types in the TiO$_2$ structure. The
highest photocatalytic activation is achieved by annealing the anatase powder
in a reducing atmosphere for an appropriate temperature/annealing time. By
combining the results from H$_2$ generation and EPR analysis we show that the
simultaneous presence of two types of defects, i.e. surface exposed Ti$_3^+$
and lattice embedded Ti$_3^+$ centers, in an optimum low concentration, is the
determining factor for an optimized photocatalytic H$_2$ evolution rate. In
fact, annealing anatase powder under the so-reported optimized conditions in

However,
it can utilize only the small labeled portion of data; it fails to leverage the
large amounts of unlabeled data that is often available in medical image
datasets. Supervised models are further handicapped by domain shifts, when the
labeled dataset, despite being large enough, fails to cover different protocols
or ethnicities. In this paper, we introduce \emph{extreme consistency}, which
overcomes the above limitations, by maximally leveraging unlabeled data from
the same or a different domain in a teacher-student semi-supervised paradigm.
Extreme consistency is the process of sending an extreme transformation of a
given image to the student network and then constraining its prediction to be
consistent with the teacher network's prediction for the untransformed image.
The extreme nature of our consistency loss distinguishes our method from
related works that yield suboptimal performance by exercising only mild
prediction consistency. Our method is 1) auto-didactic, as it requires no extra
expert annotations; 2) versatile, as it handles both domain shift and limited
annotation problems; 3) generic, as it is readily applicable to classification,
segmentation, and detection tasks; and 4) simple to implement, as it requires
no adversarial training. We evaluate our method for the tasks of lesion and
retinal vessel segmentation in skin and fundus images. Our experiments
demonstrate a significant performance gain over both modern supervised networks
and recent semi-supervised models. This performance is attributed to the strong
regularization enforced by extreme consistency, which enables the student
network to learn how to handle extreme variants of both labeled and unlabeled
images. This enhances the network's ability to tackle the inevitable same- and
cross-domain data variability during inference.

length required to reach the surface. In the present work, PEC water splitting
performance of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ prepared by anodization of thin iron layers
on an FTO glass and subsequent annealing in low O$_2$-Ar ambient with only
0.03% O$_2$ was investigated. The key finding is that annealing the anodic
nanostructures with low oxygen concentration provides a strongly enhanced PEC
performance compared with classic air annealing. The photocurrent of the former
at 1.5 V vs. RHE results in 1.1 mA/cm2, being 11 times higher than that of the

Sn doping, and introduction of oxygen vacancies, which contribute to the
enhancement of the hole flux from the photogenerated site to the reactive

  the Disentropy of the Autocorrelation","5 pages and 7 figures",,,,"physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The amount of randomness in a signal generated by physical or non-physical
process can reveal important information about that process. For example, the
presence of randomness in ECG signals may indicate a cardiac disease. On the
hand, the lack of randomness in a speech signal may indicate the speaker is a
machine. Hence, to quantify the amount of randomness in a signal is an
important task in many different areas. In this direction, the present work
proposes to use the disentropy of the autocorrelation function as a measure of
randomness. Examples using noisy and chaotic signals are shown.

TiO$_2$ nanotubes conformally coated with a nanocrystalline Nb$_2$O$_5$ layer
and find for these hierarchical structures an excellent supercapacitor
performance. Highly aligned conductive 1D electrodes were obtained by a three
step process: i) growth of self-organized nanotubes with defined and adjustable
intertube spacing, ii) conformal Nb$_2$O$_5$ decoration in the tube interspace
(while providing full electrolyte access to the entire active area), and iii)
high temperature nitridation. Key is the growth of a nanotube array with
regular tube-to-tube interspacing that enables an optimized decoration with
secondary materials such as Nb$_2$O$_5$. We observe an increase in electrode
capacitance from 158 $\mu$F cm-2 for bare TiO$_2$ NTs, to 1536 $\mu$F cm-2 for
TiO$_2$/Nb$_2$O$_5$ NTs, to finally 37 mF cm-2 for Nb$_2$O$_5$ decorated and
then nitrided nanotubes. This drastic increase can be ascribed firstly to the
defined spacing established between the tube arrays that then allows for a
conformal coating with a secondary active coating. Secondly, nitridation causes
a drastic increase of the electron conductivity of the entire scaffold and thus
reduces resistive losses.

formed in a highly dense array by Au seeding of a Fe substrate by a thermal
oxidation technique. The NFs are conformally decorated with a thin FeOOH
cocatalyst layer. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements show that this
photoanode with the $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$/FeOOH NFs rooted on the Au/Fe
structure exhibits a significantly enhanced PEC water oxidation performance
compared to the plain $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ nanostructure on the Fe substrate.
The $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$/FeOOH NFs on Au/Fe photoanode yields a photocurrent
density of 3.1 mA cm-2 at 1.5 VRHE, and a remarkably low onset potential of
0.5-0.6 VRHE in 1 M KOH under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm-2) simulated sunlight
illumination. The enhancement in PEC performance can be attributed to a
synergistic effect of the FeOOH top decoration and Au under-layer. While FeOOH
facilitates hole transfer at the interface of electrode/electrolyte, the Au
layer provides a sink for the electron transport to the back contact: this
leads overall to a drastically improved charge-separation efficiency in the
single crystalline $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ NF photoanode.

which profoundly impact the water flow and solute transports in the soil.
Understanding these effects is vital for predicting biogeochemistry of the soil
and preventing environmental issues associated with groundwater pollution. The
HP1 model has been applied for numerical analysis of various water flow and
chemical transport problems in the soil. The objective of the paper was to
assess the effects of a soil layer and a subsurface drainage system on the
water flow and solute transport in a soil column experiment using the HP1
model. Results indicated that both the soil layer and the subsurface drainage
system had profound impacts on the geochemical processes in the soil. The soil
layer retarded the transport of solute in the soil and created a hotspot for
geochemical processes. On the other hand, the subsurface drainage system
drained out an excessive amount of water and solutes from the soil and
therefore decreased the solute concentration in deep soil.

with academic achievements but have also long terms consequences beyond the
academic time. It is widely admitted that between 5% to 10% of the world
population is subject to this kind of disabilities. For assessing such
disabilities in early childhood, children have to solve a battery of tests.
Human experts score these tests, and decide whether the children require
specific education strategy on the basis of their marks. The assessment can be
lengthy, costly and emotionally painful. In this paper, we investigate how
Artificial Intelligence can help in automating this assessment. Gathering a
dataset of handwritten text pictures and audio recordings, both from standard
children and from dyslexic and/or dysgraphic children, we apply machine
learning techniques for classification in order to analyze the differences
between dyslexic/dysgraphic and standard readers/writers and to build a model.
The model is trained on simple features obtained by analysing the pictures and
the audio files. Our preliminary implementation shows relatively high
performances on the dataset we have used. This suggests the possibility to
screen dyslexia and dysgraphia via non-invasive methods in an accurate way as
soon as enough data are available.

membranes were then decorated by sputtering different Pt amounts i) only at the
top, ii) only at the bottom or iii) at both top and bottom of the tube layers.
The Pt-decorated membranes are transferred either in tube top up or in tube top
down configuration onto FTO slides and investigated after crystallization as
photocatalysts for H$_2$ generation using either front or back-side light
irradiation. Double-side Pt-decoration of the tube membranes leads to higher
H$_2$ generation rates (independent of tube and light irradiation
configuration) compared to membranes decorated at only one side with similar
overall Pt amounts. The results suggest that this effect is not ascribed to the
overall amount of Pt cocatalyst as such but rather to its distribution at both
tube extremities. This leads to optimized light absorption and electron
diffusion/transfer dynamics: the central part of the membranes act as light
harvesting zone and electrons therein generated can diffuse towards the
Pt/TiO$_2$ active zones (tube extremities) where they can react with the
environment and generate H$_2$ gas.
