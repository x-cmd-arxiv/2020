detected outflows. We measure the mass and energetics of the outflows,
including material at low-velocities by correcting for cloud contributions. The
total momentum and kinetic energy injection rates of outflows is comparable to
the turbulent dissipation rate of the cloud. We also compare the outflow
position angles to the orientation of C$^{18}$O filaments. We find that the
full sample of outflows is consistent with being randomly oriented with respect
to the filaments. A subsample of the most reliable measurements shows a
moderately perpendicular outflow-filament alignment which may reflect accretion
of mass across filaments and onto the protostellar cores.

a suitable set of lattice velocities, and the correct assignment of the
associated weights. For high-order models, the solution of this problem
requires a non-trivial effort. The paper outlines the functioning of a publicly
available Python script which has been written to assist researchers in that
task. The speed of sound $c_s$ is considered as a parameter, which can, within
limits, be chosen at will. Under this premise, the Maxwell-Boltzmann constraint
equations are a system of linear equations to determine the weights, and hence
amenable to numerical solution by standard linear algebra library routines. By
suitable contractions, the tensor equations are mapped to a set of equivalent
scalar equations, which simplifies the treatment significantly. For a
user-supplied set of velocity shells, the software first checks if a solution
for the weights exists, and returns it if it also happens to be unique. In such
a case, the software also calculates the range of $c_s$ values that yield
positive weights. Standard models like D3Q19 with a well-defined special $c_s$
value then result as limiting cases where one of the weights vanishes. In case
of an infinite set of solutions, the user may find one particular solution by
supplying a $c_s$ value, and then minimizing one or several weights within the
framework of standard linear programming. Some examples illustrate the
feasibility and usefulness of the approach. A number of models that have been
discussed in the literature are nicely reproduced, while the software has also
been able to find some new models of even higher order.

and positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for nonlinear
hyperbolic problems. The entropy stability property and, optionally,
preservation of local bounds for the cell averages are enforced using flux
limiters based on entropy conditions and discrete maximum principles,
respectively. Entropy production by the (limited) gradients of the
piecewise-linear DG approximation is constrained using Rusanov-type entropy
viscosity, as proposed by Abgrall in the context of nodal finite element
approximations. We cast his algebraic entropy fix into a form suitable for
arbitrary polynomial bases and, in particular, for modal DG approaches. The
Taylor basis representation of the entropy stabilization term reveals that it
penalizes the solution gradients in a manner similar to slope limiting and
requires semi-implicit treatment to achieve the desired effect. The implicit
Taylor basis version of the Rusanov entropy fix preserves the sparsity pattern
of the element mass matrix. Hence, no linear systems need to be solved if the
Taylor basis is orthogonal and an explicit treatment of the remaining terms is
adopted. The optional application of a vertex-based slope limiter constrains
the piecewise-linear DG solution to be bounded by local maxima and minima of
the cell averages. The combination of entropy stabilization with flux and slope
limiting leads to constrained approximations that possess all desired
properties. Numerical studies of the new limiting techniques and entropy
correction procedures are performed for two scalar two-dimensional test
problems with nonlinear and nonconvex flux functions.

replicator equations. Here we generalize that approach to any vector field that
can be written in the form $X(u)=(\B\eta)(u),$ where $\B=\B(u)$ is a matrix and
$\eta=\eta(u)$ is a vector. For a linear system we show that, if the
representing matrix of the system has at least one pair of positive-negative
non-zero eigenvalues, or a zero eigenvalue with at least one 3-dimensional
Jordan block associated to it, then the linear system has a Hamiltonian
description with respect to a big-isotropic structure. As a byproduct, we find
a class of linear systems with zero eigenvalue that are Hamiltonian with
respect to a big-isotropic structure but not a Dirac structure. Moreover, we
prove that every linear Hamiltonian system, having a big-isotropic structure as
underlying geometry, is completely integrable in the sense of Zung [12]. For
linear systems, in the both Hamiltonian formulation and complete integrability

circumvent the well-known linear control limitation -- the waterbed effect. The
ideal behaviour of such a filter in the frequency domain is unity gain while
providing a phase lead for a broad range of frequencies, which clearly violates
the linear Bode's gain phase relationship. However, CgLp's ideal behaviour is
based on a describing function, which is a first order approximation that
neglects the effects of higher order harmonics in the output of the filter.
Consequently, achieving the ideal behaviour is challenging when higher order
harmonics are relatively large. It is shown in this paper that by resetting
only one of the two states of a second order CgLp, the nonlinear filter will
act as a linear one at a certain frequency, provided that some conditions are
met. This phenomenon can be used to the benefit of reducing higher order
harmonics of CgLp's output and achieving the ideal behaviour and thus better
performance in terms of precision.

problematic for theories of consciousness. We formally describe the standard

to some physical system, such as the brain, testing requires comparing a
theory's predicted experience (given some internal observables of the system
like brain imaging data) with an inferred experience (using report or

falsified. We show that if inference and prediction are independent, it follows
that any minimally informative theory of consciousness is automatically
falsified. This is deeply problematic since the field's reliance on report or
behavior to infer conscious experiences implies such independence, so this
fragility affects many contemporary theories of consciousness. Furthermore, we
show that if inference and prediction are strictly dependent, it follows that a
theory is unfalsifiable. This affects theories which claim consciousness to be
determined by report or behavior. Finally, we explore possible ways out of this

body of high-energy experimental data and dedicated global fits. However,
calculating the partonic observables such as parton distribution function
(PDFs) from the fundamental theory of strong interactions, QCD, has made
limited progress. Recently, the authors have advocated a formalism,
large-momentum effective theory (LaMET), through which one can extract parton
physics from the properties of the proton travelling at a moderate
boost-factor, e.g., $\gamma\sim (2-5)$. The key observation behind this
approach is that Lorentz symmetry allows the standard formalism of partons in
terms of light-front operators to be replaced by an equivalent one with
large-momentum states and time-independent operators of a universality class.
With LaMET, the PDFs, generalized PDFs or GPDs, transverse-momentum-dependent
PDFs, and light-front wave functions can all be extracted in principle from
lattice simulations of QCD (or other non-perturbative methods) through standard
effective field theory matching and running. Future lattice QCD calculations
with exa-scale computational facilities can help to understand the experimental
data related to the hadronic structure, including those from the upcoming

key challenge in this task is that one training video might only contain a few
annotated starting/ending frames that can be used as positive examples for
model training. Most conventional approaches directly train a binary classifier
using such imbalance data, thus achieving inferior results. The key idea of
this paper is to use the distances between the frame within the ground truth
and the starting (ending) frame as dense supervisions to improve the video
grounding accuracy. Specifically, we design a novel dense regression network
(DRN) to regress the distances from each frame to the starting (ending) frame
of the video segment described by the query. We also propose a simple but
effective IoU regression head module to explicitly consider the localization
quality of the grounding results (i.e., the IoU between the predicted location
and the ground truth). Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts on three datasets (i.e.,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions, and TACoS).

This paper studies the unsupervised setting of re-ID, which does not require
any labeled information and thus is freely deployed to new scenarios. There are
very few studies under this setting, and one of the best approach till now used
iterative clustering and classification, so that unlabeled images are clustered
into pseudo classes for a classifier to get trained, and the updated features
are used for clustering and so on. This approach suffers two problems, namely,
the difficulty of determining the number of clusters, and the hard quantization
loss in clustering. In this paper, we follow the iterative training mechanism
but discard clustering, since it incurs loss from hard quantization, yet its
only product, image-level similarity, can be easily replaced by pairwise
computation and a softened classification task. With these improvements, our
approach becomes more elegant and is more robust to hyper-parameter changes.

Previous works often capture the visual tempo through sampling raw videos at

generic Temporal Pyramid Network (TPN) at the feature-level, which can be
flexibly integrated into 2D or 3D backbone networks in a plug-and-play manner.
Two essential components of TPN, the source of features and the fusion of

action instances at various tempos. TPN also shows consistent improvements over
other challenging baselines on several action recognition datasets.
Specifically, when equipped with TPN, the 3D ResNet-50 with dense sampling
obtains a 2% gain on the validation set of Kinetics-400. A further analysis
also reveals that TPN gains most of its improvements on action classes that
have large variances in their visual tempos, validating the effectiveness of
TPN.

invariant is called the loop linking number in the present paper. We refine the
result of Cadegan-Schlieper by proving that the loop linking number is an
invariant of the homeomorphism type of the arrangement complement.
  We give two effective methods to compute this invariant, both are based on
the braid monodromy. As an application, we detect an arithmetic Zariski pair of
arrangements with 11 lines whose coefficients are in the 5th cyclotomic field.
Furthermore, we also prove that the fundamental groups of their complements are
not isomorphic; it is the Zariski pair with the fewest number of lines which
have this property. We also detect an arithmetic Zariski triple with 12 lines
whose complements have non-isomorphic fundamental groups. In the appendix, we
give 28 similar arithmetic Zariski pairs detected using the loop linking

  To conclude this paper, we give a multiplicativity theorem for the union of

mathematical approach for predicting the spatial spread and temporal evolution
of the onset and recession of flood waters in urban road networks. A network of
urban roads resilient to flooding events is essential for provision of public
services and for emergency response. The spread of floodwaters in urban
networks is a complex spatial-temporal phenomenon. This study presents a
mathematical contagion model to describe the spatial-temporal spread and
recession process of flood waters in urban road networks. The evolution of
floods within networks can be captured based on three macroscopic
characteristics-flood propagation rate ($\beta$), flood incubation rate
($\alpha$), and recovery rate ($\mu$)-in a system of ordinary differential
equations analogous to the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model.
We integrated the flood contagion model with the network percolation process in
which the probability of flooding of a road segment depends on the degree to
which the nearby road segments are flooded. The application of the proposed
model was verified using high-resolution historical data of road flooding in
Harris County during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The results show that the model
can monitor and predict the fraction of flooded roads over time. Additionally,
the proposed model can achieve $90\%$ precision and recall for the spatial
spread of the flooded roads at the majority of tested time intervals. The
findings suggest that the proposed mathematical contagion model offers great
potential to support emergency managers, public officials, citizens, first
responders, and other decision makers for flood forecast in road networks.

assigns type labels to entity mentions irrespective of the context. In order to
alleviate the noisy labels, existing approaches on FGNET analyze the entity
mentions entirely independent of each other and assign type labels solely based
on mention sentence-specific context. This is inadequate for highly overlapping
and noisy type labels as it hinders information passing across sentence
boundaries. For this, we propose an edge-weighted attentive graph convolution
network that refines the noisy mention representations by attending over
corpus-level contextual clues prior to the end classification. Experimental

entities without using alias tables and 2) generate more contextual
representations for both mentions and entities. Recently, a solution has been
proposed for the former as a dual-encoder entity retrieval system (Gillick et
al., 2019) that learns mention and entity representations in the same space,
and performs linking by selecting the nearest entity to the mention in this
space. In this work, we use this retrieval system solely for generating
candidate entities. We then rerank the entities by using a cross-attention
encoder over the target mention and each of the candidate entities. Whereas a
dual encoder approach forces all information to be contained in the small,
fixed set of vector dimensions used to represent mentions and entities, a
crossattention model allows for the use of detailed information (read:
features) from the entirety of each <mention, context, candidate entity> tuple.
We experiment with features used in the reranker including different ways of
incorporating document-level context. We achieve state-of-the-art results on

electrons which can be observed through their synchrotron and inverse Compton
emission. The transition between synchrotron-dominated and
inverse-Compton-dominated emissions takes place at $\approx 10^9$ eV. Aims: The
short-term (weeks to months) flux variability of the synchrotron emission from
the most energetic electrons is investigated with data from ten years of
observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the energy range from
60 MeV to 600 MeV. Methods: The off-pulse light-curve has been reconstructed
from phase-resolved data. The corresponding histogram of flux measurements is
used to identify distributions of flux-states and the statistical significance
of a lower-flux component is estimated with dedicated simulations of mock
light-curves. The energy spectra for different flux states are reconstructed.
Results: We confirm the presence of flaring-states which follow a log-normal
flux distribution. Additionally, we discover a low-flux state where the flux
drops to as low as 18.4% of the intermediate-state average flux and stays there
for several weeks. The transition time is observed to be as short as 2 days.
The energy spectrum during the low-flux state resembles the extrapolation of
the inverse-Compton spectrum measured at energies beyond several GeV energy,
implying that the high-energy part of the synchrotron emission is dramatically
depressed. Conclusions: The low-flux state found here and the transition time
of at most 10 days indicate that the bulk ($>75$%) of the synchrotron emission
above $10^8$ eV originates in a compact volume with apparent angular size of
$\theta\approx0.4"" t_\mathrm{var}/(5 \mathrm{d})$. We tentatively infer that
the so-called inner knot feature is the origin of the bulk of the $\gamma$-ray
emission.

between the laser-induced reduction of the magnetoelastic coupling and the

change. Based on the analysis and modeling of the excited precession we find
signatures of laser-induced precessional switching, which occurs when the
magnetic field is applied along the hard magnetization axis and its value is
close to the effective magnetoelastic anisotropy field. The precession
excitation process in an individual magnetoelastic domain is found to be
unaffected by neighboring domains. This makes laser-induced changes of
magnetoelastic anisotropy a promising tool for driving magnetization dynamics

developments in many areas of physics, including the study of gravity. Case in
point, such techniques have recently been used to show that binary black holes
can amplify incident, low-frequency radiation due to an interplay between
absorption at the horizons and momentum transfer in the bulk of the spacetime.
In this paper, we further examine the consequences of this superradiant
mechanism on the dynamics of an ambient scalar field by taking the binary's
long-range gravitational potential into account at the nonperturbative level.
Doing so allows us to capture the formation of scalar clouds that are
gravitationally bound to the binary. If the scalar is light enough, the cloud
can be sufficiently diffuse (i.e., dilute while having considerable spatial
extent) that it engulfs the binary as a whole. Its subsequent evolution
exhibits an immensely rich phenomenology, which includes exponential growth,
beating patterns, and the upscattering of bound states into scalar waves. While
we find that these effects have negligible influence on the binary's inspiral
in the regime wherein our approximations are valid, they offer new, analytic
insight into how binary black holes interact with external perturbations. They
may also provide useful, qualitative intuition for interpreting the results
from future numerical simulations of these complex systems.

point clouds, which makes our system more widely applicable. Experiments on the

epidemic started on February 25. We calibrate the model with the number of dead
individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of
values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31)
approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3
initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of
lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7
million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period
providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection
period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the
reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is
0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed.
However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If
approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times
more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax
these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the
incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period
(13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times
more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination
of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the

stability of peakon trains solutions, i.e. multi-peakon solutions such that
their initial configuration is increasingly ordered. Furthermore, we give an
improvement of the orbital stability of a single peakon so that we can drop the
non-negativity hypothesis on the momentum density. The same result also holds
for the orbital stability for peakon trains, i.e. in this latter case we can
also avoid assuming non-negativity of the initial momentum density. Finally, as
a corollary of these results together with some asymptotic formulas for the
position and momenta vectors for multi-peakon solutions, we obtain the orbital

growth of planetary cores, depend on the sizes of solids residing in the disk.
In particular, these processes were found to be sensitive to size distribution
of solids, and efficient planetesimal formation and growth through these

erosion, a process that efficiently grinds down boulders into a mono-sized
distribution of pebbles, provides a natural upper limit for the maximal pebble
sizes (in terms of their Stokes number). We find the dependence of this upper
limit on the radial separation, disk age, turbulence strength, and the
grain-size composition of the boulders in the disk. SI is favorable in areas
with a Stokes number less than 0.1, which is found in the inner
sub-astronomical-unit regions of the disk. This upper limit shapes the size
distribution of small pebbles and thereby catalyzes the early onset of
planetesimal formation due to SI, and the later core accretion growth through
pebble accretion.

Furthermore, we also show exotic electronic transmittance behavior near such

unconventional scaling behavior in transmittance. Considering both analytic

energetic domination by protons. Furthermore, if the jets were dominated by the
kinetic energy of cold protons, it would be difficult to efficiently accelerate
leptons in the jets' terminal shocks. Assuming that the relative energy
contents of leptons, protons and magnetic fields are preserved across the
shocks, the above implies that the large-scale jets should also be
energetically dominated by leptons: $P_{\rm e,j} \gtrsim P_{\rm p,j}$. On the
other hand, previous studies of small-scale jets in blazars and radio cores
suggest a pair content (number of electrons and positrons per proton) of the
order of $n_{\rm e}/n_{\rm p} \sim 20$. Assuming further that the particle
composition of jets does not evolve beyond the blazar scales, we show that this
implies an average random Lorentz factor of leptons in large-scale jets of
$\bar\gamma_{\rm e,j} \gtrsim 70(1+\chi_{\rm p})(20n_{\rm p}/n_{\rm e})$, and
that the protons should be mildly relativistic with $\chi_{\rm p} \equiv

pressure of protons, $\epsilon_{\rm p}$ the internal energy density of protons,

massive stars, is a key element in galaxy formation theory. The energy budget
of SN feedback, as well as the duration over which SNe occur, are constrained
by stellar lifetime models and the minimum mass star that ends its life as a
SN. Simplifying approximations for this SN rate are ubiquitous in simulation
studies. We show here how the choice of SN budget and timings ($t_0$ for the
delay between star formation and the first SN, $\tau_{\rm SN}$ for the duration
of SN injection, and the minimum SN progenitor mass) drive changes in the
regulation of star formation and outflow launching. Extremely long delays for
instantaneous injection of SN energy $(t_0 << 20\;\rm{Myr})$ reduces star
formation and drive stronger outflows compared smaller delays. This effect is
primarily driven by enhanced clustering of young stars. With continuous
injection of energy, longer SN durations results in a larger fraction of SN
energy deposited in low ambient gas densities, where cooling losses are lower.
This is effect is particularly when driven by the choice of the minimum SN
progenitor mass, which also sets the total SN energy budget. These underlying
uncertainties mean that despite advances in the sub-grid modeling of SN
feedback, serious difficulties in constraining the strength of SN feedback
remain. We recommend future simulations use realistic SN injection durations,
and bound their results using SN energy budgets and durations for minimum SN
progenitors of $7M_\odot$ and $9M_\odot$.

by constraining the circumstellar medium (CSM). Models of the SN ejecta
colliding with CSM are necessary to infer the structure of the CSM and tie it
back to a progenitor model. Recent SNe I revealed CSM concentrated at a
distance $r\sim10^16$ cm, for which models of SN interaction are extremely
limited. In this paper, we assume the concentrated region is a ""wall""
representing swept-up material, and unswept material lies outside the wall. We
simulate one-dimensional hydrodynamics of SNe Ia & Ib impacting 300 unique CSM
configurations using RT1D, which captures the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We
find that the density ratio between the wall and ejecta -- denoted $A_0$ or
""wall height"" -- is key, and higher walls deviate more from self-similar
evolution. Functional fits accounting for $A_0$ are presented for the forward
shock radius evolution. We show that higher walls have more degeneracy between
CSM properties in the deceleration parameter, slower shocks, deeper-probing
reverse shocks, slower shocked ejecta, less ejecta mass than CSM in the shock,
and more mixing of ejecta into the CSM at early times. We analyze observations
of SN 2014C (Type Ib) and suggest that it had a moderately high wall ($10 < A_0
< 200$) and wind-like outer CSM. We also postulate an alternate interpretation
for the radio data of SN 2014C, that the radio rise occurs in the wind rather
than the wall. Finally, we find that hydrodynamic measurements at very late

that although the spontaneously polarized Ising Chern magnet is a natural
ground state for repulsive Coulomb interactions, it can be in reasonable
energetic competition with correlated states which can be viewed as Laughlin
states of excitons when short distance corrections to the interaction are
included. This is because charge neutral excitons in these bands behave
effectively as charged particles in ordinary Landau levels. In particular, the
Ising Chern magnet is no longer the ground state once the strength of a short
range intra-valley repulsion is about $30\%$ larger than the inter-valley
repulsion. Remarkably, these excitonic Laughlin states feature valley number
fractionalization but no charge fractionalization and a quantized charge Hall
conductivity identical to the Ising magnet, $\sigma_{xy}= \pm e^2/h$, and thus
cannot be distinguished from it by ordinary charge transport measurements. The

entropy while introducing the open-loop operator whose expectation value
effectively captures the phase transition. Further, we extend the analysis to
an open quantum setup by defining effective collapse operators, the dynamics of
which cool the system to different topologically ordered steady states. We show
that the phase transition between such steady states is effectively captured by
the expectation value of the open-loop operator.

energetic output of galaxies. Studying the impact of different stellar
populations on the dust heating remains hard because it requires decoupling the
relative geometry of stars and dust, and involves complex processes as
scattering and non-local dust heating. We aim to constrain the relative
distribution of dust and stellar populations in the spiral galaxy M81 and
create a realistic model of the radiation field that describes the
observations. Investigating the dust-starlight interaction on local scales, we
want to quantify the contribution of young and old stellar populations to the
dust heating. We aim to standardise the setup and model selection of such
inverse radiative transfer simulations so this can be used for comparable
modelling of other nearby galaxies. We present a semi-automated radiative
transfer modelling pipeline that implements the necessary steps such as the
geometric model construction and the normalisation of the components through an
optimisation routine. We use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT to
calculate a self-consistent, panchromatic model of the interstellar radiation

quantify to what extent different stellar age populations contribute to the
dust heating. Our method takes into account the effects of non-local heating.
We obtain a realistic 3D radiative transfer model of the face-on galaxy M81. We
find that only 50.2\% of the dust heating can be attributed to young stellar
populations. We confirm a tight correlation between the specific star formation
rate and the heating fraction by young stellar populations, both in sky

  barred galaxies",,,"10.1051/0004-6361/201936176",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Dust in late-type galaxies in the local Universe is responsible for
absorbing approximately one third of the energy emitted by stars. It is often
assumed that dust heating is mainly attributable to the absorption of UV and
optical photons emitted by the youngest (<= 100 Myr) stars. Consequently,
thermal re-emission by dust at FIR wavelengths is often linked to the
star-formation activity of a galaxy. However, several studies argue that the
contribution to dust heating by much older stars might be more significant.
Advances in radiation transfer (RT) simulations finally allow us to actually
quantify the heating mechanisms of diffuse dust by the stellar radiation field.
  Aims: As one of the main goals in the DustPedia project, we have constructed
detailed 3D stellar and dust RT models for nearby galaxies. We analyse the
contribution of the different stellar populations to the dust heating in four
face-on barred galaxies: NGC1365, M83, M95, and M100. We aim to quantify the
fraction directly related to young stars, both globally and on local scales,
and to assess the influence of the bar on the heating fraction.
  Results: We derive global attenuation laws for each galaxy and confirm that
galaxies of high sSFR have shallower attenuation curves and weaker UV bumps. On
average, 36.5% of the bolometric luminosity is absorbed by dust. We report a
clear effect of the bar structure on the radial profiles of the dust-heating
fraction by the young stars, and the dust temperature. We find that the young
stars are the main contributors to the dust heating, donating, on average ~59%
of their luminosity to this purpose throughout the galaxy. This dust-heating
fraction drops to ~53% in the bar region and ~38% in the bulge region where the
old stars are the dominant contributors to the dust heating. We also find a
strong link between the heating fraction by the young stars and the sSFR.

CFTs based on a gate set built out of conformal symmetry transformations.
Previously, it was shown that by choosing a suitable cost function, the
resulting complexity functional is equivalent to geometric (group) actions on
coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group, up to a term that originates from the
central extension. We show that this term can be recovered by modifying the
cost function, making the equivalence exact. Moreover, we generalize our
approach to Kac-Moody symmetry groups, finding again an exact equivalence
between complexity functionals and geometric actions. We then determine the
optimal circuits for these complexity measures and calculate the corresponding
costs for several examples of optimal transformations. In the Virasoro case, we
find that for all choices of reference state except for the vacuum state, the
complexity only measures the cost associated to phase changes, while assigning
zero cost to the non-phase changing part of the transformation. For Kac-Moody
groups in contrast, there do exist non-trivial optimal transformations beyond
phase changes that contribute to the complexity, yielding a finite gauge
invariant result. Furthermore, we also show that the alternative complexity
proposal of path integral optimization is equivalent to the Virasoro proposal
studied here. Finally, we sketch a new proposal for a complexity definition for
the Virasoro group that measures the cost associated to non-trivial
transformations beyond phase changes. This proposal is based on a cost function
given by a metric on the Lie group of conformal transformations. The
minimization of the corresponding complexity functional is achieved using the
Euler-Arnold method yielding the Korteweg-de Vries equation as equation of

the intercalated materials. The optimal substitution level for the intercalated

Earth-like exoplanets with 0.2 weight percent (wt%) water (i.e., no exposed
continents) a reduced flux of bioessential phosphorus limits the export of
photosynthetically produced atmospheric O2 to levels indistinguishable from
geophysical production by photolysis of water plus hydrogen escape. Higher
water contents >1wt% that lead to high-pressure ice mantles further slow
phosphorus cycling. Paradoxically, the maximum water content allowing use of O2
as a biosignature, 0.2wt%, is consistent with no water based on mass and
radius. Thus, the utility of an O2 biosignature likely requires the direct
detection of both water and land on a planet.

The gold standard in causal inference is performing randomized controlled

cost constraints. As an alternative, methodologies for causal inference from
observational data have been developed in statistical studies and social
sciences. However, existing methods critically rely on restrictive assumptions
such as the study population consisting of homogeneous elements that can be
represented in a single flat table, where each row is referred to as a unit. In
contrast, in many real-world settings, the study domain naturally consists of
heterogeneous elements with complex relational structure, where the data is
naturally represented in multiple related tables. In this paper, we present a
formal framework for causal inference from such relational data. We propose a
declarative language called CaRL for capturing causal background knowledge and
assumptions and specifying causal queries using simple Datalog-like rules.CaRL
provides a foundation for inferring causality and reasoning about the effect of
complex interventions in relational domains. We present an extensive
experimental evaluation on real relational data to illustrate the applicability

making them ideal for VLA. However, experimental results have been limited
until now because injecting electrons into the laser field has remained a
considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that using a plasma
mirror as an injector solves this problem and permits to inject electrons at
the ideal phase of the laser, resulting in the acceleration of electrons along
the laser propagation direction while reducing the electron beam divergence
compared to the linear polarization case. We obtain electron bunches with
few-MeV energies and a 200 pC charge, thus demonstrating for the first time
electron acceleration to relativistic energies using a radially polarized
laser. High-harmonic generation from the plasma surface is also measured and
provides additional insight into the injection of electrons into the laser
field upon its reflection on the plasma mirror. Detailed comparisons between
experimental results and full 3D simulations unravel the complex physics of
electron injection and acceleration in this new regime: we find that electrons
are injected into the radially polarized pulse in the form of two
spatially-separated bunches emitted from the p-polarized regions of the focus.
Finally, we leverage on the insight brought by this study to propose and

Franzese and Stanley (FS) that accounts for the many-body interactions of
water. We review mean-field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations on water
monolayers for a wide range of pressures and temperatures, including extreme
conditions. The results show the presence of two dynamic crossovers and explain
the origin of diffusion anomalies. Moreover, the model shows that all the
different scenarios, proposed in the last decades as alternative explanations
of the experimental anomalies of water, can be related by the fine-tuning of
the many-body (cooperative) interaction. Once this parameter is set from the
experiments, the FS model predicts a phase transition between two liquids with
different densities and energies in the supercooled water region, ending in a
liquid-liquid critical point. From this critical point stems a liquid-liquid
Widom line, i.e., the locus of maxima of the water correlation length, that in
the FS model can be directly calculated. The results are consistent with the
extrapolations from experiments. Furthermore, they agree with those from
atomistic models but make predictions over a much wider thermodynamic region,
allowing for a better interpretation of the available experimental data. All
these findings provide a coherent picture of the properties of water and

description of the dynamics of an $n$-dimensional oscillator beyond the

algorithms, to obtain a parameterization of the attracting invariant manifold

several advantages. It provides analytically a Fourier-Taylor expansion of the
parameterization up to any order, as well as a simplification of the dynamics
that allows for a numerical globalization of the manifolds. Thus, one can
obtain the local and global isochrons and isostables, including the slow
attracting manifold, up to high accuracy, which offer a geometrical portrait of
the oscillatory dynamics. Furthermore, it provides straightforwardly the
infinitesimal Phase and Amplitude Response Functions, that is, the extended
infinitesimal Phase and Amplitude Response Curves, which monitor the phase and
amplitude shifts beyond the asymptotic state. Thus, the methodology presented
yields an accurate description of the phase dynamics for perturbations not
restricted to the limit cycle but to its attracting invariant manifold.

including the reduction of the dynamics to the slow stable submanifold. We

LQ control performance. By limiting the subject to these methods, we are able
to identify principles underlying coding for control; a subject of significant
recent interest but few tangible results. In particular, we consider coding the
quantized output signal deploying period-two codes of differing
delay-versus-accuracy tradeoff. The quantification of coding performance is via
the LQ control cost. The feedback control system comprises the coder-decoder in
the path between the output and the state estimator, which is followed by
linear state-variable feedback, as is optimal in the memoryless case. The
quantizer is treated as the functional composition of an infinitely-long linear
staircase function and a saturation. This permits the analysis to subdivide
into estimator computations, seemingly independent of the control performance
criterion, and an escape time evaluation, which ties the control back into the
choice of quantizer saturation bound. An example is studied which illustrates
the role of the control objective in determining the efficacy of coding using
these schemes. The results mesh well with those observed in signal coding.
However, the introduction of a realization-based escape time is a novelty

\simeq 0.3$, namely at (or near) the critical doping $p^\star$ where the
pseudogap phase is expected to end ($p^\star\simeq 0.2$). Secondly, the high
$\gamma$ value implies that the Fermi surface must consist of more than the
single electron-like pocket detected by quantum oscillations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4

yields only $\gamma = 4.0$ mJ/K$^2$mol. This missing mass imposes a revision of
the current scenario for how pseudogap and charge order respectively transform
and reconstruct the Fermi surface of cuprates.

maximum entropy; this prior assumes minimal information about the per-device

data in neural machine translation (NMT), and iteratively conducting
back-translation can further improve the model performance. Selecting which
monolingual data to back-translate is crucial, as we require that the resulting
synthetic data are of high quality and reflect the target domain. To achieve
these two goals, data selection and weighting strategies have been proposed,
with a common practice being to select samples close to the target domain but
also dissimilar to the average general-domain text. In this paper, we provide
insights into this commonly used approach and generalize it to a dynamic
curriculum learning strategy, which is applied to iterative back-translation
models. In addition, we propose weighting strategies based on both the current
quality of the sentence and its improvement over the previous iteration. We
evaluate our models on domain adaptation, low-resource, and high-resource MT
settings and on two language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our
methods achieve improvements of up to 1.8 BLEU points over competitive
baselines.

address the novel problem of image manipulation from scene graphs, in which a

direct supervision for constellation changes or image edits. This makes it
possible to train the system from existing real-world datasets with no

interactions[9,10] and topological insulators [11-14]. These families of
materials can all be well-described using models with noninteracting-electron
bandstructures. Here, we show that electronic interactions within a strongly
correlated heavy fermion material, the Kondo lattice system YbAl$_{3}$, can
provide a large enhancement in spin-orbit torque. The spin-torque conductivity
increases by approximately a factor of 4 as a function of decreasing
temperature from room temperature to the coherence temperature of YbAl$_{3}$
($T^* \approx 37$ K), with a saturation at lower temperatures, achieving a
maximum value greater than any heavy metal element. This temperature dependence
mimics the increase and saturation at $T^*$ of the density of states at the
Fermi level arising from the ytterbium 4$f$-derived heavy bands in the Kondo
regime, as measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy[15]. We
therefore identify the many-body Kondo resonance as the source of the large
enhancement of spin-orbit torque in YbAl$_{3}$. Our observation reveals new
opportunities in spin-orbit torque manipulation of magnetic memories by
engineering quantum many-body states.

develop highly tangled and complex topologies---the solar photosphere being the

diagnostic techniques with finite spatio-temporal resolution due to
cancellations of Zeeman polarization signals. Observations of resonance
scattering polarization have been considered to overcome these problems. But up
to now, observations of scattering polarization lack the necessary combination
of high sensitivity and high spatial resolution in order to directly infer the
turbulent magnetic structure at the resolution limit of solar telescopes. Here,
we report the detection of clear spatial structuring of scattering polarization
in a magnetically quiet solar region at disk center in the Sr~{\sc i}
4607~\AA~spectral line on granular scales, confirming theoretical expectations.
We find that the linear polarization presents a strong spatial correlation with
the local quadrupole of the radiation field. The result indicates that
polarization survives the dynamic and turbulent magnetic environment of the
middle photosphere and is thereby usable for spatially resolved Hanle
observations. This is an important step toward the long-sought goal of directly
observing turbulent solar magnetic fields at the resolution limit and
investigating their spatial structure.

The depth maps output by the internal imaging sensor are used in an in-hand

tedious manual effort of optimizing scientific applications for a specific
target platform. Ideally, an autotuning approach is capable of reliably
identifying the most efficient implementation variant(s) for a new target
system or new characteristics of the input by applying suitable program
transformations and analytic models. In this work, we introduce Offsite, an
offline autotuning approach which automates this selection process at
installation time by rating implementation variants based on an analytic
performance model without requiring time-consuming runtime experiments. From
abstract multilevel YAML description languages, Offsite automatically derives
optimized, platform-specific and problem-specific code of possible
implementation variants and applies the performance model to these
implementation variants.
  We apply Offsite to parallel numerical methods for ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). In particular, we investigate tuning a specific class of
explicit ODE solvers (PIRK methods) for various initial value problems (IVPs)
on shared-memory systems. Our experiments demonstrate that Offsite is able to
reliably identify a set of the most efficient implementation variants for given
test configurations (ODE solver, IVP, platform) and is capable of effectively
handling important autotuning scenarios.

total calculated thermal conductivity of this phase is 220 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$

increasing EES. In the hexagonal close-packed iron the EES is also not
increased by thermal disorder and remains weak. Our main finding thus holds for
the both likely iron phases in the inner core.

especially when compute and storage resources of the hardware (viz. crossbar)
need to be shared among the neurons and synapses of the SNN. We propose an
approach to analyze and compile SNNs on a resource-constrained neuromorphic
hardware, providing guarantee on key performance metrics such as execution time
and throughput. Our approach makes the following three key contributions.
First, we propose a greedy technique to partition an SNN into clusters of
neurons and synapses such that each cluster can fit on to the resources of a
crossbar. Second, we exploit the rich semantics and expressiveness of
Synchronous Dataflow Graphs (SDFGs) to represent a clustered SNN and analyze
its performance using Max-Plus Algebra, considering the available compute and
storage capacities, buffer sizes, and communication bandwidth. Third, we
propose a self-timed execution-based fast technique to compile and admit
SNN-based applications to a neuromorphic hardware at run-time, adapting
dynamically to the available resources on the hardware. We evaluate our
approach with standard SNN-based applications and demonstrate a significant
performance improvement compared to current practices.

notably byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016; Gage, 1994), the
WordPiece method (Schuster and Nakajima, 2012), and unigram language modeling

literature does not contain a direct evaluation of the impact of tokenization
on language model pretraining. We analyze differences between BPE and unigram
LM tokenization, finding that the latter method recovers subword units that
align more closely with morphology and avoids problems stemming from BPE's
greedy construction procedure. We then compare the fine-tuned task performance
of identical transformer masked language models pretrained with these
tokenizations. Across downstream tasks and two languages (English and
Japanese), we find that the unigram LM tokenization method matches or
outperforms BPE. We hope that developers of future pretrained LMs will consider
adopting the unigram LM method over the more prevalent BPE.

the crystallographic evolution of up to 30 gold and copper nanoparticles during

robust solutions, such as H-infinity or tube model predictive control, that
plan control actions feasible for the worst-case disturbance. Yet, planning for
every contingency can lead to over-conservative, poorly performing solutions or
even, in extreme cases, to infeasibility. Resilience addresses these
shortcomings by adapting the underlying control problem, e.g., by relaxing its
specifications, to obtain a feasible, possibly still valuable trajectory.
Despite their different aspects, robustness and resilience are often conflated
in the context of dynamical systems and control. The goal of this paper is to
formalize, in the context of optimal control, the concept of resilience
understood as above, i.e., in terms of adaptation. To do so, we introduce a
resilient formulation of optimal control by allowing disruption-dependent
modifications of the requirements that induce the desired resilient behavior.
We then propose a framework to design these behaviors automatically by trading
off control performance and requirement violations. We analyze this
resilience-by-compromise method to obtain inverse optimality results and
quantify the effect of disturbances on the induced requirement relaxations. By
proving that robustness and resilience optimize different objectives, we show
that these are in fact distinct system properties. We conclude by illustrating
the effect of resilience in different control problems.

change events in the system trigger adaptation rules. We first present a scheme
to incrementally check model queries in the form of temporal logic formulas

provide users the items that users are potentially interested in. However, due
to the openness of the online platform, recommendation systems are vulnerable
to data poisoning attacks. Existing attack approaches are either based on
simple heuristic rules or designed against specific recommendations approaches.
The former often suffers unsatisfactory performance, while the latter requires
strong knowledge of the target system. In this paper, we focus on a general
next-item recommendation setting and propose a practical poisoning attack
approach named LOKI against blackbox recommendation systems. The proposed LOKI
utilizes the reinforcement learning algorithm to train the attack agent, which
can be used to generate user behavior samples for data poisoning. In real-world
recommendation systems, the cost of retraining recommendation models is high,
and the interaction frequency between users and a recommendation system is
restricted.Given these real-world restrictions, we propose to let the agent
interact with a recommender simulator instead of the target recommendation
system and leverage the transferability of the generated adversarial samples to
poison the target system. We also propose to use the influence function to
efficiently estimate the influence of injected samples on the recommendation
results, without re-training the models within the simulator. Extensive
experiments on two datasets against four representative recommendation models
show that the proposed LOKI achieves better attacking performance than existing
methods.

The approach is suitable for enhancement of the optical signatures produced by
the optical Hall effect in semi-transparent conductive layer structures with
plane parallel interfaces. The physical principle is the constructive
interference of electric field components that undergo multiple optical Hall
effect induced polarization rotations upon multiple light passages through the
conductive layer stack. Tuning one of the cavity parameters, such as the
external cavity thickness, permits shifting of the frequencies of the
constructive interference, and enhancement of the optical signatures produced
by the optical Hall effect can be obtained over large spectral regions. A
cavity-tuning optical stage and gas flow cell are used as examples of
instruments that exploit tuning an external cavity to enhance polarization
changes in a reflected terahertz beam. Permanent magnets are used to provide
the necessary external magnetic field. Conveniently, the highly reflective
surface of a permanent magnet can be used to create the tunable external
cavity. The signal enhancement allows the extraction of the free charge carrier
properties of thin films, and can eliminate the need for expensive
super-conducting magnets. Furthermore, the thickness of the external cavity
establishes an additional independent measurement condition, similar to, for
example, the magnetic field strength, terahertz frequency, and angle of

Laplacian matrix, while the screening function for external charges is the
inverse of the screened laplacian. We particularize the treatment to square and
pyrochlore ice. For square ice we highlight the gauge-free duality between
direct and perpendicular structure in terms of symmetry between charges and
currents, typical of magnetic fragmentation in a two-dimensional setting. We
derive structure factors, correlations, correlation lengths, and
susceptibilities for spins, topological charges, and currents. We show that the
divergence of the correlation length at low temperature is exponential and
inversely proportional to the mean square charge. While in three dimension real
and entropic interactions among monopoles are both 3D-Coulomb, in two dimension
the former is a 3D-Coulomb and the latter 2D-Coulomb, or logarithmic, leading
to weak singularities in correspondence of the pinch points and destroying

CoCo encodes the combinatorial part of the optimal solution into a strategy.
Using data collected from offline problem solutions, we train a multiclass

  in the Wild","2020 Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision",,,,"cs.CV cs.HC cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unconstrained remote gaze estimation remains challenging mostly due to its
vulnerability to the large variability in head-pose. Prior solutions struggle
to maintain reliable accuracy in unconstrained remote gaze tracking. Among
them, appearance-based solutions demonstrate tremendous potential in improving
gaze accuracy. However, existing works still suffer from head movement and are
not robust enough to handle real-world scenarios. Especially most of them study
gaze estimation under controlled scenarios where the collected datasets often
cover limited ranges of both head-pose and gaze which introduces further bias.
In this paper, we propose novel end-to-end appearance-based gaze estimation
methods that could more robustly incorporate different levels of head-pose
representations into gaze estimation. Our method could generalize to real-world
scenarios with low image quality, different lightings and scenarios where
direct head-pose information is not available. To better demonstrate the
advantage of our methods, we further propose a new benchmark dataset with the
most rich distribution of head-gaze combination reflecting real-world
scenarios. Extensive evaluations on several public datasets and our own dataset
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a
significant margin.

instability and the actual onset of turbulent transport in magnetized plasma.
It is generally attributed to the suppression of turbulence by zonal flows, but
developing a more detailed understanding calls for consideration of specific
reduced models. The modified Terry--Horton system has been proposed by St-Onge
[J. Plasma Phys. $\boldsymbol{\rm 83}$, 905830504 (2017)] as a minimal model
capturing the Dimits shift. Here, we use this model to develop an analytic
theory of the Dimits shift and a related theory of the tertiary instability of
zonal flows. We show that tertiary modes are localized near extrema of the
zonal velocity $U(x)$, where $x$ is the radial coordinate. By approximating
$U(x)$ with a parabola, we derive the tertiary-instability growth rate using
two different methods and show that the tertiary instability is essentially the
primary drift-wave instability modified by the local $U''$. Then, depending on
$U''$, the tertiary instability can be suppressed or unleashed. The former
corresponds to the case when zonal flows are strong enough to suppress
turbulence (Dimits regime), while the latter corresponds to the case when zonal
flows are unstable and turbulence develops. This understanding is different
from the traditional paradigm that turbulence is controlled by the flow shear
$U'$. Our analytic predictions are in agreement with direct numerical
simulations of the modified Terry--Horton system.

Furthermore, we have developed an enhanced version of the method, WASGD+, by

However, when the mixture components have light tails such as a normal

spins-7/2 in EuMg2Bi2 exhibit an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at a

magnetic susceptibility chi data below TN in terms of molecular-field theory
(MFT), the AFM structure is inferred to be a c-axis helix, where the ordered
moments in the hexagonal ab-plane layers are aligned ferromagnetically in the
ab plane with a turn angle between the moments in adjacent moment planes along
the c axis of about 120 deg. The magnetic heat capacity exhibits a lambda
anomaly at TN with evidence of dynamic short-range magnetic fluctuations both
above and below TN. The high-T limit of the magnetic entropy is close to the
theoretical value for spins-7/2. The in-plane electrical resistivity rho(T)
data indicate metallic character with a mild and disorder-sensitive upturn
below Tmin = 23 K. An anomalous rapid drop in rho(T) on cooling below TN as
found in zero field is replaced by a two-step decrease in magnetic fields. The
rho(T) measurements also reveal an additional transition below TN in applied
fields of unknown origin that is not observed in the other measurements and may
be associated with an incommensurate to commensurate AFM transition. The
dependence of TN on the c-axis magnetic field Hperp was derived from the
field-dependent chi(T), Cp(T), and rho(T) measurements. This TN(Hperp) was
found to be consistent with the prediction of MFT for a c-axis helix with S =

staggering in time between the electric and magnetic fields and between
particle velocity and position and (3) errors in the time derivative in the

stories, but the language generation itself was restricted and inflexible.
Modern methods use language models for more robust generation, but often lack
an explicit representation of the scaffolding and dynamics that guide a
coherent narrative. This paper introduces a new model that integrates explicit
narrative structure with neural language models, formalizing narrative modeling
as a Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS). A SLDS is a dynamical system in
which the latent dynamics of the system (i.e. how the state vector transforms
over time) is controlled by top-level discrete switching variables. The
switching variables represent narrative structure (e.g., sentiment or discourse
states), while the latent state vector encodes information on the current state
of the narrative. This probabilistic formulation allows us to control
generation, and can be learned in a semi-supervised fashion using both labeled
and unlabeled data. Additionally, we derive a Gibbs sampler for our model that
can fill in arbitrary parts of the narrative, guided by the switching
variables. Our filled-in (English language) narratives outperform several
baselines on both automatic and human evaluations.

The numerical resolution of such nonlinear parabolic-parabolic or

significant computational time when solved with fully implicit schemes.
Standard linearized semi-implicit schemes, however, require reasonable
computational time, but suffer from lack of accuracy. In this work, two methods
based on a single-layer neural network are developed to build linearized
implicit schemes: a basic one called the each step training linearized implicit
(ESTLI) method and a more efficient one, the selected steps training linearized
implicit (SSTLI) method. The proposed schemes, which make use also of a spatial
finite volume method with a hybrid difference scheme approximation for
convection-diffusion fluxes, are first derived for a chemotaxis system arising
in embryology. The convergence of the numerical solutions to a corresponding
weak solution of the studied system is established. Then the proposed methods
are applied to a number of chemotaxis models, and several numerical tests are
performed to illustrate their accuracy, efficiency and robustness.
Generalization of the developed methods to other nonlinear partial differential
equations is straightforward.

then validated by all atom docking simulations. The validated ML models were
subsequently used to screen a large bio-molecule dataset (with nearly a million

distorted due to redshift-space distortions (RSD). While one dominant
contribution to RSD comes from the Doppler effect induced by the peculiar
velocity of galaxies, the relativistic effects, including the gravitational
redshift effect, are recently recognized to give small but important
contributions. Such contributions lead to an asymmetric galaxy clustering along
the line of sight, and produce non-vanishing odd multipoles when
cross-correlating between different biased objects. However, non-zero odd
multipoles are also generated by the Doppler effect beyond the distant-observer
approximation, known as the wide-angle effect, and at quasi-linear scales, the
interplay between wide-angle and relativistic effects becomes significant. In
this paper, based on the formalism developed by Taruya et al., we present a
quasi-linear model of the cross-correlation function taking a proper account of
both the wide-angle and gravitational redshift effects, as one of the major
relativistic effects. Our quasi-linear predictions of the dipole agree well
with simulations even at the scales below $20\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc, where
non-perturbative contributions from the halo potential play an important role,
flipping the sign of the dipole amplitude. When increasing the bias difference
and redshift, the scale where the sign flip happens is shifted to a larger
scale. We derive a simple approximate formula to quantitatively account for the
behaviors of the sign flip.

field (SOCPF) equation is presented. The theoretical results include the
following three aspects. First, three new derivation methods for the SOCPF
equation are given. The SOCPF equation can be viewed as the gradient flow, the
special diffusion equation and the diffuse interface form of a sharp interface
formulation for the piecewise constant function, respectively. These derivation
methods help us to understand the SOCPF equation at different perspectives.
Second, the conservation's properties of the solution of SOCPF equation are
studied. Compared with the Cahn-Hilliard equation and the Allen-Cahn equation,
it is found that the solution of SOCPF equation satisfies more conservation
laws. Third, the wetting boundary condition for the SOCPF equation is
investigated. We find that the no-flux boundary condition is equivalent to the
wetting boundary condition for two-component phase field model. Moreover,

quasars (FSRQs) and 575 BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects. On intra-day timescales,
the median amplitude of variability ($\sigma_{m}$) for FSRQs is
0.04$^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ mag and 0.05$^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ mag in W1 and W2 bands.
For BL Lacs we found median $\sigma_{m}$ in W1(W2) bands of
0.04$^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ (0.04$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$) mag. On long timescales, for
FSRQs we found a median $\sigma_{m}$ of 0.44$^{+0.28}_{-0.27}$ mag and
0.45$^{+0.27}_{-0.27}$ mag in W1 and W2 bands, while for BL Lacs the median

W2 bands. From statistical tests, we found FSRQs to show larger $\sigma_m$ than
BL Lacs on both intra-day and long timescales. Among blazars, low synchrotron
peaked (LSP) sources showed larger $\sigma_m$ compared to intermediate
synchrotron peaked (ISP) and high synchrotron peaked (HSP) sources.The larger
$\sigma_{m}$ seen in FSRQs relative to BL Lacs on both intra-day and long
timescales could be due to them having the most powerful relativistic jets
and/or their mid infrared band coinciding with the peak of the electron energy
distribution. BL Lacs have low power jets and the observational window too
traces the emission from low energy electrons, thereby leading to low
$\sigma_{m}$. In both FSRQs and BL Lacs predominantly a bluer when brighter
behaviour was observed. No correlation is found between $\sigma_m$ and black
hole mass.

speech from one emotion state into another one, keeping the basic linguistic
information and speaker identity. Previous approaches for emotional VC need
parallel data and use dynamic time warping (DTW) method to temporally align the
source-target speech parameters. These approaches often define a minimum
generation loss as the objective function, such as L1 or L2 loss, to learn
model parameters. Recently, cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks
(CycleGAN) have been used successfully for non-parallel VC. This paper
investigates the efficacy of using CycleGAN for emotional VC tasks. Rather than
attempting to learn a mapping between parallel training data using a
frame-to-frame minimum generation loss, the CycleGAN uses two discriminators
and one classifier to guide the learning process, where the discriminators aim
to differentiate between the natural and converted speech and the classifier
aims to classify the underlying emotion from the natural and converted speech.
The training process of the CycleGAN models randomly pairs source-target speech
parameters, without any temporal alignment operation. The objective and
subjective evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of using CycleGAN
models for emotional VC. The non-parallel training for a CycleGAN indicates its
potential for non-parallel emotional VC.

velocities ranging from 493 to 2140~km~s$^{-1}$. A detailed analysis of the
eruption kinematics yields the following main results. (1) The early evolution
of all events consists of a slow-rise phase followed by a main-acceleration
phase, the height-time profiles of which differ markedly and can be best fit,
respectively, by a linear and an exponential function. This indicates that
different physical processes dominate in these phases, which is at variance
with models that involve a single process. (2) The kinematic evolution of the
eruptions tends to be synchronized with the flare light curve in both phases.
The synchronization is often but not always close. A delayed onset of the
impulsive flare phase is found in the majority of the filament eruptions (5 out
of 6). This delay, and its trend to be larger for slower eruptions, favor ideal
MHD instability models. (3) The average decay index at the onset heights of the
main acceleration is close to the threshold of the torus instability for both
groups of events (although based on a tentative coronal field model for the hot
channels), suggesting that this instability initiates and possibly drives the
main acceleration.

recent years, with impressive applications highlighted in computer vision in
particular. Compared to such examples, however, there have been more limited
applications of GANs to time series modelling, including forecasting. In this
work, we present the Mixture Density Conditional Generative Adversarial Model
(MD-CGAN), with a focus on time series forecasting. We show that our model is
capable of estimating a probabilistic posterior distribution over forecasts and
that, in comparison to a set of benchmark methods, the MD-CGAN model performs
well, particularly in situations where noise is a significant component of the
observed time series. Further, by using a Gaussian mixture model as the output
distribution, MD-CGAN offers posterior predictions that are non-Gaussian.

crucial to many life-sustaining physiological processes. Recently, transition
metal ion such as Cu$^{2+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, Ni$^{2+}$, have been shown can increase
the solubilities of aromatic biomolecules. Comparing with Cu$^{2+}$, Zn$^{2+}$
shows less enhancement to the solubilities of biomolecules such as tryptophan
(Trp). On the other hand, Zn$^{2+}$ has a higher concentration in human blood
plasma and appears in protein the most among transition metal ions, clarifying
whether Zn$^{2+}$ can enhance the solubilities of other aromatic amino acids is
significantly important. Herein, we observed that the solubility of aromatic
amino acid histidine (His) is greatly enhanced in ZnCl$_2$ solution. Based on
first principle calculations, this enhancement of solubility is attributed to
cation-$\pi$ interaction between His and Zn$^{2+}$. Our results here are of
great importance for the bioavailability of aromatic drugs and provide new
insights for the understanding of physiological functions of Zn$^{2+}$.

of the heavy-ion community since they can help to elucidate the origin of
collective-like effects discovered in small collision systems at the LHC. In
this work, we report that in PYTHIA 8.244, the charged-particle production in
events with a large number of MPI (${\rm N}_{\rm mpi}$) normalized to that
obtained in minimum-bias pp collisions shows interesting features. After the
normalization to the corresponding $\langle {\rm N}_{\rm mpi} \rangle$, the
ratios as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ exhibit a bump at $p_{\rm T}\approx3$
GeV/$c$; and for higher $p_{\rm T}$ ($>8$ GeV/$c$), the ratios are independent
of ${\rm N}_{\rm mpi}$. While the size of the bump increases with increasing
${\rm N}_{\rm mpi}$, the behavior at high $p_{\rm T}$ is expected from the
""binary scaling"" (parton-parton interactions), which holds given the absence of
any parton-energy loss mechanism in PYTHIA. The bump at intermediate $p_{\rm
T}$ is reminiscent of the Cronin effect observed for the nuclear modification
factor in p--Pb collisions. In order to unveil these effects in data, we
propose a strategy to construct an event classifier sensitive to MPI using
Machine Learning-based regression. The study is conducted using TMVA, and the
regression is performed with Boosted Decision Trees (BDT). Event properties
like forward charged-particle multiplicity, transverse spherocity and the
average transverse momentum ($\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$) are used for
training. The kinematic cuts are defined in accordance with the ALICE detector
capabilities. In addition, we also report that if we apply the trained BDT on
existing (${\rm INEL}>0$) pp data, i.e. events with at least one primary
charged-particle within $|\eta|<1$, the average number of MPI in pp collisions

SIS breaking, as exemplified by the Rashba effect. In particular, by combining
this symmetry with magnetic fields or another type of time-reversal symmetry
(TRS) breaking, noncentrosymmetric materials can be made to exhibit
nonreciprocal responses, which are responses that differ for rightward and
leftward stimuli. For example, resistivity becomes directionally dependent;
that is to say, rectification appears in noncentrosymmetric materials in a
magnetic field. However, the effect of SIS breaking on thermal transport
remains to be elucidated. Here we show nonreciprocal thermal transport in the
multiferroic helimagnet TbMnO3. The longitudinal thermal conductivity depends
on whether the thermal current is parallel or antiparallel to the vector
product of the electric polarization and magnetization. This phenomenon is
thermal rectification that is controllable with external fields in a uniform

can make effective use of images with and without pose annotations.
Specifically, we formulate a hierarchical generative model of poses and images
by integrating a deep generative model of poses from pose features with that of
images from poses and image features. We then introduce a deep recognition
model that infers poses from images. Given images as observed data, these
models can be trained jointly in a hierarchical variational autoencoding
(image-to-pose-to-feature-to-pose-to-image) manner. The results of experiments
show that the proposed reflective architecture makes estimated poses
anatomically plausible, and the performance of pose estimation improved by
integrating the recognition and generative models and also by feeding

most previous work requires all seeds to be correct, we focus on the setting
where the seeds are partially correct. Specifically, consider two correlated
graphs whose edges are sampled independently from a parent \ER graph
$\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. A mapping between the vertices of the two graphs is
provided as seeds, of which an unknown $\beta$ fraction is correct. We first
analyze a simple algorithm that matches vertices based on the number of common
seeds in the $1$-hop neighborhoods, and then further propose a new algorithm
that uses seeds in the $2$-hop neighborhoods. We establish non-asymptotic
performance guarantees of perfect matching for both $1$-hop and $2$-hop
algorithms, showing that our new $2$-hop algorithm requires substantially fewer
correct seeds than the $1$-hop algorithm when graphs are sparse. Moreover, by
combining our new performance guarantees for the $1$-hop and $2$-hop

improve the previous results in

adding 46 new high resolution simulations of massive galaxies performed with
the inclusion of Black Hole feedback. We show that outflows generated by the
AGN are able to partially counteract the dark matter contraction due to the
large central stellar component in massive haloes. The net effect is to relax
the central dark matter distribution that moves to a less cuspy density
profiles at halo masses larger than $\approx 3 \times 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. The
scatter around the mean value of the density profile slope ($\alpha$) is fairly
constant ($\Delta\alpha \approx 0.3$), with the exception of galaxies with halo
masses around $10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, at the transition from stellar to AGN
feedback dominated systems, where the scatter increases by almost a factor
three. We provide useful fitting formulas for the slope of the dark matter
density profiles at few percent of the virial radius for the whole stellar mass
range: $10^5-10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ ($2 \times 10^9-5 \times 10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$
in halo mass).

encoding mechanism helps the self-attention networks to learn the source
representation with order dependency, which makes the Transformer-based NMT
achieve state-of-the-art results for various translation tasks. However,
Transformer-based NMT only adds representations of positions sequentially to
word vectors in the input sentence and does not explicitly consider reordering
information in this sentence. In this paper, we first empirically investigate
the relationship between source reordering information and translation
performance. The empirical findings show that the source input with the target
order learned from the bilingual parallel dataset can substantially improve
translation performance. Thus, we propose a novel reordering method to
explicitly model this reordering information for the Transformer-based NMT. The
empirical results on the WMT14 English-to-German, WAT ASPEC

problems in quadratically unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) into the

embedding heuristics have been developed for annealers of moderate size (about
2000 nodes) the size of the latest CMOS annealing processor (with 102,400
nodes) poses entirely new demands on the embedding heuristic. This raises the
question, if recent embedding heuristics can maintain meaningful embedding
performance on hardware graphs of increasing size. Here, we develop an improved
version of the probabilistic-swap-shift-annealing (PSSA) embedding heuristic
[which has recently been demonstrated to outperform the standard embedding
heuristic by D-Wave Systems (Cai et al., 2014)] and evaluate its embedding
performance on hardware graphs of increasing size. For random-cubic and
Barabasi-Albert graphs we find the embedding performance of improved PSSA to
consistently exceed the threshold of the best known complete graph embedding by
a factor of 3.2 and 2.8, respectively, up to hardware graphs with 102,400
nodes. On the other hand, for random graphs with constant edge density not even
improved PSSA can overcome the deterministic threshold guaranteed by the
existence of the best known complete graph embedding. Finally, we prove a new
upper bound on the maximal embeddable size of complete graphs into hardware
graphs of CMOS annealers and show that the embedding performance of its
currently best known complete graph embedding has optimal order for hardware
graphs with fixed coordination number.

the integral term does not affect the local properties of the kink, but it
governs the behaviour at the asymptotics. The kink behaviour at the center is
dominated by a sine-Gordon equation and its width tends to increase with the
power law exponent. When the interaction is the Coulomb repulsion, in
particular, the kink width depends logarithmically on the chain size. We define
an appropriate thermodynamic limit and compare our results with existing

disaster damage assessment. Recent methods use homogenous transformation, which
transforms the heterogeneous optical and SAR remote sensing images into the
same feature space, to achieve change detection. Such transformations mainly
operate on the low-level feature space and may corrupt the semantic content,
deteriorating the performance of change detection. To solve this problem, this
paper presents a new homogeneous transformation model termed deep homogeneous
feature fusion (DHFF) based on image style transfer (IST). Unlike the existing
methods, the DHFF method segregates the semantic content and the style features
in the heterogeneous images to perform homogeneous transformation. The
separation of the semantic content and the style in homogeneous transformation
prevents the corruption of image semantic content, especially in the regions of
change. In this way, the detection performance is improved with accurate
homogeneous transformation. Furthermore, we present a new iterative IST (IIST)
strategy, where the cost function in each IST iteration measures and thus
maximizes the feature homogeneity in additional new feature subspaces for
change detection. After that, change detection is accomplished accurately on
the original and the transformed images that are in the same feature space.
Real remote sensing images acquired by SAR and optical satellites are utilized
to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experiments demonstrate
that the proposed DHFF method achieves significant improvement for change
detection in heterogeneous optical and SAR remote sensing images, in terms of
both accuracy rate and Kappa index.

field theories with a $\theta$-term based on density of states (DoS) methods.
The key ingredient is to use open boundary conditions where the topological
charge is not quantized to integers and the density of states is sufficiently
well behaved such that it can be computed precisely with recently developed DoS
techniques. After a general discussion of the approach and the role of the
boundary conditions, we analyze the method for 2-d U(1) lattice gauge theory
with a $\theta$-term, a model that can be solved in closed form. We show that
in the continuum limit periodic and open boundary conditions describe the same
physics and derive the DoS, demonstrating that only for open boundary
conditions the density is sufficiently well behaved for a numerical evaluation.
We conclude our proof of principle analysis with a small test simulation where
we numerically compute the density and compare it with the analytical result.

strategies that exploit sophisticated detection algorithms are required.
Motivated by this, in this paper we introduce an active defense method based on
dynamic clustering. Our detection strategy uses a moving-target approach where
information about the system's varying operating point is first used to cluster
measurements according to their transfer function characteristics that change
over time. Then, detection is carried out through series of similarity checks
between measurements within the same cluster. The proposed method is effective
in detecting cyber-attacks even when the attacker has extensive knowledge of
the system parameters, model and detection policy at some point in time. The
effectiveness of our proposed detection algorithm is demonstrated through a
numerical example on the IEEE 24-bus power system.

Flexible Transmitter Network (FTNet), which is built on the most common
fully-connected feed-forward architecture taking the FT model as the basic

improved back-propagation algorithm in the complex-valued domain. Experiments

provide a foundation for the reconstruction of much more detailed molecular
structures, than possible with current methods. Conventional NMR theories are
based on the effective spin model which idealizes nuclei as fixed point
particles in a lattice $L$, while molecular vibrations, bond rotations and
proton exchange cause a delocalization of nuclei. Hence, a lot information on
molecular structures remain hidden in experimental NMR data, if the effective
spin model is used for the investigation.
  In this document it is shown how the quantum mechanical probability density
$\mid\Psi^\beta(X)\mid^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^{3n}$ for the continuous, spatial
distribution of $n$ nuclei can be reconstructed from NMR data. To this end, it
is shown how NMR spectra can be calculated directly from mQED at finite
temperatures without involving the effective description. The fundamental
problem of performing numerical calculations with the infinite-dimensional
radiation field is solved by using a purified representation of a KMS state on
a $W^*$-dynamical system. Furthermore, it is shown that the presented method
corrects wrong predictions of the effective spin model. It is outlined that the
presented method can be applied to any molecular system whose electronic ground
state can be calculated using a common quantum chemical method. Therefore, the

skewnesses are 0.37 and 0.49 and the kurtoses 2.79 and 2.94 for even and odd
cycles, respectively. The correlation coefficient between skewness and kurtosis
for even cycles is 0.69, and for odd cycles, it is 0.90. Conclusions. The
separate PCAs for even and odd sunspot cycles show that odd cycles are more
inhomogeneous than even cycles, especially in GSN data. Even cycles, however,
have two anomalous cycles: SC4 and SC6. According to the analysis of the
sunspot area size data, the GG is more distinct in even than odd cycles. We
also present another Waldmeier-type rule, that is, we find a correlation
between skewness and kurtosis of the sunspot group cycles.

cases, state-of-the-art image stitching methods easily produce image alignment
artifacts, since they may produce false pairwise image registrations that are
in conflict within the global connectivity graph. Our method augments the
current methods by collecting all the plausible pairwise image registration
candidates, among which globally consistent candidates are chosen. This enables
the stitching process to determine the correct pairwise registrations by
utilizing all the available information from the whole imagery, such as
unambiguous registrations outside the repeating pattern and featureless
regions. We formalize the method as a weighted multigraph whose nodes represent
the individual image transformations from the composite image, and whose sets
of multiple edges between two nodes represent all the plausible transformations
between the pixel coordinates of the two images. The edge weights represent the
plausibility of the transformations. The image transformations and the edge
weights are solved from a non-linear minimization problem with linear
constraints, for which a projection method is used. As an example, we apply the
method in a large-scale scanning application where the transformations are
primarily translations with only slight rotation and scaling component. Despite
these simplifications, the state-of-the-art methods do not produce adequate
results in such applications, since the image overlap is small, which can be
featureless or repetitive, and misalignment artifacts and their concealment are
unacceptable.

component has recently been physically realized (van Woerkom, {\it et al.},
Microwave photon-mediated interactions between semiconductor qubits, Physical
Review X, 8(4):041018, 2018). The feedback loop is closed by cascading this
main component with a beamsplitter. The dynamics of this coherent feedback
network is studied from three perspectives. First, an analytic form of the
output single-photon state of the network driven by a single-photon state is
derived; in particular, it is observed that coherent feedback elongates
considerably the interaction between the input single photon and the network.
Second, excitation probabilities of DQD qubits are computed when the network is
driven by a single-photon input state. Moreover, if the input is vacuum but one
of the two DQD qubits is initialized in its excited state, the explicit
expression of the state of the network is derived, in particular, it is shown
that the output field and the two DQD qubits can form an entangled state if the
transition frequencies of two DQD qubits are equal. Finally, the exact form of
the pulse shape is obtained by which the single-photon input can fully excite
one of these two DQD qubits at any controllable time, which may be useful in
the construction of $2$-qubit quantum gates.

simulations that systematically explores three plausible extensions: warm dark
matter, self-interacting dark matter, and a running of the scalar spectral
index of density fluctuations. Current observational constraints are used to
specify the additional parameters that come with these extensions. We examine a
large range of observable metrics on small scales, including the halo mass
function, density and circular velocity profiles, the abundance of satellite
subhaloes, and halo concentrations. For any given metric, significant
degeneracies can be present between the extensions. In detail, however, the
different extensions have quantitatively distinct mass and radial dependencies,
suggesting that a multi-probe approach over a range of scales can be used to
break the degeneracies. We also demonstrate that the relative effects on the
radial density profiles in the different extensions (compared to the standard
model) are converged down to significantly smaller radii than are the absolute
profiles. We compare the derived cosmological trends with the impact of
baryonic physics using the EAGLE and ARTEMIS simulations. Significant
degeneracies are also present between baryonic physics and cosmological
variations (with both having similar magnitude effects on some observables).
Given the inherent uncertainties both in the modelling of galaxy formation

of caching capabilities to full-duplex (FD) radios in the context of
ultra-dense networks (UDNs). More specifically, we aim at showing that the
interference footprint of such networks, i.e., the major bottleneck to overcome
to observe the theoretical FD throughput doubling at the network level, can be
significantly reduced thanks to edge caching. Fundamental results show that
most of the gain, as compared to their half-duplex (HD) counterparts, can be
achieved by such networks only if costly modifications to their infrastructure
are performed and/or if high-rate signaling is exchanged between user
equipments (UEs) over suitable control links. Therefore, we aim at proposing a
viable and cost-effective alternative to these solutions based on pre-fetching
locally popular contents at the network edge. We start by considering an
interference-rich scenario such as an ultra-dense FD small-cell network, in
which several non-cooperative FD base stations (BSs) serve their associated UEs
while communicating with a wireless backhaul node (BN) to retrieve the content
to deliver. We then describe a geographical caching policy aiming at capturing
local files popularity and compute the corresponding cache-hit probability.
Thereupon, we calculate the probability of successful transmission of a file
requested by a UE, either directly by its serving small-cell base station (SBS)
or by the corresponding BN: this quantity is then used to lower-bound the
throughput of the considered network. Our approach leverages tools from
stochastic geometry in order to guarantee both analytical tractability of the
problem and generality of the results. Our numerical simulations show that
shifting from cache-free to cache-aided FD small-cell networks yields a
remarkable performance improvement.

  model of a fast pandemic",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study an SEIQR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered)
model for an infectious disease, with time delays for latency and an
asymptomatic phase. For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and
everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two
nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One
parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The subcase of perfect quarantining
and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined
first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and
a long-wave approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation
(ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave
approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture
the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation.
Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state
non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical
solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter
choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show
how correctly executed time-varying social distancing, within the present
model, can cut the number of affected people by almost half. Alternatively,
faster detection followed by near-certain quarantining can potentially be even
more effective.

variables by matrices, and train our policy network using Monte-Carlo sampling.
We study the implications of parametric action space in a model-free

the quantitative and qualitative results on both remote sensing and non-remote

present a gradient-index lens antenna designed to radiate with a 45{\deg}

excitation of each feeding element. The proposed lens is fabricated by
multi-material 3D printing. The final lens radiates with a gain of 8.5 dBi when

concentrated on the unit ball? Interestingly, any optimally concentrated
divergence free vectorial functions, when represented in series in vector
spherical harmonics, shall be also concentrated in one of the three vectorial
spherical harmonics modes. Moreover, divergence free ball PSWFs are exactly the
vectorial eigenfunctions of the second order Sturm-Liouville differential
operator which defines the scalar ball PSWFs. Indeed, the divergence free
vectorial ball PSWFs possess a simple and close relation with the scalar ball
PSWFs such that they share the same merits. Simultaneously, it turns out that
the divergence free ball PSWFs solve another second order Sturm-Liouville eigen

clinically essential task, for quantitatively measuring cell-level features in
order to diagnose cervical cancer. This task, however, remains rather
challenging, mainly due to the deficiency of intensity (or color) information
in the overlapping region. Although shape prior-based models that compensate
intensity deficiency by introducing prior shape information (shape priors)
about cytoplasm are firmly established, they often yield visually implausible
results, mainly because they model shape priors only by limited shape
hypotheses about cytoplasm, exploit cytoplasm-level shape priors alone, and
impose no shape constraint on the resulting shape of the cytoplasm. In this
paper, we present a novel and effective shape prior-based approach, called
constrained multi-shape evolution, that segments all overlapping cytoplasms in
the clump simultaneously by jointly evolving each cytoplasm's shape guided by
the modeled shape priors. We model local shape priors (cytoplasm--level) by an
infinitely large shape hypothesis set which contains all possible shapes of the
cytoplasm. In the shape evolution, we compensate intensity deficiency for the
segmentation by introducing not only the modeled local shape priors but also
global shape priors (clump--level) modeled by considering mutual shape
constraints of cytoplasms in the clump. We also constrain the resulting shape
in each evolution to be in the built shape hypothesis set, for further reducing
implausible segmentation results. We evaluated the proposed method in two
typical cervical smear datasets, and the extensive experimental results show
that the proposed method is effective to segment overlapping cytoplasm,
consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on single

magnetization and magnetotransport measurements, both of which demonstrate that
the material is a topologically nontrivial semimetal. The INS spectra clearly
show a spin gap of $\sim6$ meV. The dispersion in the magnetic Mn layer extends
up to about 76 meV, while that between the layers has a narrow band width of 6
meV. We find that the linear spin-wave theory using a Heisenberg spin
Hamiltonian can reproduce the experimental spectra with the following
parameters: a nearest-neighbor ($SJ_1\sim28.0$ meV) and next-nearest-neighbor
in-plane exchange interaction ($SJ_2\sim9.3$ meV) , interlayer exchange

Sr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{1-y}$Sb$_2$, possibly because that the Weyl fermions and magnons
reside in the Sb and Mn layers separately, and the interlayer coupling is weak
due to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the material, as also evident from

demonstrate that we can produce components which are directly compatible
without any fine-tuning or compromising accuracy on the original tasks.

feature extractors with different architectures, and increasing the

spin-polarized SP, versus a non-spin-polarized NSP configuration, and
identified as ferromagnetic versus a higher energy anti-ferromagnetic

that only Fe carries the magnetic moment, while carbon receives charges from Fe

configuration induces an enlarged c/a hexagonal ratio, versus NSP, while
a(hex.) remains constant thanks to the rigid C6 carbon substructure network,

competition between diagonal and non-diagonal electron-phonon contributions in

arise from the intricate way in which its components interact. Various systems
in physics, biology, social sciences and engineering have been successfully
modelled as networks of coupled dynamical systems, where the graph links
describe pairwise interactions. This is, however, too strong a limitation, as
recent studies have revealed that higher-order many-body interactions are
present in social groups, ecosystems and in the human brain, and they actually
affect the emergent dynamics of all these systems. Here, we introduce a general
framework that allows to study coupled dynamical systems accounting for the
precise microscopic structure of their interactions at any possible order. We
consider the most general ensemble of identical dynamical systems, organized on
the nodes of a simplicial complex, and interacting through
synchronization-non-invasive coupling function. The simplicial complex can be
of any dimension, meaning that it can account, at the same time, for pairwise
interactions, three-body interactions and so on. In such a broad context, we
show that complete synchronization exists as an invariant solution, and we give
the necessary condition for it to be observed as a stable state in terms of a
Master Stability Function. This generalizes the existing results valid for
pairwise interactions (i.e. graphs) to the case of complex systems with the
most general possible architecture. Moreover, we show how the approach can be
simplified for specific, yet frequently occurring, instances, and we verify all
our theoretical predictions in synthetic and real-world systems. Given the
completely general character of the method proposed, our results contribute to
the theory of dynamical systems with many-body interactions and can find
applications in an extremely wide range of practical cases.

leveraging the adaptive inference networks for deep SISR (AdaDSR). In
particular, our AdaDSR involves an SISR model as backbone and a lightweight
adapter module which takes image features and resource constraint as input and
predicts a map of local network depth. Adaptive inference can then be performed
with the support of efficient sparse convolution, where only a fraction of the
layers in the backbone is performed at a given position according to its
predicted depth. The network learning can be formulated as the joint
optimization of reconstruction and network depth losses. In the inference
stage, the average depth can be flexibly tuned to meet a range of efficiency
constraints. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our
AdaDSR in contrast to its counterparts (e.g., EDSR and RCAN).

data with distribution system operators (DSOs), a possible leakage of this data
is often disregarded in operational routines of DSOs. This paper introduces a
privacy-preserving optimal power flow (OPF) mechanism for distribution grids
that secures customer privacy from unauthorised access to OPF solutions, e.g.,
current and voltage measurements. The mechanism is based on the framework of
differential privacy that allows to control the participation risks of
individuals in a dataset by applying a carefully calibrated noise to the output
of a computation. Unlike existing private mechanisms, this mechanism does not
apply the noise to the optimization parameters or its result. Instead, it
optimizes OPF variables as affine functions of the random noise, which weakens
the correlation between the grid loads and OPF variables. To ensure feasibility
of the randomized OPF solution, the mechanism makes use of chance constraints
enforced on the grid limits. The mechanism is further extended to control the
optimality loss induced by the random noise, as well as the variance of OPF
variables. The paper shows that the differentially private OPF solution does
not leak customer loads up to specified parameters.

preservation of neighborhood relationships, (ii) handling data on a non-linear

generate rule antecedents using clusters in the input data. In this context, we
also propose a new variant of the Geodesic c-means clustering algorithm. We
estimate the rule parameters by minimizing an error function that preserves the
inter-point geodesic distances (distances over the manifold) as Euclidean
distances on the projected space. We apply the proposed method on three
synthetic and three real-world data sets and visually compare the results with
four other standard data visualization methods. The obtained results show that
the proposed method behaves desirably and performs better than or comparable to
the methods compared with. The proposed method is found to be robust to the
initial conditions. The predictability of the proposed method for test points
is validated by experiments. We also assess the ability of our method to reject
output points when it should. Then, we extend this concept to provide a general
framework for learning an unsupervised fuzzy model for data projection with
different objective functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to manifold learning using unsupervised fuzzy modeling.

The first is on word frequency and the second on sentiments of the individual
tweet messages. Inspection of the word frequency is useful in characterizing
the patterns or trends in the words used on the site. This would also reflect
on the psychology of the twitter users at this critical juncture. Unigram,
bigram and trigram frequencies have been modeled by power law distribution. The
results have been validated by Sum of Square Error (SSE), R2 and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE). High values of R2 and low values of SSE and RMSE lay the
grounds for the goodness of fit of this model. Sentiment analysis has been
conducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this
time. Both tweets by general public and WHO were part of the corpus. The
results showed that the majority of the tweets had a positive polarity and only

algorithmic framework for JISA based on the majorization-minimization (MM)
optimization technique (JISA-MM). We use a well-known inequality for
super-Gaussian sources to derive a surrogate function of the negative
log-likelihood of the observed data. The minimization of this surrogate
function leads to a variant of the hybrid exact-approximate diagonalization
problem, but where multiple demixing vectors are grouped together. In the
spirit of auxiliary function based independent vector analysis (AuxIVA), we
propose several updates that can be applied alternately to one, or jointly to
two, groups of demixing vectors.
  Recently, blind extraction of one or more sources has gained interest as a
reasonable way of exploiting larger microphone arrays to achieve better
separation. In particular, several MM algorithms have been proposed for
overdetermined IVA (OverIVA). By applying JISA-MM, we are not only able to
rederive these in a general manner, but also find several new algorithms. We
run extensive numerical experiments to evaluate their performance, and compare
it to that of full separation with AuxIVA. We find that algorithms using
pairwise updates of two sources, or of one source and the background have the
fastest convergence, and are able to separate target sources quickly and
precisely from the background. In addition, we characterize the performance of

spin-$j$ symbol correspondence ($n = 2j \in \mathbb{N}$). Given a spin-$j$
symbol correspondence, the matrix algebra induces a twisted $j$-algebra of
symbols. In the first part of this paper, we establish a more intuitive
criterion for when the Poisson algebra of smooth functions on $S^2$ emerges
asymptotically ($n \to \infty$) from the sequence of twisted $j$-algebras. This
more geometric criterion, which in many cases is equivalent to the numerical
criterion obtained in [20] for describing symbol correspondence sequences of
(anti-)Poisson type, is now given in terms of a classical (asymptotic)
localization of symbols of all projectors (quantum pure states) in a certain
family. For some important kinds of symbol correspondence sequences, such a
classical localization condition is equivalent to asymptotic emergence of the
Poisson algebra. But in general, the classical localization condition is
stronger than Poisson emergence. We thus also consider some weaker notions of
asymptotic localization of projector-symbols. In the second part of this paper,
for each sequence of symbol correspondences of (anti-)Poisson type, we define
the sequential quantization of a smooth function on $S^2$ and its asymptotic
operator acting on a ground Hilbert space. Then, after presenting some concrete
examples of these constructions, we obtain some relations between asymptotic
localization of a symbol correspondence sequence and the asymptotics of its
sequential quantization of smooth functions on $S^2$.

sub-leading exponentials, scaling as $\exp[- \sqrt{2} m L]$ and $\exp[-

the forward Compton amplitude of the pion, meaning that all details of the

considered, and found to be sub-percent-level for typical lattice calculations.

Kaluza-Klein (KK) resonances. The NNLO cross-section adds about $21\%$
correction to the next-to-leading order (NLO) results. We found that the SV
correction at the N$^3$LO order decreases the cross-section by $0.7\%$ near the

the convolution kernel of different scales is used to extract the multi-scale

of kinetic to magnetic energy in simulated sunspots on the convective motions.
We use a set of non-grey simulation runs of sunspots with the MURaM code. These
data are used to synthesise the Stokes profiles that are then degraded to the
Hinode spectropolarimeter-like observations. Then, the data are treated like
real Hinode observations of a sunspot and magnetic properties at the umbral
boundaries are determined. Simulations with potential field extrapolation
produce a realistic magnetic field configuration on their umbral boundaries.
Two simulations with potential field upper boundary, but different subsurface
magnetic field structures, differ significantly in the extent of their
penumbrae. Increasing the penumbra width by forcing more horizontal magnetic
fields at the upper boundary results in magnetic properties that are not
consistent with observations. This implies that the size of the penumbra is
given by the subsurface structure of the magnetic field. None of the sunspot
simulations is consistent with observed properties of the magnetic field and
direction of the Evershed flow at the same time. Strong outward directed
Evershed flows are only found in setups with artificially enhanced horizontal
component of the magnetic field at the top boundary that are not consistent
with the observed magnetic field properties at the UP boundary. We want to
stress out that the `photospheric' boundary of simulated sunspots is defined by
a magnetic field strength of equipartition field value.

had been previously found out from magnetization distribution probed by
polarised neutron elastic scattering but had so far remained theoretically
unexplained. The easy plane magnetic anisotropy of Nd in NdCo$_5$ is strongly
enhanced by the large value of $A_6^6\langle r^6 \rangle$. Counter-intuitively,
the polar dependence of anisotropy energy within the easy plane remains rather
small. The easy plane magnetic anisotropy of Nd is reinforced up to high

initio anisotropy constants of NdCo$_5$ and their temperature dependence are in
quantitative agreement with experiment. Unlike NdCo$_5$, the $A_6^6 \langle r^6

challenge. Many methods attempt to recovery missing labels by exploiting

discriminant information to some extent, leaving room for further performance
improvement. In this paper, we develop a simple yet effective discriminant
multi-label learning (DM2L) method for multi-label learning with missing
labels. Specifically, we impose the low-rank structures on all the predictions
of instances from the same labels (local shrinking of rank), and a maximally
separated structure (high-rank structure) on the predictions of instances from
different labels (global expanding of rank). In this way, these imposed
low-rank structures can help modeling both local and global low-rank label
structures, while the imposed high-rank structure can help providing more
underlying discriminability. Our subsequent theoretical analysis also supports
these intuitions. In addition, we provide a nonlinear extension via using
kernel trick to enhance DM2L and establish a concave-convex objective to learn
these models. Compared to the other methods, our method involves the fewest
assumptions and only one hyper-parameter. Even so, extensive experiments show

expression contains the corresponding class's logical relationship among inputs
(and$\backslash$or$\backslash$not). Experiments and main results: DD, a
white-box machine learning algorithm, showed excellent system identification
performance for the black-box system. Secondly, it was verified by nine
real-world applications that DD brought better generalization capability
relative to MLP architecture that imitated neurons' cell body (Cell body Net)
for regression. Thirdly, by MNIST and FASHION-MNIST datasets, it was verified
that DD showed higher testing accuracy under greater training loss than Cell

logical expression capacity, which avoids over-fitting and makes it easy to get
a model with outstanding generalization capability. Finally, repeated

space}$. The theories of gravity admitting scalarization are characterized by
the fact that the field equations always admit the general relativistic
solution but for certain ranges of the parameters space it loses stability and
nonlinear development of a scalar field is observed. Thus, in order to
determine the values of the parameters where such scalarization is possible we
studied the stability of the general relativistic solution within the framework
of the considered tensor-multi-scalar theories. Based on these results we could
obtain a family of scalarized branches characterized by the number of the
scalar field nodes. These branches bifurcate from the general relativistic
solution at the points where new unstable modes appear and they are
energetically more favorable over the pure Einstein solutions. Interestingly,
in certain parameter ranges, we could obtain non-uniqueness within a single
branch of scalarized solutions.

active galactic nuclei is one of the major ingredients for determining the mass
of the accreting black hole. This can be done by determining the delay between
the optical continuum and the flux reprocessed by the BLR, in particular via
the emission lines. We propose here that the delay between polarized and
unpolarized light can also be used in much the same way to constrain the size
of the BLR; we check that meaningful results can be expected from observations
using this technique. We use our code STOKES for performing polarized radiative
transfer simulations. We determine the response of the central source
environment (broad line region, dust torus, polar wind) to fluctuations of the
central source that are randomly generated; we then calculate the cross
correlation between the simulated polarized flux and the total flux to estimate
the time delay that would be provided by observations using the same method. We
find that the broad line region is the main contributor to the delay between
the polarized flux and the total flux; this delay is independent on the
observation wavelength. This validates the use of polarized radiation in the
optical/UV band to estimate the geometrical properties of the broad line region
in type I AGNs, in which the viewing angle is close to pole-on and the BLR is
not obscured by the dust torus.

Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space is a hyperbolic analogue of the
geometric median of a point cloud in Euclidean space. It was defined by Douady
and Earle as part of a construction of a conformally natural way to extend
homeomorphisms of the circle to homeomorphisms of the disk, and it plays a
central role in Millson and Kapovich's model of the configuration space of
cyclic linkages with fixed edgelengths.
  In this paper we consider the problem of computing the conformal barycenter.
Abikoff and Ye have given an iterative algorithm for measures on $\mathbb{S}^1$
which is guaranteed to converge. We analyze Riemannian versions of Newton's
method computed in the intrinsic geometry of the Poincare ball model. We give
Newton-Kantorovich (NK) conditions under which we show that Newton's method
with fixed step size is guaranteed to converge quadratically to the conformal
barycenter for measures on any $\mathbb{S}^d$ (including infinite-dimensional
spheres). For measures given by $n$ atoms on a finite dimensional sphere which
obey the NK conditions, we give an explicit linear bound on the computation
time required to approximate the conformal barycenter to fixed error. We prove
that our NK conditions hold for all but exponentially few $n$ atom measures.
For all measures with a unique conformal barycenter we show that a regularized
Newton's method with line search will always converge (eventually
superlinearly) to the conformal barycenter. Though we do not have hard time
bounds for this algorithm, experiments show that it is extremely efficient in
practice and in particular much faster than the Abikoff-Ye iteration.

This type of life has developed in a metal-rich environment and has taken
roughly 5 Gyr to do so. We investigate the possible number of CETI based on
different scenarios. At one extreme is the Weak Astrobiological Copernican
principle - such that a planet forms intelligent life sometime after 5 Gyr, but
not earlier. The other is the Strong Condition in which life must form between
4.5 to 5.5 Gyr, as on Earth. In the Strong Condition (a strict set of

our Galaxy: this is a lower limit, based on the assumption that the average
life-time, L, of a communicating civilization is 100 years (based on our own at

nearest CETI is at most 17000$_{-10000}^{+33600}$ light-years away, and most
likely hosted by a low-mass M-dwarf star, far surpassing our ability to detect
it for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the likelihood that the host stars

that relaxation of the qubit can be suppressed tenfold by tuning into the

securely computing common data of different sets. In PSI protocols, often two
parties hope to find their common set elements without needing to disclose
their uncommon ones. In recent years, the cloud has been playing an influential
role in PSI protocols which often need huge computational tasks. In 2017, Abadi
et al. introduced a scheme named EO-PSI which uses a cloud to pass on the main
computations to it and does not include any public-key operations. In EO-PSI,
parties need to set up secure channels beforehand; otherwise, an attacker can
easily eavesdrop on communications between honest parties and find private
information. This paper presents an improved EO-PSI scheme which has the edge
on the previous scheme in terms of privacy and complexity. By providing
possible attacks on the prior scheme, we show the necessity of using secure
channels between parties. Also, our proposed protocol is secure against passive
attacks without having to have any secure channels. We measure the protocol's
overhead and show that computational complexity is considerably reduced and
also is fairer compared to the previous scheme.

such cases, one must resort to advanced numerical algorithms such as particle
filters to consistently estimate the filter. It is also well known that the
particle filter can be enhanced by considering hierarchies of discretizations

computational effort to achieve a given mean square error (MSE). A variety of
multilevel particle filters (MLPF) have been suggested in the literature, e.g.,

is a reduction, relative to the approach in the aforementioned paper by Jasra

and provide analytical fits for the Halpha luminosity and equivalent width. Our
set of models covers a range of masses for 56Ni and the ejecta, for the

brightness contrast between stripped material and metal-rich ejecta challenges
the detection of HI and HeI lines prior to ~100d. Intrinsic and extrinsic
optical depth effects also influence the radiation emanating from the stripped
material. This inner denser region is marginally thick in the continuum and
optically thick in all Balmer lines. The overlying metal-rich ejecta blanket
the inner regions, completely below about 5000A, and more sparsely at longer
wavelengths. As a consequence, Hbeta should not be observed for all values of
Mst through at least 300 days, while Halpha should be observed after ~100d for
all Mst >= 0.01Msun. This contrasts with the case of circumstellar (CSM)
interaction, not subject to external blanketing, which should produce Halpha
and Hbeta lines with a strength dependent primarily on CSM density. We confirm
previous analyses that suggest low values of order 0.001Msun for Mst to explain
the observations of the two SNe Ia with nebular-phase Halpha detection, in
conflict with the much greater stripped mass predicted by hydrodynamical
simulations for the single-degenerate scenario. A more likely solution is the

parametric function that represents the spectral form of the synthetic bursts
provided by our internal shock synchrotron model (ISSM). We simulated the
response of the Fermi instruments to the synthetic bursts and fitted the
obtained count spectra to validate the ISSM function. Then, we applied this
function to a sample of 74 bright GRBs detected by the Fermi/GBM, and we
computed the width of their spectral energy distributions around their peak
energy. For comparison, we fitted also the phenomenological functions that are
commonly used in the literature. Finally, we performed a time-resolved analysis
of the broadband spectrum of GRB 090926A, which was jointly detected by the
Fermi GBM and LAT. The ISSM function reproduces 81% of the spectra in the GBM
bright GRB sample, versus 59% for the Band function, for the same number of
parameters. It gives also relatively good fits to the GRB 090926A spectra. The
width of the MeV spectral component that is obtained from the fits of the ISSM
function is slightly larger than the width from the Band fits, but it is
smaller when observed over a wider energy range. Moreover, all of the 74
analysed spectra are found to be significantly wider than the synthetic
synchrotron spectra. We discuss possible solutions to reconcile the
observations with the internal shock synchrotron model, such as an improved
modeling of the shock micro-physics or more accurate spectral measurements at
MeV energies.

that the accretion was accompanied by the ejection of two jets that shaped the
bipolar Homunculus nebula. Observations of echos from the GE found emission
lines with broad wings suggesting some of the mass in equatorial directions
reached more than $10\,000 \,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$. We run hydrodynamic simulations
following periastron passage during the GE, launching jets from the secondary

the polar jets with the surrounding primary wind, as they accelerate part of
the flow to velocities $ > 10\,000 \,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and deflect it towards
lower latitudes. We find that the amount of mass that reached these high

reaches maximum and then decreases with time. Our simulations agree with

building blocks of GCN. The framework offers flexibility to compose and
evaluate different networks using feature and/or label propagation networks,
linear or non-linear networks, with each composition having different
computational complexity. We conduct a detailed experimental study on several
benchmark datasets with many variants and present observations from our
evaluation. Our empirical experimental results suggest that several newly
composed variants are useful alternatives to consider because they are as
competitive as, or better than the original GCN.

bounds the maximal amounts of corresponding operational entanglement in an

in many-body systems. Furthermore, the converted multipartite entanglement can
be transferred to its subsystems and restored to coherence of a single party by
means of local incoherent operations and classical communication, which
constitutes a protocol of resource interconversion within the full incoherent
operation scenario. As an example, we present a scheme for cyclic

for the Helmholtz equation with variable coefficients (modelling wave

problem. This problem is discretised using $H^1$-conforming nodal finite
elements of fixed local degree $p$ on meshes with diameter $h = h(k)$, chosen
so that the error remains bounded with increasing $k$. The action of the
one-level preconditioner consists of the parallel solution of problems on
subdomains (which can be of general geometry), each equipped with an impedance
boundary condition. We prove rigorous estimates on the norm and field of values
of the left- or right-preconditioned matrix that show explicitly how the
absorption, the heterogeneity in the coefficients and the dependence on the
degree enter the estimates. These estimates prove rigorously that, with enough
absorption and for $k$ large enough, GMRES is guaranteed to converge in a
number of iterations that is independent of $k,p,$ and the coefficients. The
theoretical threshold for $k$ to be large enough depends on $p$ and on the
local variation of coefficients in subdomains (and not globally). Extensive
numerical experiments are given for both the absorptive and the propagative

large-scale distributed storage systems. Erasure codes are widely deployed in
practical storage systems to provide fault tolerance with low storage overhead.
However, random data distribution (RDD), commonly used in erasure-coded storage
systems, induces heavy cross-rack traffic, load imbalance, and random access,
which adversely affects failure recovery. In this paper, with orthogonal
arrays, we define a Deterministic Data Distribution ($D^3$) to uniformly
distribute data/parity blocks among nodes, and propose an efficient failure
recovery approach based on $D^3$, which minimizes the cross-rack repair traffic
against a single node failure. Thanks to the uniformity of $D^3$, the proposed
recovery approach balances the repair traffic not only among nodes within a
rack but also among racks. We implement $D^3$ over Reed-Solomon codes and
Locally Repairable Codes in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) with a
cluster of 28 machines. Compared with RDD, our experiments show that $D^3$
significantly speeds up the failure recovery up to 2.49 times for RS codes and
1.38 times for LRCs. Moreover, $D^3$ supports front-end applications better
than RDD in both of normal and recovery states.

maximize the earned benefit by initially activating a set of nodes within the

\textit{Independent Cascade Model} of diffusion. We propose an incremental

corresponding to the target nodes. Finally, we perform a series of extensive
experiments with four real\mbox{-}life, publicly available social network

Particularly, the hop\mbox{-}based approach is found to be more efficient than

understanding of DTC and shed more light on the physics behind the DTC.
Besides, by the detailed analysis of simplest two-sites model, we show further

$H_{\textrm{NJL}} = \bar\psi (-i \gamma^k \partial_k + m_0) \psi - G [

the non-Hermitian, PT- and chiral-symmetric bilinear term $ig\bar\psi \gamma_5
B_{\mu} \gamma^{\mu} \psi$; in 1+1 dimensions, where $H_{\textrm{NJL}}$ is a
form of the Gross-Neveu model, it is extended by the non-Hermitian PT-symmetric
but chiral symmetry breaking term $g \bar\psi \gamma_5 \psi$. In each case, the
gap equation is derived and the effects of the non-Hermitian terms on the
generated mass are studied. We have several findings: in previous calculations
for the free Dirac equation modified to include non-Hermitian bilinear terms,
contrary to expectation, no real mass spectrum can be obtained in the chiral
limit; in these cases a nonzero bare fermion mass is essential for the
realization of PT symmetry in the unbroken regime. Here, in the NJL model, in
which four-point interactions are present, we {\it do} find real values for the
mass spectrum also in the limit of vanishing bare masses in both 3+1 and 1+1
dimensions, at least for certain specific values of the non-Hermitian couplings
$g$. Thus, the four-point interaction overrides the effects leading to PT
symmetry-breaking for these parameter values. Further, we find that in both
cases, in 3+1 and in 1+1 dimensions, the inclusion of a non-Hermitian bilinear
term can contribute to the generated mass. In both models, this contribution
can be tuned to be small; we thus fix the fermion mass to its value when
$m_0=0$ in the absence of the non-Hermitian term, and then determine the value
of the coupling required so as to generate a bare fermion mass.

very extreme-mass-ratio inspirals composed by brown dwarfs and the supermassive

there are plunge events during the formation of inspiraling orbits. In this

estimated as $\sim$ $0.01 {\rm{yr}^{-1}}$ for the Galaxy. If we are lucky, this
kind of very extreme-mass-ratio bursts will offer a unique chance to reveal the
nearest supermassive black hole and nuclei dynamics. The event rate can be as
large as 4 $\sim$ 8 ${\rm yr^{-1}}$ in 10 Mpc, and because the signal is strong
enough for observations by space-borne detectors, we have a good chance of
being able to probe the nature of neighboring black holes.

the large BERT model to a fixed smaller size. They can not fully satisfy the

this paper, we propose a novel dynamic BERT model (abbreviated as DynaBERT),

width-adaptive BERT and then allowing both adaptive width and depth, by
distilling knowledge from the full-sized model to small sub-networks. Network
rewiring is also used to keep the more important attention heads and neurons
shared by more sub-networks. Comprehensive experiments under various efficiency
constraints demonstrate that our proposed dynamic BERT (or RoBERTa) at its
largest size has comparable performance as BERT-base (or RoBERTa-base), while
at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression

recordings. To address this problem, we investigate singing voice detection

two steps: i. The singing voice separation (SVS) technique is first utilized to
filter out the singing voice's potential part coarsely. ii. Upon the continuity
of vocal in the time domain, Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCN)
is used to learn compositional features. Moreover, to eliminate the outliers,
we choose to use a median filter for time-domain smoothing. Experimental

electricity distribution networks (DNs) against storm-induced failures.
Microgrids enabled by Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) can significantly
help speed up re-energization of loads, particularly in the complete absence of
bulk power supply. We describe an integrated approach which considers a
pre-storm DER allocation problem under the uncertainty of failure scenarios as
well as a post-storm dispatch problem in microgrids during the multi-period
repair of the failed components. This problem is computationally challenging
because the number of scenarios (resp. binary variables) increases
exponentially (resp. quadratically) in the network size. Our overall solution
approach for solving the resulting two-stage mixed-integer linear program
(MILP) involves implementing the sample average approximation (SAA) method and
Benders Decomposition. Additionally, we implement a greedy approach to reduce
the computational time requirements of the post-storm repair scheduling and
dispatch problem. The optimality of the resulting solution is evaluated on a
modified IEEE 36-node network.

convergence of the Steklov eigenvalues of a sequence of domains in a Riemannian
manifold to weighted Laplace eigenvalues of that manifold. The domains are
obtained by removing small geodesic balls that are asymptotically densely
uniformly distributed as their radius tends to zero. We use this relationship
to construct manifolds that have large Steklov eigenvalues.
  In dimension two, and with constant weight equal to 1, we prove that
Kokarev's upper bound of $8\pi$ for the first nonzero normalised Steklov
eigenvalue on orientable surfaces of genus 0 is saturated. For other
topological types and eigenvalue indices, we also obtain lower bounds on the
best upper bound for the eigenvalue in terms of Laplace maximisers. For the
first two eigenvalues, these lower bounds become equalities. A surprising
consequence is the existence of free boundary minimal surfaces immersed in the
unit ball by first Steklov eigenfunctions and with area strictly larger than
$2\pi$. This was previously thought to be impossible. We provide numerical
evidence that some of the already known examples of free boundary minimal
surfaces have these properties and also exhibit simulations of new free
boundary minimal surfaces of genus 0 in the unit ball with even larger area.
The first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of all these examples is equal to 1, as a
consequence of their symmetries and topology, so that they verify a general
conjecture by Fraser and Li.
  In dimension three and larger, we prove that the isoperimetric inequality of
Colbois--El Soufi--Girouard is sharp and implies an upper bound for weighted
Laplace eigenvalues. We also show that in any manifold with a fixed metric, one
can construct by varying the weight a domain with connected boundary whose
first nonzero normalised Steklov eigenvalue is arbitrarily large.

have enacted social distancing measures in an attempt to limit the spread of
the virus. Under these conditions, the Web has become an indispensable medium
for information acquisition, communication, and entertainment. At the same

potentially harmful and disturbing content, such as the spread of conspiracy

towards Chinese people since COVID-19 is believed to have originated from
China. In this paper, we make a first attempt to study the emergence of
Sinophobic behavior on the Web during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We
collect two large-scale datasets from Twitter and 4chan's Politically Incorrect
board (/pol/) over a time period of approximately five months and analyze them
to investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with regard to
the dissemination of Sinophobic content. We find that COVID-19 indeed drives
the rise of Sinophobia on the Web and that the dissemination of Sinophobic
content is a cross-platform phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities
like \dspol, and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Also,
using word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution and emergence of
new Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting
differences in the context in which words related to Chinese people are used on
the Web before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift
towards blaming China for the situation, while on /pol/ we find a shift towards
using more (and new) Sinophobic slurs.

temperature in a magnetic field with constant curvature (a $Z$-pinch) and an
equilibrium temperature gradient. Numerical simulations reveal a well-defined
transition between a finite-amplitude saturated state dominated by strong
zonal-flow and zonal-temperature perturbations, and a blow-up state that fails
to saturate on a box-independent scale. We argue that this transition is
equivalent to the Dimits transition from a low-transport to a high-transport
state seen in gyrokinetic numerical simulations. A quasi-static staircase-like
structure of the temperature gradient intertwined with zonal flows, which have
patch-wise constant shear, emerges near the Dimits threshold. The turbulent
heat flux in the low-collisionality near-marginal state is dominated by
turbulent bursts, triggered by coherent long-lived structures closely
resembling those found in gyrokinetic simulations with imposed equilibrium flow
shear. The break up of the low-transport Dimits regime is linked to a
competition between the two different sources of poloidal momentum in the
system -- the Reynolds stress and the advection of the diamagnetic flow by the
$\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ flow. By analysing the linear ITG modes,
we obtain a semi-analytic model for the Dimits threshold at large
collisionality.

distribution between the large-scale balanced flow and the small-scale
imbalanced flow. Weakly nonlinear IGWs emitted from baroclinic jets are
observed in the differentially heated rotating annulus experiment. Similar to
the atmospheric spectra, the experimental kinetic energy spectra reveal the
typical subdivision into two distinct regimes with slopes $k^{-3}$ for the
large scales and $k^{-5/3}$ for the small scales. By separating the spectra
into the vortex and the wave component, it emerges that at the large-scale end
of the mesoscale the gravity waves observed in the experiment cause a
flattening of the spectra and provide most of the energy. At smaller scales,
our data analysis suggests a transition towards a turbulent regime with a
forward energy cascade up to where dissipation by diffusive processes occurs.

Observations of strong Balmer line asymmetries during flare events have been
interpreted as being caused by CMEs. Here, we aim to estimate the maximum
possible Balmer line fluxes expected from CMEs to infer their detectability in
spectroscopic observations. Moreover, we use these results together with a
model of intrinsic CME rates to infer the potentially observable CME rates for
stars of different spectral types under various observing conditions, as well
as the minimum required observing time to detect stellar CMEs in Balmer lines.
We find that generally CME detection is favoured for mid- to late-type M
dwarfs, as they require the lowest signal-to-noise ratio for CME detection, and
the fraction of observable-to-intrinsic CMEs is largest. They may require,
however, longer observing times than stars of earlier spectral types at the
same activity level, as their predicted intrinsic CME rates are lower. CME
detections are generally favoured for stars close to the saturation regime,
because they are expected to have the highest intrinsic rates; the predicted
minimum observing time to detect CMEs on just moderately active stars is
already >100 h. By comparison with spectroscopic data sets including detections
as well as non-detections of CMEs, we find that our modelled maximum observable
CME rates are generally consistent with these observations on adopting
parameters within the ranges determined by observations of solar and stellar
prominences.

nanomotors through self-assembly remains challenging. Here we describe a
self-assembled colloidal motor with a repetitive light-driven rotation of
transparent micro-particles immersed in a liquid crystal and powered by a
continuous exposure to unstructured ~1 nW light. A monolayer of azobenzene
molecules defines how the liquid crystal's optical axis mechanically couples to
the particle's surface, as well as how they jointly rotate as the light's
polarization changes. The rotating particle twists the liquid crystal, which
changes polarization of traversing light. The resulting feedback mechanism
yields a continuous opto-mechanical cycle and drives the unidirectional
particle spinning, with handedness and frequency robustly controlled by
polarization and intensity of light. Our findings may lead to opto-mechanical
devices and colloidal machines compatible with liquid crystal display
technology.

the role/behavior of these modifications with regard to some low redshift
tensions, including the so-called $H_0$ tension, prevailing within the standard

obtain the first constraints through a robust and accurate analysis using the
latest full Planck CMB data, with and without including BAO data. We find that
the Rastall parameter $\epsilon$ (null for general relativity) is consistent
with zero at 68\% CL (with a tendency towards positive values, $-0.0001 <
\epsilon < 0.0007$ (CMB+BAO) at 68\% CL), which in turn implies no significant
statistical evidence for deviation from general relativity, and also a
precision of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ for the coefficient $-1/2$ of the term
$g_{\mu\nu}R$ in the Einstein field equations of general relativity
(guaranteeing the local energy-momentum conservation). We explore the
consequences led by the Rastall gravity on the cosmological parameters in the
light of the observational analyses. It turns out that the effective source
dynamically screens the usual vacuum energy at high redshifts, but this
mechanism barely works due to the opposition by the altered evolution of CDM.
Consequently, two simultaneous modifications of different nature in the
Friedmann equation act against each other, and do not help to considerably
relax the so-called low redshift tensions. Our results may offer a guide for
the research community that studies the Rastall gravity in various aspects of
gravitation and cosmology.

This approach is robust because it only depends on parameters that describe the

(or change-point), at which two linear segments join together, to be an
additional growth factor other than the intercept and slopes so that
researchers can estimate the knot and its variability in the framework of
individual measurement occasions. However, developmental processes usually
unfold in a joint development where two or more outcomes and their change
patterns are correlated over time. As an extension of the existing BLSGM with
an unknown knot, this study considers a parallel BLSGM (PBLSGM) for
investigating multiple nonlinear growth processes and estimating the knot with
its variability of each process as well as the knot-knot association in the
framework of individual measurement occasions. We present the proposed model by

demonstrate that the proposed PBLSGM generally estimate the parameters of

intensity ratios of these lines (1394{\AA}/1403{\AA}), which under optically
thin condition is predicted to be two, helps us to diagnose the optical
thickness of the plasma being observed. Here we study the evolution of the
distribution of intensity ratios in 31 IRIS rasters recorded for four days
during the emergence of an active region. We found that during the early phase
of the development, the majority of the pixels show intensity ratios smaller
than two. However, as the active region evolves, more and more pixels show the
ratios closer to two. Besides, there are a substantial number of pixels with
ratio values larger than 2. At the evolved stage of the active region, the
pixels with ratios smaller than two were located on the periphery, whereas
those with values larger than 2 were in the core. However, for quiet Sun
regions, the obtained intensity ratios were close to two irrespective of the
location on the disk. Our findings suggest that the \ion{Si}{4} lines observed
in active regions are affected by the opacity during the early phase of the
flux emergence. The results obtained here could have important implications for
the modelling of the solar atmosphere, including the initial stage of the
emergence of an active region as well as quiet Sun.

a novel end-to-end framework for accurate reconstruction of animation-ready 3D
clothed humans from a monocular image. Existing approaches to digitize 3D
humans struggle to handle pose variations and recover details. Also, they do
not produce models that are animation ready. In contrast, ARCH is a learned
pose-aware model that produces detailed 3D rigged full-body human avatars from
a single unconstrained RGB image. A Semantic Space and a Semantic Deformation
Field are created using a parametric 3D body estimator. They allow the
transformation of 2D/3D clothed humans into a canonical space, reducing
ambiguities in geometry caused by pose variations and occlusions in training
data. Detailed surface geometry and appearance are learned using an implicit
function representation with spatial local features. Furthermore, we propose
additional per-pixel supervision on the 3D reconstruction using opacity-aware
differentiable rendering. Our experiments indicate that ARCH increases the
fidelity of the reconstructed humans. We obtain more than 50% lower
reconstruction errors for standard metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods
on public datasets. We also show numerous qualitative examples of animated,
high-quality reconstructed avatars unseen in the literature so far.

constrain the possible presence of an FRB-emitting source. Although such
searches are high-risk, any such detection could greatly elucidate the origins

way of the metamodel-based approach (i.e., a mathematical model which is
fittedon a small-size sample of simulations). To achieve it with a very large
numberof inputs, a specific and original methodology, called ICSCREAM
(Identificationof penalizing Configurations using SCREening And Metamodel), is
proposed. Thescreening of influential inputs is based on an advanced global
sensitivity analysistool (HSIC importance measures). A Gaussian process
metamodel is then sequentiallybuilt and used to estimate, within a Bayesian

90%-quantile of PCT. In both cases, the ICSCREAMmethodology allows to estimate,
by using only around one thousand of code simulations,the impact of the

be beneficial for both patients and clinicians. However, multiple acceptance
barriers such as lack of PGHD reliability prevents a routine usage of this
data. A clinical decision support system, called FullFlow, has been developed
to address these acceptance barriers. The objective of this study was to
determine if FullFlow was useful during consultations and to verify the
hypothesis that the higher PGHD reliability, the more effective the system is.
The assessment relied on a medical pilot during which clinicians and patients
with diabetes used the FullFlow during medical consultations. The data
collection relied on a post-consultation questionnaire in addition to system
logs. This study showed that the PGHD reliability was low for an overwhelming
majority of consultations. The information displayed was useful in half of the
consultations according to the clinicians who answered the questionnaire.
Despite this, the overwhelming majority of clinicians who answered the
questionnaire found that the designed FullFlow system permitted to gain
insights of the situation of the patients. The study showed the higher the PGHD
reliability is, the more useful the system is for clinicians. PGHD usage in
clinical settings can permit clinicians to gain valuable information regarding
the situations of their patients. A clinical decision system can present useful
information to clinicians. While the PGHD reliability is correlated to the
usefulness of such system, it is not the only factor impacting it: context of
the clinicians and patients such as novelty of usage and personal goals also
plays a role in determining on how such system is useful for clinicians.
However, due to a limited number of participants, a new medical pilot must be
performed in order to confirm the results of this study.

efficiency of mesh deformation. By incorporating the multigrid concept that the
computational errors on the fine mesh can be approximated with those on the
coarse mesh, this algorithm stochastically divides all boundary nodes into $m$
groups and uses the locally maximum radial basis functions (RBF) interpolation
error of each group as an approximation to the globally maximum one of all
boundary nodes in each iterative procedure for reducing the RBF support nodes.
For this reason, it avoids the interpolation conducted at all boundary nodes
and thus reduces the corresponding computational complexity from
$O\left({N_c^2{N_b}} \right)$ to $O\left( {N_c^3} \right)$. Besides, after $m$
iterations, the interpolation errors of all boundary nodes are computed once,
thus allowing all boundary nodes can contribute to error control. Two canonical
deformation problems of the ONERA M6 wing and the DLR-F6
Wing-Body-Nacelle-Pylon configuration are computed to validate the GCB greedy
algorithm. The computational results show that the GCB greedy algorithm is able
to remarkably promote the efficiency of computing the interpolation errors in
the data reducing procedure by dozens of times. Because an increase of $m$
results in an increase of $N_c$, an appropriate range of $\left[
{{N_b}/{N_c},{\rm{ }}2{N_b}/{N_c}}\right]$ for $m$ is suggested to prevent too
much additional computations for solving the linear algebraic system and
computing the displacements of volume nodes induced by the increase of $N_c $.
The results also show that the GCB greedy algorithm tends to generate a more
significant efficiency improvement for mesh deformation when a larger-scale
mesh is applied.

$\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\frac{m_p}{m_e}$ are attributed
a particular importance from the point of view of nuclear synthesis, formation
of heavy elements, planets, and life-supporting structures. Here, we show that
a combination of these two constants results in a new dimensionless constant
which provides the upper bound for the speed of sound in condensed phases,
$v_u$. We find that
$\frac{v_u}{c}=\alpha\left(\frac{m_e}{2m_p}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, where $c$ is
the speed of light in vacuum. We support this result by a large set of
experimental data and first principles computations for atomic hydrogen. Our
result expands current understanding of how fundamental constants can impose
new bounds on important physical properties.

Neumann studies bombs comprising a primary explosive charge along with
explosive booster material. His goal is to calculate the minimal amount of
booster needed to create a sustainable detonation, presumably because booster
material is often more expensive and more volatile. In service of this goal, he
formulates and analyzes a partial differential equation based model describing
a moving shock wave at the interface of detonated and undetonated material. We
provide a complete transcription of von Neumann's work and give our own
accompanying explanations and analyses, including the correction of two small
errors in his calculations. Today, detonations are typically modeled using a
combination of experimental results and numerical simulations particular to the
shape and materials of the explosive, as the complex three dimensional dynamics
of detonations are analytically intractable. Although von Neumann's manuscript

infection with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper, we propose a
sampling design for building a continuous-time surveillance system. Compared
with other observational strategies, the proposed method has three important
elements of strength and originality: (i) it aims to provide a snapshot of the
phenomenon at a single moment in time, and it is designed to be a continuous
survey that is repeated in several waves over time, taking different target
variables during different stages of the development of the epidemic into
account; (ii) the statistical optimality properties of the proposed estimators
are formally derived and tested with a Monte Carlo experiment; and (iii) it is
rapidly operational as this property is required by the emergency connected
with the diffusion of the virus. The sampling design is thought to be designed
with the diffusion of SAR-CoV-2 in Italy during the spring of 2020 in mind.
However, it is very general, and we are confident that it can be easily
extended to other geographical areas and to possible future epidemic outbreaks.
Formal proofs and a Monte Carlo exercise highlight that the estimators are
unbiased and have higher efficiency than the simple random sampling scheme.

so-called ''Layer-2'' transaction protocols, where payments are routed across
networks of private payment channels. However, for a given transaction, not
every network state provides a feasible route to perform the payment; in this
case, the transaction must be put on the public ledger. The payment channel
network thus multiplies the transaction rate of the overall system; the less
frequently it fails, the higher the multiplier.
  We build on earlier work on credit networks and show that this network
liquidity problem is connected to the combinatorics of graphical matroids.
Earlier work could only analyze the (unnatural) scenario where transactions had
discrete sizes.
  Superficially, it might seem like the continuous case would be harder to
examine. However, removing this assumption lets us make progress in two
important directions. First, we give a partial answer to the ``monotonicity
conjecture'' that previous work left open. This conjecture asks that the
network's performance not degrade as capacity on any edge increases. And
second, we construct here a network state sampling procedure with much faster
asymptotic performance than off-the-shelf Markov chains ($O(\vert E\vert
\beta(\vert E\vert))$, where $\beta(x)$ is the complexity of solving a linear
program on $x$ constraints.)
  We obtain our results by mapping the underlying graphs to convex bodies and
then showing that the liquidity and sampling problems reduce to bounding and
computing the volumes of these bodies. The transformation relies crucially on
the combinatorial properties of the underlying graphic matroid, as do the
proofs of monotonicity and fast sampling.

  for Predictive Maintenance in Computing Centers","8 pages, 8 figures, IEEE Conference on Evolving and Adaptive
  Intelligent Systems (EAIS 2020)",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Log-based predictive maintenance of computing centers is a main concern
regarding the worldwide computing grid that supports the CERN (European
Organization for Nuclear Research) physics experiments. A log, as
event-oriented adhoc information, is quite often given as unstructured big
data. Log data processing is a time-consuming computational task. The goal is
to grab essential information from a continuously changeable grid environment
to construct a classification model. Evolving granular classifiers are suited
to learn from time-varying log streams and, therefore, perform online
classification of the severity of anomalies. We formulated a 4-class online
anomaly classification problem, and employed time windows between landmarks and
two granular computing methods, namely, Fuzzy-set-Based evolving Modeling
(FBeM) and evolving Granular Neural Network (eGNN), to model and monitor
logging activity rate. The results of classification are of utmost importance
for predictive maintenance because priority can be given to specific time
intervals in which the classifier indicates the existence of high or medium
severity anomalies.

  Optimization for Solving Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem","PPSN2020 Submission",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) is a real-world model of the
simplistic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) that considers how to satisfy multiple
customer demands from numerous depots. This paper introduces a hybrid 2-stage
approach based on two population-based algorithms - Ant Colony Optimization
(ACO) that mimics ant behaviour in nature and the Imperialist Competitive
Algorithm (ICA) that is based on geopolitical relationships between countries.
In the proposed hybrid algorithm, ICA is responsible for customer assignment to
the depots while ACO is routing and sequencing the customers. The algorithm is
compared to non-hybrid ACO and ICA as well as four other state-of-the-art
methods across 23 common Cordreaus benchmark instances. Results show clear
improvement over simple ACO and ICA and demonstrate very competitive results
when compared to other rival algorithms.

highly benefits from backscatter data reflected from PEC hidden objects,
considering the edge diffractions of the object as a key point. First, based on
physical optic principles, we investigate the cross-polarized reflections of
PEC objects in order to show the superiority of reflections of the edges to
other parts of the object. Next, we represent the results of a near filed
simulation using Feko to study the differences between cross and co-polarized
reflections of a PEC object and the human body beneath it. To a further
illustration, our experimental results are presented in which we utilized a THz
imaging system consisting of a semiconductor-based THz camera and a horn
antenna operating at 100 GHz as the source. Cross-polarized backscatter data is
analyzed to distinguish PEC objects from the human body. Besides, we used two
orthogonal linear polarizations of the source to maximize backscattering from
orthogonal edges. Experimental results show a noticeable improvement in edge
detection of hidden objects indicating that this method can result in high
accuracy in THz real-time imaging.

  reinforcement learning","124 pages, PhD thesis, IIS, Bangalore (2020)",,,,"cs.LG math.DS math.PR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present for the first time an asymptotic convergence analysis of two
time-scale stochastic approximation driven by ""controlled"" Markov noise. In
particular, the faster and slower recursions have non-additive controlled
Markov noise components in addition to martingale difference noise. We analyze
the asymptotic behavior of our framework by relating it to limiting
differential inclusions in both time scales that are defined in terms of the
ergodic occupation measures associated with the controlled Markov processes.
Using a special case of our results, we present a solution to the off-policy
convergence problem for temporal-difference learning with linear function
approximation. We compile several aspects of the dynamics of stochastic
approximation algorithms with Markov iterate-dependent noise when the iterates
are not known to be stable beforehand. We achieve the same by extending the
lock-in probability (i.e. the probability of convergence to a specific
attractor of the limiting o.d.e. given that the iterates are in its domain of
attraction after a sufficiently large number of iterations (say) n_0) framework
to such recursions. We use these results to prove almost sure convergence of
the iterates to the specified attractor when the iterates satisfy an
""asymptotic tightness"" condition. This, in turn, is shown to be useful in
analyzing the tracking ability of general ""adaptive"" algorithms. Finally, we
obtain the first informative error bounds on function approximation for the
policy evaluation algorithm proposed by Basu et al. when the aim is to find the
risk-sensitive cost represented using exponential utility. We show that this
happens due to the absence of difference term in the earlier bound which is
always present in all our bounds when the state space is large.
